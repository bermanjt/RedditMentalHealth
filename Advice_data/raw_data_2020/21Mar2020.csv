0,"I got fired today from my job as a marketing and design manager of 2 years. 

I worked for an event agency in NYC &amp; the coronavirus has caused my former company to lose ALL its clients because no one obviously wants to (or should) throw these types of events right now. They cant continue paying me because they literally just dont have the money. I understand why this is happening from their end but it suck so much to be fired after working so hard to create and run the department I was part of.

I just signed a new lease in a huge city and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I've never been fired before. I feel lost. I have some money saved but it's about enough to get me through the next 3 months. I feel so unbelievably sad and confused.I sound so pathetic right now but I'm so scared I dont even care how this comes off. 

Any advice would be helpful as I'm not thinking clearly right now.. how to stay positive, good books, info on applying of unemployment, are places even hiring right now? 

Thanks for reading.",21Mar2020,1
1,"My boyfriend of 5 months just dumped me coz he said he fell out of love. (I'm in year 10)
We were doing good up untill Monday and it broke my heart coz I love him so much.
He wants to remain friend's and I'm fine with that as long as he's happy but I don't know what to do or how to feel coz it came out of nowhere and I still love him to death. 
Anyone have any advice or ways of dealing and getting over with this.",21Mar2020,1
2,"So, I'm not looking for judgment. I just need advice, especially after what happened today. 

To start off, my BF is an army brat. His dad served since he was 18 and retired about 5 years ago. I moved in with my BF 3 years ago and we live with his parents because money is tight for us right now. We bought our own groceries and tried to contribute some money towards the household bills (water, electricity and all that). We pay our own car insurance and hardly ask for money, only asking when the paychecks were less than we planned on or somethinf came up and we didnt have gas money.

Recently, my BFS parents talked him into quitting his job to try for a better one, even though he and I talked and agreed that he should wait to see if I got a job there or not (long story for another time). It didnt work out, so now we are both out of a job and with the recent problem, jobs are laying off their workers instead of hiring new ones, so getting a job is tough.

But what happened today is making me worry. My BF went to go pick up a friend because we were going to play D&amp;D. He got home and his dad told him to wash his hands. My BF did, but changed the water to warm from cold. His dad asked him why and my BF said that warm water isnt as effective at removing germs, but it does get rid of some oils that harbor germs (he worked in a kitchen for a while). His dad, taking offense, began arguing. My BF finished washing his hands and came to our bedroom, where he sat to a few minutes, the normal amount of time it takes his dad to cool off (he tends to argue a lot and gets mad easily). After a bit, my BF went to the basmebt to set things up for our D&amp;D game, but his dad followed him and kept yelling at him. It escalated to him getting in my BFA face and yelling. I should take this time to mention that this has happened in the past to the point that my BFs dad got violent, but it was when he was an alcoholic. It still left an impact on my BF, so when his dad got in his face, he felt threatend and tried to push him back out of his face. Thats when his dad grabbed him and tried to pin him on the ground, saying that he felt threatend. I managed to seperate them and spent the next hour and a half consoling my BF and trying to calm him down. His dad called his mom and spun a tale that BF tried to hit him and was swining at him (All untrue. I was right there and saw what happened). His mom call BF and starts berating him, telling him how ungreatful he is and that he should apologize and how hes lucky they dont call the cops, never once letting BF tell him what actually happened. BF is sleeping now, but I told him we should leave before he fell asleep. My parents have already made it very clear we are welcome to move in with them back when we were threatened to be kicked out if we didnt get a job. BF didnt want to make any rash decisions (his words) and wanted to think on it. Im worried he may say we need to stay here and I dont know what to do. Advice?",21Mar2020,1
3,"

so basically my ""friend kaylee"" is a whore. i have to be completely and totally honest. her best friend ""bella's"" ex boyfriend cheated on bella with kaylee. bella is awesome and I love her. Bella DIDN'T deserve that to happen to her. its one thing for your boyfriend to cheat on you but it's a completely nother thing for him to cheat on you with your best freind. its fucked up. recently bella leaked kaylee's nudes. do i think bella should've done that? no fuck no. but do i feel bad for kaylee? NO!


   kaylee texted me last night saying that she feels ashamed and she wants me to help her with this nude shit and put bella in her place. i said kaylee i aint gonna say you deserved to get your nudes leaked but i dont feel fucking bad for you AT ALL. you shouldn't have done that to bella nor should bella have leaked your nudes. but you had this shit coming to you.


   then kaylee just said that she was pressing charges on bella and shes gonna ""beat bellas ass"". then i said kaylee im done being your friend. if you would do that with bellas boyfriend NO TELLING what you'd do with the guy im talking to. your DRAMA is not my problem! leave me the fuck out of this and figure this shit out yourself. Am I mean for saying this? what should i do? (bella and kaylee aren't their real names i just want to them to have their privacy)",21Mar2020,1

5,"I work as a play behavioral therapist for children with autism, but my company is still having us conducting in-home sessions during the covid-19 pandemic. I work in close contact with kids for the duration of our sessions, so social distancing/telecommuting isn’t really an option. I’m having a hard time weighing the pros and cons of the situation so I wanted some objective input.

Unpaid leave is being offered to all technicians through April 17th. I’m personally concerned about the potential for spread, but I’m also concerned about my kids’ teams because so many other techs are taking leave. They also can’t guarantee that I would be able to return to the teams I’m on now, so I may come back from leave and have to work with different kiddos. 

Honestly, the financial repercussions of taking leave would be minimal to me; I’m pretty sure I could receive some unemployment benefits through the state government during my potential leave. However, the families I’m working with have expressed their desperation to have me stay since most of the other techs have already taken leave. I don’t want to leave everyone hanging and facilitate potential regression, but I also don’t want to potentially contribute to community spread.

What are your thoughts?",21Mar2020,1
7,"Alright I’m sorry this is so long but I really need some help cause I’m really scared and Idk what’s happening

Alright so, idk where to start with this or even how but today was the last day of school cause of the coronavirus and our GCSE’s have been cancelled. I tried not to think about it all cause I already had enough to deal with so I just laughed at the situation. It didn’t hit me that today was probably the last day I’m ever gonna see the people I’ve been friend with for the past 5 years. All the relationships I’ve built, work I’ve done is gone in a matter of 2 days. Idk what I’m meant to do now though cause my grades are gonna be from teachers and I don’t think they’re gonna be that good so I’m not sure where to go with my life.

But now the big thing. I went round a Friend’s house (we’ll call her V) with 2 other friends to meet up like we usually do one last time before we most likely go into quarantine. V was pretty sad already cause she was getting really worked up about her grades.

When I got to her house (late), I went to the toilet just to splash my face with water, and this is where the laughing began. In a private room, nobody could hear me, I was just laughing at myself in the mirror. 

Ok so she didn’t seem to bad until she went upstairs for like 20 minutes which she then told us later was because she was getting sad again. 

In between this and the next part, I overheard L and the other friend (I(who was also in my ‘prayers’ (you’ll see in a bit))) talking about this account. If you look at it you’ll see there’s some pretty private shit and I’ve tried my beat to hide it from people cause I don’t want them knowing or worrying about it, but a fair few of my friends, including V, have found it now. I only use it now cause I’ve built up so much karma so it’s just useful. This happened while I was laughing again round a corner in her room so they knew I was there but idk.

Ok now this bit is really retarded so just hear me out (also I just wanna preface this by saying I’m an atheist and a pretty strong ‘believer at that). Cause I’ve been so confused lately, I uh, I guess you would call it praying. Like, ik everyone’s done it in a time of need like when something big is about to happen, but, I’m a fucking child when it comes to relationships and I can’t stop myself from thinking pretty much every girl I meet wants to go out with me. Or more accurately, I wanna go out with every girl I meet. It happens all the time and I can’t stop myself when it does. So when I ‘prayed’ I was essentially just asking for a sign on which girl out of 4 is ‘the one’. Like I said, this boys retarded. And there were ‘signs’ pointing to V, so when I went round her house I wasn’t exactly in the beat mindset.

So when she went upstairs I noticed something about her lights and as a joke, was gonna go upstairs and be angry about it. But I just kept laughing for no reason. But a little bit of time went on and. Ok so I have this stress ball that I use whenever I’m thinking about shit and it just helps, but one of the people there (L(a guy) his it. It wasn’t for any reason just a joke. He put it underneath V’s bed and I took his phone and said to get it back, but he tried to get his phone back, and in that, I pushed him onto the bed and it broke the frame. It wasn’t anything important, like just to keep the mattress in but it was a pretty big crack. I started laughing for about 5 fucking minutes straight because I didn’t really realise what had happened and what the consequences were.

So a bit of time went on and V came back downstairs. She didn’t notice the crack at first so I started laughing again. I fell on the floor and when she noticed, I didn’t see her face, but I could tell that she was genuinely annoyed. She was so angry that she kicked everyone out. This was the first time I think I’ve seen her actually, like proper angry and it was entirely my fucking fault. I couldn’t stop laughing at first and she kept on telling me to get out.

But after a few minutes, I calmed down, got my hall back, apologised and left. I walked all the way home even though I had a skateboard with me and I haven’t looked anyone in the eyes since it happened. 

Instead of going home, I waked past my house and went into the woods next to it. I went up a hill and found a tree to think on. After what felt like 10 minutes, I checked my phone after I had said sorry to everyone 20 minutes beforehand. And V had text back explains how she felt and shit and said that we couldn’t go round her house anymore to hang out cause stuff always breaks when we do. And it’s fucking true as well, and it’s always fucking me. So after this I just started laughing because part of the ‘sign’ I wanted to see if V was the one was either be the last to leave, or have her hug me because she was sad. And obviously, there was a big fucking chance for that when she went upstairs, but I was being too Fucking retarded, destructive and just not thinking straight when I had it. Ik I’m a terrible person for this shit as well, like manipulative. Having her be sad as a way for me to ‘go out with her’. 

But after laughing about it, I started crying, like full on fucking sobbing in the woods. And I was still fucking laughing while it was happening as well. The only thing I remember thinking about them was me laughing about the fact o thought I had a chance with V even though I couldn’t even tell when she needed help. After 20 minutes of Jude crying and laughing, I went back home, had my dinner and slept for 2 hours just thinking about it.

I just feel like I’ve ruined the relationship I had with the 3 people and it fucking hurts. Cause V was the only person I could really open up to and talk about my feelings to and now Idk what’s gonna happen cause she’s angry and sad, and I’m just Fucking laughing while hiding my real feelings. I’m just scared about everything cause idk where my life is going or what I can do to fix the situation.",21Mar2020,1
8,I have a co worker (government worker) that is obviously sick. And with everything going on. But he refuses to go home or see a doctor stating he is saving his sick time for retirement and we can’t force him. Is there a law saying that we can force him to leave.,21Mar2020,1
9,"Before I start, the friend is planning to go to therapy with their other friend (so they have an incentive).

So my friend admitted to me that they’re suicidal. It was a tough pill to swallow because I should’ve expected it where I couldn’t. 

We talked about why they feel this way and I tried my best to basically say: things happen in the past but they don’t have to change the future. I said as much as I could.

It made them feel slightly better after some more conversation and we eventually ended up discussing other things to keep their mind off of suicide.

The therapy is something that will happen with another friend, which I think might be to make sure they don’t flake. 

My issue is, I’m concerned that:
a) they’re in a very emotional state because they’re leaving.
b) they have never been like this before which is never a good thing.

I’m not in the general public but I am around people every day in the same workplace, albeit it is well spaced out and sanitized. Two of the people I live with are working in food service, still out in the public as well. But some of my roommates have valuable jobs that allow them to work from home in technology fields , and I feel like it is morally my responsibility to keep myself away from them as they have been declared desired to remain safe. Myself on the other hand may end up ill since I have to keep working. While I am as of yet not symptomatic, I could be a carrier and not know it, while they have not left the house, and I feel like if I interacted with them or even left the room I could put them in harm’s way, which they would otherwise not face if it weren’t for myself and my other roommates working in the public.

12,"This self distancing is driving me mad. I’m fed up with my lazy family. I’ve been on 6 walks by myself today and I’m so lonely. My family only ever wants to watch tv and talk about movies. My mom and sister will go an entire day in their pyjamas and think it’s completely normal.

My 10 year old sister spends the whole day on the computer or watching TV and thinks I’m ridiculous for begging her to go outside with me. She’s growing up with some horrible habits too and doesn’t appreciate being active. I feel like my parents gave up with parenting her.

I feel so lonely. I understand it’s good to relax sometimes but they are like this every day and I want to go outside and live my life. I want to take family walks or bike rides or SOMETHING.

Even when we are not in quarantine they are like this. I have hardly any fun memories outside with them. They only want to stay home. What a boring life that is. My favourite memories are when I went places with my friend’s families. I feel like a loser every time I try a new thing like skating or skiing or riding a tube on a boat because I never did it with my family before and im always a newbie at everything.

13,Almost 6 years ago I found my mom dead. It was the worst day of my life and I can still see the picture in my head. She wasn’t answering her phone so I decided to stop by and see if she wanted to go have breakfast with me and when I opened the front door (there was a couch right to the left) her body was the first thing I saw. We were very close. Ever since then I’ve been afraid it will happen again. I also found my 11 year old German Shepherd dead like 4 years ago. When I used to live at my dads I was terrified he would die in his sleep. This one night I got up to go to the bathroom and the door to his room was open and I got scared because he never sleeps with it open and it was too dark to see inside so I had to ask if he was okay. The dog was afraid of the storm so that’s why he opened it. Other times I would hear his alarm go off for too long and think he’s dead. Now I worry I will find my daughter dead. It eats me up.

14,"I've gone on 5 dates with this girl and NYC just effectively said any social gatherings are banned. If I've been working from home and so has she with her roommate and not directly coming in contact with anyone else, is it okay for us to visit one another's apartments?

19,"Ok so here's my setup. I got divorced last year and had to take a roommate to pay the bills. I found someone decent who had a kid who was the same age as my oldest (7 at the time).

25,"First of all sorry for my English and any errors and lack of fluency of this text, I'm writing this in a burst of emotion. 

So.. The problem is my stepfather. We (me, mom, 10yo brother, dog) are living under the same roof with this tyrant for like 11 years now. On the outside he seems like this likeable, middle aged family guy with beer belly but behind the closed doors he is completely different. He doesn't walk around angry all day but make one little mistake, say something that doesn't match his opinions and he will start to scream all over you and tell that you don't have the right to speak. The worst part of this life are Fridays, Fridays are days when he drinks vodka and turns into a mad man. The first time when I saw him explode was maybe 7/8 years ago, family came to visit us, they got drunk and he threatened to kill my mother and set my (then 3 years old brother) on fire. We called the police, they took him to the police station for 2 hours and then released him like nothing happened. 
Next time, year 2016, it's fair to say, he beat the shit out of my mother. She was wearing sunglasses for the next month because of the swelling and scars on the face. 
When he drinks, he constantly threatens to beat and kill my mother, he kicked her out of the house in the middle of the night a few times. 
Recently, when he was sober, he told my (10yo) brother that he'll beat him so bad his head will fall off. 
And now, when I'm writing this, I'm sitting next to my drunk mom who just got beaten again and threatened to be killed. 

So the problem is that she don't want to leave him because she knows that we have no money to live normal life. I think that we all developed Stockholm syndrome after all these years with him and it's hard to do anything. 

I have no idea what we can do because it's so hard to convince her to move out. She earns national average which barely covers the rent, and we still need to pay for utilities and food for 3 of us + dog. 
I'm finishing high school in 2 months so I could go to job but then no one will be home to take care of the dog and young brother. 
 
I just remembered, when mom was pregnant he didn't believe that it was his child, and after the birth he gave her 3 months to move out. As you can tell,  nothing happened 

What on earth can we do to solve this problem?

33,"I (23F) have gotten into a bit of trouble with my ex (27M) over the past few days, but it has escalated significantly over the last 24 hours. 

Yesterday was my birthday. My ex, who I’ve been friends with since our breakup in October, had been staying at my apartment to avoid staying with a family member who was thought to have had exposure to a patient with COVID-19. I left the apartment at noon, but ended up having to come home later in the night when the hosts of my party began arguing over their own personal problems. I called an Uber home and asked my ex if he could let me into my building, and he replied saying he would. When I arrived, he did not come downstairs and I was left to wait in the lobby for 20 minutes until an elderly woman entered the building at around 2:30 am. When I got to my apartment, my ex was sitting by the door, heavily intoxicated. 

I have a rule in my house that alcohol is not allowed inside without my permission. This is due to some of my ex’s previous behaviours. I asked him to leave, but he refused to go. This set off a nasty argument between the two of us, but we finally went to bed. 

Today, we got into another argument after he put a beer in my shopping cart at a grocery store. We left the store empty handed and when we got back to my place, I told him he needed to leave again. He once again refused, and argued with me while calling me names, etc... I kept asking him to leave, but he wouldn’t budge. I locked myself in my room for a bit to try and get some space from the situation, and when I finally came out, he was FaceTiming some of his friends. I asked him again to leave, and he refused, but got up and approached me to continue arguing his point... and I pushed him. 

I feel awful for putting my hands on him. He threatened to call the police on me, which would have been well deserved, but then faked a call and laughed at me when he said he had the upper hand. He continued to refuse to leave, saying that if I told him to go, he would “ruin my life.”

He has left my apartment at this point, but I feel like my life is over. I have never put my hands on anyone like that before and feel horrible about doing it. It is never okay to do that to anyone under any circumstance, but I was pushed to my limit with this guy breaking the rules of my house and refusing to leave when asked several times. 

I need to cut things off for good with this person. Many of our arguments are fueled by the fact that he is not over me, and it is clear now that our friendship is not salvageable. I want to block this person on social media, but I fear that if I do that, he will contact police and charge me.

I feel so scared and small. This friendship/relationship has been so taxing on me, but he has been my only connection in the city I live in. I have no other support.

This is not who I am as a person.",21Mar2020,1
34,"I'm currently enrolled in a small university on Guam with a tight-knit community and pretty cheap tuition (more or less ~$8000 per year, however I'm under FAFSA and a Regent scholarship so that brings it down quite a lot). The university also has a handful of great professors, and it offers pretty good opportunities for my major. I'll be graduating in 2 years.

However, my family is planning on moving to Oregon sometime during the summer, which is something my newly retired dad has been looking forward to doing as a post-retirement goal. He's been setting it up for a while now, and we have family there so it wouldn't be much of a problem to move.

Both my family and I want to be as close in proximity to each other as possible, especially in case an emergency happens, but a little distance won't hurt if I stay on Guam to finish my degree.

To fulfill the need for proximity, I initially planned on transferring to an AASCB-accredited university in Oregon which naturally has a bigger community, possibly more opportunities, and possibly more experienced professors. However, the tuition fees will probably bite, as I'll most likely be paying out-of-state tuition if I transfer, and FAFSA + scholarships might not be enough to save me from taking out a student loan. Furthermore, I got back my unofficial credit evaluation from their admissions department and they estimate that it will take me 3 more years to graduate.

Furthermore, I'm planning on taking the CPA exam somewhere along the way. On Guam, I can start taking it during my senior year as long as I have completed certain advanced courses. In Oregon, I have to take 2 more years worth of classes (on top of the classes required for my major) before I can sit for the CPA exam.

Ultimately, my question is should I transfer to Oregon, or should I stay on Guam to finish my degree? I don't want to take for granted the privilege and opportunity I have to transfer to an AASCB-accredited university while being in close proximity to my family, but it will mainly cost me with graduating way later and paying way more. Quality, time, and money are the most important factors for me.

Guam
+ cheap tuition
+ 2 years left to graduate
+ can take CPA exam earlier
- limited experiences and career opportunities
- far away from family
- not AASCB-accredited

Oregon
+ possibly more opportunities
+ closer to family
+ AASCB-accredited
- most likely very expensive
- 3 years left to graduate
- +2 more years before I can sit for the CPA exam 

Kinda on the fence between what I should decide for myself, and I've just been doing nothing but reevaluating the pros and cons without finding a solid conclusion. Any advice would be appreciated!",21Mar2020,1
35,"I'm 16, so I'm not too worried about this right now, but I've always had trouble connecting with people where I'm from and often wonder whether I'll ever have meaningful relationships (romantic or platonic) in the future.
     I've often wondered why this is: I'm pretty smart and a lot more academic than most of the people I know, and I also don't really tell people that I'm gay. I would probably get some mild ribbing from a few boys I know, but mostly I don't expect I'd receive too much flak - ultimately, I think I don't like to talk about it because I was raised by parents who are quite emotionally reserved (I mean that I never used to discuss crushes or anything with them, not that they didn't love me), so I feel really uncomfortable about the idea of opening up to any of my friends, and I've never felt very emotionally attached to them anyway - they're nice girls, I just don't have a lot in common with them. Whereas my brother and sister both miss their friends during school holidays and want to meet up outside of school, I don't feel the urge to go out of my way to see them. I guess that makes me seem cold.
     Anyway, I often imagine my future and wonder if I'll meet people I actually understand. Something I find difficult to imagine is ever having sex: I don't know if this is a product of my weird aforementioned emotional/sexual reservations, but I feel deeply uncomfortable thinking of myself in any kind of sexual manner; I mentioned my age earlier because I'm hoping I'm still just sexually immature and it'll sort itself out. 
     The reason it bothers me is that I often worry my own sexuality has paradoxically ostracised me from ever wanting to engage sexually with another woman, by which I mean this: I'm quite masculine; in the future I'd definitely be a butch lesbian. However, I find more feminine women sexually attractive, and I often feel confused and upset by the fact that I desire femininity but hate the idea of resembling it myself. I just can't imagine ever wanting someone to have sex with me, as I have a woman's body and it makes me picture myself as feminine, which I hate. What's more, I hate that I hate picturing myself in this way - I feel kind of sexist, or that I'm basically just denigrating and sexualising feminine women or something.
     I'm confused about what this means for my sexuality. Like, I'm certain I'm homosexual: I'm definitely sexually attracted to women, and if I were a man I don't think I'd have a problem with this. I think I would happily have a future relationship in which I didn't have sex with my partner, even though I'm clearly not asexual as such (is this weird?). I also am very meh about gender politics and all that, and don't think I could be bothered to transition to male.
     Does anyone out there feel similarly or know what could be the matter with me?",21Mar2020,1

Its like a switch, whenever someone starts yelling angrily, i just kinda, stop feeling emotionally i guess??? It sounds super bad to phrase it like that, but that's the only way i can think of describing that, i think but i don't really think, its weird, and i almost can't describe it i never feel sad while or immediately after it happens, buy usually i just have a breakdown a few hours after it happens.

A lot of my stress comes from my living situation (which I’m trying to fix at the moment) but also my health. I’m a big hypochondriac and this whole virus hysteria isn’t doing me any good at all. I’ve stopped checking the news, but people are talking about it every where I go.

He is part of the millions of Americans that are immunocompromised and my sister refuses to quit her job. The number of coronavirus cases in my area is growing exponentially and my sister says that she refuses to quit her job because she believes that her coworkers will not think she is fit to be in the medical field.

I can't hang out with my friends from home because we don't want to get each other sick, so aside from running errands for my parents, leaving the house to take a walk, and my work with the fire department, I'm in my parent's house all day every day. The only people I can interact with in a daily basis are my parents and brother. I love them all to death, but the transition isn't exactly easy. I went from being able to pick what I want to do, what to eat and when I want to run errands and clean, to effectively being a high school student again. Even though I can handle myself and I like living on my own, I'm back to relying on them for everything. I have to eat what they cook, I go shopping for what they need, and I leave the house when they want me to. It's not their fault, because they're just treating me how I was treated when I was younger, so I'm not mad at then or anything like that, I'm just frustrated. I feel like I lost all of the agency and confidence that I gained when I was at school. That combined with the fact that I can't see my friends anymore is starting to get to me a little. My only saving grace right now is the fact that I'm in the fire department, and I can get out of the house and ride on the trucks when we get calls.

It is only for background. His dad lost his wallet sometime between going to the store and coming home with $1000 in cash and over $300 in checks. He’s 83 and retired and on government assistance, so like, that’s basically all his money. I tore apart his house with him the night it happened because my boyfriend was passed out drunk (different, but vital information). It wasn’t in the house. The next day, his sisters call the cops on us and say we stole it and then one of them came down and told the landlord Sean has been to jail and so she told us we couldn’t stay there even though we had money for our share of the rent. And I had a psychotic breakdown due to stress and being out of my meds for a week, was in the ER then I used the lack of medical personnel and security guards around due to this pandemic and hospitals being rearranged to dodge the nurse to run/hide from the security guard and then a cop they found in the parking lot. Almost physically attacked my boyfriend after getting into a big ass argument. Not my best moment, mind you, but we made it through. I did, however, go off on my family and now my grandma told me she’s taking me out of the will. So, we are both basically out of a place to stay individually and definitely together.

82,"Hey im a (m23) (in Canada) and trying to live my life the best way i can. Im in a relationship with this one girl for almost 3 years, she is my first in everything. Kiss, sex etc.. Growing up i didnt have much friends, so i was a loner so when she came up in my life it was a big deal.. But since it was our first relationship we are both dont have any expirience or knowledge and that sometimes  me and my girlfriend, we have occasional fights for random reasons.. We both know our relationship has an expectation day, but we are both afraid to act on it. For the past year or so i followed a girl on insta that went to my highschool.. She is 20 years old. Anw i tried talking to her casualy, not in any sexual way, i dont want to be that guy who cheats or sends wierd dms to people, just normal conversation so i can get to know the person, but she isn't really the responsive type, but from what she told me and some stories she uploaded, we have so many things in common.. And I'm starting to feel that she might be something special.. With my current gf we dont match  alot.. We have alot of differences, and that leads to alot of arguments sometimes..Now lately ive been having some thoughts about breaking up etc but now with the quarantine and stuff she lives in another state and only comes for uni to my state so when the pandemic was announced she went back to her parents. Anww long story short  the insta girl made a q/a and in a question of if she has a crush on someone she said yes but doesn't know if he feels the same way..  And she won't act on it..   But i know nobody is thay stupid to let her go away that easy,  she mentioned they talk alot, and i know that whoever ends up with her is a lucky person.. I just cant get her out of my head..  How can i proceed, what should i do..",21Mar2020,1
83,"Firstly, I am not alone. While I have struggled to make meaningful friendships in college, I can say that I have an available group of 6 hometown friends that I can share some of my problems with.  However despite this, I still feel so lonely. Given that I lean towards being more introverted, I am often okay with going extended periods on time on my own, but since the New Year, I have been craving friendships that feel ""real"". 

This feeling is something I have been struggling with since early 2019. I have been so desperate for meaningful friendship that I have been talking to my ex daily, for hours during the quarantine and even before then. While she is a great person, the friendship does not do anything for me anymore. I still find myself experiencing emptiness and feeling unheard. 

Lately I've been more disgruntled, irritable, tired, annoyed, and nihilistic. I'm pushing myself away from loved ones because I feel so distant from them anyways. 

Now facing forced isolation, I find myself alone with my thoughts. Thoughts that antagonize me, and make me feel dread for the many years of life that follow this one. How do I overcome this self-loathing, pathetic feeling of loneliness? I honestly can't take this anymore. I wish there was not a biological need to be social, I would much rather be alone but content.",21Mar2020,1
84,"M 21 for reference
So me and this girl hooked up a few weeks ago after a party and it was good. We were wound up for a while by our friends because we had a common group of friends. Also, she was my ex’s friend(ish) who I only broke up with a few weeks ago (with her for 1 year)

At the start of the week, us two and our friends went on holiday to the countryside for the week and to drink before lockdown occurred.
Anyway, on the first night we hooked up again and it was exactly the same as before so it was overlooked. And then the second night again but then it became a bit more personal with the cuddling and kissing even when we weren’t doing anything sexual. It changed. And then by the third night and fourth morning we were being couple-y. Kissing in the kitchen and all and it was really nice. Then it was all sexual again and I’m not sure if it’s a fwb or not. I’m also very confused with how I feel about relationships and everything. My mind is confused and I don’t know what to do",21Mar2020,1

This job has been a sweet source of income and my parents arent exactly in the best position right now, so it helps them out too if I'm able to afford all my stuff by myself. Im afraid I may be fired if I ask for time off due to corona. I also met alot of cool ppl I wont be able to see anymore if I leave. Additionally, like I said, they are a bit understaffed so I'd feel bad leaving right now. It doesnt help that my store wont provide me with face masks during work.

I'm honestly not sure what to do. I could go either way but seeing all these articles on how grocery stores are the worst place to be rn is frightening. Additionally, my county Is the most infected in all of NY rn so that's something.

89,"Every Christmas there are those films where a businessman or businesswoman are obsessed with their work and never have time to love but some kind of Christmas magic shows them that their lives are meaningless without their special one.

I wonder, watching those films, if actually they have it backwards. Is love (romantic love, i mean) more important than your work? For example, I'm currently 20 years old, studying in college to be able to work (let's drop the difficulty of getting the work you like and assume that I could achieve it) in a career I enjoy very much. My career is actually my hobby, I love to work on those things and many people, even teachers, are surprised that I spend most of my free time improving my skills on my career. But doing it is actually like playing videogames, or watching a movie for me.

The problem is that that sometimes it makes me feel like an ""Ebenezer Scrooge"". And on top of that I have the thought that I don't want a boyfriend or anything like that (I mean, I have my crushes like any human being, and I enjoy with sex, but love and sex does not have to come together, if you know what I mean). What is troubling me is that in a distant future, I wake up in the middle of the night realising that I waste my life working and love is the only important thing.

As I stated, I feel in love and that, but my rational thinking brain knows that perfect love doesn't exist, neither the ""perfect boyfriend or girlfriend"" and with time, usually 5 years, the chemicals reactions that ""provoke love"" disappear (that's why in a relationship is more important to be good friends than love itself, is what makes you stay longer than those years). Knowing that, I don't want to have anybody depending on me or viceversa (also because my career doesn't let me stay in one place for long), so I just want to be single. But again, I'm worried that I will regret that decision in the future (actually I regret my love decisions on high school, where I feel like I wasted my opportunity to have a silly teenager relationship and that's an experience I will never be able to live).

So, what do you think, is love really important?
P.S. If you could give me a bit of background to understand and check the ""sources"" of your wisdom. Because, for example, a 14 years old could not help me on this issue, neither someone at my age I think.",21Mar2020,1

99,"Lately I’ve been considering not seeing my dad anymore. My parents are divorced and I’m wondering if he’s really been as bad as I think or if I’m just being an edgy teen and overreacting to the situation.

To start my dad yells at me for things I don’t do or things that aren’t my fault.
* Yelling at me for not doing laundry right and threatening to “tear my ass apart”.
* Yelling at me for locking him out of his car when he was the one who was in it last, and when he was proven wrong he ignores it like he didn’t do anything wrong.
* He doesn’t do anything around the house and only wants me to come over to do his chores (dishes, yard work, help him clean the house.) 

I don’t have a problem with helping out around the house. I always clean for my mom when she’s not home or help her with house work, but is it bad if the only reason he wants me around is to do work for him while he drinks and watches me and yells that I’m doing it wrong?

*If I didn’t clean the bathroom near my room he would threaten to stick my head in the bowl and make me smell it.
*He would ask me to scratch his feet all the time and would guilt trip me if I said no.
*When I had my girlfriend over he would whistle and say things like “damn”.
*When he caught me smoking weed he didn’t care and would give me some to smoke.
*He compares me to my brother about things like weight, muscle, work ethic, etc.
*He would tell me he was coming to pick me up and would cancel almost every time.
*He would promise to take us to the movies or dinner and spend time with us and never fulfilled his promises.
*If I disagree with him on anything he says I’m stupid and need to do my research (and when I do and prove him wrong he says Im still wrong).
*He doesn’t care about my mental or physical health.
*He only makes one meal a day, no other food in the house except for the food needed for dinner that day, no way to make breakfast or lunch.
*No clean dishes or cups unless I clean them.
*He yells at me when I don’t want to eat off a fork with leftover food stains on it like chunks of old food or dried mustard.
*He forces me and my younger brother to help him grow weed.
*Whenever I bring up my mental health he tells me to man up and proceeds to talk about how bad he has it.
*He doesn’t provide financial help to my mom to help with groceries, clothes, etc. 
*When he does he only gives her $100 very 2 months-ish.

So, should I stop seeing him or am I just being over reactive?",21Mar2020,1
100,so this girl matched with me on tinder and the whole situation seemed weird because our text chain would disappear and she would go back to my matched then she asked fro my number and once she got it she texted me a week later and sent me nudes. Then the next day another number claimed it was her father and if i didn't call him he'd file a police report because he said she was a minor (even though she was on tinder which is 18 plus) then a few hours later i got a text from a Lieutenant who claimed he was part of my cities police department but he didn't give me his badge number and i tried to call the 2 numbers he sent and they were dead lines and the number the text came from was a dead line to. is this real and am i gonna get arrested or is this a scam,21Mar2020,1

Today proved it, so he was going to get me weed from his link but I came late so that didn’t happen, anyways he told me he couldn’t get it and he pretty much expected me to leave right after like he didn’t wanna chill or anything. He just told me to try a dispensary, like I travelled all the way to him too and he knows it took me 40 min to get there. 

Even before this whenever me and him used to chill it was only to smoke by the side of his building and right after the joint was done he would leave, he never asked me to chill because of that I’ve always had a feeling he uses me for weed but I’ve always ignored that but today is enough proof that he just used me for weed

After that night, I've talked to my good old friend and found out that every single time I've talked about a new relationship, this girl is always on the back of my mind.

I also followed her back on Instagram saying that I'm sorry about everything, and she also apologised and we just officially ended it there.

106,"I rarely turn to ask people questions but I'm stumped. I love my brother but he's confusing. possibly less intelligent, I'm not sure, if he has some mental illness or just insecure, possibly lacks true confidence in any abilities he has, possibly enjoys manipulation I don't know. there is a lot of variables to be had before the conclusion.  
My brother thinks I and my sister are geniuses compared to him, so he thinks of himself as intellectually less. He looks at me and asks me questions like how do you have an answer to everything, or how are you so aware of people and surrounding and situations. I tell him ""I think reasonably, and I am passionate about certain things that I need these skills for. Then he asks me ""how do you notice these things that you need and how do you learn them"". I tell him I think chronologically about what it takes to be \[what I'm doing\].   
My point is my IQ might be higher than the next or lower and my brothers might be lower than the next or higher. I just think we are all on an even playing field and we all have the same opportunities, I just decided to realize the importance of the opportunities first, same for my sister. I don't think anyone is smarter than the next. I think IQ just lets you complete the same goal as anyone else just a little faster, an effort is still needed; who will try harder per se.  
Let me state some facts.   
He is the eldest brother of our generation of kids.  
""He is a jack of all trades but a master of none"" sort of speak. In a sense, I and my sister were like this also just him especially. I and my sister have mastered things in life tho and have been passionate about certain things that we put time into learning the detailed process and all the knowledge you gain even outside of the passion due to values in life and lifestyle and how our brain works and learns.   
We are all very different, I am almost completely rational and reasonable If I didn't have forced passions I would be diagnosed with Anhedonia, I do try my best to think from logical and emotional sides, it is difficult due to emotional and intuitive thinking to me seems to be the dumbest way of thinking but I'm open-minded to being wrong.  
My sister is about 50/50 maybe leans more towards logical, but from time to time I will have to help her realize her certain situations and how to fix or change them efficiently and effectively. But at the same time, my sister has put way more effort into life than I have and most will, she is insanely talented and has a great working ethic. And amazing at what she does and the skills she needs to do what she does.  
My brother is 90/10 intuitive and emotion being ""90"" decisions and answers are inconsistent don't make sense when thought out. He often lies not sure why he could be intimidated or just doesn't care which isn't often the real reason for anything. And I always know when he's lying because he's not great at it; chronologically his stories don't add up. Today I asked him to do me a favor, he would need to leave his home. He said sure in the morning. Then denied me later saying he doesn't want to get the coronavirus and he thinks 70% of the population will get it (if that happened I would be completely astounded and mind-blowing). And then later saying he's going out with his girlfriend to run some errands and he will do my favor tomorrow.   
Weirdly, he does this often does he think he's tricking me? Does he think I don't notice every single lie he tells me? He's 21 lives with his girlfriend at her grandparent's house cause her parents made them move out. His mind is never stimulated by real knowledge and reasonable education. he graduated high school and hasn't looked at anything but his phone and girlfriend since so his mind is just withering away and, has had some extensive substance abuse. He thinks it is not. He has tried nearly every drug there are at least 5 times not going to get to detailed.   
So essentially I'm stumped I once thought my brother would be the most successful person in our family and now is starting to look like a loser he's negative and accepts defeat without even realizing it but you can tell by what he's saying on a day to day basis. A couple of months ago he said ""I don't know what I want to be because the worlds going to end in a couple of years anyways"" from like ice caps or global warming, or some shit. I tell him he has given up before he started even if the worlds ending tomorrow im going to give today my all because why not fuck it what's better to do. I believe some of the views on life have changed due to the environmental influence of his girlfriend being extremely liberal and depressed and having anxiety making them very co-dependent. not saying liberal is a bad thing both sides have an extreme and the extreme is scary. I love my brother and I have tried to help him realize what he's doing with his life but he believes he is right and no one can change him he's very closed-minded. I think that's why he has a hard time talking to me because the things he says I will give straight-up facts and reasons that are fully thought out to why they aren't the healthy and correct way of living. I care for him I don't want to see him like this but he is so far gone I don't think he can come back unless he has some sort of crisis.  
My conclusion is, im not sure? He could honestly just be not that bright, causing him to believe whatever you shoot at his face that sounds easy to understand. He could have some mental illness like anxiety or depression. Or he's insecure and can't understand confidence because he's passionless. I just don't see why a human would want to live like him.",21Mar2020,1

120,So I(14M) and my friends(14M/16M) just got our first skateboarding sponsor as skateboarding influencers not as pros or anything we have a Instagram with 5k followers that the 3 of us co own. We really want this to go somewhere and we have gotten to the point where companys are now giving us products for us to post about it. Sooner then later they are going to start paying us. My older sister(20F) is a lifestyle/beauty influencer with 700k on YouTube and 500k on Instagram. Her manger got us this sponsor as a favor from my sister.

We have 6 acres of land and our house only takes up 2 we basically have 4 acres that do nothing besides increase in value over time.

123,"So as the title suggests, I’ve been planning on moving to a different state for the last few months. The date has been the weekend of the 27th of this month for a while. My current lease is ending on the 31st and I am moving in with my partner who moved out a little before me. 

My biggest question is, what can I expect for this? I plan on driving. It is about a 25 hour drive I was planning on splitting up between 3 days. From everything I have seen gas stations are still open. Worst case I can sleep in my car if hotels close and I will be bringing enough food and water with me for the 3 days just Incase I can’t find something open(which I think will be doubtful). I am worried about being pulled over on my way, as I’ll be passing through some areas that are under self quarantine orders. Is there anything I am missing? 

Before anyone suggests it, unfortunately extending my lease here is not an option nor do I want to do that.

I  am a shy person. I decided to ask out a woman that I have known for a  year. Her brother is my far neighbor. We have gotten along well in  person. We have been Facebook friends for a while. We like a lot of each  others stuff and have real engaging conversations about those topics.

I  asked her and I feel like I was turned down. ""If it ain't 'hell yeah'  it's a 'No'"" rule of thumb. I feel like her response was 'let's be  friends'. Which is a nice sentiment, but it usually isn't true. She's  never gonna text me to just see how I'm doing. She'll likely ghost me  when I say hello next time. It's just gonna be awkward for one of us.

It  will probably be me. I am already ridiculed for being single, by my  mom, by my friends, by my neighbors. I can stand being single. I can not  stand the social pressure of being single. I don't think I will be  happy living a life alone. I want to have a romantic relationship with a  woman.  Hell I'd settle for a hook-up just to pretend for a minute.

I  want to get better at this. I probably have a lot of work to do. I am  willing to do that work. A lot of the response that I have been getting  in the other places I have posted about this i get the response, ""You  were too timid"" or ""You came off as weak"". Is that true?

Is  that what I need to work on? How can I be more sexually aggressive  without being disrespectful? I guess I would try and present a more  sexual energy and then try and tone it down. I feel like I have been  told a sexual energy is unwelcome for public interaction. I feel like it  would be SUPER creepy to act differently in private messages. Maybe I  should just move out of rural Indiana.

132,"So yesterday, I was scrolling the comments in one post in r/memes, and I saw this comment (now deleted due to downvotes) claiming that vaping doesn’t kill you and that vaping laws need to “f*** off. (I don’t know the exact wording.) And with the downvotes, I knew he was wrong, so I believed he was trolling, and called him out. He then proceeded to stick to his claim, and he still brought up the fact that “vaping doesn’t kill, which I believe he was using it to support his claim on why vaping law need to be removed, and so I threw in some sources that proved otherwise and fact-checked him. He then began throwing in reasons why I was wrong, saying things like “only small doses won’t kill you” and that “there wasn’t enough evidence to prove so.” Although I was right that vaping did kill and that I countered his first comment, I still lost the argument, and I ended up getting frustrated and blocked him because it didn’t seem to make sense to me, because who would want vaping laws to be lifted, when it’s only just trying to protect people because of the dangers of vape? But it didn’t really matter because I still lost the argument that wasn’t supposed to be an argument in the first place, I was only fact-checking him because his comment was invalid.

Or it was only the first comment that was invalid...

I began to wonder to myself: why didn’t he say the reason in his first comment? All he said was the CDC (he changed the wording to say CDC before deleting the comment) said that vaping doesn’t kill, and that vaping laws need to go away. But my question is, what type of laws needed to go away? And why? Clearly he wasn’t specific enough.

Because his first comment was bland, I believed he was trolling and I tried to fact-check him, only he brought up reason why vaping doesn’t kill, but he never brought up what type of laws, and I still lost the argument. I wasn’t trying to start an argument whether the laws need to go away, all I did was try and fact-check him. And bringing back about the first comment, why didn’t he state what type of laws needed to to banned and the reason how vaping doesn’t kill people.

Now, I can’t stop thinking about that. I was arguing with myself whether I was right or was I wrong. Maybe he was wrong, but managed to win an argument anyways, since wining an argument doesn’t always mean you’re right. I feel really dumb right now, and I don’t really know what I can do about it, because now I blocked him, and I feel like a sore loser, even though I now come to realize that his claim on “vaping laws needed to be lifted” looks pretty bland and that he wasn’t really specific about it at all.

Maybe he’s wrong, or not. But all I know is that his claim was bland and that I may have approached it wrong, and therefore I lost the argument that wasn’t supposed to exist.

To be quite honestly probably where true. About him. I called him out in it and he turned bad on me like a mushroom in an airtight bag. Then, she cheated on me. Dumped me before I could confront her about it. And lied about me, claiming I raped her. (When in fact she raped me. She told me she was on the pill. And wasn’t). Now here I am. 2 years after this. I’ve moved on. These people don’t mean anything to me. I now realise they confided with each other. Two toxic manipulative cockroaches banding together in some delusional idea that they are the good people. That I’m the scum here.

We should catch up on discord call.” I join and am immediately caught off guard. It’s them. They just lie. I have no clue why. It’s just us. What are they trying To prove to them selves.

Context: So a couple of weeks ago my dad ordered face masks for me and my siblings. My siblings masks were the black ones with white designs like a bear or a mustache. There are five masks and when we got them today there is one extra. I on the other hand got a Tokyo Ghoul styled mask, and my order came with two masks one a simple mask with the design and the other with a zipper that separates the teeth. Now when we were ordering them I was the most excited out of all of us. As I was getting something that represents who I am as a person and what I like. 

Now today when we opened the masks up and tried them on my little brother asked can he try the zipper one on. I gave it to him no problem because in my mind he's going to give it back. He shows it to my mom and she asks if that was his, he turns to me and asks if he could have it. This made me feel obligated to give it to him. As I am the oldest and I, according to my mom, should be willing to share all my things no matter what it is, and if I don't I'm a bad older sister. Honestly, I'm grateful that the masks were ordered, but it makes me mad that my mom did that. Like I wanted that mask and that was the one I was most excited about getting.

 Now I know i might be able to get it back from him later as he's young and he tends to forget about some of his toys. What I want to is am I wrong for being irritated at what happened? I am open to comments good and bad. Thanks for reading and I hope you all are being safe during these days.",21Mar2020,1
146,"I've been thinking about calling APS (Adult Protective Services) on my grandparents. This hasn't been an easy thought, and in reality it's an even harder decision to follow through on. Let me explain the situation. TL;DR at the end.

Both my grandma and grandpa are about 85 years old. Three years ago they sold the family home, and moved into a retirement community. This was hard for both of them, but in the end they couldn't keep up with the large amount of yard work and housework that came with the place. So they let go  of most of their positions except the essentials, and moved into a much smaller apartment that they would be able to maintain.

During that time, my grandpa was still sound of mind. It was starting to slip as old minds do, but he was still sharp and pretty much on top of things. Shortly after the move however, his mental health took a serious and fast decline. He has since been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He doesn't know who he is, where he is,  who any of the family is, or who is  wife (my grandma) is. It's been pretty rough for everyone, but we're doing the best to remind him that he is still loved.

That is, everyone except my hell-spawn of a grandma. The Gods themselves only know why he decided to stay with her for all of these years, as she has never treated him kindly or fairly. I know this is going to sound paranoid and a bit extreme, but I'm starting to think she's trying to kill him. After his mind left she insisted that he stays with her so she can 'care for him'. But thus far she has been hesitant to take him to the Dr. unless another family member twist her arm and does it themselves, and is not consistent about making sure he takes his medication. He recently had a very bad fall, which has left him unable to walk without a cane. He no longer has any strength in his legs because she refuses to walk with him anywhere or let him leave the house. He is starting to starve because while they sold the home, they don't have any money since they had to cover previous debt. My father and uncle bring them groceries, but lately she has been giving them all away and insisting that he no longer needs to eat. Things like this have been going on for months.

I live 12+ hours away and have zero financial means to support them, or I would have immediately put my grandpa into good and capable care. My other family members won't interfere because they don't want to rock the boat. I'll rock the boat, I'm not worried about that, as long as calling  APS actually benefits my grandpa and doesn't make things worse in the long run. I'm not sure what they would do for him in reality. Any advice or personal experience on this is very much appreciated. I know I have a lot to think about.

147,"My [20F] parents [51 M/F] don’t have a great relationship. Basically, my mom’s a selfish person that wants my dad to overwork himself to support her reckless spending. My dad is desperate to pay bills off, but she racked up $10k in debt. She also has a secret credit card that only my brother and I know about—my dad doesn’t know about it. So money “goes missing” when she makes payments on it. 

My dad has money in a safe, and now he’s having a hard time with bills due to being laid off. He wants to take the money out of the safe to pay some loans off so he can prepare for having no household income for awhile. 

My mom took $200 out of that safe, and she’s panicking because she wasn’t supposed to. I thought my dad had locked the safe to prevent her from doing so, but she must have found the key. 

She texted me begging for money because she knows I have my own safe (that she can’t get to) that has about $1k in it. She said she needs $200 for a few weeks and she promised not to spend it. She told me she would give me $300 back. Problem is, she has no income, so she would be taking MORE money out of the safe to pay me. Obviously, I don’t want more money back. 

My problem is, do I loan her the $200? If I do, I stop my parents from arguing, and help my dad out with bills. No guarantee that I’ll get the money back though. I also enable her behavior though...

It showed a girl standing there and she looked no older than 12 or 13. I got so scared. I wasn't sure what to do, I didn't wanna click on it so I tried to ignore it but I couldn't think about anything else. So in the end, I did click it. I didn't watch the entire thing even though it was just a minute, but i skimmed it. It looked like this little girl was getting mummified. No actual sexual actions but it was a video of a little girl on a porn site. I reported it to the site but still felt bad. I asked a friend for advice and she didn't really know what to do either. I googled it and turns out, my country's police department takes online reports of non-urgent cases and recommend reporting child pornography there. So I decided to do that, for my conscience at least. I had to give them all of my details, address, name, phone number etc. Now I'm wondering if I've overreacted since technically it wasn't pornography and I have no proof the girl is a minor.

He's asked me to be his girlfriend, but I didn't have an answer for him at that time (this would be my first relationship so I'm not sure what to do because I'm weak like that). He said he would wait and so we've been vibing and all has been good.

B is someone that I got to know only recently - within the past year or so. He's also a really nice dude and I find that spending time with him and talking to him has been really nice; it's a sort of comfortable that I haven't reached with A after all this time. We've had our moments of ""real talk,"" but it hasn't been to the extent that B and I have had. I don't actually know if B likes me, but based on what I've seen (and what others have seen), my close friends seem to think so.

I've begun to talk to B more about serious things and with A it's kinda been the usual conversation, and I find myself questioning who I really like. I've heard that if you like someone else when liking one person, it means that maybe you didn't like the first person as much as you thought you did???

Sorry if I sound like I'm playing both of them. :( I'm trying not to, and would appreciate any advice.",21Mar2020,1
156,"I’m a junior in high school, so I tend to catch feels pretty easily, as teenagers will do. Context. The guy I like right now is my ex boyfriend from my sophomore year, but I use the term lightly because we dated for like three months and we’re best friends now.

There are a few issues that make me hesitant to do anything about how I feel. Firstly, he really likes another girl- thing is, he asked her out twice and she rejected him both times (one of those times was just a few days ago). Secondly, I just broke up with someone else about a month ago. I know it’s high school and relationships don’t really matter as much, but... stigma, and whatnot.

Most importantly, this guy has a lot of underlying mental health issues. I’m scared I’ll end up breaking his heart at some point and really fucking with him. That’s a really bad reason to avoid someone, but... here we are.

I’m also just a bit worried people will think it’s weird if I date my ex, regardless of how short of a time we were together. A lot of my girl friends can be pretty unintentionally bitchy about that sort of thing.

I’m just debating between giving myself a few months to think about it before pursuing him or just completely shutting it down to avoid any complications. Just looking for a little advice, seeing if people have had similar experiences, or whatever. I can clarify in comments if people need me to.",21Mar2020,1
157,Hello so I’m 16 male and lately I’ve been losing my mind. I am in a way panicked on all of life. My career grade averages are 3.67 but I currently have 2.67 due to my horrible struggles in Spanish and my math teacher hates me but I don’t know how to bring them up if I can’t change the past. And on top of it all my stepdad and I have gotten tense since he has gotten mad on me about cleaning our pool yet the pump is broken but I had a massive headache earlier about it all and now later I’m told my grandma is dying and tomorrow will be the last day I will ever see here if she makes the night. This is hurting me more than my dad abandoning my family for drugs. I’m lost. I’m falling apart even though I’ve been known throughout my family and friends as the person always up despite blows to knock me. I’m trying to live up to my moms expectations and it’s stressing me out. Idk what to do. Thanks for any advice.,21Mar2020,1

 I was then”Booked” where they asked if I had any mental conditions I couldn’t speak I was laughing and crying so much and I said no but I was with a local mental health out patient treatment I then gave all my info still laughing and was then put in a cell where I started scratching myself and crying and laughing and saying I want to die continuously and that as soon as they let me out I was going to jump off the bridge.

they then took me to a cell where for people who are on self harm watch so that someone was there the whole time then I continued laughing and over all laughed for like an hour and a half straight I informed them I had work in 7 hours and an appointment with my therapist in 12 hours and that I needed to go or I’ll get fired and dropped, they said as long and I am calm they would do that.

 I couldn’t sleep so I sat there all night then when it got light I asked if I could leave they said soon then time went on and I didn’t get to leave 7am came and passed I continued to ask and told them I had no means to pay my mother back for the light and no way to move out unless I keep this job but they wouldn’t let me go.

So on Monday I had went to his place to hang like usual and idk one thing led to another and we ended up cuddling/hugging/holding hands he kept on playing with my hair and touching my face too. It was nice, the same thing happened this Thursday and Today. He’s changed too, I feel like he’s gotten a lot nicer and started caring about me more compared to when we were just friends. Whenever I’ve come to his place or he’d come to my place he’d always ask me if I wanted something and even when I said no he still bought it. He use to never do that lmao. He also doesn’t really deny that “we’re dating” whenever his friends ask about it.  

I really like being around him, whenever I tried to pull my hand away from him because I got tired he’d always ask to hold my hand again. It’s cute, he’s cute.

Specialized high schools are basically gifted and talented prestigious and segregated high schools consisting of mostly asians and whites.

Today, I decided to go for it and ask my dad for something. I showed him a 400$ desktop on Amazon and said that I would need a better computer anyways for online learning. He said he would order it later, which usually means get out of my way. I reminded him again and then he said,

“All you’ll do on it is play games, why should I buy it?”

I understand that he’s made sacrifices in paying for textbooks and prep programs for the test, but he’s able to pay for this!

I am employed by a local company. We are provided with eye wear, aprons, gloves, and a cotton face mask (I'm not so sure that these offer any real type of protection against getting or transmitting the virus). 

My boss says that the CDC classified the business as an 'essential business', but I can't find anything on their website. I did find an 'essential business' list on the Dept. Of Homeland Security's website and house cleaners are not listed. 

Also I'm not cleaning homes of disabled veterans/people, or of seniors who don't have anyone else; I'm cleaning homes of upper middle class to million dollar homes. People who are certainly capable of cleaning their own home. 

Originally I was still going to work because I do need to cover my bills. Now that is no longer a worry for me because my partner said that he doesn't think that the money I would make is worth the risk of my health or that of others, especially given that we now know that you can be asymptomatic and still shed the virus. He is willing to help with my bills and thinks that I should be staying home. 

I agree with him. Also people here aren't really taking the self quarantine very seriously. We recently had a couple of nice days and people were out and about in groups and crowding popular parks and beaches.

My grandmother passed away recently. I have lived with her for years but she passed so unexpectedly. Currently I'm in college and recovering from foot surgery so I only work part time. Her house was left to me in the will, but I cant just continue to pay off the mortage without getting it refinanced.

I know a lot of people are gonna say that I'm just gonna have to cut my losses, but just hear me out. 

I can afford to pay for the mortage, just as long as I can get the house refinanced. I can make a downpayment of at least 1/5 of the total house value. I can get a full time job too and make more than enough money to pay the mortgage.

I have always known my roommate is a sex worker and I have absolutely no issues with it whatsoever. I used to do BDSM fem dom work on the side. 

I moved in with my roommate (who is an escort) in September 2019 during a tough situation.  I paid only $300-400 in rent until January 1st. Then I started to pay $600 for my room. 

The previous roommate would be asked to leave the house when clients came. I told my roommate right off the bat that I will never leave the house if I am paying rent. I don't believe that's a fair ask and I refuse to pay for a hotel for extended stay clients. We both agreed this was reasonable. 

However, several times I have been asked to leave. I have also been asked to NOT return home. With no actual time frame or specific details being given. This has caused me a lot of grief and as you can imagine, discomfort. I've had to awkwardly ask friends if I could stay in their homes longer than I wanted to...

I sat my roommate down several weeks and stated this all needs to stop. They agreed and apologized. Stating I must have 'misunderstood' because they would never ask me to leave or not come home. 

Fast forward to the COVID19 quarantine. The only visitor (I thought) either of us has seen is my girlfriend. My girlfriend has been on work from home for several weeks now and has had literally no contact with anyone but my roommate and I. I've also been on work from home. 

Here's where i fucked up, I ASSUMED my roommate was not taking clients due to the quarantine. I was wrong. Apparently they've been seeing clients at hotels. I thought they were going to grocery stores or whatever to find toilet paper. 

Here's the part I need help with. 

At 7am this morning my roommate asked both my girlfriend and I around 7am to LEAVE the house because a CLIENT was coming over. They suggested we 'go for a nice long walk it's nice out'. This led me to ask if they are planning to have clients over and if they have been visiting them at hotels. My roommate admitted to both.

180,"I’m just starting to type but I know this is gonna be extremely long. Only start reading if you’re gonna care to finish. Thank you for listening in advance. Any advice helps.

Alright, so here it is, the full story. It sounds so long, but only happened in the span of a few months. Before we start, this is about me and a girl. I’ll call her Symone, her middle name. If you want to fully visualize this in ur head or something idk: she’s blonde, kinda pale but also like perfect skin tone for her personally, she’s about 5 foot 6, I have black hair, olive skin, 6 foot 1. Idk that’s unnecessary huh, whatever. We’re 16, sophomores in high school. 

The Story of me and Symone:
I know exactly when I first met her. August 13th, 2018, sometime between 3 and 4 pm. The last period on my first day of high school. I can’t say I was attracted to her yet, but I was intrigued, I knew she was different from other girls. Me and her weren’t friends for quite a long time, we talked in class occasionally, made small talk, nothing more. I was becoming better friends with other kids that would eventually bring me closer to her, but majority of freshman year I just hung with my cousins, I wasn’t happy about starting at this new school. In the second semester of freshman year, I started to really talk to her more, hung out with her during lunch/study hall and stuff. We still weren’t close friends, only really talked in a group chat. It was the start of second semester when I truly knew I loved her. Eventually, the school year came to a close, the last time I saw her was the last day, after we got student merit awards from our favorite teacher, I said goodbye to her as she signed another guy (who she had a crush on)’s yearbook. We weren’t really close enough friends to hang over the summer, so we didn’t, at all. We still talked over summer, but really just were more of acquaintances. This year is when things changed, fast. I’ll break down this year so far, into 4 different phases. 1. Still not really friends, 2. Good friends, 3. Mutual feelings, 4. Heartbreak. Yeah, spoiler alert, she ended up liking me back. Here’s how it went. We started this school year and I felt really shitty, like me and her weren’t very good friends and since I didn’t have like any classes with her or other people I talked to, I didn’t really get to interact with friends. One day, like a month into the school year, one of my friends was like “hey why haven’t we all ever hung in person, aren’t we like good friends lol”. It really didn’t make sense, he was right, the only thing holding us back was distance really. Quick sidenote, the friend group I’ll be talking about from here on out is a group of 4, consisting of my female cousin, male best friend, me, and Symone. Another sidenote, Symone and my best friend we’re already close friends before everyone else, like really close, I think there was even mutual feelings at one point. Anyway, moving on. The first time we all hung out, was at my house, we watched a movie in my basement and just hung out. Symone cuddled with my best friend, so did my cousin, kinda hurt. The point of talking about this, is because this is when my cousin and best friend realized they liked each other and lead to them dating soon after. This is also how I found out that Symone was dating a senior. This really didn’t hurt too bad, cuz I didn’t even feel like I had a chance at this point. We hung out every weekend after this, the start of phase 2, and she started cuddling with me, even though she had a boyfriend, which is fine she’s just a really touchy affectionate person, it wasn’t intimate or sexual or anything. The point is, we were getting closer. Our story is currently in October 2019. My best friend and cousin are dating, Symone is having relationship troubles. By the end of November, we’re all much closer of friends, talking consistently, hanging out consistently. And in December, things ended with Symone and her boyfriend. He was really fucking toxic and broke her heart really really bad. That’s important later on. The same week that she broke up with him, she texted me and asked if she could come over and watch a movie with me cuz she was sad. I had a family party so I couldn’t, but she still wasn’t looking to be with me at this point. Right before Christmas break, something very important happens, that really makes me think about the butterfly effect. Symone and my best friend were fighting/she felt hurt that he didn’t support her anymore. Things seemed to pass over the break and by the start of the second semester of sophomore year, I thought things were fine again. We’re now in January. Symone is single, I am single. Whenever we hung out, she got more and more intimate with me, putting my hands on her thighs, hugs, cuddling, falling asleep on top of me. Throughout January specifically, we started to get closer and closer. One night, we all went to a school event at a skating rink, she saw her ex and was sad. I went outside with her to tell her something unrelated about a girl in there I knew from middle school. While I was telling her she started to sob. I held her for a few minutes and talked her through it. That’s is the point where we became each other’s rocks, and had each other’s backs. Fast forward, it’s the end of January/ Start of February (can’t remember). We all want to hang out, but she says she has “family stuff”. I immediately know somethings up so I question further but hey dry responses. She tells me that she’s really mad at my best friend cuz he’s being an asshole to her lately. At this point, me and him have drifted and I’m now closer to Symone. That night, me and her talk for literally 12 hours non stop. Discussing random stuff and also helping her get through fight with my friend. That same night, I’m about to get in the shower, I see a thing on her snap story. It’s one of those things that you snap back for and they fill in the blanks of stuff. I reply to the story and say “dude what is this, middle school?” She says “haha, I know I just felt like it idk” a few minutes later I get a filled out version for my name. The last blank is “Have I Ever Liked You”. She puts “yup”. I’m just remaining calm at this point and I say, “haha last one, L to you”. She says “yeah that ones current”. I’m shocked. But also I guess there was signs of interest and I’m just dumb. Instead of responding with words, I send her a filled back one for her name and put “yup, also current” for the last blank. This is the beginning of phase 3. Things love insanely fast after this. It’s literally like a month and a half but feels so much longer. After this, we get really really intimate when we hang out, and start acting like a couple, not really there yet but also out of the like talking phase. Pretty quickly tho, things get worse. After like a week of this, she randomly says “we can’t date right?” on Snapchat. I just respond all confused and ask her to explain what she means. Here’s what she says. “Like we can’t/shouldn’t date right? We’re really good friends, and I don’t wanna lose that, after my last relationship, I learned not to date friends because you’ll walk away with less than you started with.” I’m like okay, but the problem is, she doesn’t stop acting all loving and intimate. I’m not okay with it at first, but soon she acts like she wants a relationship again, so I’m back in. Things moved really fast in the past 3 weeks. First, we get sexually intimate when I put my hand under her bra. Then I start fingering her at a later date and then first kiss. It’s really weird first kiss didn’t happen earlier, I know. Anyway, we’re now basically dating, she holds my hand in the hallway, we switch classes around to be with each other, we hang out all the time, tell each other we love each other etc. More importantly than all that, we realize how similar we are and how well we get each other. She says she’s like me if I was just female and vice versa. We both really realized that we’re like soul mates and perfect for each other in every way. We have had similar struggles and trauma and both still have similar issues and life experiences and interests and passions and opinions etc. We both really need each other in our lives. Now at this point, we’re each other’s top priority and both head over heels in love. The best feeling in the world is knowing that you love someone just as much as they love you back. On her birthday weekend, the whole group comes to my house and her and my cousin are going to do their nails. Me and my best friend need something to do for like an hour while they do that, so we decide to go check out a shitty school dance that only freshman are gonna go to. I get really bad anxiety and panic attacks, and when we were there, I had a panic attack. I told her abt the panic attack, cuz she gets it, on snap to come pick us up with my sister but not to tell anyone what was going on, they came and picked us up. And she held my hand and comforted me the whole time. Then we went home and she climbed into my bed with me and just held me for a bit. I wasn’t embarrassed or freaked out, I felt so comfortable around her, and she had the ability to take away anything bad I was feeling. After she left that night, I realized how perfect we were for each other, and it became more than just physical attraction. Fast forward again, it’s March 14 2020. It’s a Saturday night. She is home alone and feeling anxious. She wants to come over, so I invite her over. We hang out in my room just cuddling, talking and kissing. I really really loved her in this moment, and she really really loved me, little did I know it would be the last of these moments. The next day, corona virus got really serious in the US and we found out our school would be cancelled. We were both really anxious about the future. I know Symone’s mind really well, cuz it’s basically the same as my mind. I know that in times of crisis, she’ll take a look at her life and reconsider a lot. I also noticed that after we hung out that last time, she seemed really distant. I kept asking if something was wrong, she said “yea just going through it, don’t wanna talk about it”. I tried a couple more times but got the same response. I was worried that it was something about me, but also the fact that she was distant sucked, cuz I was having a lot of anxiety and she’s the only person who really has ever been able to help with it. One night, it’s really late, I’m sleep deprived and going insane and I send her a really long message, I won’t include it here out of embarrassment but I’ll break down what it said. Basically: hey you seem distant, I wish you would let me help with your problems, idk what’s up w u, I really need u, life’s changing fast and I miss u and need consistency, I know you really well, so I think I know that this has to do somewhat with my role in your life,  just lemme know what’s up, bye. I’ll actually give her response, here it is. 
Her response: 
Basically, this sounds really fucking stupid but lately I’ve just been questioning how everybody and everything reacts in my life to change. Like when something big happens in my life that hurts me or makes me happy or sad or whatever strong emotion, who is there to comfort me or congratulate me or whatever the time asks for. That sounds kind of selfish in a way? But I realized the feeling I’ve been missing is a support system. And I have a lot of friends, you see me hugging people idek in the hallways. I’m an outgoing person. But other than you and my best friend [REDACTED] who I have known for legit 10 years, I don’t feel like I can open up and tell them anything. And I hardly see [REDACTED] . Maybe next year that’ll change cuz she’ll go to the same campus. Regardless, thats why these past couple days I’ve been a mess. I realized a while ago I told you I don’t really want to ever date because I like keeping my friends and my dating completely separate and I realize now that I’m fucking stupid for not doing that because if we dated and anything happened I’d lose 1/2 of all the support I feel in my life which doesn’t seem like a lot but I feel like I would just be so mentally unhealthy if I didn’t have you in my life. We kinda help each other figure shit out.
I guess the bottom line is- when it comes to dating, I’ve always gone after people that’s are.. disposable. That sounds horrible. Yikes. 
But I don’t mean as a person just disposable, I mean disposable to each other’s lives. That even if something happens and we both get hurt, we walk away with what we had. But when dating someone you feel so connected with in a best friend way, anything happens and you leave with less than you came with. You lose your support. And I’ve tried explaining this to [REDACTED] countless times and I guess she doesn’t understand what I mean so maybe you won’t either maybe I’m actually going fucking insane but I just feel like I’m not doing what I know I should be doing and I feel guilty. And I love spending time with you and telling you everything and pretty much being best friends but I know if I ever let it be more than that it’s kind of going to ruin my life and yours if anything happens and let’s be honest I’m not mentally stable enough to deal with that shit and I’m not mature enough to figure out a way to fix things once they fall apart. And I haven’t told anyone cuz I feel like what I’m saying still doesn’t make any sense and it fully might make you hate me and if it does wow that really sucks! But I owe you an explanation. I love you a lot and I still want to talk as much as we do and hang out all the time but I don’t think I can do anything more knowing I’d literally commit suicide if I didn’t have you in my life that sounds SOOO FUCKED HAHAHAHAHA but literally hello no support! Uwu! 
And I’m sorry if this makes you not want to trust me b because I know, as cocky as this sounds, that I’ve gotten you to be more open about how you feel and all of that and I don’t want you to regret that or feel like I’m fucking around or anything I just want to get everything our because if anybody can understand this mess I’m my head it’s probably you. Anyways I’m sorry this is a lot. 

I responded and told her that what she was saying made sense, we really need each other and we shouldn’t jeopardize having each other’s backs. I still loved her and wanted to be close and that she could talk to me about anything, and shouldn’t just keep it all bottled up. I don’t blame you for leading me on, cuz I know you had real feelings too, I just wish you conveyed that earlier on and didn’t get as intimate ig. 
I lied.

Her next response:
We do be understanding each other on a weird level. But that’s like exactly my point. Even [REDACTED] who I’ve know for 10 years hasn’t been able to understand me on the level you do. That’s why it’s really important to me that we stay in a really close friend relationship. I really don’t think you meet enough people that understand you this well to risk losing them like that. I fully agree that I got carried away sometimes and should’ve stopped myself from being too touchy, and I know a lot of the times I felt guilty after. Idk why. But I also don’t want to ever like, feel awkward about anything or even have anything change. I know that’s also a lot to ask for and if you don’t want that too I completely understand but I hope we can stay the same way and be just as close as before, just not- intimate ig?

Ughhhhhh. That’s all I felt for a bit. What I really felt, was that her logic made no sense, we care about each other too much and understand each other too well for anything to go wrong. No matter what, we would be able to stay close. Also, what contention could happen in a relationship that couldn’t happen in a friendship. It’s funny because ironically her fear of losing me is what makes me feel more distant. I don’t get her logic at all. And I wish she would just have never dated the guy before me cuz he fucked her up so bad she can’t trust me. We’re literally soulmates, she said that, she felt that, she told me she loved me. I think a lot of the lyrics of Leray by Trippie Redd are pretty accurate to my thoughts. 
-
“Good to not be you
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
""I thought you was married to the single life"", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit”
-
Yeah, I guess that’s all. I’m just really struggling and wanna hear what people think. No specific question, just advice. If there is a question, I guess it’s should I just get over her or should I try and get her back into that role in my life? Anything helps, you a real one if you read this far.

181,"As the title says, I'm supposed to be moving very soon, at the end of this month. Partner and one dog coming with. This move was set in motion before all the covid-19 stuff blew up, and everything's already paid off -- our utilities are scheduled for transfer on our move-in date, our current landlady has a new tenant moving in a couple days after we go, and so on. I don't think we could realistically backtrack on this, not only for financial reasons and everything mentioned above, but staying here would also be a worse idea, in my opinion. The new place would be a lot more manageable and comfortable for the three of us in any situation, but especially right now, I don't want to be stuck in a tiny upstairs apartment if things get more serious. I'm pretty sure we'll be able to make the move, but certain details are still up in the air, and it's very stressful, so hopefully some of you kindly Reddit folk can offer some nuggets of advice.   


I think my number one concern is that we have a lot of large furniture which is going to be difficult to move. Optimistically I had been planning to hire a moving service if we decided to keep it all, but that's not exactly a good idea at this point. I'm not married to the idea of keeping it and having to move it ourselves -- nor could we possibly fit it in our car -- so any ideas would help. If it helps to know, re: local charity donation possibilities, laws against dumping etc, we are in New Mexico.  
Beyond that, it's just a matter of how far \*intending\* to move is really going to get us if everywhere ends up in a more severe lockdown situation. What if we can't move everything during our move-out/move-in window? What if we can, but the utilities company isn't sending people out by our-move in date and we have no water/heat/electricity? I'm sure there are other important problems to account for, but my brain's pretty anxiety-fried so I'll leave it at that and if anyone has anything to add, please do.

We were making out on her bed and her leg was over me and my hand was on her ass. We stopped for a minute and were talking super close face to face when we heard her mom said “wake up. Wake up.” While snapping her fingers. We don’t know how much she saw either. I had to leave her house bc her mother told me I was allowed until 11:30 and it was exactly that time. My girlfriend and I were extremely embarrassed and we didn’t even leave the room for 5 minutes because we had no clue what to say or do and we were trying to think about how much she saw. I apologized to my girlfriend and left her house and headed straight to the neighborhood dog park about a block down the road, where I FaceTimed her and started writing this post, that’s where I am now.

185,"so I was in a relationship, it was rocky tbh. just wasnt the greatest time for both of us personally and it messed up.

I personally took the time to reflect and I know I was extremely bad in the last few months of the relationship and I've worked on myself ever since, but my question is...
would it be ok for me to say to myself that I was in fact a good boyfriend, although the last few months I wasnt the majority of the relationship I personally feel I was really good. idk it's just a late night thought and I'm really confuses about it

189,"I’ve been holding off of posting this for while incase it came across as weird or creepy 

For a very long time I’ve not had a mother figure in my life, my mother died years ago nor did I grow up with an older sister.

I tend to get really attached to people (not in a creepy, stalkerish romantic way) that show any motherly caring traits towards me, it was a conversation I had with a friend last week that helped me figure this out.

In 2015/16 I grew attached to one of my friends who was 2 year older than me who acted like a big sister, I really bonded with this person we had a lot in common, if I spent longer than 10 minutes out of class they’d come and make sure I was alright, they dragged me away from toxic people, I remember one time something was really impacting on me and she gave me an ultimatum crying and gave me the longest hug when I chose the right thing I couldn’t stop thinking about my friend they days we were off on breaks I eventually detached and I felt empty 

In November 2018 I grew attached to someone who’d sit with me, help me with my work there was one time I was ill my stomach was burning and they came out sat with me, gave me money to get a cold drink and took me to speak to someone. When I first met them I wasn’t too keen on them they’d offer to help me and I’d say no but they never gave up trying to help me, they helped me through various panic attacks and other issues. They’d come up and speak to me if they saw me sitting alone, I trusted them enough to open up and they gave such good advice But if they’d act the slightest bit off with me it would really impact my mood, make me think I’ve done something or they just don’t like me. I’d think about them a lot, again not in a romantic way It took me up until February this year to fully detach myself and I was a huge relief I sat there and thought “what was so special about this person”

Recently I’m becoming attached to someone who’s helped me out of a shitty relationship, will be really strict with me especially when it comes to work, they show almost every trait my mum had. 

I’m getting so tired of getting attached it’s like an endless cycle I think  all I want is a mother figure, I’m not even sure that’s why I get attached to people I know this isn’t normal?",21Mar2020,1

191," From AZ.

The title says it all. I developed a minor cough on Tuesday this week and informed my boss. We agreed that I should stay home to be cautious and provide updates (a co-worker's wife is immunocompromised). I've done that so far. No fever, just a cough. Now it escalated up the chain and higherups are demanding that I get tested and provide a definitive result, lest they shut down the site. I have not come in contact with someone diagnosed, and I have not traveled. My cough has not developed any further. I've told them all this already. They haven't budged.

So now I have to go to urgent care and try to convince the doctors to give me a test that they don't have many of. And I fear that this will put me at a much higher risk of coming in contact with someone who may indeed have the illness.

What should I do to avoid infection in an urgent care waiting room?

If I'm ever in a group with her and her other friends, I am usually excluded from the conversation. She will often hang out with friends about a five minute walk from me and if I happen to ask to hang out while she is there she says no, but if she is hanging out with me she won't hesitate to walk over to hang out with other people with me (even if i don't really want to). Some of the people she hangs out with are transphobic, and I am ftm transgender, so I am worried her opinions have changed because of them and that is why she is drifting away from me.

194,"I dated somebody for almost a year. We ended back in December.
During this year, they cheated 3 times. (That I know of at least).

1. They texted a girl they knew and would send her money constantly, flirt, and try to move her in. I didn't know until I checked his phone and found it. He told me ""I couldn't even tell she was flirting!"" Then texted her stating he had a girlfriend and stopped talking to her. I went back to him.

2. This past December I decided to ask him to check his phone randomly. He INSTANTLY said ""NO ITS MINE"" and refuuuuused.
I cried. I begged. Not to mention his phone was on my phone plan so I tried pulling the ""I EVEN HELPED PAY FOR THE PHONE""
eventually he opened up and told me he was blackmailed by some guy and was forced to do things and had no choice.
He lied about being abused essentially.
I finally got the phone from him after a solid hour and he admitted he was sexting a guy on discord the whoooole month of December. The month I thought was fine. I was shattered. I left.
He blamed mental illness and told me ""if I destroyed us, then I had a reason to kill myself"". And also ""my brain wants you to hate me. So I just do this and not think""

3. We stayed in contact til January. I was raped by an ex around the same time.
The day of the rape I messaged him for support. The SAME DAY he told me he never wanted a family with me, that LAST December during the short time we split he had sex with his ex (when I asked him for a solid year if he ever cheated on me or does weird stuff while out of town) so I found out I was lied to for a solid year. He basically told me every fucked up thing possible. Later on he cried about it saying he was just trying to make me hate him again.
When I asked about his ex, he told me everything and I just felt... lost.

Ever since then he's tried contacting me saying he will be a better person. That he will step up.
He tries to support me, etc.
However, every single night I lay awake wondering why I wasn't enough. I think AWFUL things like ""all those times he couldn't cum for me but I bet he came for her instantly""
I think about how he lied about abuse, blackmail, etc a month before I was raped. He made it seem ok to lie about that stuff.

I think about how he's so jealous over me, makes fun of my male friends, etc, but cheated. He cheated.

Why wasn't I enough?
Why is he good now?
Is he just hiding it better?
Why did he hide it for so long?
Was everything a lie?
Why.. WHY wasn't I enough?
How many other times were there?
Was it even mental illness?

I have run into this most my adult life. But when I start to get really close to someone I start to split hairs in my head and retract. It hasn't made healthy relationships impossible but certainly more difficult.

I don't consider myself a wonderful person or worth much at all, so this isn't a narcissist thing I feel. But say I crush on someone, they reciprocate it and we start dating... in a few months I start to latch onto the bad. Under their control or not. Things like ""he has too much body hair, his vernacular is a little weird sometimes, his hair gets greasy quickly"" and I just start to pull away. It's not like these things are deal breakers, because on a concious level I can recognize I don't care. But reminding myself of that doesn't do anything and over time I start to get embarrassed by them or a little less affectionate/disgusted by them.

197,"Hi everyone, first post here. 

So my sister and her friend (both 19) were out drinking by a local reservoir around 12 last night. Let's call the friend J. J has been suicidal for a while and he got very drunk last night while they were by the water. My sister tried to drag him away from the water (we don't know if he was trying to drown himself on purpose or not) and she is covered in scrapes and bruises from trying to get him away from the water. Eventually J passed out so my sister got him situated as best she could and ran to get help. She had to drive about 10 min away to get cell service. By the time help (another friend) came about 20 min later, and they drove the 10 min back to the water, they couldn't find J by the water where she left him. They looked in the nearby woods, thinking he had come to and wandered away, but eventually found him face down in the water about 12 feet out. Authorities came and retrieved the body. 

Some things to note:
1- she didn't call the cops initially because she didn't realize the danger of the situation and didn't want to get in trouble for underage drinking. She just needed help getting J up and in the car.
2- she is safe and not injured past the scrapes and bruises
3- she is seeing a crisis counselor tomorrow morning
4- we are not judging her for what happened. She did all she could. I just want help with knowing how to help her. 
5- she and J dated a few years back. His last coherent words to her were ""I still love you"" and there was a polaroid of them in his wallet. She is very hurt and heartbroken.
6- yes some mistakes were made. They can't be fixed now. Please don't judge them. What happened has happened.
7- J's family is not angry at her and are not pressing charges. J's home was broken and he was couch hopping after being kicked out a while back. He had a hard life and turned to drugs and alcohol after he and my sister broke up a few years back.

and he just doesn’t do that and never takes ownership for failing to do that, always projects onto me, and blames me for reasons why he hasn’t personally done this.

That’s irrelevant and there’s no reason to withhold building up trust personally. I wouldn’t let anything get in the way of this, if I were in his shoes. He always has excuses.

We’re very similar people, he’s an emotion-driven person similar to myself, so this makes no sense… we are both INFP’s actually.

202,"So, long story short, I grew up in a very unstable and neglectful family.  I felt very alone for most of my life and suffered sexual and psychological abuse.  

I knew I had to get out of there, so I studied hard and I was able to start college at 16 tthrough a program my state has.  I moved into the dorms then, just after the first semester of my sophomore year of high school.  I was the only minor who lived in the dorms there.  I did great for the first semester, but I fell into a deep depression after that. I felt lost without familial or social support and felt alienated in my college thanks to my age.  I had dealt with issues with my mental health my whole life, having been to the mental hospital 4 times, but I had never felt so alone.  Nevertheless, I made it through and just last year transferred to a different college and finally moved into my own apartment.  I officially graduated from high school last May when I transferred (was getting dual credits), so I've been out of high school for about a year now.  

I feel so lost in life, having lost out on my last two and a half years of high school.  It was my decision to leave high school early, but I felt like it was what I had to do to get out of what was happening to me.  I live with my partner now (thank god for her), but I don't have any friends.  I live in a new city, and I like it here, but it's often scary and so intimidating. 

How can I stop wanting to get my high school years back?  I feel like I need to grow up and move on with my life, but I feel so alone in the world and terrified of graduating college next year.  How can I know where I'm going?  How can I build social connections that'll get me somewhere?  How can I be an adult without having any role models to show me how?",21Mar2020,1

205,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I [21F] met him [21M] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break. First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",21Mar2020,1

207,"So, long story short, I grew up in a very unstable and neglectful family.  I felt very alone for most of my life and suffered sexual and psychological abuse.  

I knew I had to get out of there, so I studied hard and I was able to start college at 16 tthrough a program my state has.  I moved into the dorms then, just after the first semester of my sophomore year of high school.  I was the only minor who lived in the dorms there.  I did great for the first semester, but I fell into a deep depression after that. I felt lost without familial or social support and felt alienated in my college thanks to my age.  I had dealt with issues with my mental health my whole life, having been to the mental hospital 4 times, but I had never felt so alone.  Nevertheless, I made it through and just last year transferred to a different college and finally moved into my own apartment.  I officially graduated from high school last May when I transferred (was getting dual credits), so I've been out of high school for about a year now.  

I feel so lost in life, having lost out on my last two and a half years of high school.  It was my decision to leave high school early, but I felt like it was what I had to do to get out of what was happening to me.  I live with my partner now (thank god for her), but I don't have any friends.  I live in a new city, and I like it here, but it's often scary and so intimidating.  I don't talk to my dad; he hasn't contacted me in years.  My mom is a paranoid schizophrenic and her disorder rules her life; though I don't live with her anymore, she has never taken care of me.  If anything, I have had to take care of her.  

I feel so, so alone.

How can I stop wanting to get my high school years back?  I feel like I need to grow up and move on with my life, but I feel so alone in the world and terrified of graduating college next year.  How can I know where I'm going?  How can I build social connections that'll get me somewhere?  How can I be an adult without having any role models to show me how?",21Mar2020,1
208,"I was out walking my dogs at 8pm. It was dark and I had forgotten my phone, which I never do. I thought, “it’s fine, nothing ever happens.”

I was walking down a street when I saw some teenagers riding bikes and heard them saying “Are you an adult. This guy is following me.”

I don’t know why, but I thought they were joking around. Most kids in my neighborhood do that. But then I realized that they were serious, and that they were asking a woman standing outside of her house. 

I walked past the kids, the woman, and the van that had been following them. I was scared and without my phone so I didn’t stop to help. 

I felt bad about walking right through what was happening, so I turned back and watched to make sure the kids were okay. I saw the van drive off after the kids received help from the woman. 

I went home, called the police, and drove around to see if I could find the van. I couldn’t. I saw a police car but I don’t think they found the van either. 

I drove around my neighborhood and ended up finding a house with a similar van parked outside of it. I don’t know if I’m just seeing what I want to see. I don’t know what to do. 


TL;DR. I witnessed boys being chased by a van getting help from a woman, was too scared to help, went home called 911, drove around and found a van parked at a house. Don’t know what to do.",21Mar2020,1
209,"Hi all, apologizing ahead of time for typos bc I'm on my phone. Also this is a throwaway because I don't want my roommates figuring out I'm talking about them online. This is gonna be long because I really need advice here.

Anyways, so I'm sick rn. I don't know what I have but I'm fine, however I am in a state with a fair amount of cases of coronavirus. I talked to my doctor and she advised I isolate myself in my room and only go out into the rest of the apartment to cook my meals. However, I have been sick since I was in Florida with my roommates 2 weeks ago, and they all said that if they were going to get sick with what I had they already would have gotten it. So cool, I'm still living in the rest of my apartment, which is nice because I'm living with 2 of my best friends and it's a very pleasant environment in here.

I'm a hypochondriac and my roommates know this - I think anytime I express any sort of concern about health issues they discard it as my irrational worryings and don't take me fully seriously. They seem to be of the camp of ""if we get it we get it, and it's not like any of us are in contact with any old people anyways"". Trust me, I know it's a dangerous mindset.

For example, they had a friend over the other day (already something I wouldn't do, I stayed in my room anyways because I was feeling particularly unwell at that moment) and the first thing they do when she arrives is they *hug* her, and then proceed to all sit on the same couch to watch movies. This was within the last 3 days, and they know about the existence of the concept of social distancing. 

A second example is that today we went grocery shopping (I know I shouldn't have gone, I wore a mask and used hand sanitizer profusely) and I didn't touch anything except the things I was buying for fear of germ transfer, while they were walking around touching all sorts of stuff with their hands not seeming to give too much thought to it.

The day after that first example happened I told them I wasn't really comfortable with the fact they had this friend over and got so close to her, and I said I would like it if they sterilized the room and themselves before and after they had guests if they continued to have people over. They responded saying that ""we all (us and the guest they had over) live in the same apartment building so it's not like she's an outsider"" and ""this is already such a miserable time, we don't want to stress out more than we have to"". I got too upset and had to leave the room to calm myself down. We have since made up, but I don't think my point has gotten across about the importance of this stuff. I belive we each have a moral obligation to fight this and I'm unsure if they feel the same way.

So, in conclusion, what can I say to get through to my roommates and get them to take this more seriously, and how would I say it? It is a very tough situation because we are all, as I said, best friends, and I don't want to push them away with asking then to act a certain way that might not even make a difference. To that end, should I even bother pushing for this? Is it worth the struggle?

210,"So about a year ago my friend developed an obsession with our school principal. She would often wonder what the principal looked like having sex or without clothes. It was far beyond anything a student should be thinking about their principal. For a while, I decided just to ignore it. It was just a phase that would shortly end... right? Fast forward to a year later... she still has the obsession and it’s grown to be much worse than before. It’s as if we can’t have a conversation about anything BUT the principal. She doesn’t want to be seen with me when the principal is near because i’m an ""embarrassment"" When we got word that all the schools closed due to COVID-19, she was in tears because she never had her ""moment"" with the principal. Sometimes she’ll even take home items the principal touches... I don’t even want to know what she does with them. If the principal goes so far as to walk into a room, my friend turns BRIGHT red and BURSTS into tears of what she says are joy. I’m having a hard time understanding her. I even cut all contact with her (For other reasons, but this obviously being a big factor) I was hoping this post may lead me to some answers... or at least some ideas of what to do? I’m pretty stuck.

Oh, I forgot to mention... this girl also sleeps with a baby noice maker, stuffed animals, etc! (Keep in mind, we are seniors in high school) There’s nothing wrong with doing things like this out of comfort, but it honestly makes me pretty embarrassed to be seen with her. Does that make me the bad person? 

Well thanks for the advice! :)",21Mar2020,1
211,"I learned today that I’m having an early miscarriage (I didn’t know I was pregnant). I’m in college pursuing a career in medicine and, while it’s always been my dream to be a mom, definitely can’t have a kid right now. Despite this, I’m remarkably sad about this loss and I don’t know why. My partner has been comforting about the physical symptoms (this shit HURTS), but can’t quite understand the emotional ones to be of help. 

I’m usually pretty logical when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I don’t think I’ll be able to logic my way out of how I feel right now. I didn’t know I was pregnant till I lost the pregnancy. I could’ve easily never known I was pregnant. If I hadn’t had the miscarriage, I likely would’ve had to get an abortion. Despite not feeling connected to this child, I feel extremely sad about losing it. 

Does anyone know why i might be feeling this way? Is there some weird pregnancy hormone that makes pregnancy loss hard on the brain? Am I more connected to this child than I give myself credit for?",21Mar2020,1
213,"I used to be so motivated. I had big dreams coming out of high school. My ultimate goal was, and maybe still is dental school. To get there, I thought I had to go to the biggest and ""best"" school I could get into and major in biology or another related science because that's what pre-health students do, right?

Anyway, I did well academically freshman year, GPA &gt;3.85. I thought I needed a challenge, so I transferred to my state's flagship school, which is well known for its science programs. Long story short, I am in way over my head and it has been very hard for me.

I transferred in sophomore year and was immediately met with classes that were beyond anything I had expected in terms of difficulty. I had a much lower GPA than I was used to that first semester. The second semester was a little better, but still not great. Then came junior year. 

The first semester was very difficult. I was only taking 13 credits, but it was all science classes (except for military science, I'm in ROTC also). Because of commitments for ROTC that I have this upcoming summer, the only time I could take the DAT (dental school admission test) was this last winter. That meant I had to study for the DAT all of first semester in addition to a very science-heavy course load. That semester broke me mentally, physically, and emotionally. I was having serious doubts about wanting to go to dental school because I knew that it would be even more intense than that and that I wasn't ready for it. All the time management skills I had been trying to build over the years seemed to fade away and left me in ruin. I wasn't working out on my own, wasn't eating right, and was obsessing over school in an unhealthy way.

The DAT ended up okay. I got a better score than I thought, but the semester had still left its mark. Studying my butt off for a mediocre GPA and an okay DAT score and still having an entire semester to go until the application cycle is a lot to handle mentally. I thought it would be better because the DAT was over with, but I was wrong. I am still miserable and very uncertain about my future. I am currently in some science classes that I thought I could handle I have not done very well on the exams so far. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed, so overwhelmed that I have effectively stopped going to extracurriculars and I haven't shadowed or done any healthcare volunteering all year. I can't even think of why I ever wanted to go to dental school in the first place. I don't even know why I ever loved science so much.

Lately, I have been doubting myself even more, so I have been looking into other options in case I fail to get into dental school. Graduate school is something I have considered in the past, so I have been looking at some of them. But as I've searched, I realized something: why am I doing this? Why do I feel the need to go on to more schooling if I am feeling miserable? Why do I feel this pressure to obtain a terminal degree in something I might not even enjoy doing? I don't even know if I'm cut out for research, the only ""experience"" I have is in lab classes. Because of this, I started looking at jobs.

The job market for biology majors is not that good. The most I would be good for is a research assistant job at some biotech company. It probably wouldn't be too bad of a gig, but the pay doesn't look great. I try not to make things about the money, but money is a harsh reality and I'll have to pay for rent and food somehow.

I have been pretty depressed thinking about my future, not like clinically depressed, but more of a general feeling of inadequacy with myself and my inability to decide what I want to do right now. I know I'm young and I have plenty of time, but that time will be gone before I know it and I don't want to waste my life wondering what could have been.

So, is there anyone else out there that feels like this? Is there anyone else who has been through this and can give me advice, one last bit of hope before the end of the semester?

TL;DR: I am a pre-health student torn between dental school, grad school, or full-time work. I am very overwhelmed by life and need some help.",21Mar2020,1
214,"Hey reddit, thank you for listening first of all. 

Long story short, my wife cheated on me, we split, and my biggest insecurity is my teeth. My teeth weren’t as bad as they are now when we first met. As a kid, I was homeless a lot, never had insurance, or even a toothbrush most of the time, and my front teeth all are black on the top half (top set of teeth, halfway down are black). I used to be able to hide this, but now it’s very hard as they are getting worse. I brush my teeth daily, and it still gets worse. I’m working on getting insurance now.

The advice I’m seeking is, will opening this insecurity up, and letting everyone see my teeth by fully smiling, and never trying to really cover them up, help me overcome this?

217,"My cousin hasn't spoken to me for three months, after we had a serious discussion at the beginning of January about his mom's (my aunt's) health. For some back story, the family last saw each other before Christmas and both my mom and I noticed my aunt was acting different. She kept repeating herself and asking the same questions over and over, and also having trouble thinking of words such as 'microwave'. Fast forward to a month ago, my aunt started sending me strange messages on FB that made absolutely no sense, such as that my mom had said a bunch of things to hurt her the last time we had seen each other and that she couldn't see us anymore because of it.

I usually spoke to my cousin every day and I considered him my best friend, so I immediately messaged him about those strange messages and he had no idea what she was talking about either. Then I brought up how I thought maybe something was wrong with her, such as potential dementia. He agreed, saying he's noticed for awhile now that she's been acting like a different person, repeating herself and asking the same questions over and over, and he thinks she might get lost while driving because she's always gone a long time when she goes places now. We agreed that she probably needs checked out by a doctor. Then, mid conversation, he stopped talking and he hasn't spoke to me since, despite me messaging and texting his phone almost every day since. He doesn't even open my messages on FB, despite being online on sometimes. I've even texted him asking if I upset him and asking if he hates me, and still no reply. It doesn't matter at all what I say.

Now it's been three months and he's still going strong on ignoring me and I have no idea what to think. I even called him and left a voicemail the other day, just asking if him and my aunt are okay due to all the craziness with the virus and people hoarding supplies lately, and still radio silence. I don't know if he's just processing everything, if he's trying to ignore the entire situation by ignoring me, or I somehow did something to upset him and now he's mad at me. I don't know if I've completely lost my cousin over this and it's been really depressing me all this time. 

And honestly it might be completely selfish of me, but I don't feel like I deserve this. If he needs (more) time to process everything, or even if he's upset at me, I feel like I at the very least deserve to be told that and not just ignored like I'm a piece of trash. I'm at the point where I'm truly ready to just delete him off FB and block his number because I'm upset that he could ignore me for so long. I don't even need an entire conversation, nor do we even need to talk about my aunt's health issues, I'd just like to know if they're doing okay and if he hates me.",21Mar2020,1

So this is kinda gonna be a wall of text but i will try to format it, this is a long one.

For some context, I am 16 years old and i live with my mom and dad. My parent's have never had a ""stable"" relationship. Their has been constant lying, cheating, and fighting but they do still get along most of the time. Their not shitty people and they are great parents and have done everything for me. I have a good home situation aside from this.

Tonight they got into a fight because my mom's ex-boyfriend died, and then their is some deeper problems that mostly have to due with finances, and they didn't not get truly physical aside from little shoves, but the screaming and insults is much. Today i just fucking broke, for around 2 hours i did nothing but cry, from little tears to sobbing. I can't take it anymore. I have asked my mom and dad to stop drinking, and my mom somewhat has, but my dad has not, and he becomes a asshole when drunk. I constantly ask him, beg him to stop. It just does not seem like he cares anymore. He acts like a fucking thug and a criminal, which i guess makes sense because he has been in and out of prison, but he never went in for violent stuff, only financial stuff. They get along most the time but every night it occasionally happens. I can't fucking take it, i just wan't to turn 18, go to college, and not have to worry anymore. This shit happens like twice a week.

I don't know what to do anymore, i'm close to fucking breaking, that is what i do know. I have to at all times only have one earphone on, so i can hear them in case they start fighting. If they start fighting i don't want to leave the house and go to the pool to chill, i don't even want to go to my bedroom because i'm afraid things will get physical, which they will. I don't play/talk to my friends sometimes because i know they may fight. I always worry when they leave because i know they are gonna drink. Each time i hear them talking i go out of my bedroom to ensure they do not start. I don't workout because they may start fighting or it may get physical. I can't do schoolwork, which is especially gonna suck because of the quarantine. I don't like going with them anywhere, or doing anything.

I don't wanna leave because i wanna make sure my dog is fine and safe and that they aren't doing anything that could harm her at all. I have a office, pool, marina, beach, and gym at my complex but i don't wanna use them to cool down, because i wanna make sure nothing really bad happens. I have constant anxiety when i'm not home, aside from a trip to Boston recently where i did not worry. I'm worried my dad may break shit when hes drunk and angry. It's getting a point where i'm stop giving a fuck. If they wanna kill each, fine, i don't about to not give a fuck. Everyday when i come home from school i'm worried if my dad is drinking or not. Each time they do legit anything, even just grocery shopping i'm worried hes gonna drink.

I just do not know what to do anymore. I can't keep going, i am close to running away, finding a way to emaciated, going into the foster system, or not giving a fuck and letting them go at it, physically. I just want some tips or something, anything to help me out here.",21Mar2020,1

It used to be where it would just be cold and i know I’m sweating  there but now every it’s to the point where it’s soaking wet. I’m extremely embarrassed because you can smell it sometimes. If I can smell it the people can. And it’s just a very uncomfortable cold and soaked feeling. So my mom knows about this and I told her how worse it got and she got me a expressive deodorant to fight my sweaty armpits and it still don’t help. It lessened the soaking wet which I’m happy for but i would have to re apply it 5 times a day. That’s too much going to the bathroom to do. I think I have a problem. What can I do? I’m crying now because it’s a problem for me",21Mar2020,1

I asked her to video chat the other night (before hand) and she said she couldnt that her parents where sleeping. Lmfao went to her story 3 mins later and see screenshots of her acting cute on facetime with the douche from cali. Now the douche from cali is hitting me up with false info.. But i mean whatever. She said i was good for her and she was afraid of that. Also we dated a year ago but she cheated like 3 times. Idk why i do this to myself. I cut her off.. she still hasnt deleted the posts of us or deleted the highlight she made for me. If not done by tomorrow im gonna ask her to.

226,"Wanted to give a heads up that this deals with heavier situations/topics.


So, when i was around the age of 12 or 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression. The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.
So, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.

One I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm question if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.

I have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room to apply it.
Well, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.

I was too confused and dazed to really do anything because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.

She was a female nurse, very sweet, but this memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted because it didn't seem or feel right. 

I'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it. I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away.",21Mar2020,1
227,"So a little bit of back story, I have a huge crush on my best friend (she knows she’s known since before we became close) so recently I moved schools (again) but I was even more devastated than last time (I left that school, then came back the following year) I was so devastated because all the relationship I had build would soon promise to fade away, but I promise my self that I wouldn’t let that happen again with the girl again, so we texted and FaceTime on the daily. But one day my parents had checked my phone and had read that a couple of months ago me and a couple of friends got sent to the office, because my crush (let’s call her Claire) had made a mistake. I’m not going into detail of that incident tho. But my mom and stepdad asked everything of what happened and that’s when the hatred started. My mom and Step dad would call her a whore and shit like that. I didn’t wanna tell Claire but I also didn’t wanna keep a secret between us. Flash forward a couple of months I want to go to the park with Claire, they say no. Which kinda pissed me off, they don’t know Claire like I do, that was the only time she had ever gotten in trouble and my parents use that to criticize her, call her a whore, say she’s using me. But me and Claire still talk and FaceTime. One day, after some drama between my ex best friend and me, which Claire helped to get us to stop butting heads, my Stepdad texted my mom to tell me to block Claire. I look at my mom and say “no she is my friend, I am not blocking her I deserve a choice to choose who
I hang out with.” My mom was on my side for once but said I can never hang out with Claire again, and that I have to talk to her in secret or my step dad will destroy my phone. But I have a huge crush on this girl still, and I’m pretty sure she likes me too but I want to hangout with her and show her that we can be together while I’m different schools, what should I do!

228,"I'm in my 30's, with a beautiful and loving wife and the most amazing little 7 month old the world has ever known.  I met my wife helping a friend in NYC with his startup, and unbeknownst to me, like my grandfather, I fell in love someone who was not a US citizen.  I only mention this because it helps to define my situation a little more.  Long story short, in order for us to stay in the US together, she would be bound to the US, without being able to work, while we had to save an extra $5,000 for her to apply for a marriage green card.  At that time I thought how fortunate I was, knowing if I saved enough and worked extra hours this could be done, and I was glad to do it.  It took nearly a year from marriage for her to get her green card and be allowed to work again, which happened just earlier this year!

 I'm also a son, to two parents who both need help; my dad who worked his whole entire life as a truck driver, is my hero.  It took me until college to realize this; that this man spent his best years on the road missing his children grow up so we could have a decent life... I regret I wasn't kinder to him growing up but I guess that's what happens when you get older; your ability to understand grows.  My mother, born handicap... worked hard raising us, and throughout her struggles always showed me just how independent and hard working she could be.  Now... with all the kids away and my father in rehab do we understand just how much father time has withered her ability to take care of herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also a healthcare worker, more specifically a respiratory therapist.  I have done nearly everything, from nebulizers and MDIs to emergent intubations and CPR, I've worked in Adult ICUs with nearly 20 Ventilators to myself, and I've also worked in Neonatal and Pediatric ICUs, saving lives and improving outcomes by consulting with doctors when I see ways for improvement.   In this time of unequivocal need in the world for us I struggle to find the answers to many questions I'm currently being confronted with.  You see, respiratory therapy has a somewhat complicated application in healthcare, as we are very often grossly underutilized in relation to our knowledge base.  I'll try my best to refrain from bias and keep this as short as possible; but I believe it stems from two main things: Nurses being overworked in most of these healthcare facilities, and lack of understanding towards respiratory therapy.  As a result, Respiratory Therapists often find themselves doing mundane tasks, like Incentive Spirometers and Nebulizers, and in numbers akin to what one would think of if we were assembly line workers.  Instead of spending our time really able to focus on our patients, truly helping them with their respiratory disease processes, or going over critical labs and charts, ventilator readings etc... and to work with care teams in optimizing outcomes.  I say this not to belittle how things are, but to try to explain the wide spectrum that exists in how respiratory therapy is and can be applied, which I hope will help others in understanding my predicament.  

&amp;#x200B;

At my current facility, I have a short contract, that ends in a few weeks.  Yes, we have suspected COVID-19 cases, and yes, I've been assigned each night as the only RT on that floor.  From day 1, we didn't have the appropriate equipment.  I still havn't been fit tested for their n-95s.  The changing area they setup has both those exposed to the Coronavirus who are leaving for work and those who are just coming in both changing together.  I am given a faceshield for a papr I am told must be used every shift until it breaks, (some areas of which can not be wiped down for sterilization as per their instruction) which to me is a major weak spot for infection.  I have a workroom that is right outside the hot zone that people from the hotzone frequent without changing garments.  I see blatant non sterilization or the papr equipment after use in suspected patient's rooms.  For all of this risk... what do they have me doing?  Why am I risking exposure?  To give them one medication, their albuterol inhalers. Something just a week ago the nurses were doing.  Now you may ask why do I find this to be a problem?  1.  Why add an extra staff and risk exposure for a medication that previously was given by other staff who are comfortable giving it.  We all have a job to do, without a doubt; however if shit really hits the fan and you're down much needed staff because of this that will be a big problem.  My facility was short 10 positions months ago;  when this area gets going every.single.person.will.matter.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you all made it this far, thank you.  I'm sure I rambled a bit, and I'm sure I'll get flack for something.  In the end I do want to make a difference, but I don't want to be taken out during the pre-season if you know what I mean.  I have voiced my concern to the supervisor here and he displayed feelings of being powerless.

As to my question...

1.  Should I leave my current job and work somewhere else?

If I get sick this next week or two giving inhalers... I risk making my wife and child sick, I risk my mother getting sick or having no one who can help take care of her... I risk myself getting sick... and if I get sick who pays for my hospital stay(If I get sick, it won't be because I wasn't following their policy, it will be because they could not properly protect me)?  If I get sick now I risk not being there for the patients when they need me the most.  My job is to take care of others... but it is also the Hospital system's job to be prepared and give us adequate communication and a comprehensible plan.  After all this blows over I hope the world will see these top board members and  CEOs who were getting bonuses whilst not ensuring they had proper supplies for disasters.  I'm willing to be reasonable, no one foresaw the magnitude and rate of the current pandemic, but at least a week or two of supplies stored offsite would have showed sufficient care and concern, yet the current place I'm working didn't even have enough supplies in January for flu season, and why?  Was it money? The CEO alone of this system made close to 2,000,000 last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards leaving, and finding another place that needs me now or in a couple weeks that are either more prepared OR have me doing something that's worth risking mine and my family's health over.  

&amp;#x200B;

Food for thought: A previous patient of mine was a WWII vet... and I asked him which branch he fought in.  He said to me he fought with the UK.  I asked him if he was from there and he said (paraphrased) ""No, but the we couldn't get it in our head this war needed to be fought, so I left for England while they were taking their sweet old time.""  I'm going to fight this thing, but sometimes it might be better to join forces with someone else on the same side.",21Mar2020,1

230,"My parents (step dad and biological mom) have been married for only two and a half years and they’ve decided to get divorced. My stepdad couldn’t handle my mom anymore and personally I don’t blame him. My moms never in a good mood so she’s always criticizing everything we do. She used to be abusive (hasn’t been since someone called child protective services on her), she puts a lot of pressure on everyone, and she relies on my stepdad too much. My stepdad makes 6 figures a year and my mom takes advantage of it. She quit her job where she was making just under 6 figures (between 80k-90k a year) because she says my stepdad can pay for everything.
Holidays, food, clothing, new electronics, house renovations, etc. Are all paid for by him. I really can’t express how scummy my mom is being about this divorce. She’s been bragging about how much money she’s gonna get and she’s trying to portray him as a bad guy. She’s also trying to convince us to cut ties with him. All of my siblings have talked privately and agreed that none of us are leaving him behind and we all want him in our lives. He’s such an amazing guy and I love him to pieces. 

When I first heard of the divorce, I wasn’t surprised to hear about it. My stepdad said he wants to take me in after the divorce is settled and I want to go with him too. The only connection I have to my mom is that she is my mom. I have an actual connection to my stepdad, him and I have a very healthy and friendly bond and I don’t want to lose it.

241,"So I’m having a mental breakdown. And my sister is the cause of this. There’s a lot of things I want to say to her but I can’t because I would be viewed as crazy or a future killer. Who knows.

But she does it in different ways. She knows I have anger problems and I don’t want to go to therapy for it I don’t feel comfortable and I will have to take meds. But I don’t want to feel like a freak and that will make me feel a whole bunch of other things. 
But she would be like “Somethings wrong with you (my name). Something is definitely wrong with you” after I have a anger episode 8/10 that someone triggers.

I (19f) started working at a new part time job in January. I worked with this guy (shift supervisor) several times and thought he was pretty cool but nothing special. About a month or so ago I worked with him a lot and began to notice how he is super nice, funny and paid more attention to me than the other supervisors. Not to mention he's the only supervisor who is even a little attractive. Not my usual type, but not bad. I thought he was a lot older than me like 27,28 but turns out he is 21 and a senior at my college (I'm a sophomore.) Even before I knew he was close to me in age I started hoping he'd be there and felt super happy and excited when he'd talk to me. Anyway, it's not like he is obviously flirting with me or giving me attention, but he is more present than other supervisors and makes jokes, talks to me and helps me out with stuff. So I got a huge crush and began kind of obsessing and checking the schedule to see if he'd be at work when I was. 

This is not the first time I've had a crush on a supervisor, btw- which is why I'm wondering if this is some crazy obsession of mine or if I just like him. But I barely know him, and we never really talk about non work stuff (besides small talk and normal things once in a while.) so part of me wonders if this is a real crush or some weird daddy issue thing.

Part of me wants to continue because it makes me glad to be going to work, but it also hurts me already and i know it won't go anywhere. But I keep thinking, maybe I should try and talk to him more and see if it goes anywhere?

A bit of context: I'm currently enrolled in one of my country's best master's degree for my field, but I'm not sure I'd be able to find a job I'd like after that. It is free, I'm already kinda settled in the city, I'm making friends and I have only a year (approximately left). 

  
I have stumbled upon a Master of Science in Luxury and that's totally what I would love to do. It is a great master's and I'd have a very interesting network afterward. However, it is very expensive (35000€ for a year and a half) so I'd have to get into a huge debt and I'd have to change countries every four months (required by the formation, I'd have to live in Paris, NY or London and Shanghai, making it even more expensive than it already is).

251,"I started a new job with a medical company and have been there for a month. Having this experience will for sure benefit me with my career path. We have many facilities and in one facility, someone was tested positive for COVID-19. Everyone at our clinic started panicking because two people from that clinic came over to ours to work. An RT asked me if I wanted to get an XR of my lungs to see if she can see anything, I agreed. At the time of this, I didn’t know we weren’t allowed to do that. 

Later on that day, I had my sweater over my face and my manager scolded at me when she saw me and said I was wrong, then called me into her office. Her and our regional manager (who was at the other clinic), sat me down and basically told me I know nothing of the corona and to stop panicking. They also told me if I didn’t want to be there, I could leave. However, they did assure me that I was wanted there and that they were doing their best to keep us safe. We don’t have a lot of face masks or gloves, we still have direct contact with patients, no gowns..so are they really doing their best? I tried to explain to them that what makes us panic more is feeling like we’re not safe here and if we are worried about the corona, to not disregard our feelings about it.

Ok so.

I am a religious, straight kid.

I try (unsuccessfully) not to fap, I am disgusted by porn, and I am uncomfortable with a lack of clothing. I also am uncomfortable with the idea of gayness. I don't have anything against gay people or anything, just thinking about it gives me a weird feeling in my stomach. This one will probably just take me time to not be uncomfortable with.

Now here's the thing. Modern society doesn't have too much modesty, and I can't fault people for that. The issue is that I get a bad feeling in my stomach when people aren't modest. How do I get rid of the feeling so that I can look at people normally without the feeling? It's really annoying to deal with, but I'm trying to get rid of it. People can do whatever they want, but how can I deal with it. Does anyone have any advice?",21Mar2020,1

263,"So I've had the displeasure of being stuck at university for 8 years. Managed to get one worthless degree in that time and I'm currently close to finishing my 2nd degree. Unfortunately, I think I may be suffering from severe burnout after all these years of study and it is manifesting quite severely.

Everything feels like a massive grind, and it takes  every fibre of my being to craft an enthusiastic facade. In reality, I just feel like an empty husk with very little left to give. I wake up and go to my uni placement and basically count down the hours until it is over. It feels like I require 3 months of straight hibernation to reset my mind and body.

Quite frankly, I gain very little enjoyment from life. I receive close to zero satisfaction from doing basically anything, other than maybe going to the gym and training. It almost feels like I'm going through the motions and I doubt my capacity to complete this degree as my resilience wanes.

I've become deeply cynical. I struggle to see any purpose to this journey. Study, work, make money, sleep, repeat, just doesn't appeal to me. The cycle seems so repetitive and boring, like I'm trapped in an endless loop.I may be irrational, but I wish I could just eject myself from the expectations and confines of society. My money is running out and I just no longer want to participate.

Cognitively, I've noted severe decline. Like my mind is always foggy. I'm slow to comprehend and process information, and my decision-making feels impaired. I've realised I'm not really cut out for my chosen career and now I'm confused. Physically, my body is constantly breaking down with sports related injuries/ phases of unexplained chronic pain. Most likely exacerbated by psychosocial stressors. 

If anyone has any advice or has overcome burnout, I'd appreciate your input? I'm only mid 20's so plenty of time to turn things around, but I fear I'll completely capitulate should this situation persist. Most mental health options seem like such poor band aid solutions i.e. mindfulness, medications etc. I've seen counsellors/ psychologists but have overall not been overly impressed with their approaches.

267,"Hi, I'm an 18-year-old female senior about to head to university/college overseas (fingers crossed that the coronavirus alleviates). My dad comes from a somewhat wealthy family in California. My grandma owns a ton of bottles of alcohol (specifically wine--her entire basement is a wine cellar) and has encouraged us to take sips since we were three, saying that early exposure of alcohol prevents alcohol dependency. My dad shares a somewhat similar mindset, and my mom thinks it's okay to try alcohol once you're around 16. The only difference between my immediate family and my extended family is that we struggle financially. During really tough periods (which are more often than not these days), my dad consumes around four+ cans of beer. My mom's not as bad with the alcohol, but she gets really frightening and violent.

My sister grew up thinking that drinking alcohol was normal. Over the winter, my gma introduced her to champagne and my sister loved it. Once we arrived back home from vacation, my sister started asking for champagne at home. My mom was kinda iffy about it (having come from an Asian family against alcohol consumption), but my dad was like, ""why not,"" and started giving her some in small amounts (meaning less than a glass). Since the quarantine started, my sister started to ask for more champagne (an entire glass).

We ran out of champagne around three days ago and my sister asked my parents to buy more. My parents came home with three more bottles yesterday, and my sister had around two glasses yesterday and got pretty tipsy for the first time. She joked around, stating that ""I know that it's bad, but I think I'm going to be an alcoholic one day."" I reacted negatively and criticized her, while my parents chuckled, my mom lightly teasing her (""oh, that's not going to happen, honey).

I'm more concerned about the fact that I'm leaving soon. Though none of us are diagnosed, I suspect that my family is stricken with a variety of mental disorders, which makes the periods of financial difficulties worse (i.e. my mom threatens to leave the house all the time, tells us that she's going to divorce my dad/replace herself with a different mom, and has severe mood swings, my dad cries and gets in a severe depressive mood where he can't get out of bed, and my sister mentioned that she was suicidal). I worried that during that time, my sister will start depending on alcohol.

My family, at times, is amazing. I am aware that this post paints them in a negative picture, but I would never wish for a different family. They support us, protect us, and make us laugh. But they're also crap at times too. I just want to do anything I can to prevent my sister from becoming an alcoholic. Any advice?",21Mar2020,1
268,"My girlfriend moved one town over after running away and we’ve been keeping in touch for a while and apparently she crashed with one of her ex’s, who she is now sleeping with. He texted me one day on his phone after seeing me text her, he sent me the usual “You need to stop texting (girlfriends name)” along with some threats. I asked him why I needed to stop, he said it was because she was his girlfriend. I explained the situation to him and he was actually very understanding and apologetic. She’s been trying to text me for about a week now and I’ve just been ignoring her. Then she learned that I found out about the cheating and got mad at me because she believes it’s my fault that she’s cheating on me because I didn’t want to have sex with her (for context I’m 17 and she’s 16 and I’m personally not ready for sex). As soon as she accused me of what happens I immediately ceased all contact with her. Since then 2 girls had asked me out, one of which was just trying to make me feel better while the other was a girl I actually really like, but after the whole incident I couldn’t bring myself to say yes. I just don’t know how to get out of this “funk” I’m in.

271,"ok so this is a little personal

  
My high school experience has not been the best. For the majority of the time, I have always felt left out and just really really alone. While I do have some ""friends"", they are more like acquaintances. Throughout high school, I've never really made any close friends at all, no one that I can truly trust or confide in. Many of my ""friends"" already have their own friend groups and I always feel like I'm the third wheel, an outsider, a while I have tried to make attempts at trying to grow closer, whether that be learning about sports, or helping people with hw, or learning about a new field, I've failed to make any connection to anyone at all. And I'm not gonna lie it really hurts sometimes, not having anyone to rely on and has lead to some dark thoughts and insecurities, like whether I'm that shallow of a person or am just a loner who is incapable of making true friendships.  
Fortunately, I'm going to college soon and can put that all behind me, but I really don't want to make the same mistakes and have a similar experience to that of high school.

272,"I didn’t want to make this but I just wanted some advice. 

So here’s a scenario, I have an online friend let’s call em Ms. C, I play with her late at night and we have a good time (at least I do) and play maybe for like 2-3 hours. After that Ms. C would say that she feels sleepy/tired and wants to go to bed. It’s late at night and I understand so I don’t think much of it. I still have some energy left in me so I messaged another friend, let’s call em Mr. L. I ask Mr. L if they wanted to play, he said that he’s going to play with Ms. C tonight. I was confused and said,  “huh? She told me she’s going to bed cause she was tired.”  Mr. L replied with, “really? that’s odd she said wanted to play with me tonight.” I’d message Ms. C and ask if she’s actually going to sleep, I get no response. After this I just thought it was a little weird but I just shrugged it off that night. The next day at around the same time I’d message Ms. C and ask to play. She’d tell me that she’s tired from work and doesn’t feel like playing. I understood so I just told her we can play the next day. I get told the same thing each following day. Now it’s been a couple days since we’ve played and I’ve been told by Mr. L that they’ve both played those past days. I would say, “how? that’s not true, Ms. C has been offline for 4 days and said she’s been tired from work!” “Idk bro maybe she just got bored of you and found me more entertaining?” said Mr. L. At this point I wasn’t even sure how to feel. Ms. C is a great friend of mine but just to be told lies? Is she really friend if she’s not being straight up with me? Should I confront this with her?

278,"Those Instagram filters have made it easy for us to hide our emotions. And we practice it more than often, mostly just to hide our imperfections and please others around us. However, hiding your emotions is not a good option and those filters are doing an exceptionally sloppy job.

Our feelings pile up and sooner or later we get stuck in a weird situation, a situation that makes our heart beat faster than Husain Bolt, we sweat for no reason and sometimes it even becomes hard to breathe.

This weird situation is called anxiety, our body’s natural response to stress and other uncomfortable situations but it is not just this. Anxiety is a physical state that has mental side effects (this is what people failed to understand) and as a result, 90% of people don’t know how to deal with anxiety.

1. Anxiety is a physical, biological problem. Treat it as such and don’t worry about the psychological effects.
2. Re-read point one. And then do that again.
3. You are not taking any stimulants from now on.
4. Pay attention to what you eat.
5. Exercise. Daily, until you’re tired.
6. Make good-sleep your utmost priority.
7. Learn the breathing techniques, meditation is one way to go.
8. And this one is not added in the main points but see the doc if you still haven’t found

I've found this article [7 Things you need to know and understand to avoid anxiety](https://www.wanderingpen.com/anxiety-symptoms/), that taught me these tricks. I found them useful, the article also explained the topic of anxiety in a different way. Some new lessons to learn, I never knew about the physical aspect of anxiety, until reading this one.

282,"30 year old INFP male here… in my early 20’s I had it all; great friends, my life was headed in a great direction…

To make a long story short, two things happened that really altered my course;

- I was deeply influenced and mislead by this christian woman, she was a true friend and we talked all the time, yet her extremist views led me to burning so many bridges, and as a result I walked away from all my friendships, a great community I was apart of… from 2012 to 2019 I followed this womans false teachings. 
All along I thought I was on the right path, up until last summer I was awakened.

- in 2016 I went through a very traumatic incident in my life that deeply hindered me… went through something very abusive and too painful to talk about, just know that it has been quite the mountain to conquer right up until this very day.

So now here I am, with no true friends, no community… I work full-time so it’s very difficult to find a solid group of friends at my age with my schedule. I’m a good looking down to earth guy, just also someone who is vulnerable and been through more agony, more stress than probably most by far.

I have tried and tried to find a woman to date, it just has never panned out… I try to be laid back, yet I’m sure girls can sense that I’ve been through something very serious, can sense my desperation. How could anyone not be longing for a true companion after going through what I have?

I’m in a very difficult situation and right now it feels like trying to build an entire city from scraps in my free time, or climbing up an icy mountain.

I have remained free from self-harm, and that will always be the case, but I am just deeply afraid that my life won’t turn around and it feels like no matter how much I try, nothing happens.

283,"Hi there, I’m going through this period of time where I’ve hit a breaking point with who I am and who I thought I was. In high school I was more quiet, and I thought I had a good group of friends, I was genuine around people and typically didn’t find myself disliking or judging people too quickly. Nowadays in college I find I make very quick snap judgements and if I don’t quote-on-quote “like someone’s vibe” I stay away, but group projects still exist and force interaction and how the rest of the students view you is also a thing. This was never something I really cared for in the past. Obviously I am respectful to everyone thats a basic courtesy I will do to everyone regardless of how I feel about them, but when it comes down how I portray myself in front of people outside of my friend group I feel disingenuous. I hate feeling fake and I hate how I take snap judgements from others as truth so easily/ make judgements so much faster now. How do I reverse it? Or teach myself not to do these things?

288,"As the title says, my friend is currently isolating themselves from everyone, their family, online friends, and her friends. We've been inseparable since 3rd grade, never had a single disagreement that impacted our friendship until recently. It's been 7 years of friendship, and we've done quite a lot together, and we're were considering each other siblings. Now however, I don't even know if she's alive for multiple days at a time, and it's getting worrying. Over the years, she's had a few mental illnesses, some of which we share (the usual depression and anxiety, who doesn't have those these days though?) She does however have a thing which can only be described as a ""twitch"", which is something she still hasn't diagnosed properly despite therapeutic consultation. She tends to twitch, rather violently, when stressed or anxious. It's been something we've worked around in most cases, but it had been triggering more and more often.  


I was going through what could only be described as immense hopelessness, and it was showing through how I was talking to others. I would be constantly fatalistic, and my usual brand of sarcastic humor started being less of a ""haha yeah that would be dumb"" thing and more so of a ""haha yeah **that would be dumb**."" if that makes sense.  


This was apparently ebbing away at her, and she thought that I hated her due to it. It all came to a head when we were talking about a ttrpg I run, and I wanted to avoid spoilers by answering with a ""I don't know, would that happen?"" when she'd ask for potential future events. She eventually got tired of that response, and asked, ""Do you hate me or something?"" and I responded, ""I don't know, do I hate you or something?"" and then she didn't talk to me for about a hour.  After which, we had to work on a project together, so it got mostly ignored, and I thought things were back to normal. She was audibly reading off of my laptop from behind me, and I turned it in in a direction she couldn't because I didn't feel comfortable with it. This is where the twitches came in. She was seizing up, as she knew she was about to twitch. She asked me, ""Can you turn it back around?"" and, I was getting a bout of anxiousness, as I hadn't seen her seize up so quickly and over such a physical object before. Two mutual friends, who were working on the project with us, asked me to do so, and I could only respond with an ""um"" out of what can only be described as stupidity. She then asked me one more time, ""X, please turn it around, I won't read it anymore."" Before I had time to react, she started violently twitching, to the point that others in public were turning heads to look. I simply watched, unsure if she was okay, as it looked like a seizure.   


After that, she regained composure, and stared at her own laptop, avoiding even looking at me. She told me at a later point that all she wanted me to do then was to apologize or help comfort her, but I was too worried that she might get set off again if I did something, as she was avoiding me. This was on a Friday, the weekend passed by without contact, which I understood why, and with the help of some other mutual friends, things got patched up. She still wanted to be friends, but she still made a point of letting me know that she can't look at me without feeling anxious anymore. I started watching my words more around her, avoiding her triggers, and she eventually started distancing herself from more of her own friends, and some of our friends in our friend group.   


Sadly, some of our friend group has some...less than savory views of how to deal with her anxiety towards me, such as, lets call him Ed, he thinks she should just ""get over herself"" but I know that's not how it works. She's been getting even more depressive since then, avoiding talking to the friend group for reasons related to her anxiety. She's even gone so far as to ignore her online friends, who have contacted me asking if she is okay. I know she's occasionally on, but she hasn't messaged these people in just over a week. She no longer even tries to talk to anyone outside the 4 person friend group we have online, and is actively avoiding her own family. I suspect a potential suicide attempt soon, but she's denied it when I told her I was worried about her. She's told me that her main worry right now is how easily her friends get along without her.  


I'm not sure what to do anymore, most of my attempts to get others to do it have failed miserably, most attempts I make at including her in things end up with her leaving. Anything I do personally just fails. I genuinely don't mind anymore if I'm the issue (of course I do, I just mean that I don't care if I have to cut myself out of her life to get her feeling less anxious about her friends), I just want to see her get better.  


**TL;DR: I was in an edgy rut, said some things that made her think I didn't like her as a friend anymore. She has an absolutely horrendous twitching attack in a class, and doesn't get immediate empathy from me due to misreading the situation. Mutual friends recovered the friendship, only for her to isolate herself from all of her relationships, and experiences a deep depression I haven't seen in all 7 years of knowing her.

I of course laughed for 5 straight minutes about it, even when we were getting kicked out, and when I eventually left, I said sorry on our group chat and went to sit in the woods by my my house. The owner was pretty sad the day before about her grades and told us that when she went upstairs it was because she was sad. I just laughed again cause I wanted to help her the last few days and when I had the chance, I was too blind to see it.

After I finished laughing I just started to cry, like full on proper sobbing, about everything that was going on in my life, while still laughing in between. Nothing was even on my mind either, I just cried. 

I just don’t know what to do cause Idk how to fix what I’ve done or what I’m gonna do in general and I’m really scared. I had been pushing everything down and tried not to think about it for so long and it all just came out in destruction and tears. Like the owner was genuinely angry for the first time with me being around her and it was my fault.",21Mar2020,1
296,"Alright so it is currently Sunday a bit passed 3am here. I took a nap on Wednesday that ended around 5pm, then I was awake for the following thirty hours. Then I slept for nine and a half hours last night and I’m not really feeling particularly sleepy tonight. As someone who had previously never stayed up for more than 23 hours (and I only did that like twice to complete large last minute assignments for school), this is extremely unusual for me. 

Honestly it’s kind of just a lot of fun once I get passed a certain point in the night. Everything remotely funny is like hilarious and I’m listening to music and just really vibing. Throughout the thirty hours I told about, I spent a long time on this subreddit just giving advice and it was a lot of fun. 

I know I really should sleep but like, I’m currently on spring break from college with no responsibilities for the next few days, so I don’t really see any issue with it, for now at least. 

Anyone have any input on any part of this? Thanks.",21Mar2020,1
298,"So it’s been 7 days since him (we are acquaintances) and I stopped talking. We aren’t friends (haven’t been since Jan, he thought we were for some reason) anymore soooo I have to be cautious if I should even text him again. I don’t think I should text him again. But I’m waiting for him to text me first but that’s unlikely since when told me that our friendship died and he just doesn’t like me like how I like him. In a romantic way. But the thing that makes me think he could possible be waiting for me to do it is because he told he was waiting for ME to end the friendship. So he would likely be wishing for me to start up. I kinda end the friendship?, we weren’t friends he just thinks we were for some reason. We were acquaintances. Nothing more, well and sexual buddies too but that means nothing now unless is starts again. Yehw I don’t think it will. But I ended it I said I can’t do this anymore. Whatever I meant at the time. We clearly had different thoughts on what we were. He thought we were more then acquaintances and I thought we were less then friends. 
I’m feeling the most pain and it’s usually the person receiving the message is hurt the most but I’m hurting a lot more. I don’t know for sure if he’s hurting like I am but I doubt it. What do you think? He said he likes talking to me tho and he said it doenst matter if I text him and he won’t delete me or block. 
The amount of times I backed out from saying hi to him is crazy. I would say 30 times, I’m serious

315,"It's been 6 months since my gf broke up with me. It has been rocky for a while and after another arguement caused by my overthinking, she suggested we should just break up then and there over text. I was heart broken, I felt like it was the end of everything we did for those 3 years almost going on  4 years. The one mistake I believe I made was trying to stay friends with her. Although she broke up with me, a week later she told me in a conversation that she missed me. I didn't  want to believe it cause I mean she just broke up with me in such an uncaring way. Later those months were filled with moments of happiness and jealously seeing she was starting to date her old ex/best friend. I ignored it and she kept me around because apparently I was ""best friend"". Although she was starting talking to someone, she continued to flirt and act as if nothing changed between us. Those months felt wrong in a confusing way. Like she just broke up with me and still wants to talk to me like nothing's changed? Idk but a couple of fights later, she started to move away from being flirty and sweet to just being friends. Although it was sudden, I felt like a stranger to her. Finally we talked and apparently she didnt feel that way anymore towards me. I still talk to her but I feel more like a total stranger to her more than ever. I guess what I'm saying is it feels like she doesn't want nothing to do with me because of the fights we've had. idk why but it's just hard getting over a person who you knew for a long time.

I'm sorry for the whole sob story but should I distance myself away more and more? I know it's hard letting a person go because you've know them for a long time and the memories you've guys had but I just feel like a stranger to her and I assume she doesn't care that I'm around that much anymore seeing she's talking with another person.

Anyway, the other night she asked me what I thought about her and I told her I really liked her and that she’s an amazing woman. She then told me that she thought she wasn’t my type so I told her to relax and we don’t need to rush this and that I was too good.

Anyway, I was speaking to her today and then she told me she’s still waiting on a click/ spark and that she hates that it’s not there, but she likes me and sees me as a really good friend. I’m just really confused as she then told me she misses me and can’t wait to kiss me again. I told her the best relationships start of as great friendships and we’ve only been together 4 times and that’s not enough time, which she said true too and agrees. She then asked what I was doing, but I was busy so didn’t respond for 3 hours so she asked if I was okay because I forgot to respond.

Currently I’m salaried at a similar rate to members of my team finishing apprenticeships and I’ve failed in application for the senior post twice, of faults that are my own. 

I’ve been struggling recently with depression which mostly manifests around motivation to do simple things. This has had a minor knock on effect on my work. Not in the sense of getting things done, that’s never been a problem, but in occasionally lapses of professionalism (being extra grouchy on occasion.) and occasionally arriving late. 

This is something that was spoken about in a meeting with my boss and since my boss is understanding and a good boss we spoke about the problems I’ve been having and I’ve been focusing on improving the issues which I believe I have done as of recently. In the back end of last year I would be late 2-3 times a week due to simple motivation issue. For me at the moment it’s literally as simple as sometimes I just can’t find the motivation to get out of bed - this isn’t just for work, even for personal things and hobbies. 

My boss has been understanding throughout, but obviously this is a black mark on my record as what I would consider, an exceptional employee in terms of work done. I feel like this is hindering me in progression even while I’m improving in my negative areas. 

There is a job opening for 1.5x my current salary which is an additional 15 minutes on my daily commute. I’ve always been good in interviews, and upon reading the post I believe I fit their criteria. I love working where I work but money is slowly becoming a problem for me as more requirements get added. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to progress at my current workplace for nearly 6 months now, while it’s been mentioned that it’s coming but I need to continue to focus and improve on my negatives it just hangs on me that maybe that black mark where I currently work is insurmountable. 

I love where I work, and I love the people I work with. My boss could have kicked me out years ago with completely valid reasons and never did and for that I feel an intense amount of loyalty to them and the company, it would have been really hard for me to get back into the work force when I was at my lowest.

I apologized for asking a few times and said I can be a little crazy about this, and she said “a little??”. (Please note she is a very good friend, I just am constantly asking her if I look fat). So here are two pictures from today, the one on the left is the better picture and the one on the right is the one I look the worst in. Also keep in mind I was trying to maintain good posture in these pictures so things are likely worse outside of these pictures. I want honest opinions! Do I just need to change my exercise regimen?

343,what should i do?,21Mar2020,1
344,I am in college now thinking back on stuff so I need some advice because I have been wondering something. IDK what it's been or what but when I was in junior high and I stayed later they usually closed the gates and so you would have to go through the office but I always forgot and would start crying and panicking so a teacher or whoever adult was there would have to help me. And again whenever a new school year started we would get our schedule and so while everyone would be going to their classrooms I would be at the first floor still crying and panicking thinking I am gonna be late and never gonna find my class I think remember feeling overwhelmed by it EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Then again in the summer I don't even remember what would have happened but something with school idk but I would start crying and freaking out. I do have this incident that happened that I freaked out so bad that I became a sobbing mess at home and went non verbal for two days I couldn't even make sounds  that was in high school. I do know that it hasn't happened though so far since I started college almost finished my first year,21Mar2020,1
345,"**tl;dr** someone who I \*thought\* was a good person and friend has fired someone who is dear to me.  I am disgusted and heartbroken.  What should I do?

I work in a professional services firm.  Someone who I thought was a good person and friend got promoted to manage the admin team (I'll call him/her 'manager').  I was supportive at the time, despite some reservations which I kept to myself.  

Since then, a new person got hired into the admin team. New person is a breath of fresh air.  Enthusiastic and pleasant, there is no job too hard. We've developed a strong working relationship and manager knows this.

There has been negative feedback about the admin team.  Although new person has made some mistakes (as does everyone), main issue is manager's inability to manage.  There has been a lot of  corporate pressure to 'make it work'. To resolve, manager and Human Resources did a joint 'review' to 'address' the feedback by 'restructuring' the team.  Translation: manager got new person fired. 

I am angry, disgusted and heartbroken. Someone I thought was my friend (and who I've supported to risk of my career) has fired someone dear to me.  And they did it because blaming new person is easier than facing their own failings.  What's worse, they didn't even do it themselves - they got HR to do it for them over the phone. I have tried to support new person but the timing could not be worse with the economic situation.  

I feel compelled to confront manager about what they've done but I am so angry this could get me fired. I don't know if I can work with manager anymore as even thinking about manager makes me sick with shame. I am worried about how my reaction will affect my wider team, including staff who report to me. I am thinking about resigning but this will wipe out years of hard work trying to establish myself in this business.

346,"When I was 13, I had a main trio of friends. A, D, and me. A is a year older. D started being really passive aggressive to us and lying about things. Eventually we cut her off, and we didn’t see her much or talk to her. Fast forward a few months, and D and I reconcile. She was a lot nicer and kinder. A was hanging out with her own school friends more often, a bit out of the picture. 

One day D and I sit down and have a talk about what happened. I was afraid of what to say. I admit, I didn’t really have a backbone at that age. I was terrified of confrontation and didn’t want anyone to be mad at me, so I figured I’d take the blame for it. She asked me why we stopped being friends with her. I can’t remember what I said exactly, but it wasn’t the truth. I basically blamed it all on me (and A? I can’t remember). I was afraid to tell D it was because of her behaviour and lies. I know it was wrong, yet the fear overcame me. 

This happened when we were 13. Me and D are almost 20 years old, and A is living her own life. We are all still neighbours. We have been through high school together and have really grown as people. She is really kind, sweet, and there for you. We are best friends still and confide in each other. This topic has not been brought up in years. However I’m not sure if it’s the quarantine or not but I’ve been thinking about it lately and feel a tinge of guilt. Guilt for not communicating properly, guilt for not telling the truth. I haven’t thought about it for years until not. 

Is it worth it to tell the truth 7 years later? Is this something to lay to rest? What do you suggest?",21Mar2020,1

I don’t know what to do. I’m a teen stuck in quarantine and three days ago I woke up with a very intense pain on my butthole. 

Please don’t laugh! 

Sometimes I have to brace myself to sit down, pass gas and even wiping. Wiping after going to the toilet (even peeing!!!) has been torture for me because it’s so fucking painful!

I got sick of it and decided to see what was going on. I got plastic gloves (didn’t want to touch it with my bare skin) and popped my leg up on the windowsill next to my bathroom mirror.

It’s a small lump. It’s like a pink-ish red-ish colour and extremely painful to touch. It’s not like a bubble, it freaked me out because it’s shaped more like a work (obviously it’s not one, I made sure of that after my heart attack). It’s not exactly inside my butthole. It’s like sitting on the entrance.

356,"I’m lactose intolerant but a huge fan of cheese. 

Around six months ago I bought a bag of shredded cheese and upon opening it discovered the whole bag had gone bad...or so I thought. I exchanged the bag and had the same issue. The cheese smelled rotten. From then on I have been unable to eat/smell preshredded cheese. I rarely bought preshredded so this didn’t bother me much, I accounted the experience to preservatives. All was well, or so I thought...

A month ago I bought some of my favorite cheese. It was delicious however it left me with a hellish aftertaste. It’s so horrendous I immediately ran to the kitchen sink and sprayed my mouth out. This didn’t help. I ran to brush my teeth and using mouth wash (countless times) but it only lightened the taste. This aftertaste has begun to happen every time I’ve eaten cheese. Honestly the taste is so bad I don’t think I will ever be able to stomach cheese again. 

I’ve tried eating other dairy products to see if it was a dairy related incident but it only happens when I eat cheese. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar?",21Mar2020,1
357,"Hello I would really appreciate some advice as I cannot make up my mind about this. 

I was friends with this guy for a few months before we fell out over a conflict involving a mutual friend &amp; group project. What happened was that this mutual friend felt that I was trying to steal credit by doing extra work and so the 2 of them brought the issue up in front of **everyone** (8 of us). Felt really attacked, insulted that they thought that lowly of me and also betrayed that guy friend didn't have my back (we were quite close and he actually liked me romantically). Strange thing is that guy friend has always been neutral about conflicts like this, so I really had no idea why he took sides this time (maybe it is me).

Few weeks later, I had a talk with this guy friend and he still insisted that he did the right thing; that it was a group matter hence he brought up the issue in a group setting. This was despite me explaining that it was really a private matter between me and her which ought to have been settled privately. Anyway, that was the last time we talked. 

I was also outcasted by a group of friends (the 2 of them are inside as well) and excluded from their outings.

So anyway, this guy's birthday is coming up. One of our friend in that group texted me and said the decision to wish him or not lies with me. Not sure what should I do? I feel that by texting him it signals that I have put everything behind but imho I actually haven't. Still kinda hurt about how ""disposable"" I had been.

Our text conversations are pretty basic hi...how are you....etc but with the pandemic I really can't think of anything else to talk to her about or ask her this is probably a pitiful and dumb post but any advice on conversation starters would be so awesome thanks reddit.,21Mar2020,1
360,"Now I only have one confirmed but trivial example but, I've always gotten a vibe I'm used as the scapegoat for when someone get caught out for something. You know when you just have a feeling? I feel like I can pick up on it in conversation or a feeling from the room. Now I'm not an angel, and as a child I know I would tell a fib such as it wasn't me but, I'd never point a finger. I do find it hard to trust, even family and I am always concerned I am to paranoid or speculative. 

Now my dad had a beer in the fridge to have with dinner, as he usually does. Although on this night he did his late shift, so we left dinner aside for him. I hear he had come home so I go out to the living room to check how his day was and say hello. I walk in and get instantly told agressively ""If your going to have a beer with dinner you could put one back in the fridge."" I obviously defended myself saying ""I didn't have your beer, I dont even drink with dinner"" (which is the truth, I only drink when I'm drinking) ""Anyway I was going to ask how your say went"" he changed his tune a bit and replied good. So I leave the room and I'm in my phone so I pause in the hallway to type and hear him say ""I bet he did"" to my mum to which she says passively ""oh I don't know"". When she 100% knew my brother had it with his dinner I was there when she said to him ""you going to have that beer with dinner"" after he pulled it out.. 

I didn't go back to defend myself further, I didn't want an argument and if mum wasnt going to admit it was my brother I'd look to defensive making it seem even more like I had had the drink. I'm just annoyed she let it end with him thinking I 1: drank the beer, then 2: lied about drinking it. When she full well knew who it actually was. 

I'm just left here thinking, I wonder if previous speculation is true then, what else have I been blamed for, or had spoken about behind my back. I just worry about being overly paranoid about this, I am a bit of a black sheep of the family. 

Anyones thoughts?",21Mar2020,1
361,"This is gonna be a bit of a long one, and I apologise in advance about that. I\[18M\] met this girl who we’ll call R\[18F\] through a common group of friends from my school that she used to study in before I actually knew her. We talked for the first time in a common group chat back in 2017. We started talking in DMs soon after and we got along really well and had a ton of common interests and seemed to be similar people in general. We grew fairly close over the next year or so over which I opened up about some very personal things I’m not used to discussing and she was one of the first people I opened up to because I was still really introverted. She was really understanding and we both went through relationships over this period. We also played a lot of games together, and I got her into my discord server where she reconnected with a lot of friends she knew back in school but had lost touch with. One of them was this guy we’ll refer to as A. Now, at a time in which we were both getting out of less than stellar relationships, turns out we had both kind of liked each other this entire time but were both insecure and didn’t come forward about our feelings and just stayed platonic with some flirtatious banter. So, once we were both single, we got into a relationship, and we met IRL and it was really nice and everything seemed to be headed in a good direction. Well, she dumped me after 10 days out of the blue because she realised she liked A and didn’t want to be unfair to me and tried to let me down easy. It was a hard hit, even putting my insecurities aside, because I’d genuinely liked this girl for a while. There was a month of passive aggressiveness where I was in denial about being over her yet completely jealous of A and it was pretty shitty. After that, we started talking properly again and turns out she wasn’t dating him even though he’d said he liked her way back. I told her I still had feelings for her and she said the same and albeit I was confused about this whole situation, I really wanted to give it another shot. Well, I was about to go off to college in a different state whereas she was going to stay in our hometown. We met two days before I left and that was nice as well and after I went off to college, she helped me get through all the changes I was struggling to cope with and it was really nice for the first two months or so. Over these two months and the two years I’d known her, I fell in love with her. I told her I felt so when she told me she was scared of us catching feelings for each other as she’d made it plenty evident she hated the idea of a long distance relationship. She told me she loved me too, and I was the happiest I’d ever been in an otherwise miserable life. Well, then she broke up with me over text a week before I was going to go home and meet her saying she couldn’t handle the stress of a relationship along with the stress her parents gave her regarding grades in college. I tried to convince her to give me another chance over the next week saying I won’t talk to her more than once a day or take much of her attention, because I will admit that I was probably overbearing earlier. I depended on my conversations with her to get me through the days of college as I was struggling to make friends and had a really shitty roommate situation. Well, I wanted to make amends to the best of my ability because I really didn’t wanna lose R. Anyway, so none of my efforts seemed to work out after which I went home and asked her face to face if there were any other reasons, and I specifically asked her if it was about A or any other guy she might have started liking and she said that wasn’t the case and that she’d never lie to me. The next few months of college were miserable where I struggled to stop feeling for her and failed spectacularly and started using unhealthy coping mechanisms and stooped as low as self harm because of this and issues at home and college. Basically, I was overwhelmed. These months involved crying to her at 4 am about never feeling happy and similar things like asking her to give me permission to wait for her until college ended (4 years) and she was ready to date me. I hit rock bottom, and every time I visited home for around the next six months, I’d be miserable and obsess over the fact that I was in the same city as her and still couldn’t meet her. Then, I found out from a mutual friend that R and A were now a thing and she’d liked him the entire time and now they were just going ahead with it since right after our breakup. R found out that our friend told me and tried to talk to me about it, but I was done once she told me she’d never stopped liking him. Our friend also showed me chats where R admitted to never being in love with me in the first place. Well, the point is, I said goodbye to her and didn’t talk to her for a while, but it broke me to the point where I stopped enjoying everything I used to because most of the things I did enjoy were in common with her. Anyway, so I stooped lower mentally until December of 2019 near Christmas where she texted me asking to make things okay and let our entire chapter be water under the bridge and go back to friendship. Seeing her message me gave me an insane amount of adrenaline, but it also depressed me to the point where I was sitting in a room full of people tearing up. I get how fake and pathetic all of this sounds, but I’m trying to be completely honest here. It’s like I couldn’t stop thinking about her ever since and she’d finally texted me but I was also too broken to talk to her properly. Anyway, so after a much needed wakeup call from my closest friends, I wished her good luck in her relationship with A (which she is still in) and left her life completely. Why I’m making this post is because 3 months after we last talked, which was long after she’d broken my heart, I still can’t seem to completely over all of it. I’ll still hear a song randomly and feel this pit in my stomach and go down the rabbit hole of memories and come out of that more miserable than I went in and feel miserable for the rest of the day. Even seeing her name pop up in a discord server or seeing her online is like a trigger. I don’t like feeling this miserable, and I hate how weak she still makes me. Am I being an asshole for holding a petty grudge for this long and still feeling miserable and insecure about this whole experience and letting it shit all over my self-confidence even though I wish I could get over this because quite frankly, I miss her friendship? I’m really sorry for making the post so long, I just really needed to get all of this off my chest.",21Mar2020,1

So I’m a uni student in the UK I worked at a local franchise convenience that rhymes with car a year ago but quit the job for final year. No bad blood between me and the employer, just had less expenses and a job that paid more per hour and less laborious so was an easy choice.

I went back in because of Brit’s hoarding everything this place is the only one to buy anything in the local area. After some small talk they wanted to know if I would work. I said sure (I have lost my other job for the time being so sure) 

However I think it due to the current climate I don’t think it’s fair I’m on the same £8 an hour I was on before. No other staff want to work, many have moved home (the place pretty much hires only uni students) The shop is rammed constantly, I can only imagine what their profit is currently, I’m obviously working a lot harder than  I used to due to this. And the last thing is I’m obviously risking my health being in contact with some many people a day.

368,"Some context:
So me (18F) and my best friend (18F) just finished highschool and have been in uni for about 5 weeks now. Before then we would spend literally every day together, we called each other soulmates and we both spoke how we would remain in each other's lives forever. When uni began she became distant and I feel like I’m losing my best friend as she’s starting to turn into a different person.

Another friend of mine (let’s call her Jane) is also close with my best friend (let’s call her Sarah) and noticed her acting this way too. Sarah started excluding Jane from certain group events when uni began. Ever since uni started its felt like Sarah’s been trying to fit in too hard and it's beginning to feel like she's prioritising her new uni friends that she has only known for a few weeks over her highschool best friends. 

Earlier Sarah sent me messages saying how she thinks our relationship has begun to change, and that its starting to become toxic. I have begun distancing myself a bit from her because it hurts to see her so happy without me and fun with all these other uni friends she has made. And whenever we meet up, Sarah is always texting her uni friends on her phone when I’m trying to hold a convo with her. 

Sarah has also texted Jane saying she wants to cut ties saying that the beloved their friendship of three years is too much to handle. Because of this, Jane completely broke down and it revealed a side of Sarah that I never knew existed. 

AITA for wanting to cut ties with Sarah after making Jane (another one of my best friends) feel like this?",21Mar2020,1

Sorry in advance that this may not be formatted properly, currently on mobile. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I haven’t had the best of luck with vehicles, and have had my second wreck and may have totaled my second ever vehicle. (Do not know for sure yet, because we have to get it to the shop to see what can be done. Deeply afraid that it’s toast.) This is a vehicle that is essentially on loan (Unofficially. I’m just under their insurance) to me from my parents while I go to college, and with the way things are right now, I may be without a vehicle for a while.

We made a deal that while I am pursuing my education, that I will be responsible for my own phone bill, and anything that goes on for the car (aside from insurance. I am on their insurance, so they said they would pay for my insurance.) So I essentially had two main responsibilities: Car maintenance such as: gas, oil changes, etc., and a $75 phone bill each month. The job I had was nice for what I needed. It was flexible with my hours for college, and my boss was wonderful. The only draw back was that I only received $250 a month in cash (It’s an under the table job, like construction can be). Unfortunately, I have nothing to show for it as far as savings go, because it all went into college, that one bill each month, and maintenance for my vehicle.

I am currently unemployed, partly because my last job’s business was starting to tank and boss-man had to let me go, and partly because I was putting in applications just before COVID-19 hit my area, and then everything has essentially halted until further notice for job applicants. I’m a broke college student with only $150 to my name, and have come to find out that my parents still owe the better part of $6,000 on this car that *may* now be totaled, and I have no way to help them with my mess (with the economy and the way things are currently). What can I do? Please, someone give me advice. I’m in full onset panic mode.

(Edit: forgot to mention. We have already turned it over to insurance as an accident, but I just mainly need advice on what I can do to possibly remedy this situation in any way. I need a job, obviously, but with the way things are right now that may be impossible.)",21Mar2020,1

We talked about it and he has said that he was only on tinder to see if i was active because he had suspicions I was cheating and only changed his bio out of boredom. When I asked to see his tinder, he showed me that he had deleted his account.

I don't know what to do in this situation, I feel like he is being genuine about why he was on tinder but at the same time I have this feeling that I might be getting played here.


Also, I know that it was wrong to go snooping through his tinder - I have extreme anxiety about him cheating on me because of my past relationships. 

Any advice on the situation would be a great help, thank you!

378,"Did I fuck up my life for uni ? And should I feel guilty for lying to my parents?

So basically I started my first year 2017 but had to repeat due to anxiety! Anyways so in 2018 I passed the following year. Last year I decided to take a gap year to work and just to travel a bit. Now I’m regretting it and wished I had continued my second year last year instead of taking a gap year. I’m also a mid year student. I’m 21 so I’m legit stressing thinking I’m gonna graduated a year and half or two years later than what I should have. 

If I only didn’t take that gap year I would have been on my third year now. 

Anyways with my parents (they know about the gap year) just not the repeated year. I told them them my course goes for 4 years instead of 3. Which they didn’t question since some of the majors in my class go for 4. Think I’ll tell them after I graduate since it hopefully won’t even matter by then. I did however tell my mom I’m retaking two units. 
So basically they know when I graduate and that isn’t an issue. It’s just that I kinda beat my way around it.
I kinda half truth but not completely. Just that my parents especially my dad would over react which would have caused me more pressure and stress that I thought it was better to just leave it until I finish my studies. I know I’m not gonna fuck around. 

My mental health is all well now. I’ve been passing my classes so far. And am pretty set with the future. Just instead of graduating next year ima graduate the year after! And like I said my parents know that’s when I graduate. Only because I never told them I repeated a year but my course goes another year. 
Should I feel guilty ? 
Obviously if I was to have any problems this time I would let them know. But yeah for now I’m G I just feel like I fucked up a tad morally. But at the same time the way my family reacts to certain things isn’t the best. That a part of me say if I’m confident and doing well it’s shouldn’t be a problem.
But idk

Just to also add! I also know that on the certificate it would probably show 3 years when I graduate . But I guess since I’ll be completing it by then. It wouldn’t really cause them to question it. I guess could always say I took an extra course in the middle or it just says “3 years”. And if they do question it by then I’ll just tell them the truth which is most likely what I’ll do. Or eventually lol but either way the truth will come out!
I just feel like telling now would cause them to stress and then make me feel under pressure. But just to make it clear if I do have any struggles that come my way this time I will 100% let them know! I’m just taking chances right now.
I also hate seeing them stressed which stresses me out. Also My fees are all government based!

That being said, I will 100% continue to work my ass off for my assessments! I’ve also taken some  counselling from my uni when I do have struggles which has helped quiet a bit and have started seeing some help which has also benefited me allot!",21Mar2020,1

Hello Reddit. This is a throwaway account. I am a 20 YO guy from Iraq who has been facing severe psychological abuse by my brother, who is 13 years older than me, and I don't know what to do and how to deal with it. For as long as I can remember and since I was a child, my brother has abused me in multiple ways. When I was younger, he would physically abuse me and beat me up to force me do whatever he wanted me to do, and always shamed me and belittled my achievements. When I was only 11 years old, he used to call me fat and other insults about my weight, to which I responded by not eating well and losing my appetite. I almost developed anorexia because of his constant remarks about my weight. Now that I'm in my adulthood, the bearings and physical abuse has stopped (maybe because he thinks I will retaliate), but the psychological abuse is only getting stronger. 

He constantly tries to push my buttons and throw hurtful comments at me even though I don't ever respond to them. He knows that his comments hurt me because when I was younger I broke down in front of him a couple of times, crying and telling him what I did to deserve all he puts me through. After my father passed away in 2012, I developed depression and anxiety because he treated me even worse than before. My father could protect me to a certain extent, but when he understood that I was practically without any protection and psychological support, he attacked me even more. My mother tries to protect me but she is also a target, one time he tried to beat her for shouting at him to stop hurting me, so she can't do much. Besides all the hurtful things he tells me, he has disrupted my sleep pattern as well. At night when I fall asleep, he suddenly makes loud noises near my room and shouts out nonsense to wake me up. Because he terrorizes me through nighttime, I have recently been sleeping during the day time and I'm awake all night. 

One time when I was younger, I tried to retaliate and he beat me up, when I tried to defend myself and beat him back, he invited a couple of his friends and they beat me up in my own room. Because I tried to defend myself, he abused me for a whole month and left many scars on my body. I have reported him to the police but they have not done anything to protect me, they even went on to blame me about how he's my older brother and I should respect him as he's only doing those things to ""make a man"" out of me. 

Recently, I have disassociated with him in every way possible. I do not reply to his comments, I do not show any emotions to his remarks because I simply want him to think that his abuse is no longer effective, but it is. And I don't know what to do. I have cut myself out of his life completely, even though we live in the same house, I don't go out of my room because I don't want him to see me or engage with me in any way. He recently engaged with his girlfriend and had a party to which I did not attend. I am trying to be as distant as possible from him, because if I can't do anything else, I want to hurt him by convincing him that he simply doesn't matter to me and whatever he says cannot affect my life or bring bad emotions to me. I request your kind input on how to deal with this. How can I convince him that his comments can't hurt me (even though they do)? Should I keep disassociating?",21Mar2020,1
396,"Hello everyone, 
I really need an advice on this. I don’t know how to deal with this problem by my own and I don’t know who to ask for help. 
I’m in a relationship for almost two years now. Everything is really going great. We get along together  really well and since day one of our relationship almost nothing changed. Everything would be perfect if there wouldn’t be my boyfriends porn addiction. 
He is actually really open about this kind of stuff, that’s why he told me at the beginning of our relationship that he jerks off at least three times a day. We always joked about it and I jokingly said that he was addicted to porn. However that was at the beginning of our relationship and I think at that time he just didn’t jerked off that often as we had sex all the time. I’m not a person who denies sex unless I’m feeling ill or something, but my work made it really difficult to have sex daily since I have to do a lot at home and my boyfriend just doesn’t initiate sex. One day he said to me that he believes that he’s addicted to porn, so I said that it’s ok as long as he doesn’t prefers masturbating to porn over having sex with me in a situation we could have sex. I’m ok with him watching porn and I know that even when I tried to forbid it he could still watch it, because I can’t and don’t want to observe him 24/7. And then something happened that really made me concerned: he told me that he already preferred porn over sex with me several times already.  But then he added that it was long ago so I don’t have to be concerned about it. However I still was. I never was searching for it but I often found tissues with cum on it as I was cleaning my house and I think that it’s really weird to jerk off at a girlfriends house while she’s taking a shower.... isn’t it?
Now (due to the Coronavirus) we both stay at home and because of my workplace we’re kind of living together. He’s actually the horniest person I’ve ever known but he just doesn’t initiate sex and all I do is finding tissues all over the house. As I asked him whether he’s masturbating in the bathroom or in my room when I’m taking a shower he just laughed it off and says he wouldn’t. However right now he just isn’t in the mood for sex and tells me that he doesn’t masturbate, if this would be the case than he should be really horny all the time - but he isn’t. He also often denies sex when I initiate it. He says that he’s really tired (all the time). I would believe him if he actually would be horny. Back in the days we would even have sex at 2 am because he said that he didn’t masturbate in 24 hours so he can’t go to sleep. And now he doesn’t even want to touch me. And if I try to touch him he takes away my hand and says that this feels uncomfortable right now (that’s what he always says when I touch him just after he cums). I tried to draw attention to this as I don’t want to masturbate in the bathroom or in my room while he’s taking a shower, since I’m still as horny as i always am. So while he’s satisfied the whole time by jerking off (maybe even to porn) I’m left frustrated. Even though he denies it all the time that he jerks off while I’m not around, I still say that even if it would be like this that he should also consider me. Cause I may look busy but I wouldn’t deny sex unless I’m working on something really important, which is almost never the case. 
However I tried to believe him, even though I had proof that he jerks off. So I just ignored it. Then we had sex just recently and guess what - he lasted for almost three hours. Although he said before us having sex that he’ll make it quick. As he said that he’ll be quick, I wasn’t angry or frustrated. I was happy to have sex in the first place. I don’t want to complain about three hours sex, however I don’t think a men can last three hours without masturbating and having sex in weeks. Maybe he has problems to ejaculate because he jerks off too much to porn?
We sometimes had sex when he honestly said that he didn’t masturbate 24 hours - and he barely lasted 20 minutes. 
I can’t understand why he’s hiding these things from me, because he never did. He always talked openly about jerking off or being horny. So that’s not something he’s embarrassed by. That’s why I don’t understand why he’s possibly lying to me about it now... 

I hope some people can give me advice on what to do, since I don’t know how to handle this situation. It just really frustrates me.

397,"It was recently the anniversary of the death of my next door neighbor. I remember that day so vividly it's kind of ridiculous. My stomach is twisted up in knots just thinking about it.

A few contextual elements first. I'll be using fake names and my throw-away account because I'm honestly not sure what I should do here and I don't want anyone I know linking this post to me, let alone to the actual people involved. So, for the sake of keeping things consistent, I'll list the names I'm using here:

My neighbor--Jake

Jake's wife--Paula

Jake's sister-in-law--Lina

Lina's best friend--Carol

So context is kinda key here. Jake and Paula lived with Paula's sister Lina, and have lived together for a very long time. When we initially met the family and their gaggle of four kids, I initially believed that *Lina* was Jake's wife because of the way they interacted. When I realized I was wrong, I felt pretty immediately uncomfortable but decided not to insert myself into their business; I don't want anything to do with my neighbor's marriage. Anyway, Jake and my dad were super close, and Jake would often bring the kids and either Lina or Paula to the movies when my family would host big movie get-togethers at a local theater branch. Jake was always really kind and had, on a few occasions, stopped by my house to check in on us or check through the house when we thought it'd been robbed.

Jake was a US Army veteran and a very proud man, but also a man that was visibly haunted. He struggled with alcohol and while I was never super involved in how much he drank, I couldn't help but notice the telltale signs of abuse. I can't say if he was an *alcoholic*, per say, but he definitely drank more than he ought to, especially in those last few months.

About six months before Jake's death, he got a new job after being in job limbo for a while. This new job was in Texas (and we live pretty far from Texas). Paula took the kids and moved down to Texas during the summer to get them acclimated and then put them in school while Jake oversaw renovations on the house to make it fit to sell. He did a lot of the work himself, by hand, and was very proud of his craftsmanship. He and Lina were in the garage often, working on things or just chatting and shooting the breeze. I remember thinking it was very strange for Paula to leave Jake and Lina alone, and I always got the impression that Paula was oblivious to the fact that Jake and Lina didn't act ""appropriately"" with one another.

The day that Jake died, we were just having a regular day. It was a weekend, and we were just having a regular family day. I don't remember what I was working on when my dad went out to check the mail and discovered that the police and a coroner were at our neighbor's house. In a panic, my dad asked what had happened and if everyone was okay, and Lina arrived and explained to my father that Jake had killed himself. He was dead. She needed to use the restroom and needed a place to cool off while she waited for a friend (Carol) to come and get her. I remember being completely shell-shocked at Lina's appearance. She was shaking from head to toe, pale as a ghost, and continually picked at her hands and arms. That was how I noticed that her arms were absolutely covered in deep scratches and bruises. She quickly hid them from us the moment she realized we'd seen them, and when my mother asked, Lina tried to quickly explain that she'd gotten them a while back from a child or a dog, maybe. Her story didn't make a whole lot of sense, and I've seen week old scratches compared to fairly fresh ones. These wounds were new, maybe within the last day or so.

When Carol arrived, things only got stranger. There was a lot of... veiled conversation. Carol never just came out and said what she meant, and very much acted as though she were going to guide Lina through this situation. I remember feeling very uncomfortable with the way Carol was sort of domineering Lina, who seemed to be terrified and definitely guilty. She said, a few times, that it was her fault. She wouldn't elaborate, just said that it was her fault.

Lina and Carol were eventually taken in to get their statements and so on with the police. My parents retrieved a flag to cover Jake's body and he was given a proper send-off. It was absolutely gutting for everyone involved, and the neighborhood immediately erupted in rumor and speculation. At first, I was appalled at some of the behavior of my neighbors. They would walk up the driveway and look around the house. We had to stop people from going inside the house unpermitted on multiple occasions.

The more the dust settled, though, the stranger things began to appear. Lina told my parents that Jake had hung himself from the stairway banister and she had pulled him down and tried to give him CPR. On its own, that might sound at least a little plausible, but the banister was not only shorter than Jake, it was notoriously unstable and wouldn't have been able to safely hold the weight of a full grown man. Moreover, Lina is far too small to have been able to get Jake down by herself. Of course, I'm allowing for adrenaline, but it still strikes me as very unlikely that she was able to pull him down by herself. It came out shortly after, as well, that the house was absolutely filthy and *filled* to the brim with empty beer cans and alcohol bottles. The house was a mess, and it was very obvious that the two were sharing a bed.

Paula reached out to our family and asked us to keep an eye on the house, and so my dad did. I refused to go near the house. Even now, a year later, the house makes me viscerally uncomfortable. It feels... angry. I don't know how else to put it. My father was taking care of the house and checking the mail, but a few days passed and we noticed that lights were turning on inside the house and, despite Paula's explicit instructions (and likely the police's instructions), Carol and Lina took *bleach* to the house. They took all of the bedding and sheets and pillowcases and those items promptly vanished. There is evidence that Carol and Lina did a thorough cleaning of the place and removed several things, including the alcohol containers and all of the other things mentioned thusfar. When confronted, the women had no explanation for their actions and seemed incredibly resistant to talk about anything that had happened.

To this day, I still know more from Lina's accounts than Paula does. Paula knows next to nothing about the manner in which her husband died. Moreover, at Jake's funeral, Lina's attitude was incredibly strange. She was chipper and bright and bubbly when around my dad, but also prone to hysterical fits. She demanded attention at all times and threw herself all over my father no matter how many times he tried to encourage her to find a more healthy outlet for her feelings. It was an incredibly uncomfortable and strange situation, and Lina's behavior only got stranger from there.

Lina began to circulate a series of different accounts of the night Jake died, all varying wildly. In some iterations, Jake had attacked her (hence the scratches, she said) and then killed himself from the guilt. In others, he was just a miserable man who didn't know another way out. She implied that she and Jake were intimate in some stories and vehemently denied it in others, leading to a strange cycle of misinformation and chaos that consumed the case.

When the report finally came back for Jake's autopsy and the general investigation, it turned out that Jake was beyond intoxicated, even at the time of his death. He was intoxicated to the point that he would have had very few fine motor skills. It just doesn't make sense to me, then, that he could have tied a noose and hung himself from a surface that he was taller than and which wouldn't have held his weight.

I have a terrible feeling something bad happened to my neighbor, and there's nothing I or anyone can do about it because it was ruled a suicide. How do I get past this? Do I say something, do I let it go, and how do I make myself stop shaking every time I mention Jake's name? How do I shake this terrible feeling that my neighbor was murdered and the killer got away with it?",21Mar2020,1

400,"(Sorry for grammar, not a native english speaker!)

I am from a very small country with a very rare language. My first name is unusual even here, as well as having a rare last name. It is possible for my name to be the only one in the world, I wish I was a John Smith but no. I have googled my name and found nobody else.

I am also aching for money right now, Corona has made an already difficult job search even harder. I have tried selling sfw art commissions but not much luck with those, and it takes time to build an audience that I don't yet have, with a lot of competition online.

So, the logical conclusion: Furry porn seems to sell well, so I think my chances are better in active furry communities, where the niche is smaller. I think this is my best chance for faster earning.

I have a paypal and it seems to be the most common payment option for commissions. But when paying someone, their full name is visible and that gives me anxiety. If I sell to the wrong person or get into any drama/get doxxed by the payment, the relation to furry porn would be one of only things about me to find, which might make getting an ordinary job harder. All it takes is one google result since other results are scarce already.

I have tried to google this several times with no luck, do porn artists usually share their full name with commissioners and... hope for the best? Is there a legal way to prevent full name to be shown to private buyers? Paypal needs to have a matching name to credit card/bank account, so I can't just change my name to sound more ordinary without risking loss of my account.

! To be clear ! I am NOT looking for any shady payment options, bitcoin or otherwise. I intend to pay taxes etc, completely legally. The only thing I worry about is my reputation and how this might affect me in the future. Is there any safe and legal way to accept money for art without sharing too much personal detail? What is the usual routine for others on FurAffinity or other sites? Any help very appreciated, thank you!",21Mar2020,1

402,"ok so when i was around 6 or 5 i was at this b-day party for my aunt. there was a bathroom there that was a family bathroom so any sex or amount of people could go in it. it was only my family there so my parents let me play with my cousins that were around my age . there was a playground their. i was swinging so high  i was having so much fun. then i had to pee. i went by myself because this isn't really a city town maybe about 2,000-3,000 people live their. so i went by myself. remember this is a family bathroom anyone can go in it. so i walked in and i saw my cousin ""John"" and my other cousin ""Miranda"" making out. at the time i didn't really care because you know when your 5 you don't really know about that stuff. they was begging me not to tell anyone ever. i never did. miranda and john were my aunt's kids. they were siblings. Miranda was like 13 or 14 and john was 16 or 17.  i honestly never forgot it. im traumatized. I was at my aunties house last month and Miranda let me go on her snapchat account to do her streaks because she got her phone taking for not cleaning her room . i automatically looked at her johns messages. as weird as that sounds i hoping that that was just a mistake and they stopped. i was WRONG! so basically it was explicit messages. I'm not really gonna go in detail but it was like saying stuff like ""how could this be wrong when it feels so right"" and shit like that. i told my mom to get my dad to get me. it honestly messes me up . i know i need to keep my mouth shut but i want this shit to stop. I don't wanna have a 2nd cousin with 6 eyes. should i tell me auntie? what the fuck should i do?! (john and miranda arent their real names im protecting their privacy?)",21Mar2020,1
403,"My mother was the usual teen mother. had a kid with the usual psycho abusive kyle. My mom decided to stay with him for almost a decade, while I watched these 2 crazy people maul each other. They would argue at least 2 hours a day with me listening. I will not go into detail about these two. since, she has moved back in with a relative while we lived in a single room 3 years.  I was fine as a kid. Later on in life, I started arguing a lot with her. She was the most irrational person I knew. She got me involved in everything, I knew every detail of divorce. She has no idea how to keep her kids out of her ""adult life"" she tells me all about it, but she still acts if I do not know it. I remember I hated talking to her as a kid because she had the worst personality, she would just make me feel absolutely horrible. My mom also got me involved in a lot of adult issues. I became anxiety ridden, and she had no idea how anxious I really was as a kid having listened to all of her problems.I had a lot of focus issues as a kid because being in a room with people I didn't know was too much. I become a different person when I talk to people. I started smoking weed and drinking alcohol a lot. I was not sober for almost 3 months of my life. My mom has been oblivious. My mom did nothing to ever help me. I have never felt like my mom even cares about me. Since, she has almost stopped for the most part. I found ways to avoid her and she realizes I don't need her anymore, so she can't treat me the same way. Since she has stopped I suddenly regained motivation in life.

Anyway a few month ago it started to get worse but she was told by her case manager to try and get out of the house since she was feeling trapped she was feeling a little better but now.......2 months later everywhere seems to be closed places she could go to she can't and i asked her how she was doing and she said ""Not good"" and she said she feels she is more likely to kill herself then to die from this virus if she can't get out of the house.

This pains me i get the quarantine but i also understand my sister i want to help her and the best i can do is ask if she wants to go for walks but sadly it has been raining a lot here and it is not really warm weather not super cold but still.

She ended up being interested in my bestfriend, which wasn't great but I didnt lose sleep over it. They hungout a couple of times but it didn't go anywhere. However we kinda stayed friends but are not close at all. I want to start making a move but the thing is that from what I know she doesn't usually do anything other than just hook up. I know this is fine and that she's allowed to do whatever she wants it's just that I want a relationship with her. Recently I asked her if she wanted to hangout (as friends) and she said she could after her school is less hectic in the summer. It's been about 3 weeks and I really want to message her but I'm not sure if I should and if I did what I'd say.

407,"I think someone knows Blizzard Entertainment well may help me with this. 

Well, it's all started like this: I'm Chinese and I wanted to play CODMW but as you know the game is region locked in China, which means I can't buy it on Chinese Blizzard Store, so I had to buy it through VPN in Blizzard Russia. In order to do that, I registered a Russian account and simply bought the game. 

After finishing the campaign I found the game's nothing to play anymore as I'm too weak to compete online so I decided to sell this account to another guy who couldn't use fair trading platforms as he said he didn't know how to use them (it maybe fake) so he wanted me to show the account to him and he'd give me the money as soon as he saw the game's in the account. 

As soon as he logged on, I assume he changed the account's email, account name, and password. As I registered with the Russian VPN, I didn't dare to set phone protection as Blizzard may block this account. I made such assumption because after long time I haven't got his money I tried the account, it said ""There's no such account"" by Blizzard, then I knew I'm fucked. I tried the account name (looks like ""JackBrown#46838"") and it said the same thing. What is weird is that I just changed the account name once, it shouldn't be able to change again, if I wasn't wrong. But God knows what he did. 

So here's the situation, I want this account back, but almost anything changed after he stole it. There is only one lead on my hand is the security question I set when I registered the Russian account, and I believe I can still ""convince"" Blizzard that I am the owner of the account, anyway they can still track the account by used names and emails. 

What should I do now? I need someone knows Blizzard well to get me out of this.",21Mar2020,1

Had I not done this I would've believed my gf is a narcissist but seeing the her traits and tendencies described in many mbti articles I grew to look past her ways and learn to accept her for who she is. But I feel like our differences in function makes us collide. We don't really understand each other however we just try and accept each other. It really bothers me that she doesn't have or use any Ni and Ti. My lack of Se irritates her as well. We just have a very different way of looking at the world and there were some attempts by the both of us to try to change reach others way of thinking. But I felt it would've been immoral of me to do so and gave up on it completely. She had this tendency to try and force her beliefs unto me but stopped doing it as much when I called her out on her behavior. We both feel guilty afterwards when ever we collide. We both want to maintain harmony above all so for the most part we get along very well but I'm sure it's a mutual feeling where we feel misunderstood and somewhat unfulfilled as a result.

Me and someone else were dicking around and in the end, I pushed him onto the bed and it broke the frame. Nothing really important just what held the mattress in place, but the crack was pretty big. She was upstairs when it happened so she didn’t realise until she came down a bit later. She just needed some space cause she was stressing and had been upset about some shit the day before.

I had been laughing a lot that’ll when I came round for literally no reason and even when bad shit happened, like breaking the bed, I just laughed. She got genuinely pissed for what was really the first tome around me and kicked everyone out. But it was my fault. I was just in a ball on the floor calming down when she was trying to kick me out but I eventually left. 

She told us a bit later on that her mum shouted at her for like 20 minutes and that we couldn’t go round and hang out at her house anymore cause whenever we do, something breaks and her room is left in a mess, which does happen. And it’s usually my fault as well.

I can’t help but feel bad and completely responsible and I wanna make it up to her but idk how. Meeting up is gonna be pretty difficult cause I live in England and we’re most likely about to go into quarantine so we can’t meet. We can’t even go round each other’s houses cause my parents are always gonna be home and idk if she’s ready to have anyone round hers, or at the least me.

I said sorry but didn’t say what was wrong with me and she said she forgave us but still stood by everything she said and I just wanna know if there’s anything I can do to make it up with her, just to show that I’m sorry.

416,"I live with my 64 year old mother and currently am working at a video store (yes they still exist) for 8.90 an hour. I live in Ohio, currently bars, dine-in restaurants, hair salons, tattoo shops, almost everything is closed but we've somehow managed to avoid it. When you go to a restaurant do you take the plate home and return it after a week without washing it? Everything is visibly dirty. I've been wearing gloves the past week and a half, before that I was using hand sanitizer and washing my hands every hour and now I've gone to wearing a face mask and was laughed at twice by these mouth breathing idiots who have the nerve to go to a freaking video store when everyone is being urged to only go out when it's absolutely necessary. I resist the urge to scream at people that Youtube has new video releases for rental and that Hulu and Netflix and other streaming and digital platforms exist but I doubt they've heard of the internet. One guy came in today and was eating a piece of pizza with his bare hands after touching a door handle. People don't care. This country is so screwed because of the people who still aren't taking this seriously.

420,"The context:
We are in the process of closing on a home and therefore preparing to leave our rental property.  Closing on the new house is scheduled for April 1st and we thought our lease on the rental property was up on May 30th, which was perfect timing.  However, we found out our lease is actually up on June 30th...but the landlord/property management company is willing to end it on 5/30 if they can find new renters before then.

I am six and a half months pregnant.
I’ve been able to self-isolate at home because I work in a school and our school is closed until at least March 31.
My husband works in a bank which has not been shut down at all, but he removes his shoes/clothing and washes his hands immediately after coming home each day.  
It’s just us here.  Therefore, I’ve been able to keep the house clean and haven’t left the premises in a week.

The situation:
The property management company is continuing to schedule viewings.  We’ve had two viewings in the last week, and there are THREE now scheduled all on Monday (so likely 6-7 people visiting on Monday alone).  A viewing means that potential tenants come with a representative from the property management company and tour our house, inside and out.  
I feel very wary of having strangers come into the home during this time.  I don’t know anything about their health or habits, and my pregnant self hates the idea of them breathing on or touching stuff... not to mention the house isn’t that big so it’s not easy to stay 6 ft away from someone as they tour room to room. 

My husband thinks we don’t have an option and have to let people come see the property so we can find replacement tenants.  I feel torn:  I don’t know if I should delay viewings by a week or two, or If things will actually get worse over that time and I should just suck it up and let strangers into our house now.  Part of me feels like we have all of April and May to find new tenants ... but given that my state isn’t one of the few on lockdown, it may get worse here before it gets better, and maybe we won’t have all of April and May to find new renters.

422,"The restaurant I work at has been closed down due to the Coronavirus for at least the next two to four weeks. I live near Portland, Oregon and so the risk of being exposed to the virus is probably moderate if I’m not staying away from others. 

If I don’t work, I’m worried about how I’m going to pay the rent, especially if this goes on longer than a month or two, as no one really knows how long it’s going to last. Not to mention how quickly it would drain my savings if I actually got sick and needed medical attention. 

I’ve got a job offer from a local supermarket, as they really need workers during this time, but after quarantining myself with my roommates for a few days, I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth the risk to go out and expose myself to so many people in a busy grocery store. 

Two of my roommates are also out of a job because of the restaurant closures (one has already filed for unemployment and the other is also thinking about applying at the supermarket), and one works in a mechanics shop, so it’s not the tightest quarantine, but we’re all trying not to get ourselves or others sick. We’re all young, and aren’t too worried about getting really sick ourselves, but we do worry about our loved ones (parents, grandparents, etc. when we end up coming back into contact).

My restaurant is urging people to file for unemployment, but if I can get a job so easily, I don’t want to over-tax the system that is there to help people who are much worse off than me. 

I’d like to take this job for a little bit of income and security, something to occupy myself with, and to provide a needed service to my community, but would it be more helpful to just stay home? I’ve got enough saved up to pay rent for a couple months, but I’m worried it could be much longer than that before they allow restaurants to open again. Am I overreacting by thinking that I’ll be out a job for longer than they say? Should I just enjoy a break for a few weeks and wait for the restaurants to open back up?

So with this information you can see that I'm not the healthiest person in the world and I could probably do with losing a few pounds, but I'm alright. Doctors say I've nothing to be concerned about. I've been at these stats for about two years after overcoming an eating disorder. (When I was starving myself I was 36-28-36).

I find that a lot of my older clothes that I've had for years are tighter around the hips and waist. This makes my old ED brain flare up and worry that I'm getting fat. But.... I'm not? I don't think I am. I'm curvy and Thicc, but I'm not overweight. My booty has definitely enlarged itself but not to an outrageous extent, I just look more curvy these days.

This has been on my mind for quite some time and I am desperate to talk about it and find out if these changes are 'normal'. I need to reassure myself and stop the obsessive worrying. If I could get reassurance, perhaps I could finally let go of my old clothes and embrace my 'adult' figure. I want to finally kick my ED out of my brain. Unfortunately I don't have any older ladies in my life who I can ask about this.

So recently I've been a little concerned about a guy I've been talking to. I met him around a year ago and we were talking, everything was great.

However, since I last saw him we have barely spoken, or even had a solid conversation (it's probably been like this for a month).

436,"So...
We all know what is happening in the world right now. 
I am having to work from home even though I am a digital marketing executive. Anyway, this story isn’t about me. 
My colleague, who lives with her aunt (80+ recovering from cancer) is worried about getting something on her commute to/from work and making her aunt sick. So, she asked our CEO if she could work from home. 
He then proceeded to tell her that she should not worry too much because her aunt is old and that even if Coronavirus doesn’t get to her she will “be deleted soon anyway so try not to worry too much”.

Background info: We work in a company that sells pricy food gifts with a total of 10 workers. 2 people work in the warehouse packing and everyone else In the office. We were told we will not be working from home no matter what. And if he have to self isolate we won’t be paid, even if we can work from home.

Most of us in the office are pretty annoyed with the overall situation but we were wondering if there is anything my co-worker can do/ complain to someone about this?
specially what the CEO said.
We do not have an HR staff member. 

TLDR: We work in a company that sells food gifts online(no fresh food). My colleague lives with her old aunt who’s recovering from cancer and asked to work from home. CEO proceeded to tell her her aunt will be “deleted” soon so if she doesn’t die from Coronavirus she’ll die from something soon anyways.",21Mar2020,1
437,"So I'm living with my mum for at least a month as I've been laid off work. I could move in so quickly because my girlfriend (4.5years) left me after cheating on me very recently and I had yet to sort a place to rent (luckily).

My mum is extremely difficult to spend extended periods of time with. She has been off work for 3 months due to stress, she says she is fine now, but she is clearly not. When she is happy she is constantly seeking attention, recognition and gratification. When she is angry she is constantly stating how amazing she is, repeating herself over and over, looking desperately for a fight and changing the subject to something that she can win at. She must always have the last word, even when there wasn't an argument.

I am really trying hard to be patient and have not exploded yet. I am meditating twice a day. I have bought all my own food and kept it separate from her. I'm going for runs. I am contributing to the bills and cleaning up after myself. I'm taking deep breaths before saying things. There have been pleasant times, but I just don't know how I can try to improve this situation. I've only been here 2 days.

Can you lovely people please give me some advice? I know this was my choice and knew this was likely to be difficult, but maybe there is something I am not realising, I'm open to your thoughts.

Two of her sisters have cut off contact with her... she is very single. I’m her only child. So with all this Covid stuff she’s been in a panic about what she’ll do. She has never had a career and can’t hold on to money. She does work but always throws it on whatever she wants. She also lives several states away from me. We get along great when we’re apart.

454,"Hey Everyone. It's a lot more serious than the title probably makes it to be, I promise. No real clue which subreddit actually deals with this, so here goes.

I (19M) can't control my emotions. Laughing at awkward silences was something I thought everyone did, but then it became serious. 2 years ago, when i reached home, my parents were crying. Turns out one of my closest cousins who was of the same age I was, had cancer. It was supposed to affect me a lot more than it did my parents.

But my initial reaction, was just laughter. Probably at how awkward the room was, almost too comical, because I'd never actually seen my parents ugly cry like they did then. And also because something just propelled me to laugh. I don't know what that is. That's when I first noticed it.

I promise it's not some rip off of Joker, because I don't always laugh or anything, and was able to quickly grasp the seriousness of stuff and even cried a bit after I went to my room. But that doesn't help anything.

It also happens every once in a while when someone is talking something serious to me. When I was accused by someone of stealing money and had the whole school administration looking at me and I'd to explain myself, I broke out laughing. Made matters worse.

Then yesterday, my grandfather's sister died. He informed me while I was having eating, and I felt the burst of laughter coming. I clinched my teeth hard, and consoled him. But I felt shit because he had seen the initial smile.

Most of the times, when I feel a burst of laughter coming up during any serious conversation, I look around and make something up (""HAHA did you see him fall"" when no one did, or ""haha just remembered something"" when I didn't). 

It has had a severe impact on my mental health, to the point where I dread being anywhere physically, because I'm able to keep a straight face and tone while on call or, obviously, text. I think it's the other person's face, or the very serious aura surrounding us at the time, that brings the laughter out. And sometimes, it comes out when I think about how bad it would be if i laughed at that moment too.

I'm scared for the next time I'll laugh at someone's death, and face real consequences.

Here’s how the events took place from how she told me: There were two girls constantly calling GF pretty and offering her some MDMA. GF declines because she doesn’t take drugs. GF gets a drink from the bar and does whatever. Her housemate notices that one of the two girls slip something into her drink while she wasn’t looking. GF then drinks her drink and then her roommates tell her that it was spiked.

She of course starts panicking, chugging water, trying to throw up ect... luckily she was only slipped MD so she had a really good night.


But here’s what doesn’t add up for me or anyone else I’ve told this to: Why did her roommate let her drink it after he witnessed someone slip something in it? Why didn’t they tell a bouncer or a bartender on these two girls? 

I don’t know what outcome is worse. Did they put the MD in her drink? Or did they let two random girls put an unknown substance in her drink? Keep in mind that both her housemate and his friend do these kind of drugs...

463,"Looking for some advice on how I should handle my current coronavirus conundrum, here's a brief overview of my situation and the relevant factors:

1. I'm a 30-year old American citizen, currently ""residing"" in Berlin, Germany
2. In November of last year, I quit my job to travel for 3-6 months. I spent 3 months in Bali/Vietnam before being flown back to Germany for an interview for a position that I didn't really want/didn't end up getting, with the motivation being I'd take a free flight back to Europe and re-evaluate my situation there
3. Since returning to Europe two weeks ago the situation has of course dramatically changed 
4. I don't have anywhere to return to in the US- it's been &gt;8 years since I've lived there, and my parents are elderly with poor immune systems. I'm simply not willing to risk any type of transmission to them
5. I had planned on returning to south-east Asia, until the borders closed. I previously lived/worked in Malaysia for three years, and see myself taking another job there in the future. But that option seems to be off the table at the moment given the border lockdown 

I could stick it out in Berlin and try to find relatively cheap accommodation, but the job market here is, of course, sub-optimal, as it is in most places.  What would you do if you were me?",21Mar2020,1

465,"So, I'm a student abroad and this whole corona thing is giving me quite some trouble. Many people are going back to their home countries and I'm not sure what to do. I know my parents would want me to be with them, but they're not pushing anything on me and letting me make the decision, which is not easy. I thought about the pros and cons of me going home.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

Everything in my university is done on-line, even exams, so technically there's no point in me being here.

The situation in my homecountry with coronavirus is better than the country I'm currently in.

I'd be a bit safer, my parents still have to leave the house to work so they could take care of the groceries and stuff, there would be no reason for me to leave the house if I'm with my family.

My family would feel better knowing I'm with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

Travelling is generally a bad idea during these times (goes without saying).

I could be already carrying the virus and then I would only bring it to my homecountry (my entire family would have to be on quarantine for 2 weeks, meaning nobody will leave the house. However, I am 22, my parents are 45, my brother is 15 and we're all in good health, so nobody's at a real risk from this disease. I would only have to keep clear of my grandparents for awhile and everything will be fine).

Yeah, the situation is better in my homecountry, but will it keep being if people like me travel there?

And now probably the biggest con of them all: being stuck home with my family. We don't really get along that well. There's a lot of shouting going on in my house, and has been for as long as I remember. I feel like we can only have a good relationship when we are at a distance. When I go home for breaks, it's fine for the first few days and then we just go back to yelling at each other all the time. When I'm on regular breaks at least I can always find excuses to leave the house or even go out of town for a few days, but now I can't. I'd be stuck home with them. When I'm on the phone with them they make it seem like everything is great and they're enjoying spending time together. I was already calling bullshit, I know my family better than that but then I talked to my brother about it and he said there's constant shouting in the house and it's driving everyone insane. Me going there would not make anything better, seeing as how the worst relationship of all is between me and my dad. He's very easily irritable and particularly everything I do seems to piss him off. It would be a recipe for disaster, being stuck in an apartment with them for God knows how long. Here I'm bored as shit, but screw it, I can do my own thing and live in peace. I can work for uni during the day and get high/play video games/chat with my friends on Skype during the evening. Even if my parents want me home, I think I would do everyone justice by staying here.

473," Hi

So  I did a blood test previous week and it came out that my cholesterol  levels are pretty high for my age (I'm 23). I've hopped on the carnivore  train a couple months ago, but I'm still adding different kinds of  foods to my diet, so it's not only just meat and salt.

Just  a general list of things I eat on a regular basis are: Eggs (almost  daily), bacon, sausages, chicken, beef, liver, tuna, butter (to bake  on), all types of milk products (yoghurt, regular milk, cheese, cottage  cheese,...), dark chocolate, different sorts of vegetables, oatmeal,  buckwheat, brown rice, quinoa, nuts, fruits (apple, mango, pear, blue  berries), peanut butter.

What I  avoid is: any type of bread, breakfast cereal, pastries (even though I  could cheat from time to time, but on a rare occasion), white rice,  corn. If I want a sweet snack, I eat dark chocolate.

I  know this might not sound like the carnivore diet but I'm just curious,  does anyone also have high cholesterol when trying to maintain a more  protein and fat heavy diet?

The  doctor told me to eat more ""healthy"" and eat less saturated fats, so  basically less eggs, and fatty cuts of meat (which I try to eat more of  the past 1-2 months).

Oh and I also sport (weight lifting, running, basketball) pretty frequently so this definetelly shouldn't be the cause.

These are my numbers in case anyone would be interested:  
\- Total cholesterol: **264** mg/dL, advised to be &lt;190  
\- HDL-cholesterol: 65 mg/dL, advised to be &gt;41  
\- LDL-cholesterol: **187** mg/dL, advised to be &lt;115

I’ve (25m) been dating my gf (22f) about 4 months now. I won’t mention her name in case anyone recognises it. I’ll just call her gf ahaha 

So this morning we had an arguement and we’ve never really argued before (only been together 4 months) but we were arguing because I found out she lied to me about something. 

I don’t think it’s necessary to dive into what we were arguing about but if you think it is let me know and I’ll add it in ? 

But I was super annoyed and I wasent yelling but I was being pretty loud and so was she. 

She looked pretty guilty that I had found out she lied about this thing and she became upset, started crying and stuff. 

I told her I dident know why she was crying since I’m the one who was lied to. She then looked at me and point black she said to me “just hit me” “I’m sorry I lied just hit me, I want you to hit me” 

I was so shocked she said that I mean I’d be shocked if anyone said that but yeah I dident know how to reply or what to do so I just kinda left ? 

My question is when I see her tonight what do I say/ do ? I know it was probably the wrong thing to just leave her this morning but I can’t take it back now. 

I’m not a professional but I don’t think what she said was a normal thing for someone to ask ? 

I’d never hit a woman how do I make that known to her ? Also why would she say that ? 

I just want to add that I’ve never hurt my gf I’ve never been violent toward her or infront of her or anything like that.

I need to stay here because I know that as soon as I walk through that front door, the shaming, shouting matches and manipulation will skyrocket. 

What’s especially worrying me is that she’ll see me having a dissociative episode or overhear me talking over the phone to my best friend, who she hates and forbade me from talking to. 

She’s basically given me 48 hours to decide whether or not I’m staying in my apartment or coming back to that hellhole she insists is my home. Those were her exact words: “you have 48 hours to decide” 

I’m honestly terrified at the thought of having to go back. Hell, I stress ate so much yesterday and couldn’t get more than two hours of sleep because of it. (She’ll comment on my weight as well which won’t help) 

She actually tried promising me all manner of gifts as well, like I’m some kid that needs bribery to do his homework. She only started doing this when I got to uni, acting like everything was idyllic. She had me fooled before the Christmas holidays and I’ve basically spent most of 2020 so far in a depressive rut because of it. 

I don’t know what to do. I know if I tell her I want to stay, she’ll come up with some kind of counter argument and because she scares me so much I won’t be able to assert my decision. How do I tell her I want to stay here and avoid another fight?",21Mar2020,1
480,"I live in Scotland, where we haven't been issued a shelter in place yet. Schools have been mostly closed, but teachers are being told they still need to turn up for work to provide free day care for key workers. This means my partner's potential exposure to the virus will be high. I am a baker at very popular cafe that plans on continuing takeaway services during this unprecedented shutdown. 

Basically, because I am not a key worker and handle people's food, would it be weird or paranoid if I choose not to go to work? 80% of my pay will be covered by the government so that wouldn't be too big of a concern. I would absolutely hate to unintentionally cause anyone any harm by passing this virus on. We serve many children and older folks, so plenty of at risk people could potentially become infected.

485,"I am on the horns of a dilemma.  Probably overthinking things, but it’s sure the right time for it. 

I live in a large square state in the US that is currently under social distancing orders (restaurants, bars, gyms etc closed) but not as yet a shelter in place order.   My family (wife, son and I) have been planning a road trip to a very remote national park in a neighboring state.  The park is still open and tends to be very lightly visited even in normal times.  We would be driving about 250 miles to this location, camping in a campground, and doing a lot of hiking while practicing social distancing.  We’d be gone for about five days.

Pros: 

Hiking and being outdoors is recommended for mental health and compatible with social distancing
This particular location is not crowded or highly trafficked 
We have ungodly amounts of free time and are driving each other a little crazy
It’s one of our absolute favorite places and will bring a lot of peace and happiness being there
We do not plan to visit visitor centers or towns

Cons: 

It’s conceivable that a lockdown could be ordered in the time we’d be gone, potentially complicating our return
Travel is not exactly recommended, though we would be in a personal car
We’d be out of cell phone coverage for some of the time, so if something happened we’d be out of the loop
Rumors of house break-ins on the rise are a little concerning
If one of us became sick, we’d have an 8-hour drive home

486,"This is a long and complicated story, and I have no idea where to start, so bear with me. 
Me (15f) and my boyfriend (15m) have been dating for a few months and before then, we were best friends. I love this dude, and we have a good relationship. Before we were dating, he was in a really bad bout of depression, and it got to the point where suicide was a topic on his mind. Eventually, I helped him through it and he’s doing a lot better. 
But he has major motivation issues, even after his depression. 

He won’t do any school work, and he’s failing all his classes. The thing is, this boy is extremely smart. So god damn smart. One of the smartest people I know. His parents are both super smart, so I see where he gets it from. He has so much potential, and he can do amazing things. 
But he won’t do anything. Not even his homework. He lacks motivation to even leave his bed. He often skips sports practice just cause “he doesn’t feel like it.” I told him to talk to his mom about it, and he did, but she wasn’t any help at all, and he said that they came to an agreement that there was just “something wrong with his brain that makes him lack motivation.” I think he depression, not like the suicidal depression that he used to have, but enough to not make him want to leave his bed. 

This has been causing me so much stress, and I’ve been trying my best to help him, and try to find ways to get him to do things, but of course it doesn’t work. I thought I was seeing improvement, but now it’s only getting worse. 
His parents aren’t helping at all, they don’t even try to get him to do his work. It makes me so mad. Especially when they put pressure on his younger sister to get better grades even though she has straight As and Bs.

And then last night, I got a text at 2:00 AM from him saying “I’m thinking of running away.”  With no context or anything. That was it. I didn’t receive the text until this morning, but I’m scared. He can’t drive, and we live in a fairly small town that’s isolated from other towns, so where would he go?? I’m scared and I need help so I can help him.",21Mar2020,1

Idk why, but I get along with guys waay more better than I do with girls, and 98% of my friends (I have maybe like 6 or 7 lmao) are guys. But I text them on Discord sometimes, and almost every day I have to \*remind\* them I'm taken, just because I want them to know. I don't know how to stop, but I always find a way to add into the conversation that I'm with someone. I don't just say 'Hey, remember I have a boyfriend'... It will be added in slyly, for example if someone mentions 'I ove this video game', I'd say 'Oh yeah, my boyfriend likes that game too!' but for some reason I do it every day and I don't know why...

Part of me thinks it's because my boyfriend is insecure and he hates the fact I want to seek out friendships, and he knows they're all guys. I think I do it to ease his mind and it's become a bad habit. I feel like maybe the 1st and second day it's justifiable, but anything after that would be really annoying - wouldn't it? I just feel like I have to constantly let guys know I'm taken so they don't forget and won't try again, but it's reaching a point where I feel pathetic for doing it and I should just stop... But what if they try to flirt with me because I stop? What if my boyfriend gets mad at me because I'm not telling people all of the time that I'm taken? Ugh.

Any advice please? How should I approach this situation? I love talking to strangers on Reddit and I love making friendships and moving to other apps, so 'stopping talking to people' isn't an option. I want to know how to stop being so obsessed with telling people about my boyfriend constantly. It's annoying me and I think it's annoying the people I speak with

496,"For the past 769 days my (30f) bf (28m) has had alcohol every weeknight and throughout the day on the weekends. He drinks beer every single day. He also smokes weed but he has gone days/weeks without smoking at a time due to international travel, pending drug tests for work, etc. He hasn’t taken a break from the beer though. Ive counted and he averages 8-9 beers on the weekends or when he’s off work, and starts sometimes as early as 10:30- he says “it’s five o’clock somewhere”. Today for example, he picked up a can of his beer at 10:30 and I noticed he was super jittery and antsy (he admitted feeling this way). I’ve never seen him “drunk” though but he does pass out on the couch or bed while we’re watching a movie a lot - which isn’t a big deal because I know he’s tired. He doesn’t complain about being hungover but sometimes will say that he is. I think he’s depressed - he doesn’t want to go out, do anything fun, procrastinates, snaps at me and others all the time, says mean things sometimes and then later apologizes, missed work for a week because he said he was in pain, is in a real negative mood... I ask him if he’s ok, if he wants to talk about it, if there’s anything I can do to help? I try to get him out of the house to distract him doing things that I know he enjoys, but he rarely agrees to do anything. He tells me he goes through his periods of depression and I get it because I do too but I dont know what to do here...  I’m concerned about his drinking and mentioned that maybe he should cut down on how much he drinks because alcohol is a downer and he’s already feeling low so it’s not helping him but I don’t think he will do anything different because maybe he doesn’t think he has an issue ... or maybe he doesn’t. Does this sound like someone depending on alcohol to cope with something? Am I just being dramatic? Thank you",21Mar2020,1

503,"So I lived in a single-parent household. It was just me, my older sister, and my grandma. My mom had us when she was 17 to an older guy (we have no interest in knowing who our dad is but we’re able to have food and shelter because of him), basically lived by piggy-backing off of others and hadn’t worked a day in her life. She barely did housework, complained about her problems to my sister and our grandma all day, and just stared at the TV in her spare time when she was perfectly capable of getting up and at least making a frozen dinner for her hungry kids. Instead my grandma did everything as if she were a maid. I took her side and helped her as much as I could. 

Our mom never cared to ask us how our day was, where we’ve been, if we needed help with our homework, if there was anything we needed, etc. etc. If we were ever sick and needed to go the the dr or needed a ride somewhere she would groan and drag herself around as if doing us a favor was the greatest task of her entire life. I tried to test if she cared by coming home at 3 am smelling like booze when I was 16 and she didn’t even bat an eye. She just rolled her eyes at me and made some snarky remark along the lines of “wow aren’t you responsible.” I was infuriated at how much she didn’t care and yelled at her for being a shit parent. She cried and played victim, giving me the whole “you’re lucky I took care of you when your father left” bs when she could care less about my safety. I basically cut off contact with her since then and mostly stayed with my friends. 

Although I hated her guts, I decided that I should definitely try supporting her for my grandma’s sake so I got into a decent state college to go into nursing. I didn’t have any friends and didn’t care to since all I cared about was graduating but I met a guy in my department who seemed very sweet and caring. we started dating after we did a project together. He also came from a single-parent household so he was able to empathize with my situation. For the first time in my life, I felt cared for and could finally be vulnerable with someone. I did have some issues with insecurity and depression so we took a break here and there but he’s always been there for me regardless. After a year or so of us being together, I got pregnant. I was too scared to tell him so I broke our relationship off, blocked him on everything, and transferred to another school. 

I was around 15 weeks when i left. Being so young, I was terrified but decided that I wanted to keep the baby. Luckily, my sister was working at a hospital in the same city I was in. We’re not particularly close, but we confided in each other when there was an issue and she’s always been pretty chill. I visited her during her lunch break and told her about my situation.

She was disappointed and offered other options but I was set on keeping the baby. Since I was going to start showing soon, I had to get things straightened out with my ex and let others know that I was pregnant and keeping the baby before baby arrived. 

I’m 30 weeks now and was able to get most things situated. I got back together with my boyfriend (he was genuinely relieved that I wasn’t leaving him and he was ecstatic when I told him that I was pregnant). We’re both staying in his apartment, we’re able to complete most of our degree online (our school also has a lot of accommodations for young mom so we also have daycare set up), we’ll both be graduation by the time our son is two, and our living situation in general has been great so far. We already have our son’s nursery set up and his family is ecstatic for us. I was able to meet with them to talk about our plans and they’re all for it. His mom has also been so sweet and supportive and has been helping us out as much as she can.

The only issue I have right now is my mom. She is sooo excited to meet her grandson but I genuinely don’t want her to be involved in any aspect of my or my family’s life. I don’t even want her to know where we live.

To preface this, my roommate comes from a semi-rich family (rich enough to move to big houses regularly) and seemingly has no grasp on how her actions effect others.
I am from a low income family that has spent most of it's time in poverty or close to it, and am completely on my own without ANY financial support.

So recently, out of the 8 months we have lived together, she's spent now 4¾ of them living with a friend or with her parents, I don't use much electricity except for a water filter for my cat, an air freshener, and my surge cord, and use natural light all day, she claims she has had the electric bill on a payment plan for months and that the bill has gone higher and higher each month, but I'm not sure how that is possible. Confronting her is difficult, as I have extreme anxiety and confrontation is a trigger for me. But last night she came in saying the bill was somehow 1,024, but instead of asking for the actual half (512) she's asking for 204. In the past she's tried to get me to pay for the entire bill and still refuses to actually discuss these things with me.

510,"I need some advice on this situation. I am a first-time poster and user of Reddit. Please excuse any punctuation errors or spelling. Forewarning, English is not my first language. 

 My husband says, ""just give them the benefit of the doubt, they just moved in."" I'm not sure if this more a hormonal issue (7.5 months pregnant)or a curiosity issue.  

My family lives in a townhouse that has three units per building. We share one wall with Unit B. The kitchen wall and master bedroom/bathroom wall upstairs. A new family of six moved into Unit B two weeks ago. For me, it has been rough. The four kids range in age from 10/9 to 1.5-2.5 years old. They bang on the walls when they are inside, causing my dogs to bark and growl. The kids and parents leave their personal belongings in the common areas, making it hard to enter our home. The other night, I nearly tripped on a scooter that was left near the mailboxes. Every time my husband leaves the kids move their bikes to our carport. My husband has to move their bikes to repark. The other day, the youngest boy runs up to me and says, ""he needs to use my bathroom right now!"" His mom told him to go to the neighbor. The parents make the three oldest kids stay outside unsupervised all day. (Expect for meals.) They scream/fight right next to our guest window. Their Catahoula Leopard/Coonhound dog howls all day long. The dog tried to jump over the balcony to attack our neighbor's dog in Unit C. Unit C has had two arguments with them. Dad opens the front door and screams at the top of his lungs for the kids to come in. I overheard the mom telling another neighbor that she homeschools the kids 3- 4 hours a day, then they are expected to spend the rest of the time outside. (I have nothing against homeschooling, I homeschool my 5-year-old.) There are a few more incidents I'm forgetting, the ones listed stick out the most. 

 Early this morning was the final straw, around three am, I was awoken by the wife and husband screaming during a passionate love session, they both were banging on the wall and their headboard was slamming against the wall as well.

I’m just lost on what to do. I am trying to push myself to eat more and more calorie dense foods but I fill up very quickly now.",21Mar2020,1

514,"Hello all,
I live in upstate New York, where instances of Lyme disease are high. My family and I have been social distancing like champs but the boredom has been setting in hard. We’ve been going for walks on trails and in the creek behind our house. This morning, I found a tick thoroughly imbedded in my inner thigh. I got my tweezers and gently pulled him out, via the instruction on the subject posted by the CDC. He’s now in a ziplock bag on the counter. He’s fine. 
It’s been about 2 hours since I plucked him. The spot where he was attached is really sore. Feels like a small deep bruise, like if someone shot you in the leg with a slingshot using a marble. Let me know if this is normal. Mostly I’m worried I didn’t get the head completely out. Don’t really feel like dealing with an infection of any kind right now. And given the larger context (covid19, NYS being on lockdown) this might be a less than ideal time to get Lyme disease. Comments? Thoughts? Advice, perhaps? Thank you.",21Mar2020,1

516,"My husband and I live on the 9th floor. We've been in self-imposed isolation since last Saturday.

We woke up to noodle-laced puke all over our balcony courtesy of the fucking assholes upstairs. They won't even answer the door, although we hear them moving around.

Who freaking pukes on someone's balcony in the middle of a pandemic?

Short of reaching out to the apartment folks (which we have done), **what should we do?** I'd like them to replace my stuff at least.",21Mar2020,1
517,"I have no higher education degree (uni drop-out) and a year ago I landed a job in retail banking. My manager John, who has always been a great boss, offered to put in a good word for me and another colleague with commercial banking because they are rapidly expanding and will be setting up in a new location nearby about 9 months from now.

&amp;#x200B;

We interviewed seperately with one of their directors (lateral +2) and he was very enthousiastic about us starting there eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

To transition we would temporarily do both retail and basic commercial banking activities to ease into it until we could start at the new location full-time. This would also mean we'd be fast-tracked for a promotion to commercial banker. We're now in the most junior retail banking position. Not your classical teller job, but more of a commercial teller thing.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager John (+1) and my director Rick (+2) aren't on good terms with each other and John Commercial banking contacted John for recommendations. John however, did not run this by Rick first.

Because John and Rick aren't on good terms with each other, John is leaving. A few days ago, John told me that the director blocked the transition of me and my colleague, and thus promotion, because the two of us leaving would hurt our team's performance too much.

&amp;#x200B;

In a few days we expect Rick to take us apart and tell us we won't be allowed to do basic commercial banking activities. Thus, missing our chance for a promotion to the new team.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the director is putting his own interests before mine and that I can't trust him to help me grow. I'd leave if I was more experienced and had a degree, but truth be told right now I'm not experienced enough yet to get a better or comparable job. I don't want to jeopardize my current Job as I need the experience on my resume.

Any and all advice is appreciated!",21Mar2020,1

520,"For some background, I'm pregnant and since I've gotten pregnant she has ignored and crossed every boundary in place. Inviting herself to stay at my house for two weeks after the baby is born so that I can ""cook and clean,"" assuming that she would be in the delivery room, creating a nursery at her house (somehow believing that I would leave my newborn overnight with anyone) making plans MULTIPLE times at MY house and inviting people over without even asking me, I could literally go on and on.

Even before I was pregnant, my husband's family would be cold and rude to mine. On Thanksgiving, they wouldn't sit beside them. Made rude comments under their breath. At the gender reveal, they went out of their way to avoid my family and mocked them every time they spoke.

She and my stepmom were planning the baby shower together. My stepmom wanted to plan it with her so they could get closer, but my MIL chose to be petty throughout the entire process. Wouldn't return calls/texts from my stepmom trying to touch base, my MIL didn't send my stepmom or any of her family an invitation (even though my stepmom was literally paying for the whole thing).

So, for obvious reasons, the shower is now cancelled. And not even directly as a result of the virus. When my stepmom texted the group text that it would be better to cancel, my MIL lost her shit on my stepmom. I was in the middle of my shift at work and sick of the bickering back and forth between the two of them so I texted them to just cancel it, that I was too busy and over it to deal with it. I was not trying to mitigate two adult women. I ended up texting my MIL that it would probably be best for her to have her own baby shower for her side of the family alone.

I told my husband about what happened and he said ""my mom doesn't respect your stepmom."" I told him that it was immature and petty of her to even agree to do a baby shower that she didn't want to participate in, then. Also, my stepmom has done absolutely nothing but try to make a friend of my MIL. I don't know if she's jealous in some way or worried that my stepmom will see our baby more than her, but I've had it with the attitude. I also reminded him there are people in his family that I don't respect either, but I don't act like a child about it.

Anyway, as part of my MIL's plan to intrude in our lives, she has made plans for us at her house for the last five weekends. I already told my husband I'm not going, but really, I'm pissed that he IS going. I know that without me there, it's going to turn in to a ""bash the stepmom"" party and it's only going to validate MIL's immature behavior. On one hand, I want to call MIL out on her behavior and ask her what exactly it is that my family has done to offend her and on the other hand I don't even want to be around her because if I am, I will get riled up and it'll turn in to a fight.

Then like 2 days ago he stopped messaging as much (at all really) and stopped calling. We were supposed to hang out and smoke that night but he blew me off. I didn’t call or anything I just let him be. Then yesterday morning at 8 am he calls me and I missed it since I was asleep. Didn’t text all day until I sent a “🙄” emoji since I had asked why he called and he ignored it. Then said he was sorry about the night before and that he was in a bad mood etc. I said ok and then we exchanged a few more texts before he stopped responding again. Tried calling at night, no answer. But I can see that he’s been active on social media recently so I’m like?? 

About 45 mins ago I sent a text saying “Idk what ur deal is the past few days but I’m getting bad vibes and I don’t like it, i hope that doesn’t come off as rude but like... that was a sudden ass change.” In those exact words. He’s been posting on social media this morning so he’s awake, and he doesn’t work today. So.. 

last guy I was talking to ghosted me completely out of nowhere and I looked dumb trying to salvage communication and I don’t want to waste my time again. I don’t know if that experience is making me feel irrationally anxious about this situation or if I’m rightfully feeling weird about it. Like I don’t want to be rude or insensitive if this guy is going through something but if I’m not getting any reciprocation then I don’t want to be the one to look dumb trying hard to keep in contact. Should I just give it a couple of days and wait or just forget it and move on?",21Mar2020,1
531,"Everyone else in our sales department is on a “hybrid” commission plan. They get paid minimum wage hourly + commission on sales. 


I work on a full commission plan. I am still paid minimum wage hourly but I have to pay it back at the end of the month out of my commission check. I do make more commission on each sale than anyone on the hybrid plan. In general, I make more on this plan than I would on the hybrid plan. 

However, given the current economic situation, our customer interest has basically disappeared. All other businesses like ours have closed, but our management team found a way for us to remain at work (while physically closing our office to the public) so that everyone can continue to get a paycheck. 

I am not one to complain about wage in a sales position. Your pay is generally a reflection of how good of a job you do. However, in this exact situation, I am actually paying to go to work. 

Should I take a leave of absence? I do very much like my job. I appreciate that management is attempting to put everyone first, but I am certainly not a fan of paying to go to work if we are getting no foot traffic and no interest in the product.",21Mar2020,1

534,"Hello everyone and thank you in advance!

TL;DR: My neighbor is a rage monster that screams at all hours. I never complained to management. Now they bang on the ceiling, slam their door, and call the complex whenever I'm walking too much or too loudly, drop something or (just one time) play music at 11 am. The complex seems to side with her. So i'm worried about her coming up here or my getting evicted. 

I'm sorry if I sound a little all over the place, I want to give any and all useful information and I'm very nervous about this right now.

 I live with my boyfriend in a second floor apartment. It's a fairly nice area with a gate. We can hear our upstairs neighbor from time-to-time, they have dogs and a baby. My boyfriend and I live with our cat and that's it. I'm in graduate school working two part time jobs and giving therapy and he's a doctor in his residency so we're both almost never home. Our new neighbors moved in below us maybe 6 months ago. They're a young couple, maybe 20 years old. We've never met them, however, they woke us up every week or so with screeching fights in the middle of the night and sometimes in the day. We almost never hear the fella, just the girl. I really wanted to explain that she screeches. I don't mean this as an offense, I mean to say that she sounds like she has past a breaking point/ a bit hysterical when she's screaming at his S.O. He rarely responds loudly enough to be heard up here. Sometimes, we'd hear a random bang on the ceiling but there was never anything that we could attribute it to being about. For instance, one time my boyfriend walked into the bathroom and started his bath around 7pm and when he walked back into the bedroom there was a bang.

&amp;#x200B;

 We genuinely thought they were unrelated to us and just from something they had going on. Then, the apartment complex called to let us know they were complaining about our walking too much. The complex, surprisingly, seemed to be annoyed with us while calling. We now tiptoe.  I've gotten several ceiling bangs from other instances:  such as dropping my water bottle or dropping my laptop from the couch.We have a few potted plants on our balcony. The couple sat outside while my bf was potting one and he stopped and went inside because they give us the heebie-jeebies. A few minutes later, we hear and feel the shake of a slammed door and the apartment complex called to ask ""who was on your balcony?!"" and then told us they believed we had purposely pour soil onto their lunches. My boyfriend (not as socially smooth and a bit fed up) explained he had gone inside once they were out there and asked if maybe the wind blew some dirt onto their balcony. The woman from the complex was sarcastic with him and indicated that she didn't believe him. She also said that there were so many issues that the couple is transferring apartments. It's been a few weeks though and my armchair diagnosis would be poor impulse control when angry and they don't actually want to go to the trouble to transfer.

Cut to the most recent moment: I'm home alone (on day 4 of not leaving) and played 3 songs outloud on a 3 out of 10 volume (at about 11:00am) , while putting together some material to work on for school. I moved over to a desk and noticed that that chair thunked down a bit. She banged on the ceiling 10 times. I had the music off by the 1st one. She slammed a door, stepped outside, and screamed ""Just stop!"" in that I-am-losing-it tone. I heard her say ""yes I'm making a complaint"" in a totally different calm voice as if on the phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, y'all, this is making me uneasy as all hell. My sister is telling me ""you're allowed to walk around and allowed to have music playing, don't be scared and be quiet"". However, I genuinely think this woman will escalate with anything. I can't anticipate what will bring her to that screaming and banging anger and it makes me really scared and on edge. Also, the complex seems to be believing her and thinking we should not walk around! So, i'm worried I'll get evicted or worst case scenario she shows up at my door to fight while we're all on lockdown. Or I just have to be scared of random screaming.  i fully regret that we never complained about her screaming and now if we do it'll seem petty.

No matter what people say I can't find a reason to react or the meaning behind what people say, jokes and references mean nothing to me either. Exposure to the conversation in real life is too overwhelming since they go by so quickly and I have to make up the correct dialogue/reactions in real-time.  My therapist tries talking to me but I can't remember what we talk about in any given last meeting (They're a whole week apart).

536,"I fell in love with my classmate but it never went beyond a casual friendship because he's straight and I'm gay (secretly/closeted). We could talk about anything and we did every day for more than five years. It was great because I got to be near my crush without him knowing I had feelings for him. But it was also sad knowing he's not interested. I knew he liked me as a friend.

He was fiercely introverted so we never hung out after school and we never chatted online. He once came to my birthday and a summer camp but that was about it. Nothing more and it really sucked. I'm also introverted but not that much so I still want those kinds of social interactions. Because I only spoke to him I distances myself from my other friends so I was at home all the time after school.

I don't know if he knew I was different. I remember two moments where he was kinda suspicious but I don't know if he ever figured it out. 

He got accepted into a high school that is in a different city. I was hoping he'd want to go to the same high school as me. The last day at that school was the worst day of my life. I didn't even say goodbye to him and I just fucked off. I wish I said something.

During the summer I was at home all the time with no one to talk to and I got really depressed. I thought I'd befriend my new classmates but on the first day I was still broken so I was quiet as shit. I was the quiet kid, no one wants to talk to the quiet kid so I wasn't able to make friends.

After almost two years I still have no friends and I think about him every hour of every day. Not even sexually anymore, I just miss him as a friend. We never messaged eachother. I could do it through social media but I don't know if it's a good idea.

I've been depressed and lonely for two years and it gets worse every day. I started having suicidal thoughts but don't worry I won't kill myself. I hate myself because of my sexuality and because I'm unable to make friends.

How could I get over or forget him? Should I send him a message or is it a bad idea? What would you do? Has anyone ever experienced this?

Okay, my place of work is staying open during this pandemic and I work with babies in a development center that is part of a hospital. 

I’m becoming uncomfortable with coming to work because for one thing the parents of these babies are the people doing the testing where I live, and my *own* baby is here. My son is special needs and has a weaker immune system because of it. His diagnosis is for his brain abnormality and makes him have abnormal breathing patterns. This all led me to making the decision to stay home during this, and everyone at work is understanding. 

My problem now is that my mother lives four hours away and wants me to go home. I want to go home as well but my sisters are saying no to that idea. I mean, I agree that I shouldn’t go home because who knows what I’ve been exposed to with my job, BUT my mom has formula, diapers, wipes, and food for my son and I literally can’t find any of that anywhere! It took me a week to find four cans of formula and a pack of diapers. It’s just ridiculous that it’s even come to this. My mom is older and smokes and has a stent in her heart, basically what I’m saying is she would not do well if she were to get this virus. 

Should I stay here and keep looking for things and potentially expose my medically fragile child, or go home and risk my mother being exposed to whatever I’ve been exposed to?

544,"So yeah uhm, its a long story but please, just please help me out, I honestly don't know what to do anymore. The only thing keeping my going right now is a miracle that maybe would happen









So i'm 16 years old and i made a throwaway account just for this because honestly I think that i'm gonna die soon and my family is going to get hurt too. I'm turkish and a muslim, i'm telling you this because its essential in the story.






So it all started in may 2019, when I've met this girl (L), we both fell in love and stuff etc. Until august we broke up and well she didn't let me go, around that time I met some other girl (N), who I feel the best around but yeah I made a choice that just idk, fucked my life up? At first, I was guilty but I thought I did the right decision, but now, I just wish I could go back. I went back to my ex (L), at first, yeah everything was good tbh, 0 problems whatso ever. So uhm one day, our hormones started working up more and yeah we took each others virginity, now at the time we didn't think it was a big deal (also she's not pregnant, the story isn't about that) Until previous month, when her mother found out about it, after that everything went to shit. My girlfriend (L) is being treated like shit by her mother and I had to talk with her mom too. When I did, she threatened me, she said that we MUST get married and i MUST tell my mom about me and my girlfriend having sex, if I refused she'll tell her husband and he will kill me and my family, exactly what she told me if I refuse to marry her or if my parents dont allow it. My gf's dad is just a very dangerous man ffs, and tbh I don't care if he comes for me, I dont want him to hurt my family, 








Anywho so uhm you remember N? Yeah I still miss her, everyday but I'm not allowed to have contact with her because in december, N wanted to be ""good friends, not more than that"" or atleast I thought so. Turns out she wanted me back and when I refused, she well fucked me over pretty hard, I thought I was gonna lose L but we fixed things up. But N is still in my mind and i just dont know anymore. The same day I got threatened by L's mom, I got called by N at the middle of the night, she said that her life is just absolute shit rn and stuff and normally I was always by her side and I would've always helped her but now I just can't, I WANT TO BUT I FUCKING CANT and yeah, it was so good to hear her voice but every single time i heard her voice crack, something broke inside of me, I still love her ffs. I just don't know anymore, her friend called me previous week and just asked for help,  she wasn't even mad at me but she just wanted her friend to be happy. I thought she moved on but she didnt, after 5 months she still didn't and we knew eachother for 2 months ffs, I still haven't moved on.








My girlfriend doesn't even trust me, not cheating wise, she thinks that I'll leave her after the incident with her mom and I don't blame her for it but fuck its definitely not a catcher when ur lovers mom threatens to kill you and your family if we ever break up. My relationship atm is like a roller-coaster, and I'm just scared that what if the day comes that our love is over, because when that day comes, its probably the same day that i'll get killed by his dad because of her fucking mom. Everything is going good now but I know it won't last long, it never has ffs. 









I've told my mom about it and yeah, she was extremely sad and dissapointed, but my mom, she was always an angel, she didnt scream or hurt me or anything, she just hugged me and told me everything will be alright but I just dont fucking know anymore, I'm just scared that my whole family will think of me as ""the kid who took a girl's virginity and tossed her away and caused alot of fucking problems for the family""
In my culture, the family image is very fucking important, my girlfriends mom gives more shit about her image then her own daughter but anywho.







I have 2 ropes and I can only hold one, if i choose the left rope (N), i'll probs die but yeah i'll be happy. And if I choose the right rope (L), i'll probs be depressed as fuck and hate myself. The worst thing is, I want both of them, but cant so yeah, what the fuck should i do








I know my grammar isn't the best and if u need more details or something to understand it, just ask me, because i'm in desperate need of help, please I beg you.",21Mar2020,1

546,"Some backstory my husband and I have been together for over 10 years I’m in my mid 20s and he’s in his late 20s, so we’ve been together since high school.

We’re married, and we’re living in a different state other than my family due to my husbands work. I am very close to my family, I talk to my mom every single day and generally have a very good relationship with them. My husband and his family don’t have a good relationship and he maybe talks to his mom once a month. 

In the past when we’ve visited home we generally stay with my family because my mom isn’t overbearing and generally lets us do what we want, come and go and doesn’t give us a hard time when we want to go visit other people. When we’ve stayed with his family they get all up in arms when we want to go visit someone else and don’t spend all 24 hours of every single day with them.

&amp; before you ask, yes I have always given him the option to speak up if he truly wants to go stay at his family’s place because I’m not an asshole just looking to stay with just my family. But his answer is always “hell no, my family sucks..” or something to that effect.

My issue: everytime we hang out with my family he just starts being so rude to my mom, me, my aunt... and become very hurtful to me. As an example: today I was FaceTiming my entire family and we were all talking about this quarantine and how we’re going to cook breakfast. I mentioned I was going to cook waffles eggs and bacon because it sounded good. I was joking, but I’m front of my entire family over FaceTime my husband says, “Okay we’re not going to eat like fatasses you don’t need all of that food we need to be saving.” And my aunt exclaimed that she’s having pancakes and whatever else and he says under his breath “that’s why none of you will survive the apocalypse” 

I was a little taken back because it was rude. I shot him a look and quickly told my family that I had to leave and I explained to him how absolutely unnecessary that comment was. He got defensive saying “I didn’t call you a  fatass “ blah blah blah... but like? 

Am I in the wrong? This is just one example of what’s happened around my family, and the most recent but I’m seriously done. He’s so mean sometimes and I just can’t deal with it too much longer. Can anyone give me advice on how to handle this?",21Mar2020,1

So I told her unless you’re 100% sure it’s not coronavirus, maybe we shouldn’t risk it. Now she is mad at me now and guilt tripping me into hanging out... basically saying if I won’t hang out with her now we might as well break up because this corona / her allergies can go on forever.I honestly think it could be allergies and just want to wait a few days to be safe since she can’t get tested.

I am absolutely devastated. The schools that I thought I would get in, I got rejected and/or waitlisted into. I have gotten acceptances to state schools and one private uni that is not highly ranked. I just don't know what to do and I feel like I could have controlled my high school career in a different way.

My plan, or at least for now, is to apply for my waitlist offers and hope for the best. I've gotten waitlisted into my ""match"" and a couple of my ""reach"" schools. But what are the chances of getting into a school by the waitlist? I assume, quite low.

One of my top choice school I applied to waitlisted me. Last year 13% of people who chose to stay on the waitlist got in. If you tell me, that's very low. And I'm not that lucky.

If you're curious, the reasons why I got waitlisted/rejected was because of my low tests scores and/or applying for competitive/impacted majors.

560,"I guess it's kind of normal to worry, but I feel like she worries too much. She shares information with us, when we talk big part of the conversation is about the virus and I overheard recently when she was discussing via phone with my dad that she wants my sister to probably stop working and my dad just told her to not panic. I think my mom is probably paranoid.

You see, my mom lives in the U.S (Georgia to be specific) and we live at a small town in Mexico, there are very few cases in my state, and I don't think there is one in my town yet. Now of course, in Georgia the situation is more critical. Last week in her weekly calls, she said that when she wanted to buy her weekly groceries, there was barely anything, she was frightened and I think that's when she started to worry.

I just don't know what to tell her to calm down and to not worry for us. And I am not sure what sources she gets, if they are true or not. Her coming to Mexico is not an option, sadly. Any advice?",21Mar2020,1

562,"During the outbreak of the coronavirus in my country, the retail company I worked for closed down and laid a large number of employees off. I was let go and told that when the company reopens, I would be given preferential treatment for the position. Since then, I have been looking for new jobs but everything was closed down and the only jobs I could find were low-paying and on 0-hour contract.

The city I live in is fairly populated and I assume a large number of people are in a similar situation as mine, so there is quite competition for retail, low-paying jobs right now.

Today, my company called me to reoffer me the position. They ask me to consider the lay off as if it never happened and that the contract will go on as before, all benefits will remain the same. This job pays quite well in comparison to most of the jobs on the market. I contacted another job which is also well-paying and they promised me (not in written form) that they would take me, but I had to wait for the store to reopen.

I have 3 days to consider my options and I am unsure what to do. Should I accept the first offer or wait until the other company reopens? Should I ask the first job to give me a new contract to ensure I am still legally employeed? They say to consider the layoff cancelled, but I am not sure how they are going to declare me as employee when they first laid me off?",21Mar2020,1

565,"My boyfriend is addicted to porn and recently started to deny sex.

Hello everyone, 
I really need an advice on this. I don’t know how to deal with this problem on my own and I don’t know who to ask for help. 
I’m in a relationship for almost two years now. Everything is going great. We get along really well and since day one of our relationship almost nothing changed. We also talk a lot about spending the future together, marriage and all this stuff. Everything would be perfect if there wouldn’t be my boyfriends porn addiction. 
He is actually open about this kind of stuff, that’s why he told me at the beginning of our relationship that he jerks off at least three times a day. We always joked about it and I jokingly said that he was addicted to porn. However that was at the beginning of our relationship and I think at that time he just didn’t jerked off that often since we had sex all the time. I’m not a person who denies sex unless I’m feeling ill or something, but my work made it really difficult to have sex daily as I had to do a lot at home and my boyfriend has to work a lot as well. Nevertheless we managed to have sex three to five times a week (of course there also were weeks where didn’t had sex even with once but these were the minorities). 
One day he said to me that he believes that he’s addicted to porn, so I said that it’s ok as long as he doesn’t prefers masturbating to porn over having sex with me in a situation we could have sex. I’m ok with him watching porn and I know that even when I tried to forbid it he could still watch it, because I can’t and don’t want to observe him 24/7. And then something happened that really made me concerned: he told me that he already preferred porn over sex with me several times. As he saw my worried face he added that it was long ago so I don’t have to be concerned. However, I still was. 
I was never searching for it but I often found tissues with cum on it as I was cleaning my house and I think that it’s weird to jerk off at a girlfriends house while she’s taking a shower, cooking or just went to the bathroom. Isn’t it? The amount of tissues that I found was increasing over time. I mean, sure when you really want to jerk off then do as you pleased however, I am just around the corner and we could have sex instead. I’m just so surprised because he always told me that sex is so much better than masturbating and that he would never prefer it over sex (that was at the beginning of our relationship). 
Now (due to the Coronavirus) we both stay at home and because of my workplace we’re kind of living together. He’s actually the horniest person I’ve ever known but he just doesn’t initiate sex recently and all I do is finding tissues all over my house. As I asked him whether he’s masturbating in the bathroom or in my room while I’m in a different room (kitchen, bathroom) he just laughed it off and says he wouldn’t. However right now he just isn’t in the mood for sex but telling me that he doesn’t masturbates the whole time just doesn’t makes sense, if this would be the case than he should be really horny all the time - but he isn’t. I am aware that other things also influence the amount of sex you want, and being stressed or having depression or other problems may also lead to problems with arousal. Nevertheless I can assure you that he really isn’t dealing with any problems at the moment. I know that I can’t always tell how he’s feeling but it’s really just him denying sex. Nothing else changed. Our relationship and the love he’s giving to me is the same, I’m sure that he’s just addicted to porn but loves me the same. Also, I think that I would notice if something would be off as we’re living together and he’s a bad liar.
He often denies sex when I initiate it. He says that he’s really tired (all the time). I would believe him if he actually would be horny at least once a day. Back in the days we would even have sex at 2 am because he said that he didn’t masturbate in 24 hours so he can’t go to sleep. And now he doesn’t even want to touch me. And if I try to touch him he takes away my hand and says that this feels uncomfortable right now (that’s what he always says when I touch him just after he cums). I tried to draw attention to this as I don’t want to masturbate in the bathroom or in my room while he’s taking a shower, since I’m still as horny as I always am. So while he’s satisfied the whole time by jerking off (maybe even to porn) I’m left frustrated. Even though he denies all the time that he jerks off while I’m not around, I still say that even if it would be the case that he should sometimes consider me. Cause I may look busy but I wouldn’t deny sex unless I’m working on something really important, which is almost never the case. I wanted to make it clear that I’m almost always available for sex because I thought that maybe he believed that I was to busy to have sex so jerking off was his only option. 
However I tried to believe him, even though I had proof that he jerked off several times a day. 
Then we had sex just recently and guess what - he lasted for almost three hours. Although he said before us having sex that he’ll make it quick. As he said that, I wasn’t angry or frustrated. I was happy to have sex in the first place. I don’t want to complain about three hours sex, however I don’t think a man can last three hours without masturbating and having sex in weeks. Maybe he has problems to ejaculate because he jerks off too much to porn?
We sometimes had sex when he honestly said that he didn’t masturbate for 24 hours - and he barely lasted 20 minutes. 
I can’t understand why he’s hiding these things from me, because he never did. He always talked openly about jerking off or being horny. So that’s not something he’s embarrassed by. He even told me sometimes while we were talking on the phone that he has to end the call because he wants to jerk off, that he just jerked off twice and sometimes he even said that he masturbated while we were talking on the phone. That’s why I don’t understand why he’s possibly lying to me about it now... I’m going crazy because he’s hiding so much from me. Stuff like checking his browser history or WhatsApp chats even crossed my mind because he always denies watching porn or jerking off. I never even said once something against masturbating. 
What I forgot to mention: Some days back my phone died and I needed to google something important for work so I asked him if I could do it on his phone because his phone was just next to me and he was on his computer. After I asked him he instantly grabbed his phone away from me and said I that I should look it up on his computer. So I asked him why I couldn’t look it up on his phone and he just said that he feels uncomfortable when I’m on his phone and immediately changed the subject. 

I hope some people can give me advice on what to do, since I don’t know how to handle this situation. It just really frustrates me. 

By the way: please excuse my grammatical and spelling mistakes. English isn’t my first language.

566,"Hello all! This is my first time actually posting on reddit, I usually just lurk and enjoy memes but I’ve found myself in a very tough position recently that I could use some advice on. 

I am currently 21 years old. To start off, my dad has never really been a great dad. When I was 11 he basically gave up on being a father to me after he lost his job and his mother passed away. After that he became a severe alcoholic and relied on people to have a roof over his head and meals each day. My mom and dad divorced when I was 8 because he cheated on her with multiple women (some were mothers of my teammates on my baseball team). After his decline I mainly stayed with my mom and would only hear from him time to time, usually to keep me updated on his situation. He could never really hold a job and because his previous job was a decent paying job, he looked at all the job opportunities in front of him as below him. Fast forward to the present, me and my girlfriend of 4 years have decent paying jobs and have our own apartment. It’s been hard because we had to do all of this on our own and received very little help from our parents. Well after some time of living on our own, we are finally financially stable and living comfortably while we work full time jobs and go to school as well. 

About a month ago, the woman who my dad was staying with passed away. He immediately called me and told me what was happening so I picked him up and he stayed with me for about a week before he went back to the apartment he was staying at. During this situation, he didn’t have a job because he had recently been fired. His excuse is that “his manager didn’t like him” but I know how he is and he doesn’t have the best work ethic. He is very entitled and had told me in the past that he has refused to do some of the tasks that his manager required of him because he believes that it’s beneath him. Well, after he went back to his apartment, he called me 2 days later and told me that he’s going to get evicted due to him not paying rent. At this point I told him that I cannot  have him stay with us because our lease is about to be up next month and we have to start packing and getting our apartment ready for inspection. He then proceeds to get angry with me and not talk to me for some time. After that, I went back to living my comfortable life with my girlfriend until he showed up to my door on Sunday saying that he “just needed a few minutes to rest before he figures out a plan”. It is now Saturday and it doesn’t look like he has any plan to leave. He sits on my couch all day and watches tv but he swears that he’s been applying to jobs. I feel terrible because I didn’t even get a chance to talk about this with my girlfriend but she’s been so understanding and kind towards my dad. I’m starting to resent that he has put so many of his problems on me when I’m just starting to get comfortable living on my own. While he has been here he’s been very defensive and any time I sit down and talk to him about why he hasn’t been applying to jobs, the conversation usually ends with him stating that he wants to kill himself. 

I’ve been trying to be very empathetic with the situation that he’s in right now but as time goes on, I’m starting to realize that he’s constantly putting himself in these situations. My girlfriend doesn’t want him to go to a homeless shelter but she also doesn’t realize that I’m not emotionally ready to have my dad stay with us in our little 1 bedroom apartment.",21Mar2020,1
567,"I worked in HR with a hotel and lastWednesday the 11th I was told by the director that the manager and I would have our hours cut because of the hotel’s declining business. Two days later on the 13th I was told that I would be temporarily laid off for about two weeks. 

Yesterday afternoon I got the call that I could no longer returned. When I asked if it was specifically due to the corona virus impact I was then told that were not a good fit for each other. I asked if this was due to work performance and didn’t receive a straightforward answer. I went in shorty to pack up my stuff and asked the director to elaborate.

She said I was over paid for the position because they had high expectations for me coming in and that I was very smart, too smart for the position but sometimes it look me longer than necessary to do things? She knows that I’m working towards my mba on weeknights and said that the material I’m studying is advanced for the position. However, she then said that she expected me to have more exposure with I-9’s which if anyone has seen one, you know that it’s a self explanatory document to complete. 

The manager, who has treated me more like a friend than a co-worker and has spent the majority of the time with me must have threw me under the bus?? This manager has poor time management skills and has spent HOURS on some days gossiping to me about her personal life and our other co-workers. 

She wants to remain in touch and even get lunch/dinner in the future which might be a bad idea? 

I’m having trouble processing how I did not meet their expectations when I did everything they asked me to do. There wasn’t much to do!! On the second day of March I prepared the April birthday cards to go out! They should have known the responsibilities of the position and 1. Paid me accordingly 2. Given me more work to do 3. Have an honest conversation with me

The position is very administrative, more so than HR which is what I ultimately wanted to go into. 

I feel a bit better because she admit the position is more part-time than full and should not have been called an HR Coordinator but rather an administrative assistant. 

Another aspect that really has me over thinking things is that she said I started to loose my excitement the longer I worked. I have actually never been happier with a company but I have school/personal stress that might be what she’s seeing?? Why would employers care whether or not I’m excited to work?? This is another detail that makes me question continuing a friendship with the manager.

On one occasion, the manager kept saying that she thinks I’m not happy regardless of what I said- it was VERY strange. This conversation really sticks out to me because she said it’s common for millennials to job hop or have several six months work experience positions on their resumes. I reiterated that I was happy and that I had no idea why she thinks I’m so miserable? She then OFFERED to be a reference for me but our COMPANY USES THE WORK NUMBER. 

I feel like she ambushed me and it’s because she was intimidated by me. She did not go to college and kept saying how insecure she feels over it. She also told me how much higher I was getting paid than she was for the same position, she was a coordinator but became a manager.

Any words of encouragement would be helpful, thanks in advance!",21Mar2020,1

578,"We are of Indian origin but live in the US, and my parents (60’s) had an arranged marriage which was very typical back then. They have been married for 35+ years, and during that time my Dad has devoted himself to being the breadwinner for the household for which he has been very successful at. He also kept himself very busy with hobbies, socially and of course raising his 4 children for which he has been an amazing father. My Mom has spent those years working too, but in addition definitely did the bulk of raising us children as my Dad worked such long hours, and did the majority of the household chores. She has not enjoyed married life at all, and has spent all her years quite bitter and twisted as she felt my Dad put his family before her in several ways. This is sadly true, and unfortunately quite the norm within our culture. However in recent times my Dad has realised the error of his ways, and tried to rectify things but my Mom has no interest. She pretty much hates him, and they have stayed together primarily for the children, and I think ultimately due to the stigma around divorce. Whilst they are both great parents, it has not been fun growing up amongst all the arguments.

Fast forward to today, they are both recently retired and us children have all flown the nest. I feel that my Dad may almost be suffering from depression. My Mom only speaks to him if essential, and they live separate lives within the house. My Mom is clearly resentful and still continues to argue with him a lot. Due to his age, my Dad no longer continues his hobbies, his friends and family are all busy with their own lives, and his biggest achievement being his career has now come to an end. He spends his days just watching TV, and on his phone and on his laptop. And has begun to drink a fair amount in the evenings which I believe is a coping mechanism for his unhappiness. Not long ago he had been drinking, and started saying that a long life isn’t necessarily a happy one. It’s better to have a shorter life that was happy, than a longer one that was miserable. And was saying he needs love and affection from his family, but really I believe he wants it from my Mom. He even went on to say that if he received love and affection from his family, he wouldn’t be inclined to drink so much. I’m not exactly sure what he wants from me in terms of love and affection? I currently see my parents twice a week, and I sense it is the highlight of my Dads week. My siblings pop in now and then around once a week, but I feel they aren’t as aware of the situation as I am, and are more focused on their own lives. I’m contemplating moving slightly further away which would mean I would see them once a week, and I feel guilty about this. I know once a week is very frequent compared to many, but in our culture family is everything, and my Dad especially has done so so much for me that I feel bad for not seeing him more.

I know this ultimately isn’t my problem, and that this is what happens when you stay in an unhealthy marriage for the kids, but I feel so sad for my Dad. I have tried to encourage him to pursue hobbies and passions and maybe volunteer to keep himself busy, but he says that doesn’t make him happy and that family does. I know he gets his sense of worth and happiness from his family which is not a good thing. It pains me to say it but I think my Dad wishes his life would come to an end now as he is so unhappy. They will never divorce, and both just endure misery until the end now. I just wondered if there was anything else I could do to make life easier and happier for my Dad, and how I can overcome my own feelings of sadness and guilt around the situation?",21Mar2020,1

1) I refuse to take breaks (unless boss tells me I have to, which they don't) unless I feel very emotionally unwell. I want money. Breaks aren't paid. I'm stubborn so yeah I will work 7hrs without a break if I feel like it.
2) not allowed to use phone - I'm way too busy for that!!!! Ain't no way!!!! I'll probably be written up or lectured despite other people doing the same thing (but im the runt of the group, those people don't like me i feel like)
3) bad wifi anyway if i got to use phone.
4) i do everything im asked and yes time goes by way faster than if there's no one ordering food. So ""do more work"" isn't really an option. I'm doing TONS of work.

Thanks!!!!!
Td;lr: how do i make time go by faster with no access to phone (too busy working) &amp; if I'm already working hard as is and doing lots of stuff?",21Mar2020,1

Yesterday when I read that California is under order to stay home, I told him, because I know hes stubborn. He said it's fine for him to do his usual stuff. I texted him again, and said if any of your usual stuff is non essential, and requires you to go in public, then dont do it. He called me later, and asked if I was okay. He then invited me to go to the beach with him. His gf, and her daughter. I said ""are you kidding me? Your on order to stay home"" he said ""son, I think your really overreacting about this"" I said ""no, I'm just a decent humane being who realizes there is a serious epidemic going on, and I'm not gonna go out, and potentially be responsible for someones death.

594,"Sorry in advance for the longer post. 

So my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been dating for a little over 2 years now and we live together. I truly love him so much but there are just things more recently that have been happening that I don’t like and I’ve tried to talk to him about but he’s just very resistant to compromise and seeing what bothers me and trying to change those things. He always says “well we just disagree” which is true but it’s not helping solve or fix anything. Prefacing these things we have problems with, he is not close with his family and they are not affectionate or anything at all. This is also his first relationship. I feel like these definitely play a factor into some of the problems but can’t be excuses forever. 

One thing is he isn’t affectionate anymore. When we first started dating he was and we would hold hands and kiss and lay together but probably over the last year is when he hasn’t been. He says he doesn’t like or care about those things, but I do and don’t understand why they stopped. He says he doesn’t care about “traditional things” that people “think they’re supposed to do” like kissing, saying i love you, asking how your day was, saying bye i love you when you leave the house, etc., just like common things you say and it doesn’t make sense to me. 

I also always feel when we have a disagreement or something or if someone is upset I always put in the effort to communicate and go talk to him but he never comes to me first and tries to fix things. I feel like I’m putting in all the effort. It also makes me feel like he doesn’t care when he doesn’t try to ask me what’s wrong or ever try to mend the situation. He says he doesn’t want to bother me but in my opinion it’s not bothersome to have someone care enough to come talk to me about an issue we’re having, it shows they care and want to put in the effort. Do others not think this?

He also never wants to have sex with me anymore. We used to all the time and then all of a sudden he never wanted to. We’ve had like one decent conversation about this like a year ago and he said he’s stressed because of college (we’re both seniors) and he’s insecure about how he looks now (he did gain weight but is by no means fat). Anytime I’ve tried to talk to him about this after that one discussion he shuts down and is like “i don’t want to talk about this again” and gets super annoyed that I even brought sex up. But how are we ever going to have sex or do anything again if you aren’t willing to talk or figure something out? 

I miss how it was when we first started dating. I don’t know if it was just the “honeymoon phase” and this is life after that but I feel like he was just a different person then and I want that person back. I hope that when we’re out of college and he isn’t under so much stress and is happier he changes but I can’t count on that and don’t know if I can wait. I feel so conflicted because I love him so so much but don’t know if we work in a relationship. I feel like I constantly am just hoping things will be different but I don’t want to be constantly wishing for something that could not happen. I don’t want to break up because he has so many positive qualities as well. He is smart, funny, attractive, we have a lot of the same interests, have the same political beliefs, same religious beliefs. It’s just fundamental things in a relationship we aren’t compatible on but idk if that’s enough to call it quits. By no means am I perfect and there are things I do that he doesn’t like but I feel like I try to talk to him about them and come up with ways I can be better. I’ve considered taking a break but it’s hard since we live together and see each other all the time anyway. Does anyone have similar experiences and know a way to work these problems out or is this relationship over at this point?",21Mar2020,1
595,"Not physical games. Digital. Some I buy, some... you know. Point is, when I download a videogame, I'm wasting internet. My data isn't unlimited and I need internet to work. I believe I have 200 GB or so of internet. 20 MB download speed. At first, I download a shit ton of games to keep myself busy during work. I interpret for latin americans in the US over Skype and most times, I'm mindlessly shooting something or questing while doing it. Keeps my mind off the stress of Child Protection Services calls and I never mess up a word or make a mistake. I'm good at what I do. But if I overdownload, my internet goes down to half a meg which is unacceptable and makes interpreting harder due to the voices being distorted at times. I ignore it and ask for a repition but I risk my job as if my supervisor finds out, I get suspended until my internet comes back which is the 4th of this month.

It's working fine right now, and I'm currently installing Fable Anniversary. I already downloaded it and I know, it's a game with so much content. I just started Skyrim as well. But I need more. More and more. I freaked when I finally got to play Mafia 2. I played two or three missions, downloaded Skyrim and now it's just sitting there. With Fable, I'm afraid Skyrim will do the same. So, how do I stop downloading videogames? Or at the very least, how the hell do I push my self into playing them enough to actually finish them?

I wish it'd be as easy as when I read. I download gigs of books and pick 5. I read 5 chapters out of each one, or if it's seperated into parts, I read an entire part. Then I switch and eventually, I finish every book I have. But I can't do that for videogames for some reason. Advice, please.",21Mar2020,1

599,"I’m an 18M and play a lot of Fifa on my PlayStation. Anyone who plays this game knows how rage inducing it is. I once had a friend in and we would play together in the party chat, and when he’d rage he’d say things such a “I hope you die of ______” or other vulgar disgusting phrases. After playing with him for a while I’ve know gotten in the habit of screaming these lines out without meaning them every time something goes wrong in a game of Fifa! 

I feel really guilty every time it happens even though nobody can hear me, and of course I never mean it whatsoever, it just blurts our. What can I do to break this habit? It feels like I’m automated to say these lines out of anger know and I hate the feeling it gives me after I calm down.

600,"For context I live in Turkey. Tonight the government announced a quarantine for people with pre-existing conditions and people over 65. (I don't know how that will be enforced.) While my dad is generally healthy, he is over 65, and can't seem to come to terms with having to quarantine for an extended period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

He frequently claims his good health and energy on swimming everyday, and is afraid of the negative effects of being ""senile"" at home. I've tried telling him that the benefits outweigh the costs, that you have to make some sacrifices, just like I will. But he claims that he will be safe, and he already avoids human contact by even crossing to the other side of the street upon seeing someone. Now he thinks he can avoid the quarantine by going through different routes to avoid being seen by officials. He already took a major risk by inviting me home when universities closed down. I don't want him to risk his life like this any longer. What should I tell him? He can sometimes get sensitive about issues surrounding his age, being worried about being seen as a burden, or a challenge. But he has a weird sense of his own mortality, and has been informed about this pandemic a good deal, but he just can't imagine the ""little"" town we live in could be of any threat to him.",21Mar2020,1
601,"This is going to be VERY long so I'm sorry for taking your time, but I really need some advise. Also I'm writing this on mobile so I'm sorry for any errors or formatting 
For starters, I'm a 19 year old man (transman but not important) I'm also a floor mat. Let me explain, I let all my ""friends"" walk over me and bully me every time I speak with them. The person I consider my best friend is my personal bully, and the person I spend about 80% of my week with. He is the main focus of this post because he is the most problematic friend I have. 
He has repeatedly called me names such: Dumbass piece of shit, moron, idiot, fucking child, stupid, dumb bitch, ""king of wanting attention""(I was called this by another friend of mine, not my ""bestfriend"") etc..
He always get pissed off at me for small things such as: Wanting to make the Ramen this time, making the Ramen ""wrong"", forgetting small details in a story, saying somthing ""stupid"", asking stupid questions even though I just want clerarification so I dont forget any small details, honestly if i kept going this list would be longer than this whole post. The point is i can never seem to do anything right in his eyes.
He will ask for my advise and when i give him my advise all he has to say to me is ""it's not that fucking deep man!"" 
He will constantly instigates conflicts by making passive aggressive remarks. Like if I'm trying to do the dishes so I can cook while he is making something he will get upset and say he doesnt even want to make his food anymore because I'm in the way
The reason he bullies me so often is because ""I was raised with tough love so that's how I show my love!"" But please tell me that this isnt love. Because I'm starting to believe that it is. 
He always gets upset when I show any emotion other than happiness or indifference. If he says somthing that hurts my feeling and I show any obvious sign of being upset he will say ""Did I fucking upset you?"" And then get pissed off at me for the rest of the day for being so sensitive. He says things that he KNOWS pisses me off and will talk shit about my Boyfriend AND my family to my face. Yet if I say anything slightly bad about his family or his Girlfriend he will fly off the rails and tell me off. 
 He yells at me for ""being to close to him"" when we sleep in my bed, even though most nights I wake up with him literally laying on top of me while I'm pressed against my wall, yet he still finds a way to say it's my fault that we got so close. 
He's made me more suicidal in the last 3 years than I was when i actually attempted to take my own life. I just dont know how to deal with him any more but due to my past I dont want to lose him as a friend; mainly out of fear of being alone. 


Also, I'm dating someone who I've only been with for 3 months. They already want us to move in together, they have talked to me about having babies together, and they are serious about getting pregnant once we move in together. Like deathly serious. (Hes a trans man and he said hes willing to go off of T in order to get pregnant) 
But I've NEVER wanted kids, I hate kids. Babies especially,  they are disgusting and so loud, they just drive me crazy. I could possibly think about kids in my future (like maybe when I'm 30 and done living my life) but the thought of having kids at 19 makes me so scared that I want to die just so I dont have to face my boyfriend and tell him that I dont want kids yet.
Before I met my current boyfriend (also a trans man) I was in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship that really fucked me up inside and I still get disgusted with myself every time I think about it. To the point where I can no longer take my shirt or underwear off whenever me and my BF get sexual. This person made me despise my body in ways that I never thought possible and I have really bad body dysphoria already. 
My current boyfriend is emotionally distant (he never seems interested in what I'm doing or how I'm feeling) and yet he will tell me that he loves me. And since I'm a floor mat I, regrettably, say it back, I know it's wrong of me to say it even though it isnt true. But he is a nice guy and I dont want to hurt his feeling. He never wants to do anything sexual with me unless Im the top, and that causes a lot of trauma from my previous relationship to blow up in my face. I really do like this person and they've helped me discover a thing or two about myself since we've been together, and I really do like the idea of moving in together. My current living situation isnt ideal, I live with my father who is very transphobic and he doesnt accept me for who i am. 
We are in a open Poly relationship (I've never been in a poly relationship before so I'm still very new. But I'm only dating my current BF) and he has another boyfriend who we will call D. Anytime all three of us hang out he is always hanging off of D, kissing him and playing with his hair and cuddling him; while I sit on his bed twiddling my fingers and feeling awkward and jealous. He hardly even looks at me when we hang out with D and it really hurts.


So now, here is what I need advise on, and I'm not sure if this will make much sense but you know, shoot your shot when the opportunity arises. 

How do I talk to these people about my issues that I have with them?

My best friend has been in my life for over 5 years now and even though most people who have friends for that long think it's really easy to discuss issues together, it's not that simple for me. I HATE conflict, but my best friend LOVES conflict. He thrives off of arguments and negativity (even tho he'll never admit it, it's very obvious) 
Every time I try to get my side of the story out there all he will do is tell me I'm wrong and that I'm just being a little bitch about it or that he was only fucking around and I need to learn how to take a joke. So, how do I talk to someone who wont listen to reason?

My boyfriend is a wonderful person, he is so open about his life and makes me feel so happy (most of the time) so I dont want to stop dating him. But his baby fever seems to be more important than me or my feeling. I would love to say that we can live together, have a wonderful life, get married, and then have kids; but right now it just seems like he wants to live together, have kids, and take care of kids. So, How do I discuss my fear of raising a child when i still see myself as a child as well? How do I tell him that he seems more attached to D even though he says he loves us both the same. 


If you made it this far, then thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to read this. I hope I made sense for the most part, but if not i understand. Any help is appreciated, I'm just worried that if i dont figure somthing out soon I'm not going to see much a future for myself. 
Thank you all so much and I hope you all have a wonderful day/night",21Mar2020,1
602,"She’s someone my boyfriend gives life advice and listens from time to time rather than a friend. He had rejected her multiple times and told her about his relationship with me (which she didn't took well and chose to confess to him then). Despite that, she still continues pushing herself to him. This has been happening for months, close to half a year. It's frustrating him and starting to make me feel uncomfortable. She makes it verbally clear that she goes out her way just so that she could see him (school, club activities).

There's a cycle to this and it always goes back to square one. I wish to talk to her about this if it gets too bad but I'm not entirely sure as to how I should go about it. I have talked to my boyfriend about my concerns and he doesn't mind either way. I feel like I may be thinking too much over this.

603,"23F US 

I live with my grandparents. They are both 72. The COVID-19 is spreading rapidly where I live. First death reported. My grandfather is compromised with a kidney condition and is a cancer survivor. 

I’ve been staying with my boyfriend for the past 4 days. 

I was going to go home &amp; gather some things to stay longer at his place, but my grandma told me please do not come home. She will gather my things &amp; leave them outside. Her voice broke, along with her heart, telling me this. She started to cry. She doesn’t want this... but it is the safest idea for them.

I have not been scared of this until now. I am TERRIFIED. I haven’t stopped crying for over an hour. Having my sweet grandmother gather my things &amp; leave them outside so I can stay with my boyfriend during a pandemic that could kill them... sends me into a downward spiral of sadness, fear, and despair. Not to mention I have been laid off, and have to claim unemployment.

604,"Okay, so my brother (19) and I (16), and still like with our parents.  We own a fairly big golden retriever and a Siberian cat.  Everyone in my family was perfectly content with out pet situation, a big dog to play and pet, and a cat that’ll come sit on your lap near the fireplace.

One day, during lunch my mom brought up the idea of a new dog, one that is smaller so they could sit in her lap.  My brother and I are immediately shut down this idea, because she already has a cat to cuddle with, and there is no point in getting another dog, since, we already have 2 pets, and our house doesn’t seem big enough to fit 3.  I mean my brother and I didn’t even want another dog, since we would be leaving the house within 4ish years.  My mother agreed, and said that we had a good point, and just dropped the topic of conversation entirely.

I thought that was that, but it turns out she was more set out for this dog than I thought.  A month or so later, the same conversation arose.  I made the same points as last time, and she agreed again.  This happened a couple more times, until yesterday, while doing homework in my room, my parents burst in with a small puppy on a leash.  I immediately thought, wtf, mom, you are the only person that wanted this dog, how did you get dad to agree to getting another dog.  That’s honestly pretty selfish of you and it was unfair that we did not even get a warning.

After shutting my door in anger, i just thought of situations that could arise from my saying certain things to my parents, as one does.

My brother came into my room about 20 minutes later and the following convo ensued.

B:what the fuck

M: i know right, this is ridiculous

B: I mean she (the puppy) kinda cute tho

M: ye, but I can’t believe that mom would do this without telling us, even when we warned her months earlier

B: ye that’s kinda fucked, i mean it’s mom so what are you gonna do

M (still fairly tense, prolly also because of quarantine as well):  That’s so selfish of mom, like we warned her and she still got one, we have a dog and a cat already, what more does she want?

B: honestly just refuse to take care or her, mom and dad can’t force us.

M: I guess, but I’m not mad at the dog, just mad at mom for not telling us, and just the action of getting a dog

So for the rest of the night I did not talk to either of my parents because I was upset. I slept on it, not knowing whether to tell my mom off (I mean that’s not really an option since she is a good mom, besides being selfish) or to just ride it out and not take care of the dog ( it’s just a dog, it didn’t hurt anyone).  Please let me know what I can do, because I don’t wanna hurt my mom or anyone, but I want to make it apparent that what she did was selfish and how disappointed I am in her.

610," I made a previous post about my ex girlfriend on my account.

Long-story short, we broke up so I could study abroad and the split was terrible. She said really mean things to me and never allowed us to talk again when I wanted to clarify some things. We shared an apartment, and I decided to leave my apartment key with her cause I trusted her, regardless.

While I was studying abroad, she called me after almost 2 months no contact to tell me that there was a lot of conflict with our other roommate that lives with us, and warned me not to believe things she said. I said okay. It was 3 in the morning. Then a week later, I get a call from that roommate and her other friends telling me a lot of messed up things that my ex did. One of the things that they told me she did was ""talk shit"" about me, and this hurt me deeply because there were some things that I had told her in confidence and they were telling me those things. I sent her a message telling her to stop talking about me, and to get some help. This was uncalled for on my part, and I believed the things that my roommates told me my ex had said about me because she had treated me so poorly during our break up.

After this, I also reacted by posting on instagram a picture of a location where I was at (it looked like a canyon). The caption mentioned that I was ""free of diamonds and emeralds""; these were pieces of jewelry she gave me (I never mentioned her name or specifics in the post). Even after we broke up, I still wore the jewelry she gave me religiously, because it felt like a part of her that I was holding onto. When I heard the things that she ""said"" about me, I simply stopped wearing them. She was not following me on instagram, so I guess one her friends showed her. She interpreted the post literally, believing that I had tossed the jewelry she gifted me into the canyon.

Then her whole entire family unfollows me on instagram and linked in. This hurt me because I was close with her mom, and she told me that whatever my ex and I had was between us. That I could always turn to her. She was like a mom to me.

I got sent home from my study abroad program due to the coronavirus. I was looking at my room, and my ex went through my room, and took back every gift that she had ever gotten me. Shoes, dresses, books, and even a water bottle that she took in spite.

I started freaking a little because I didn't think she would do something like that, and I suspected maybe it was my other roommate. My ex ignored my call. I had to text her mother, where she texted me ""it is my understanding that you threw the jewelry that she gave you in the canyon, which saddened us deeply. She will call you to discuss the apartment situation in a bit. Take care."" And that honestly broke my heart.

I later got on the phone with my ex, and we were finally able to speak without her being harsh towards me. I apologized to her for the message I sent her, because she told me that my roommates took her comments out of context and were trying to turn me against her. She told me that she took the things from my room that she paid for and had a receipt for, saying if I was going to throw them away, I shouldn't have them. I never planned to throw anything away. I only made the reference in my instagram post with the jewelry because those articles were sacred to me and her, and symbolized a lot.

I understand that what I did was immature with the instagram post, but I feel a little hurt. If she gifted them to me, do I not have a right to do what I want with them, especially when she treated me poorly during our break up? If we are ex's, why does it matter what I do and say? What do I take from this situation? I do not want back what she took from my room, I just don't want her or her family to hate me. I still am getting over her. I feel like I cannot trust anyone after this whole situation.

TLDR: Ex saw a post that a made where I vaguely joked about throwing away jewelry that she gifted me. She took her gifts from my room while I was away. I lost a relationship with her mother, who I cared for deeply. I do not trust my ex because she treated me poorly, but I still love her. I do not trust our old mutual friends because they tried to turn me against her and each other. How do I stop hurting from this situation? What do I take from it? Do I need to and how do I move on from losing these relationships with her and her mom?",21Mar2020,1
611,"My ""friend"" and I have had drama all throughout this year. He's called me a puppet master who is trying to control events so they play out the way i want them too, among other things. In late December i got q girlfriend. I thought she was the one for me but she's a douche but I'm not gonna go into that. My ""friend"" I'll just call him Eobard, he got with my ex just over 2 weeks after me and her broke up. He hid the relationship from me, then we got into more drama, my ex said she was on my side when she was dating him, blah blah blah. That brings us basically up to now. He dumps her, and he claims to be my friend again. I trust him but he has proven time and time again that he isn't trustworthy. First, I get another girlfriend, and like 2 days after he finds out me and her are dating he tells me ""dude, i have feelings for her."" Then a week after that, me and my ex start fighting. I trust Eobard enough to tell him what happened and I make a poor choice of words cause i was mad. At that point me and my girlfriend were arguing because all her friends don't want her to date me and I was pissed at my ex cause she's the main one that says things like that, and she claims to be my friend. I tell Eobard ""I'm mad enough to verbally kill her"" all i meant was yell. A few days later i find out he told her everything, and she's like ""you wish death on people blah blah I'm dumb."" He then proceeds to get mad at me and defends her, when he claims to be on my side. Then the cherry on top. He doesn't know me and my girlfriend are still dating, and he tried to get with my girlfriend! When i asked him about it HE LAUGHED ABOUT THE SITUATION. He said that i was right and he doesn't want me to be mad but he told me that he was gonna try to get us back together (he thinks we broke up) but instead he just tried to get with her.

But when it suddenly stops (the guy ends things), I'd be devastated and feel ugly. This has been going on for a year now and I realized it's a bad idea to place my happiness and self-esteem on others because I can't control them. I only have control over myself.

614,"Two years ago i quit college because i had the opportunity to work in fashion in paris and lived there until last year spring.

I was new to all, the art i did walked down the catwalk in two shows and got a good response but no further commission. I worked on several other shows as an assistant but became part if the creative team.
I don't want to blame it on the company, but they had financial issues and, more importantly, started having a bad reputation.

I learned a lot and basically learned everything you would in fashion school, how to build a company, talk.to investors and all that.

At some point we went into an argument as i started to feel used. I didn't get paid but that isn't unusual in fashion. 'be happy that you r even allowed to be here' was the vibe.

I lost a lot of weight and got sick, plus my savings came to an end and working as a waiter while working in fashion drained me.

So i went back home with my unfinished college and no real success from paris.

As my art got some attention but the rural area i live in doesn't offer much i thought to go back to the city, work a bit to keep me afloat, continue college and work on an exhibition in the meantime.

I am 30 now, so all feels a bit late, but i know it isn't 'too late' to do stuff.

So either i do that, or i stay in this rural place, work full-time and paint in the evenings.

For me it sounds more logical to go to the city. Work is just paid way less there than here, but it is easier to get my materials and also rent an atelier. Maybe also ask to see if galleries would take my work, i could work on that easily.

I lived in that city already for 4 years before, so it almost feels a bit boring to go back there. Yet, it was very comfortable and i am afraid to become too comfy and don't work on my art or on my college. 
Here in the rural there isn't much to do, so i am way easier focusing on painting than on other stuff.

yeah maybe someone has a though or two.",21Mar2020,1
615,"My parents opened a bank account for me a few years ago; I was there when it was set up. My mother claims that she forgot the PIN code or that *I* made the PIN (neither of these are true and she switches between them).

She won't let me have an online login either to check the balance and ignores me when I bring it up.

She also used to take most of my Christmas and birthday money as a child, or when I found money on the street she would claim that it was hers and she ""dropped it.""

Her cousin gave me $200 for my 16th birthday, I spent about $20 of it, then I asked my parents to deposit it to my bank account. My mother said something along the lines of ""we'll use the cash for groceries and just transfer the money from your father's account to yours."" I never got the money back. Whenever I bring it up she claims that I spent it all.

I currently have $34 saved up in a jar for a Nintendo Switch and I'm afraid she will try to take money out of it. She does not have a drug addiction and we are not poor, though she hasn't had a job in nearly 20 years. She claims she needs the money for public transit, yet she rarely rides the bus because my father drives her everywhere.

616,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend now for almost 6 years. We both still live at home with our parents (He stays at his house, I stay at mine). This Coronavirus has everyone in his family freaking out. My boyfriend and his brother both work retail and his dad works for a train company in an office with cubicles. They have all been staying home since Thursday and isolating themselves from the public (They don's suspect that they have the virus, they are just trying to keep from getting it). However, I do not have the luxury as I still am required to report to work (I work in a small office setting with 5 other girls.)

I am at work now (I work Saturdays in the office alone) and had planned for me and my boyfriend to go back to my house for the weekend. But now he is telling me that his family is weirded out about me coming and going as I please. No one at my house is sick and they rarely ever leave home (mom stays home, sister takes classes online full time). My boyfriend stated that I should just come over and stay at their house, but I feel like that means that I can't leave or once I do leave I can't come back. And there is no way I can stay home from work. 

This entire situation is stressing me out and I don't know what to do. I don't want something like this to affect our relationship. Should I go home and not be allowed to go over and see him? Or should I go to his house and not go to my own home to make them comfortable?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - BF's parents don't want me coming over if I have been at work or at my house due to the Coronavirus. They are too worried about getting sick although I am at a lower risk of catching it due to my home/work environment. Should I stay home and not visit my BF during this time?

620,"So me and my girlfriend broke up recently and because I'm emotional I need to have a bit of a rant over it, more for my own sanity. I would also really appreciate some advice on what I should do in this situation, because even though I've accepted the breakup and have no intentions on being the desperate psycho ex, I still have some lingering thoughts, and want to get some opinions on what I should do. Basically, I want my girlfriend back because she is truly something really special that I don't want to just give up on this easily (cliche I know but hey leave me alone) and I could totally see us working this out from my perspective.  But I'm afraid I'm being blind to her needs even though I'm trying not to be, so I need a bit of an outsider view on this. I want to know if you guys think I should try and get her back or if I should just move on and if so, how can I do that? Idk I'm very emotional and very confused and maybe getting some help from others might help me get a grip on the situation and help me decide how to proceed 😊 sorry if this is messy, I'm kinda just throwing this all here. I already posted this same rant on r/offmychest  but it's been buried and it got deleted by the adminbots lol.

  
Some context: The reason behind our breakup was not because either of us wanted to, but because my girlfriend felt like she needed to. We both have mental health issues, with hers being more serious and long term than mine and mine only having emerged recently and being a lot more manageable. She told me that because of past experiences with a self destructive ex, she felt that dating someone with the same mental health issues as her was too much for her, and that it was causing her own wellbeing to deteriorate. She didn't think that her past would be an issue when we got together but recently it flared up again and she told me that if she knew how bad it was going to get, she wouldn't have agreed to going on a date with me in the first place to spare us both the pain. I appreciate that mentality, and I really appreciate that she told me now and not 2 years down the line. She did not want to end it because she still had (has? idk) feelings for me but she just couldn't cope with the thoughts that my depression-related acts like skipping meals and having anxiety attacks were evoking in her. So, in short, it wasn't anyone's fault so to speak, it was just unfortunate circumstances that prevented us from being together, and of course I understand this. Even though we're not dating anymore, I still respect and care about her a lot and if being with me causes her pain, I'd be much happier if she went on without me. She told me that she doesn't know when she'll be ready to date someone with mental health issues, if ever, which is completely fair. We ended on good, though absolutely heartbroken terms, and we still keep in touch and have no intention of breaking off the friendship we have.

&amp;#x200B;

Whereas I'm completely okay with this and understand that even though I'm very much in pain, things will get easier, I want to get out some things I don't feel like she understood and I wish she'd listened to before jumping to a breakup conclusion. I don't feel like I got these out properly during our breakup talk because there was a lot of crying involved and she had the power in that situation. I couldn't really get my words right at the time, so I'm just gonna put them out here and get some opinions on them.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem about this is that my gf told me that she felt like she couldn't be there for me in the way that I needed her because of her own depressive episodes. But I feel like she's putting on way too much emphasis on that role and the truth is, I don't need her to the extent to which she thinks I need her. Whilst its true that I've had a rough few months where I've not been looking after myself and it's been worrying her to the extent that she's also unwell, I'm on the road to recovery, and because of the type of person I know myself to be and the fact that I've been here before and come out fine, it's not going to be long until I'm back to my old self. Not trying to be that asshole, but I genuinely know that I'll be fine. I went through something similar in high school and recovered perfectly, and when I was a kid I had a lot of shit which I came out of unscathed. The recent stress of uni, the stress evoked by my situation at home and the fact that there's no fucking sunlight all just kind of kicked off at the same time causing me to completely break down, but I went to get help. I'm now on medication and in therapy, both which are very helpful, and my own naturally positive mindset is boosting the effects of it. In comparison to my gf, my depression is rather moderate, I just had a really bad patch this year because I'd let it pile up a little bit. I don't need someone to look after me, I may have needed it now, but now that I've lived through it, I won't need it in the future. I know people are like ""how do you know that"" but trust me; like I said I've been here before, and on top of that I have been through so much shit in my life that not much fazes me anymore. Plus, in a relationship, I'm always the supportive one - I'm very good at coping with my own mental health on my own and don't need that outside person, especially now that I went and got proper help. I'm not expecting a partner to be my constant support pillar, because it won't be necessary in the future. For me it's enough if they just give me a hug and tell me they love me. Anyway I am very very willing to support a partner through the absolute worst of times, because it's something I'm good at, and coping by myself is fine. What makes me frustrated is that my gf kinda completely turned me down and refused to believe that I could do it and that I was getting better, which made me feel so damn inadequate. I tried explaining to her that she didn't need to put so much pressure on herself to be that supporter, but she kept insisting that she knew what it's like to live with depression and told me that it would be worse in the long run. I'm frustrated about that bc honestly? Ngl but because of my resilient nature and the fact that she is a complete pushover, I know I can cope with this stuff a lot better than she can. It sounds harsh and so awful from me but this is a fact. But I also understand her viewpoint and if theres anything I've learnt, is that you dont own a person. If they want to go, you have no right in stopping them. And who knows, maybe things for her are a lot worse than I can comprehend.

&amp;#x200B;

However, instead of a full on breakup, I suggested a break. This would give us both a chance to get our shit together and then try again, but she told me that ""it wouldn't be fair with both of us going home for the next few months"" - that's something I personally couldn't really understand, because I was fully prepared not to see her for a few months because of everything that's going on in the world right now, so why wouldn't it be fair? So unless there's something else that she isn't telling me, I don't really see why its an excuse for not going on a break but completely breaking up. I know she doesnt have to tell me anything if she doesnt want to, but I would appreciate it so much more if my partner straight up told me that they had a problem with me rather than made up excuses - even though I trust my gf and believe everything she tells me, I know that she's a naturally polite person who hates confrontations, and she would absolutely lie to my face in a situation such as this one just to make sure she wouldn't hurt my feelings. I'd much rather hear ""I don't want a break - you're too much like my ex and it's not good for me because its painful, so I dont want to date at all anymore"" than a vague ""it wouldn't be fair on either of us because we're not gonna see each other for a little while"". 

&amp;#x200B;

In any other situation, I'd be absolutely fine with letting this go in the first round. But the thing is, I'm very much in love with this girl and she's one of those special people who I'm not willing to give up on so easily - but I also understand that there might be more to this situation that I'm not seeing bc of emotions or inexperience or whatever. So I want to know: what does everyone here think? I don't want to screw this up any more so I would appreciate opinions. Should I just drop it and accept it for what it is? Or should I say fuck it, go for it, call her, tell her to shut up and listen and get my honest opinions across? Or should I wait, treat this as a break and see how we feel in a few months? Because I dont know, but I feel like this is something that we could absolutely work through together, especially with me getting better, and I want her to either see that, or admit to me once and for all that this isn't what her heart wants. Because well, if she's being honest and she still has feelings for me, I don't see why we shouldn't at least try to work on it?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this, I just really needed to vent. Also I would just accept it as it is, but my stubborn ass is not gonna just give up on someone this special if theres something I know I can do about it, and the way I see it: if you have to think about these things more than regularly then they're probably asking to be dealt with. But also I dont want to come across as controlling or obsessive, so I just wanted to know if it was normal human behaviour to try and ask for one more chance with someone you're genuinely In love with rather than just throwing in the towel at the first sign of a problem. I mean I'll get through this no matter what, this is just a lingering thought I wanted to deal with.",21Mar2020,1

628,"TW: suicide mention

So a little backstory. I come from a nigerian household who are very traditional. Never agreed with the whole respect your elders even if they are awful people notion. 

A little while ago I had a massive falling out with my family based on who I chose to hang out with. I started to have feelings for my brothers colleague (who always bitched about my brother to me). And that is what set them off. They called me slut and every name under the sun bc of it. In the end, I found out he was an ass anyway and his brother saved me from being ""taken advantage of"". Who I then started hanging out with as a friend. 

This is when my family went even harder on me. My cousin calling all 3 of us sending death threats and other threatening things. As well as my aunty calling me up just to call me a slut over and over again, leading me to go down a rabbit hole where I just felt so depressed and suicidal. My friend at the time. Let's call him John. Took me to the hospital to try and prevent me doing anything bad. 

My family found out and proceeded to make me feel shit about going to the hospital with him, as well as feeling suicidal in the first place. My aunty then said to me ""why would you go with him? That's not right. It is better that you kill yourself than hang out with him"". Me knowing full well that my family dont care if I'm suicidal or not in the first place, this dug very deep and I havent really talked to her since.

I dont want drama so I avoid talking to her as much as possible other than when I absolutely have to such as greeting her when I see her. But she went to Nigeria with my mum and I called my mum on my aunties birthday (not realising it was her birthday) and refused to speak to her or to say happy birthday to her. I did this because I dont want to be two faced and explained over and over again I just want an apology from her, which she wont give to me.

My girlfriend moved one town over after running away and we’ve been keeping in touch for a while and apparently she crashed with one of her ex’s, who she is now sleeping with. He texted me one day on his phone after seeing me text her, he sent me the usual “You need to stop texting (girlfriends name)” along with some threats. I asked him why I needed to stop, he said it was because she was his girlfriend. I explained the situation to him and he was actually very understanding and apologetic. She’s been trying to text me for about a week now and I’ve just been ignoring her. Then she learned that I found out about the cheating and got mad at me because she believes it’s my fault that she’s cheating on me because I didn’t want to have sex with her (for context I’m 17 and she’s 16 and I’m personally not ready for sex). As soon as she accused me of what happens I immediately ceased all contact with her.

I need some advice! 

At the moment I work as a molecular biologist in a private company however I originally trained as a haematologist in the health service. When I graduated I wanted to get back into the health service but there were no jobs available.

Due to the current COVID-19 crisis I’ve now been offered a haematology job where I did my clinical placements. The problem is that they want an immediate start and my current employer has stipulated in my contract that I’m required to give two months notice. So my question is this, I know that I want to work back in the health service long term so should I breach my contract and fail to work my notice or should I refuse the health service job and continue where I am until a less urgent post comes up. 

I’m hoping that my current employer will recognise the circumstances and that the health service are requesting that I be released from my notice period but I also really like the people I currently work with and really want to resolve this without ending on bad terms with anyone. At the end of the day I’m being offered the job I’d like to do for the rest of my foreseeable future so I’m keen to take it. Preferably without bad feelings involved!

644,"I dropped from school and studies, I never had friends or been in a romantic relationship, I learned soon enough that I was forgetable and went back to live in my mother's basement after being fired from my last job. In short, I became the cliché of the antisocial neckbeard that isn't worth anything. In short, a loser. 

At the end of the day, it's just about trying to make something out of your life, some manage, others don't. I tried getting an education, getting friends or romance, do something artistic. In a sense I'm amazed that I ended up with no social life, no professional life and no artistic life. 

After enough failed attempts, I decided to do the opposite and accept my lot in life and contend myself with whatever I have. I read a lot to forget myself, works pretty well, I've learned to not bother people in any way and it works quite well too. But at times, I still delude myself and start dreaming about a life I don't and can't have.

Context: My cousin's wedding was planned for march 28th. Then Coronavirus happened. Cousin did not want to cancel the wedding. Family did some coercing. Cousin eventually cancelled the wedding party.
But not the ceremony. She plans to have a small ceremony with only close family and friends (unlike the original 200+ guest list).

Problem: attending this ceremony involves flying to another city and breaking quarantine. This is already irresponsible, but not the worst problem. My mother has a depressed inmune system and that's what scares me the most. Airport, plane, hotel... people. I'm panicked that she'll catch this cocksucking virus.

My mom is hellbent on going. She says that if it was me she would like my family to support me... that she owes it to my cousin... that it could drive a wedge in our relationship with her... but she's also scared of what might happen if she gets sick.

I love my cousin to death and it hurts my heart that I can't be there for such an important occasion. I'm scared she won't forgive us if we don't go or hold a grudge forever. This was very important to all of us. My cousin is loved by the whole family. She's one of the best people I know and the closest thing I have to a sister.

649,"Before I start, I don't think I'm a bad person for feeling this way- I would never act upon any of my feelings, I think I am just confused. Either way there is no one in my life I can talk to about this.

I guess I'm just looking for a second opinion.

So here it goes...

The night I met my boyfriend (who I'll call John), we were at a party. He was with his other friend who I'll call Dan. John and Dan are good friends and have been since high school. John is 22, Dan is 20, I am 19.

 I went to the same high school as John for a year, and we always knew of each other and had lots of mutual friends; despite that though, we never talked and I switched schools after my grade 9 year. We met at this party a couple years after I finished high school. 

Naturally I gravitated towards John at this party since he was a familiar face, which was exciting. His friend Dan was polite, drunk, and reserved. I'm a shy person and usually wait for someone to approach me first, so even though he was with John all night we never actually spoke. Unfortunately this is where I wonder if I would have been happier now if I spoke to Dan that night instead of John... 

The next days following party John and I started talking and hanging out, and eventually started to date. Our relationship did move very fast, and we ended up moving in together before we had even been together for a year. This was less a move of love and passion, and more so it was kind of forced on us due to situational circumstances. 

I feel like we got in over our heads before we knew each other well enough; because after almost a year of living with this man who I do love, I feel like we don't line up as well as we may have thought. We have very different values and goals and attitudes. And of course difference is important, but there needs to be some common ground; and the things I value for example, are very important to me.

John is very attached to me though, but because he has asperger's I can't tell if that plays a role. Maybe he latched on so fast because he didn't want to possibly be alone? Another thing I have noticed is that he seems a lot less mature than I feel someone at that age should be, which can sometimes be embarrassing honestly. And we certainly don't click on an intellectual level... This hurts though because he has told me that every girl he has been with has left him because of his disorder. I don't want to be another person to walk out on him, he really is a good guy. I'm just in a situation where I'm not sure if love is enough to equal compatibility.

I would feel this way regardless of his friend Dan's presence in my life; but that's the thing. This Dan guy gets me. We value the same things, have the same interests (John and I don't even like the same movies)- and the point is, I'm starting to feel like John's friend Dan may be a better match for me.

Obviously due to their friendship I can never be with Dan; and to be clear, I still want to work on my relationship with John. I just can't help that wonder if I made the right choice at that party. I feel like if I knew what I know now, I would have talked to Dan. 

Judge me how you will, but if I am going to spend my life with someone, I want it to be the right person and someone who I can be 100 percent happy with. We only get one life, ya know?",21Mar2020,1

I live at home with my grandparents were are 67 and 62 and have health problems so they are isolating, they want me to stay at home also to not get the virus and pass it to them. I have asthma and a skin condition that makes my immune system low.

However they had me going shopping but yet didn't want me to go out for a drink with my boyfriend stuff and wanted him to come up to my house and he did and now they don't want him up at all but are letting my uncle bring his 9-year-old child who is 'threating' because he is so used to seeing my granny all the time but can't because of this, but also my aunt who has health problems has been up also. My brother has been going to and from the shop and is being told to wash his hands and stuff.

They constantly want me to be positive but are constantly making everything doom and gloom talk about deaths and how things are going to change etc and there has only been like a couple of deaths here, I know I sound selfish but I have been in a relationship for 8 years and I don't know when I will see my boyfriend again because my grandparents are saying even when this is all over they don't want me going out until a vaccine is made which will take 18 months and also extra months until they find a cure so roughly 2 years they want me to spend in the house. I am already in here a week and I am starting to remember why I never spend that much time in this house, I am miserable, they fight 24/7.

All I want to do is go a drive in my boyfriend's car not even go out into shops or anything, I just want to get out of the house and see my boyfriend but I know if I ask I was being shouted at and if word gets out to my uncle he will shout at me for risking his mum and dad's life.

I was told if I go out to stay out and not infect the rest of my family.

I just want some hope right now and living in my house is making me not have much hope with only the bad news reporting and talked about but not about the people recovering, I'm 22 and I feel hopeless right now.

Anyways, every time I go to visit her she asks me to bring her a coffee and never pays back (once she offered but never followed through).

673,"Trying to decide what to do. Dual citizen USA/Brazil, my immediate family is in Florida and my extended family on the Brazilian side is here. I am looking at taking the next direct flight out back to Florida but considerably worried about the situation in the United States which appears to be advancing and also worried about going back to my early 60s parents' house after possibly being exposed here or during travel. Obviously 14+ day quarantine will be in effect (suite bedroom in back of house with private entrance) but still worried. 

I am currently in São Paulo Brazil where I have a comfortable solo living arrangement but the virus is starting to make its first waves here and there is some uncertainty as to how hard it will hit and what effects it may have on the function of essential services and general societal order. The president is a disgrace and much of the federal government is appearing to be caught quite flat-footed and is rather ineffective in general. My concern isn't too much about getting sick as to my understanding I'm not in the high-risk category but more so quality of life and comfort during this stressful time. I just can't figure out whether I am better off staying here or going back to the USA.

Sāo Paulo strengths:  


* Millions of people (out of \~20 million) have already begun a voluntary quarantine starting last week, my area is middle-upper class where people are staying home, essentially mimicking the response in Italy. This is happening relatively early in the onset vs. other countries.
* Mandatory non-essential commerce closures begin Tuesday for 15 days minimum and could help get a handle on things early on
* I live in my own space (I need regular independence/alone time) have everything I pretty much need and I like to cook so having my own kitchen is kind of a big deal

Weaknesses:

* Other parts of the city people are not observing the quarantine recommendations. There won't be too much enforcement other than police busting parties and other public gatherings of people. The dynamics of SP and other Brazilian cities creates insurmountable challenges in effectuating a full lockdown. Brazilians, especially the uneducated which there are so many, are known to not behave and even act out against the establishment in certain situations.
* All public transport (subway and bus) remains open as many now essential workers utilize it to get to work, but it is not restricted to these people. which facilitates immensely the dissemination of the virus throughout the region. Peak hours are still full-boat, nurses in uniform have been being harassed on trains and people just coughing or sneezing is causing panic and confusion 
* Forecast is that health system will begin to collapse in April and by the end of April will be fully collapsed-- There simply won't be enough supply for the forecasted demand.
* Health minister predicts that Brazil will not start flattening curve until July and into September.
* I live alone and have no intention of personally meeting with friends or family until things were to truly start panning out. Virtual conferencing is novel and fun right now but I think after some time its going to be tough without any physical contact

I prepared before things got weird and have \~ 30 day food supply maybe longer with proper calorie rationing. I am worried that things could get tricky as there are rumors with trucker unions also choosing to quarantine for the sake of their own health vs. working to keep the country's supply logistics in place. There are worries that there will be systemic breakdowns which would lead to civil unrest like looting and robbery of stores, ATM robberies, home invasions etc. Winter is coming and hunger makes people do crazy things to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is USA

Strengths: 

* Being with immediate family and a dog
* My city Tampa is much extremely less densely populated than SP
* While I lack confidence in the federal and FL state response being sufficient at this time, I hold more faith in the US government and businesses to solve this than Brazil. 
*  I don't foresee the US experiencing civil unrest (but its happened before)
* Industry people say food supply is ample and will remain intact. Also we have Publix in Florida and knowing the kind of company they are, I feel that we are in good hands there.

Weaknesses:

* the situation is further advanced and there is still no unified response to get things under control before it starts getting bad in currently less-affected regions. Maybe this is a strength that it could be assumed to be closer to the end, going back would be like skipping forward a couple weeks.
* From what I understand many people in Florida are still conducting life as usual and for whatever reason they just aren't believing it or this all hasn't sunk in yet.
* News and hysteria. USA media really likes to max out the sensationalism and it affects our collective mental health
* Mandatory 14-day quarantine in a bedroom 1/5 the size of my current apartment (but I have access to outdoors)
* I usually have a couple months at my parents house before I start getting hair-brained and need to get out. It is not my family per se, but me needing my own space and independent lifestyle

I am much leaning towards USA but I keep looking back and forth at the news and one day things seem to be a better bet in one place and other day the other, when weighing all circumstances. This is happening everywhere and there's not really anywhere to escape, its gonna suck either way but to varying degrees.

Dont want to be the same idi\*\* who always risks his relationship with an angel anymore.  
What should I do?  
And, even if I´m able to change, what could be the next step? How should I approach her? Or, should I leave her alone?  
Please, any advice would be welcome",21Mar2020,1
676,"What to suggest to employer about coronavirus?

We are landscapers, dad is owner. He hasnt been worried and been downplaying coronavirus since the start. We landscape HOSPITALS only. I told him I’m a little concerned and have gotten threatened to be fired twice. He says don’t go to work today then blows up 30 min later and says he has to do all the work now.

Yes he has always been a hot head. He told me to “learn my rights” today in a sarcastic tone. He also said I’m lucky to still have a job right now (I am) and how 90% of the world has been laid off with no compensation. He’s a little narcissistic and always has been. Idk what to do anymore with him threatening my pay. Last thing I texted him was whatever I’ll just keep working.. 

He makes like 100k a month while I make 3k a month and he brags about it saying “we made 100k today” I know I need to look elsewhere and I am but I’m stuck for another 2-3 months. 

Forget to add he’s been threatening me my whole life with things and now he’s saying he can just sub out all the work and doesn’t need us. He’s given me long lasting severe anxiety and depression for things he can never take back. He’s worried about paying unemployment I can tell.

TLDR owner can’t make his mind up if we get time off and he’s money hungry. Said to take day off today then shortly after threatened my job for listening to him. Still threatening my job and I want to leave the company the right way with everything documented. He does not want to pay unemployment.",21Mar2020,1

We have always been there to support Kyle, and I have stood up for him when people give him hard time because he is gay. Yet he can’t always seem to be there for his friends. He will lash out at people for seemingly insignificant things, and his whole family will back him up and trash talk whomever it is he doesn’t like. It’s very vindictive, and they say “family is thicker than friends” as an excuse to support each other in any manner. 

I think he has also been jealous of us getting married and living together, and seeing other friends doing the same. While he is still living at home at 30yrs old with a stable good paying job, he could easily afford to move out. So it seems he turns his jealousy against his friends. Calls people slutty behind their backs, although he normally encourages said person to dress provocatively. Etc.. 

He hasn’t been doing a great job in his duties as man of honor, and is showing more interest in his own time and self than my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party whom are all very excited to plan a party and wedding. 

Over the last few months he’s been subtly poking at my fiancé and calling her thick, “comfortable”, saying she has a tummy etc. he says it in a “cute” manner but that’s no excuse. He knows her ex and mom have both body shamed her. 

IF YOU SKIMMED THE REST READ THIS: 
we just had our engagement photos done and we are both very happy with them. So of course she sent him some and we never heard a thing from him until a couple weeks later. Kyle posts a Snapchat story with his father and him looking at our photos and laughing and comparing my fiancé to his daughter in law (who is pregnant so she is bigger), and even asked if my fiancé “really works out?”, laughing some more and saying “well yes the background looks great”. With a total mocking over tone to the whole thing. 

I called him out immediately when I saw it and he ended up deleting. Tried to say he wasn’t laughing he was “choking”. Finally admitted what he did was wrong quickly said “I understand if you don’t want me in the wedding”. 
We let him know we are both not pleased, and need time to think.

A week later my fiancé gets a message from the Dad protecting his son, saying his son is the most giving person of our friend group and “that’s just a fact”, and we all have our “plus n minuses”.

690,"Hello,

I didn't really find a good sub to ask this in, so I'm posting here. My grandfather currently is stuck in his home due to the epidemic. I'm looking for things he can do to pass the time and not get too lonely. His wife died a couple of years ago, me, my mother and my aunt are advised not to visit him (apart from dropping off groceries), his eyesight is really poor so he can't read books anymore or watch television with subtitles, and worst of all, he's recently had an inguinal hernia but the surgery is being postponed to an unknown date to make space for Covid patients in the hospital. He used to work in his garden all day but due to his recent inguinal hernia he is advised to limit this (plus it hurts a lot).
So my question is: what can he do during his time? I thought of podcasts or something but he has never used internet so I don't know how we would get this to work. Any advice is welcome!

Thanks",21Mar2020,1
691,"My fiancé has a long time friend, who I became friends with as well over our years dating. This guy, we will call him Kyle, is supposed to be her “man of honor” in her wedding. Taking the place of a mutual friend who sadly past away and was the maid of honor. 

We have always been there to support Kyle, and I have stood up for him when people give him hard time because he is gay. Yet he can’t always seem to be there for his friends. He will lash out at people for seemingly insignificant things, and his whole family will back him up and trash talk whomever it is he doesn’t like. It’s very vindictive, and they say “family is thicker than friends” as an excuse to support each other in any manner. 

I think he has also been jealous of us getting married and living together, and seeing other friends doing the same. While he is still living at home at 30yrs old with a stable good paying job, he could easily afford to move out. So it seems he turns his jealousy against his friends. Calls people slutty behind their backs, although he normally encourages said person to dress provocatively. Etc.. 

He hasn’t been doing a great job in his duties as man of honor, and is showing more interest in his own time and self than my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party whom are all very excited to plan a party and wedding. 

Over the last few months he’s been subtly poking at my fiancé and calling her thick, “comfortable”, saying she has a tummy etc. he says it in a “cute” manner but that’s no excuse. He knows her ex and mom have both body shamed her. 

IF YOU SKIMMED THE REST READ THIS: 
we just had our engagement photos done and we are both very happy with them. So of course she sent him some and we never heard a thing from him until a couple weeks later. Kyle posts a Snapchat story with his father and him looking at our photos and laughing and comparing my fiancé to his daughter in law (who is pregnant so she is bigger), and even asked if my fiancé “really works out?”, laughing some more and saying “well yes the background looks great”. With a total mocking over tone to the whole thing. 

I called him out immediately when I saw it and he ended up deleting. Tried to say he wasn’t laughing he was “choking”. Finally admitted what he did was wrong quickly said “I understand if you don’t want me in the wedding”. 
We let him know we are both not pleased, and need time to think.

A week later my fiancé gets a message from the Dad protecting his son, saying his son is the most giving person of our friend group and “that’s just a fact”, and we all have our “plus n minuses”. His son has never been the most giving, sometimes he is caring sometimes not. But that statement itself was more divisive. 
Also why does his dad need to do that?

706,"Hi,

I'm 19, and my parents are split up. Throughout my entire life, if I asked my parents the same exact question, I would get two wildly different answers. I never knew who was telling the truth and who was lying.

Well, I am currently at my mom's house with a case of COVID19 (I'm ok), quarantined to my bedroom. My mom made a Facebook post letting family members and anybody else who I may have been in contact with know that I have it so that they van be vigilant about their own health and be on the lookout for symptoms. She had my permission to do this, it was just a lot easier than her having to call everyone individually.

My dad saw this and called her, furious. He was calling her a bad mother, accusing her of using my illness to get sympathy from others, and called her disgusting for posting it. He made my mom cry, he was so awful. The living room is right next to my bedroom and the speaker on her phone is loud - I heard everything.

Later, he called me, and I talked to him about it. He claimed that he was calmly asking her to change it so that I wasn't being put on blast, and that it was all for my benefit, and that he wasn't;t mean to her at all. I know that that's a lie, but he got so mad when I tried to contradict him that I had to drop it.

I don't know what to do. I do not want him talking to and about my mom the way that he does, and I don't want him to lie to me. It's getting to the point that I don't know if he's ever being sincere with me, but I can never talk to him about it because he flips out.

We will also have the ability to put money from our current house into an emergency fund encase one of us loses a job. I've estimated that we should be OK for 6-8 months.

Im in a couple of group chats cause I have no friends left and I had hope of gaining new ones and I became a target for their laughter,saying me not wanting to show my face is because I’m fat and treating me like meaningless garbage...which I am.
Im tired,I’m lonely and I’m no one,I’m just another number on the suicide counter soon.
So do me a favor,tell me painless ways to do it...please.
Also,sorry to ask but one more thing,any ideas on how to say goodbye without making anyone think I will do it? They’ll be happier if I’m gone anyway.",21Mar2020,1
712,"My friend, Paula (age 20, who I have known since elementary school) has a bad relationship with her dad for a number of reasons. Her dad had an on/off girlfriend, Sam, that had a her own issues. Paula mostly cut off contact with her dad months ago and only sees him at family parties which happen once in a while. Paula also stopped talking to Sam because Sam would often ask Paula about her dad when they were broken up. 

Since Paula cut contact with Sam, Sam has also stopped talking to Paula’s dad and seems to be living her own life. Paula, however keeps looking at Sam’s Facebook using a fake account. Paula blocked Sam on her regular Facebook account.

Paula sends me screenshots from Sam’s Facebook occasionally. One was on Sam’s birthday, Sam made a post about going out and made a poor-taste joke about partying so hard she ends up at the homeless shelter where she works. Paula wanted to have a whole conversation about this post that I just sorta nodded along with because I felt like there wasn’t much to say. 

Anyway, this morning Paula sends me a screenshot of Sam’s Facebook. Sam wrote a status about going under quarantine for 14 days. Sam’s post talked about how she has survived other very severe health issues so she has faith that she will live through this crisis. SHE NEVER SAID SHE HAS COVID-19, just to be clear. Her post went on to say that people should continue to keep in touch via phone and everyone should support each other from a distance as the world goes through this. 

 I thought it was a nice message but Paula was just pissed off and sent this long message to me about how Sam was lying about everything and Sam previously said she had been shot in the head. Paula thought that it was impossible to live after being shot in the head.

I explained that it’s totally possible to live after being shot in the head. I sent her Gabby Giffords’ Wikipedia page. I also explained that the two health conditions that Sam talked about battling through in her status were medically accurate, in that they were two conditions that often go hand in hand.

Paula went off saying that Sam has said she’s been beaten by an ex, in two car accidents, had some other health issues... so Paula is obviously lying because all those things don’t happen to one person. I didn’t respond to that message. Then Paula went off on me saying “why are you taking Sam’s side, you don’t even know you, you should be on my side and believe me, everyone in my family knows she’s lying, she never showed us pictures or any medical records, blah blah blah”. 

Then Paula said that Sam’s status (that she sent to me) said Sam has COVID-19. I was confused because Sam’s status simply said she was in quarantine. Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. Being in quarantine doesn’t automatically mean you have the illness, it just means stay in your house away from others! So I just responded saying that since there are very few cases in our area, if Paula wants to check that Sam has COVID-19 then she could simply google our city name and COVID-19. A new case would definitely be reported upon by the news due to there being very few cases here. 

I went on to say that all I was saying was that what Sam was saying made sense. Idk if she’s lying or not about the rest of her issues, I’ve never met the lady and don’t know the lady. 

I will say that the only reason I didn’t nod along with what Paula was saying is because I’ve heard soooo much about Sam and how mad Sam makes Paula. I feel like if Paula’s that mad she should just not look at Sam’s Facebook anymore. I don’t bother saying this to Paula because it’s not worth it. It also bothered me that she was just disregarding facts. Lately Paula has also been annoying me so I think this was just kinda the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

Paula went on to say that she thinks Sam is going to go to her (Paula’s) dad’s apartment while she is sick since Paula understood Sam’s status to say COVID-19 is no big deal. Paula’s grandparents live in the apartment above Paula’s dad’s so there’s concern there. 

I responded by saying that Paula went to her boyfriend’s apartment earlier this week. For all she knows, her boyfriend’s neighbor could be a 97 year old or there could be immunocompromised individuals living in the building. So we should all be aware during this time, since any one of us could be a  [Typhoid Mary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon)[/patient 31](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2020/03/31-south-korea-sudden-spike-coronavirus-cases-200303065953841.html)

Now Paula isn’t talking to me and she’s probably telling everyone she knows how I don’t believe her. When I never said I don’t believe her, I was just saying it’s totally possible to get shot in the head and live and it’s possible to have these two awful conditions Sam said she had.

713,"So I've had a bit of a tough year. I had to dropout of school because I got a brain injury last year, and I've been coping with symptoms ever since. In February I finally moved into a two-bedroom apartment after sharing a one-bedroom with a sibling for a very long time. It felt like something was finally looking up. Now with the coronavirus quarantines and job losses, it looks like I'm not going to be able to pay my rent. I am just absolutely devastated, and having very intense panic attacks. I don't know what to do, my family is really stressing out, as they are probably going to lose their jobs. I live in BC now and my family is back in Ontario. I feel like moving to this new apartment was the only thing in my life that was going well, and now it's being ripped away, I don't know what to do",21Mar2020,1

Thank you and be safe out there.",21Mar2020,1
717,"Should I bring it up or not? Maybe I should just move?

So here is the background. I recently went through an unexpected breakup mid January.  I needed to leave the house. I'm older (F35), and was not at all expecting to have to move. Most of my friends are now grown and settled with families. I am lucky enough to have a set of friends that let me stay with them. They have 2 other adult children who are really awesome who have already moved out. The arrangement is temporary basis because they would like their house, and because their youngest daughter is more than a handful at home right now.

Moving in I knew she was at a real bad place in her life. Making bad decisions hanging out with some super shady people. Her parents have been battling her behavior for several years now. She has definitely wore them down. They have kicked her out in the past to try to stop the behavior, but she will break into their house if they don't let her in anyway. They love her and want her to have a safe place to stay. 

My room is on the same side of the house as hers and shares a wall. She is loud with her friends in the mornings as they get amped up to cause whatever trouble during the day. She has like 2-4 girl friends that come to the house, hangout, and shower everyday (which I didn't know about moving in since we share a shower). She has also had men come into her room with certain girls and then she and other friends hangout in the car while the other people play loud music in the room. Sometimes her friends hangout in a car outside while she stays in the room with people. I have overheard comments and there is a lot of showering/shady young men coming in and out of her room. Not all day but usually at least a couple of times a day. I'm pretty sure it's a small prostitution ring. I had a mutual friend of ours also confront me with the facts after staying the night on the couch and two men came into her room and left after about 30 minutes and she said it was fairly obvious they had just come to have sex with her. I think I had been in denial about the actual activities up until that point. 

I think her parents have been turning a blind eye because it's too hard to deal with. Or possibly they know what's going on and don't want her to get hurt out on the streets. I haven't said anything, but I don't really want to live there anymore. It's just awkward and sad. 

I'm not against sex work, and I think it's good for a lot of people. I just don't think this situation is right, and I think these girls are very emotionally immature and possibly being coerced. Sorry this post is so long. There are so many other things going on here as well, I'm trying to keep it brief.

I fear that my country will be hit the hardest by COVID-19 pandemic due to its huge population, appalling healthcare services, and a moronic, myopic, and lackadaisical government that's taking Italy's approach (entertaining in the balconies) instead of South Korea's effective approach (mass testing) to deal with this pandemic. Our government isn't even acknowledging community transmission despite numerous and glaring evidence. 

I fear that when it's all said and done, my region's death count will shadow China's, Iran's, and Italy's current numbers, *combined*. I'm at one of the toughest crossroads in my life: should I move back into my mum's home or should I stay put and prepare for the upcoming shitstorm on my own? 

My fear is that if I make the journey:

a) I risk contaminating myself while at the airports or during the 3 hour long flight.   
b) I risk contaminating my mum despite taking utmost precaution and quarantining myself for a month in my one bedroom without ever seeing her during this time.

If I don't make the journey: 

a) I will constantly fear for the safety of my mum due to total societal collapse and the riots, looting, and shootings that'd follow.  
b) I might run out of medical supplies or be unable to find medical help in an emergency. My mum's a doctor with her own inventory of medicines (this is another thing that puts her at a higher risk of a looting), so that's an essential reason for me to travel. 

I've already booked a one-way ticket for next month, but I'm changing my mind every hour. The restrictions on domestic transport between states seemingly subside by the 31st of March, so I might have a very short window to return home before an indefinite nation-wide lockdown freezes any possibility of my movement.

739,"My fiancé has a long time friend, who I became friends with as well over our years dating. This guy, we will call him Kyle, is supposed to be her “man of honor” in her wedding. Taking the place of a mutual friend who sadly past away and was the maid of honor. 

We have always been there to support Kyle, and I have stood up for him when people give him hard time because he is gay. Yet he can’t always seem to be there for his friends. He will lash out at people for seemingly insignificant things, and his whole family will back him up and trash talk whomever it is he doesn’t like. It’s very vindictive, and they say “family is thicker than friends” as an excuse to support each other in any manner. 

I think he has also been jealous of us getting married and living together, and seeing other friends doing the same. While he is still living at home at 30yrs old with a stable good paying job, he could easily afford to move out. So it seems he turns his jealousy against his friends. Calls people slutty behind their backs, although he normally encourages said person to dress provocatively. Etc.. 

He hasn’t been doing a great job in his duties as man of honor, and is showing more interest in his own time and self than my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party whom are all very excited to plan a party and wedding. 

Over the last few months he’s been subtly poking at my fiancé and calling her thick, “comfortable”, saying she has a tummy etc. he says it in a “cute” manner but that’s no excuse. He knows her ex and mom have both body shamed her. 

IF YOU SKIMMED THE REST READ THIS: 
we just had our engagement photos done and we are both very happy with them. So of course she sent him some and we never heard a thing from him until a couple weeks later. Kyle posts a Snapchat story with his father and him looking at our photos and laughing and comparing my fiancé to his daughter in law (who is pregnant so she is bigger), and even asked if my fiancé “really works out?”, laughing some more and saying “well yes the background looks great”. With a total mocking over tone to the whole thing. 

I called him out immediately when I saw it and he ended up deleting. Tried to say he wasn’t laughing he was “choking”. Finally admitted what he did was wrong quickly said “I understand if you don’t want me in the wedding”. 
We let him know we are both not pleased, and need time to think.

A week later my fiancé gets a message from the Dad protecting his son, saying his son is the most giving person of our friend group and “that’s just a fact”, and we all have our “plus n minuses”. His son has never been the most giving, sometimes he is caring sometimes not. But that statement itself was more divisive. 
Also why does his dad need to do that?

747,"I’m just starting to type but I know this is gonna be pretty long. Only start reading if you’re gonna care to finish. Thank you for listening in advance. Any advice helps.

Alright, so here it is, the full story. It sounds so long, but only happened in the span of a few months. Before we start, this is about me and a girl. I’ll call her Symone, her middle name. If you want to fully visualize this in ur head or something idk: she’s blonde, kinda pale but also like perfect skin tone for her personally, she’s about 5 foot 6, I have black hair, olive skin, 6 foot 1. Idk that’s unnecessary huh, whatever. We’re 16, sophomores in high school. 

The Story of me and Symone:
I know exactly when I first met her. August 13th, 2018, sometime between 3 and 4 pm. The last period on my first day of high school. I can’t say I was attracted to her yet, but I was intrigued, I knew she was different from other girls. Me and her weren’t friends for quite a long time, we talked in class occasionally, made small talk, nothing more. I was becoming better friends with other kids that would eventually bring me closer to her, but majority of freshman year I just hung with my cousins, I wasn’t happy about starting at this new school. In the second semester of freshman year, I started to really talk to her more, hung out with her during lunch/study hall and stuff. We still weren’t close friends, only really talked in a group chat. It was the start of second semester when I truly knew I loved her. Eventually, the school year came to a close, the last time I saw her was the last day, after we got student merit awards from our favorite teacher, I said goodbye to her as she signed another guy (who she had a crush on)’s yearbook. 

We weren’t really close enough friends to hang over the summer, so we didn’t, at all. We still talked over summer, but really just were more of acquaintances. This year is when things changed, fast. I’ll break down this year so far, into 4 different phases. 1. Still not really friends, 2. Good friends, 3. Mutual feelings, 4. Heartbreak. Yeah, spoiler alert, she ended up liking me back. Here’s how it went. We started this school year and I felt really shitty, like me and her weren’t very good friends and since I didn’t have like any classes with her or other people I talked to, I didn’t really get to interact with friends. One day, like a month into the school year, one of my friends was like “hey why haven’t we all ever hung in person, aren’t we like good friends lol”. It really didn’t make sense, he was right, the only thing holding us back was distance really. Quick sidenote, the friend group I’ll be talking about from here on out is a group of 4, consisting of my female cousin, male best friend, me, and Symone. Another sidenote, Symone and my best friend we’re already close friends before everyone else, like really close, I think there was even mutual feelings at one point. Anyway, moving on. 

The first time we all hung out, was at my house, we watched a movie in my basement and just hung out. Symone cuddled with my best friend, so did my cousin, kinda hurt. The point of talking about this, is because this is when my cousin and best friend realized they liked each other and lead to them dating soon after. This is also how I found out that Symone was dating a senior. This really didn’t hurt too bad, cuz I didn’t even feel like I had a chance at this point. We hung out every weekend after this, the start of phase 2, and she started cuddling with me, even though she had a boyfriend, which is fine she’s just a really touchy affectionate person, it wasn’t intimate or sexual or anything. The point is, we were getting closer. Our story is currently in October 2019. My best friend and cousin are dating, Symone is having relationship troubles. By the end of November, we’re all much closer of friends, talking consistently, hanging out consistently. And in December, things ended with Symone and her boyfriend. He was really fucking toxic and broke her heart really really bad. That’s important later on. The same week that she broke up with him, she texted me and asked if she could come over and watch a movie with me cuz she was sad. I had a family party so I couldn’t, but she still wasn’t looking to be with me at this point. Right before Christmas break, something very important happens, that really makes me think about the butterfly effect. Symone and my best friend were fighting/she felt hurt that he didn’t support her anymore. Things seemed to pass over the break and by the start of the second semester of sophomore year, I thought things were fine again. 

We’re now in January. Symone is single, I am single. Whenever we hung out, she got more and more intimate with me, putting my hands on her thighs, hugs, cuddling, falling asleep on top of me. Throughout January specifically, we started to get closer and closer. One night, we all went to a school event at a skating rink, she saw her ex and was sad. I went outside with her to tell her something unrelated about a girl in there I knew from middle school. While I was telling her she started to sob. I held her for a few minutes and talked her through it. That’s is the point where we became each other’s rocks, and had each other’s backs. Fast forward, it’s the end of January/ Start of February (can’t remember). We all want to hang out, but she says she has “family stuff”. I immediately know somethings up so I question further but hey dry responses. She tells me that she’s really mad at my best friend cuz he’s being an asshole to her lately. At this point, me and him have drifted and I’m now closer to Symone. That night, me and her talk for literally 12 hours non stop. Discussing random stuff and also helping her get through fight with my friend. That same night, I’m about to get in the shower, I see a thing on her snap story. It’s one of those things that you snap back for and they fill in the blanks of stuff. I reply to the story and say “dude what is this, middle school?” She says “haha, I know I just felt like it idk” a few minutes later I get a filled out version for my name. The last blank is “Have I Ever Liked You”. She puts “yup”. I’m just remaining calm at this point and I say, “haha last one, L to you”. She says “yeah that ones current”. I’m shocked. 

But also I guess there was signs of interest and I’m just dumb. Instead of responding with words, I send her a filled back one for her name and put “yup, also current” for the last blank. This is the beginning of phase 3. Things love insanely fast after this. It’s literally like a month and a half but feels so much longer. After this, we get really really intimate when we hang out, and start acting like a couple, not really there yet but also out of the like talking phase. Pretty quickly tho, things get worse. After like a week of this, she randomly says “we can’t date right?” on Snapchat. I just respond all confused and ask her to explain what she means. Here’s what she says. “Like we can’t/shouldn’t date right? We’re really good friends, and I don’t wanna lose that, after my last relationship, I learned not to date friends because you’ll walk away with less than you started with.” I’m like okay, but the problem is, she doesn’t stop acting all loving and intimate. I’m not okay with it at first, but soon she acts like she wants a relationship again, so I’m back in. 

Things moved really fast in the past 3 weeks. First, we get sexually intimate when I put my hand under her bra. Then I start fingering her at a later date and then first kiss. It’s really weird first kiss didn’t happen earlier, I know. Anyway, we’re now basically dating, she holds my hand in the hallway, we switch classes around to be with each other, we hang out all the time, tell each other we love each other etc. More importantly than all that, we realize how similar we are and how well we get each other. She says she’s like me if I was just female and vice versa. We both really realized that we’re like soul mates and perfect for each other in every way. We have had similar struggles and trauma and both still have similar issues and life experiences and interests and passions and opinions etc. We both really need each other in our lives. Now at this point, we’re each other’s top priority and both head over heels in love. The best feeling in the world is knowing that you love someone just as much as they love you back. On her birthday weekend, the whole group comes to my house and her and my cousin are going to do their nails. Me and my best friend need something to do for like an hour while they do that, so we decide to go check out a shitty school dance that only freshman are gonna go to.

 I get really bad anxiety and panic attacks, and when we were there, I had a panic attack. I told her abt the panic attack, cuz she gets it, on snap to come pick us up with my sister but not to tell anyone what was going on, they came and picked us up. And she held my hand and comforted me the whole time. Then we went home and she climbed into my bed with me and just held me for a bit. I wasn’t embarrassed or freaked out, I felt so comfortable around her, and she had the ability to take away anything bad I was feeling. After she left that night, I realized how perfect we were for each other, and it became more than just physical attraction. Fast forward again, it’s March 14 2020. It’s a Saturday night. She is home alone and bored. She wants to come over, so I invite her over. We hang out in my room just cuddling, talking and kissing. I really really loved her in this moment, and she really really loved me, little did I know it would be the last of these moments. The next day, corona virus got really serious in the US and we found out our school would be cancelled. We were both really anxious about the future. I know Symone’s mind really well, cuz it’s basically the same as my mind. I know that in times of crisis, she’ll take a look at her life and reconsider a lot. I also noticed that after we hung out that last time, she seemed really distant. I kept asking if something was wrong, she said “yea just going through it, don’t wanna talk about it”. I tried a couple more times but got the same response. I was worried that it was something about me, but also the fact that she was distant sucked, cuz I was having a lot of anxiety and she’s the only person who really has ever been able to help with it. One night, it’s really late, I’m sleep deprived and going insane and I send her a really long message, I won’t include it here out of embarrassment but I’ll break down what it said. 

Basically: hey you seem distant, I wish you would let me help with your problems, idk what’s up w u, I really need u, life’s changing fast and I miss u and need consistency, I know you really well, so I think I know that this has to do somewhat with my role in your life,  just lemme know what’s up, bye. I’ll actually give her response, here it is. 

Her response: 
Basically, this sounds really fucking stupid but lately I’ve just been questioning how everybody and everything reacts in my life to change. Like when something big happens in my life that hurts me or makes me happy or sad or whatever strong emotion, who is there to comfort me or congratulate me or whatever the time asks for. That sounds kind of selfish in a way? But I realized the feeling I’ve been missing is a support system. And I have a lot of friends, you see me hugging people idek in the hallways. I’m an outgoing person. But other than you and my best friend [REDACTED] who I have known for legit 10 years, I don’t feel like I can open up and tell them anything. And I hardly see [REDACTED] . Maybe next year that’ll change cuz she’ll go to the same campus. Regardless, thats why these past couple days I’ve been a mess. I realized a while ago I told you I don’t really want to ever date because I like keeping my friends and my dating completely separate and I realize now that I’m fucking stupid for not doing that because if we dated and anything happened I’d lose 1/2 of all the support I feel in my life which doesn’t seem like a lot but I feel like I would just be so mentally unhealthy if I didn’t have you in my life. We kinda help each other figure shit out.
I guess the bottom line is- when it comes to dating, I’ve always gone after people that’s are.. disposable. That sounds horrible. Yikes. 
But I don’t mean as a person just disposable, I mean disposable to each other’s lives. That even if something happens and we both get hurt, we walk away with what we had. But when dating someone you feel so connected with in a best friend way, anything happens and you leave with less than you came with. You lose your support. And I’ve tried explaining this to [REDACTED] countless times and I guess she doesn’t understand what I mean so maybe you won’t either maybe I’m actually going fucking insane but I just feel like I’m not doing what I know I should be doing and I feel guilty. And I love spending time with you and telling you everything and pretty much being best friends but I know if I ever let it be more than that it’s kind of going to ruin my life and yours if anything happens and let’s be honest I’m not mentally stable enough to deal with that shit and I’m not mature enough to figure out a way to fix things once they fall apart. And I haven’t told anyone cuz I feel like what I’m saying still doesn’t make any sense and it fully might make you hate me and if it does wow that really sucks! But I owe you an explanation. I love you a lot and I still want to talk as much as we do and hang out all the time but I don’t think I can do anything more knowing I’d literally commit suicide if I didn’t have you in my life that sounds SOOO FUCKED HAHAHAHAHA but literally hello no support! Uwu! 
And I’m sorry if this makes you not want to trust me b because I know, as cocky as this sounds, that I’ve gotten you to be more open about how you feel and all of that and I don’t want you to regret that or feel like I’m fucking around or anything I just want to get everything our because if anybody can understand this mess I’m my head it’s probably you. Anyways I’m sorry this is a lot. 

I responded and told her that what she was saying made sense, we really need each other and we shouldn’t jeopardize having each other’s backs. I still loved her and wanted to be close and that she could talk to me about anything, and shouldn’t just keep it all bottled up. I don’t blame you for leading me on, cuz I know you had real feelings too, I just wish you conveyed that earlier on and didn’t get as intimate ig. 
I lied.

Her next response:
We do be understanding each other on a weird level. But that’s like exactly my point. Even [REDACTED] who I’ve know for 10 years hasn’t been able to understand me on the level you do. That’s why it’s really important to me that we stay in a really close friend relationship. I really don’t think you meet enough people that understand you this well to risk losing them like that. I fully agree that I got carried away sometimes and should’ve stopped myself from being too touchy, and I know a lot of the times I felt guilty after. Idk why. But I also don’t want to ever like, feel awkward about anything or even have anything change. I know that’s also a lot to ask for and if you don’t want that too I completely understand but I hope we can stay the same way and be just as close as before, just not- intimate ig?

Ughhhhhh. That’s all I felt for a bit. What I really felt, was that her logic made no sense, we care about each other too much and understand each other too well for anything to go wrong. No matter what, we would be able to stay close. Also, what contention could happen in a relationship that couldn’t happen in a friendship. It’s funny because ironically her fear of losing me is what makes me feel more distant. I don’t get her logic at all. And I wish she would just have never dated the guy before me cuz he fucked her up so bad she can’t trust me. We’re literally soulmates, she said that, she felt that, she told me she loved me. I think a lot of the lyrics of Leray by Trippie Redd are pretty accurate to my thoughts. 
-
“Good to not be you
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
""I thought you was married to the single life"", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit”
-
Yeah, I guess that’s all. I’m just really struggling and wanna hear what people think. No specific question, just need advice. If there is a question, I guess it’s should I just get over her or should I try and get her back into that role in my life? Anything helps, you a real one if you read this far.

My brother is uneducated, not following what's going on very closely, and his friends are equally stupid, downplaying the virus as just the flu.

My dad has some kind of disease that makes his immune system very weak, meaning if he gets this virus it could be very deadly. 

My brother doesn't seem to understand this nor does he and his friends understand just how big of a deal this situation is. 

He's bringing over his friends and they are all with in close contact and it's stressing me out knowing any of them could have the virus now that it's confirmed in my city.


How can I respectfully explain to my brother or his friends to not bring people over / not come over while this virus is going on?

751," 'Jazz' is a 2 year old cocker spaniel. He is a very good boy. His 'owner' however, is the a\*\*hole son of my landlord. 

Jazz currently lives outside in a muddy 5x5m pen where he as been for the last 18 months at least. He had never been walkies, never even seen a collar or lead and never had cuddles. He didn't even have a name.

The owner lives next door to Jazz's pen but hasn't visited him since putting him in there. Instead Jazz relies on the charity of the person in who's garden his pen is located (another tenant of the same landlord and who also wants Jazz rehomed).

Most properties around here are owned by the same family and pissing them off can result in a swift eviction. He is a bit skinny but not too bad, no fleas, no sign of worms and seems healthy - just starved of love and company. He is not in imminent danger of coming to harm.

Since finding out about Jazz I have negotiated access to his pen and started bringing him home for a few hours a day. We have spent 3 days cutting out dozens of mats, he has had a bath (he was very dirty and smelly) and been brushed and is now being fed plenty and given even more love. He is getting used to the lead too.

He wouldn't struggle to find an amazing forever home.

So... 

Do I call the RSPCA for a SECOND time about the same guy (different dog) and risk getting chucked out along with my OH and existing 3 doggos. Also, the local RSPCA centre isn't taking in dogs ATM as 	they're full and because corona.  	

Do I make Jazz go 'missing' to a good home elsewhere? Nothing could be proved but would again risk getting in trouble with the LL and the law.

Do I adopt/foster him? The owner might not notice but could come demanding either payment or his dog back. We really can't afford\\don't have space to add rescue #4 to our pack.  	

Do I try to raise money to buy him and then rehome him? Owner is likely to be happy to sell him but could be awkwardly expensive.

Any other options?",21Mar2020,1

763,"So here is some background info: I joined this new school awhile back and immeaditly the ""popular"" girls in my grade started having a liking towards me (i dont really know why im pretty average tbh) and after i admited to a friend that i was single he imeaditly told the girls, how do i know this? One by one they asked me out, now i had no interest for them (dont think they look that good or that nice of people) but i decided to lightly reject them and once one of them tried aagain i personally told her to ""leave me alon and tell this to your friends aswell"", they didnt listen. The awkward flirting continued and i clearly did not recipicated. 



After a year of them basically harrasing me I got back with my ex. I only told some guys and my twin sister. They still continued i was pissed extremely pissed, i told my class teacher and all she did was tell them to stop ""annoying"" me.



Now on to the main event, this new girl joins and i idnt care but some guys in my grade were drooling for her especially this one guy. He builds up the courage to ask her out and she says ""no"" and just that and afterwards when he asks her why she says ""youre really short"" and keep in mind he his like 2.5 inches shorter than me and this crushed him, and we spent a week consulting him to make him feel better due to what she did everyone lost intrest for her. So after this, i was playing Basketball during break and out of nowhere she comes up to me and drags me by my hand telling me she wants to tell me something, now i tought this was related to the project we were working on but she drops the bomb on me, she says ""so I have had a crush on you for awhile and i was wondering if you us to be a thing"" whilst holding my hand and draging her finger down my face. Now i was pretty pissed after going through 2 years of this bullshit, i got irate and shouted at her ""STOP FUCKING ANNOYING ME YOU UGLY BITCH!"" and ran off with her running to her friends crying. 


Her friends have been texting me calling me an ass and one of them told a teacher of course she couldnt do anything but i did see her being more annoyed with me. I kinda feel bad but also not at the same time for what she did to my friend and her friends annoying me.

765,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons) 

So on social media a few days ago I posted a picture of myself on an LGBT forum for teenagers (I am gay 14year old male), and I got one PM saying I was cute, guy was 18 and found out my age, apologized profusely, and left. No biggie. Then someone else PM’d me, also said I was cute, I found out they were a male, also gay, 19. I was immediately surprised, because when I said I was 14 they didn’t apologize or leave, and they kept talking. It was pretty normal conversation until I was asked “are you a virgin?”. Naturally this creeped me out, and I decided that the choice to continue this conversation was something I should reconsider. However, before I went to bed I said good night, to see how he would respond come next morning. To my relief, he didn’t respond when I woke up the next morning, and I decided “ehh, nothing to worry about, I’ll just move on.” However, a couple hours later I got a new message. It was something innocent, asking if I’ve heard of some some video game or something. I gave it a couple hours of thought, and decided I would continue the conversation, but not give any personal information away. Things shockingly went really smoothly. For a couple hours we chatted about video games and music, and things were going well. However, I then asked of him a favor, to ask one of my crushes if he’s gay. He did so in discreet fashion, and we found out he wasn’t. At this point, he had gained my trust, so I opened up about personal stuff like my pet dying, and he expressed what seemed like genuine sympathy. However, the conversation took a sudden turn for the worse when he said he’s “thinking of sucking you off right now”. This made me cringe very hard, as it is very odd and creepy for a 19 year old to say this to a 14 year old only two days after meeting them. I didn’t respond or engage, and one more message ensued, equally as weird: “are you circumcised?” This made me even more sketched out, as this was a throwaway account that had only been made 4 days prior to our first conversation and had no content at all (posts or comments). I decided to check the profile again, and I saw something new. The person had lied about their age, and they were actually 21, which makes me wonder even more what their intentions were in lurking a subreddit designed for teenagers.

766,"TLDR: I'm confused as to why one of my friends got mad and ended our friendship. Because the majority of our friend group likes me. And I want to correct this but I don't see where I messed up at. 

So I have been friends with this female named D for a good minute. And I have done a lot for D in the 3 years I have know her. I helped D when she was short on things or just needed me. (Ex: leave work to take her to work, pay bills she was short on, etc)((I also never asked her for anything because I never need anything from her and she is always struggling)) 
So I introduced D to my friends (All of them are guys, and 2 are my ex's that are on good terms with me, and my boyfriend is always there when we hang out.)  And I thought things were going well because she was getting along with my friends quite well. So all of my friends agree to go on a camping trip and I invited D. And things are going well, then 2 of my friends are getting sad because there nothing to distract them from things going on in their lives J left his home country &amp; family and M just lost a love one in a bad accident and M had recover well so we wanted to celebrate. So I do what any normal friend would do and try to comfort them with hugs and tell them it'll be okay. And even though it may not seem like it tommorow will always be better and I kiss the tops of there heads.
After that's all said and done, I go and see what shes doing because we are the only females and females stick together (and I didn't want to be glued to my bf). I see her all wrapped around both of my ex's. So I make a light joke asking whos breast are better because the have both seen mine. And they were both feeling her up. (Not trying to be scandalous just making a joke and maybe I was in the wrong)  D gets butt hurt so a apologize was made along said me telling her I was joking. She gets mad and goes home and I tell her to be safe.
We all go home 3 days later, and I see a list of texts of her telling me I was a 'toxic horrible friend' for always stealing her happiness and treating her like trash. 
So I ask her to explain, because I would like to fix the situation. And I have done many things for her and never asked for a cent of it back, because thats what friends do. 
She tells me I'm horrible because I stole all of the men in her life. And all she does is 'give and give to me' and I have never took anything from her because I always felt bad because I knew she was struggling. I ask her to explain, and she brings up my ex's saying the night of the camping trip I tried to steal them back but they were hers(? Knew nothing about this and she is dating on of them) and that I had stole J and M all to myself and they were hers first but she gave them to me (I asked them about this and they were confused as well). 
She then goes on to explain that me hugging my 2 friends and kissing there heads and making light jokes made them all love me. And that I was horrible for cheating on my boyfriend because I had hickeys on my neck. (That my bf gave me)

It is really confusing to me though because none of those things make any sense. I don't understand where I messed up. Like I felt like I was fabricating a really bad story when I wrote that. But I'll provide ss if I need too... (To let tell see what I'm dealing with) I don't feel comfortable with it though because they were private. And they have full names and locations in it.",21Mar2020,1
767,"I want to make this apparently clear before I start. **I don’t want any sympathy** I just want some real, honest advice to help with my situation. I know how I’m reacting is probably a big over reaction for the situation at hand but I’m hoping with some good advice you guys can help me move on a tad. 


So there was this girl I have been friends with for maybe 2/3 years now. We are near best friends and I would trust her with my life. She’s an amazing girl and I don’t know what I would do without her. There is however one thing about her that still digs away inside of me.

So a few years ago when I was 15 and she was 16. We had known each other for maybe 6 months. Now we had a bit of a romantic spark, in a weird way. It was like friends with benefits - but for like love and attention instead of s*x (if that makes any sense) so like we would say ‘I love you’ to each other every night we called and like every time we were together we would fall asleep cuddling but there was like never any confirmation of a relationship or anything even in the slightest NSFW that happened, apart from stupid teenage s*xual humour. 

Now I know why she was like this, she was like this with all of her friends. She was disowned by her parents at birth and put into the adoption system around age 3 or 4. Her parents were hardcore heroin addicts and abused her (I’m not sure to the extent of the abuse nor is she due to memory repression). So it stemmed from that her need for love and attention. Which was fine, I like looking after my friends, in a way helping others makes me feel good. 

But over time we started to get more into relationship territory together. We would often talk about s*x and what we found hot about one another. Instead of just cuddling we would make out, and start spending nights over at each others houses. And we were totally comfortable wearing just underwear and sleeping. But there was absolutely never anything s*xual contact of any sort. And she would talk about ‘The Future’ and ‘Us’ and I was excited Cos I truly thought she was amazing, I personally don’t believe in the concept of ‘the one’ as I believe that can encourage and make toxic relationships last longer if they believe they are ‘the one’. But if the concept of ‘the one’ is 100% real, I believe she may have been my one. 

(I also want to note whenever we went out for dinner or went to the cinema together she would call it a ‘date’, I personally think that never meant anything even when this was going on, but I thought I should include it in case you guys think it’s relevant) 

And after all of this, one day she has her friend who is leaving to go to army basic training, and she Is at a party, quite drunk. I wasn’t messaging her as she has warned me before to not text her whilst drunk as she can be rather irrational.  But she initiated the conversation so I just went with it. She started talking about how ‘we’ and ‘us’ would never work. She later reasoned that this was to do with the [Consent Laws in England ](https://www.fpa.org.uk/factsheets/law-on-sex) (TL;DR a 15 and 16 year old cannot have sex as the 16 year old is legally classed as a p*dophile), now I called BS on this because she had no problem talking about doing it together before (note we never had s*x but had talked about doing it together), and this was a little bit before I turned 16 so I said ‘ok can’t we just wait until [birthday]’ but she was still adamant that we didn’t do anything and that a relationship non-s*xual or s*xual would not work due to the age. 

Now onto the meat and gravy of the situation: we still kept on being our weird friends in love situation, but dialled back on all the making out and stuff. Which was ok by me, but I was a little bit upset. After a little while she started seeing a guy. They have been dating coming near about a year now if I’m not mistaken. Ever since that our little friend in love shtick has stopped and we are now just like normal friends

*Am I upset or angry at this guy for going out with her?*

Absolutely not, and I try as hard as I can to
support them in all I can, the guy (who I’ve become quite good friends with as of recent) is a sweetheart and makes my friend feel like the most special girl alive. And I’m so happy for them, like unbelievably. 

*But it still eats away at me*

I have absolutely no want to go out with her, and respect those two’s relationship 100% but it still confuses me deeply inside. The main two questions are:

1) Why did she have such a sudden change of heart?

And 

2) How did she move on from the whole concept of settling down and ‘us’ so quickly?

And I do still in some weird sort of way have feelings towards her. My love life, isn’t the most vibrant or active, and when I was with her I felt truly happy. I don’t know if that was true love, her being ‘the one’ or me just finding solace and care in a good friend. But whatever it was, I want it back. 

However I’m never gonna try and interfere with their relationship, as they are extremely happy together. She’s found her closure, I just want to find mine.

So that’s where I turn to you, people of reddit. What advice do you have for moving on, however I don’t want any advice to do with: sabotaging her relationship or encouraging her to cheat (like my irl friends have suggested). 

How do I get over someone I had (and partially still do) have feelings for, without hurting her In the process? Cos I’ve accepted the fact that those two want to and are going to stay together, and I’m super happy for them and going to support them. But there is still the little burning inside of me. 

Sorry for the super long post, I just felt that I needed to type it all out. Thank you, even if you’ve just read it - the fact that someone willingly listened to my problems means a lot. Anyways that’s all, if you have any advice please leave it below :) - M",21Mar2020,1

769,"Blah blah blah, short story long, I met a girl, we became friends, I started to like her, she didn't like me back (obviously), she told me shit she never told to anyone before, she trusted me, I trusted her, blah blah blah. When I have feelings for someone I become and asshole, because I don't know how to deal with it. I think I'm broken, but that's other story. Anyways, since she doesn't likes me back, I felt extremely bad and worthless, and I could be jealous for the most stupid thing. I could have been very toxic, but instead, I swallowed my feelings and acted like I normally would. Too sad I couldn't, and, something happened, but I think some of us got bored of the other, and I'm not sure who. Did she got bored of me? Did I got bored of her? I don't fucking know, but our conversations hasn't been as interesting as there were before, and I assumed it's my fault for not being enough, and being bored, again. I don't know why I became so boring so suddenly, maybe it's because I felt bad, maybe because I like her, or because I need therapy and antidepressants to clear my mind (I was gonna take therapy, but, the coronavirus kinda fucked up my plans) and enjoy things. However, she told me about a problem she had. Long story short, she has a friend who also likes her, and he's a real asshole, just like me. A friend of her who is a bitch told him that she (my friend) liked another guy, and that obviously made him super jealous, and she started a drama and he thought that some time from her would be fine, to clarify his mind and understand his feelings. Now, that was something logical in my mind, so, I told her that I still had feelings for her, and that I needed to forget her, otherwise I would end up hurting her, like I do with everyone else in my life. I told her, this is not goodbye, I just need some time to get my shit together, but she got mad at me, because apparently I was doing the exact same thing her other friend did, and she said that maybe it was best to talk about this tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's tomorrow! 
So, I need to know what to do, or if I'm being selfish. Apparently I hurt her, and I talked to a friend and he said that I was only thinking in me, and that's very possible, because I'm an asshole and a coward, but, what the hell should I do? If I don't forget her I will feel bad for a very long time because I will feel worthless, and if I do, she will be very mad at me because basically I betrayed her trust.

So I currently have 2 roommates, my cousin and one of his buddies from high school. They’re about 5 years younger than me. I’ve lived in this house for about 5 years and then my roommate and his buddy moved in about a year ago. The only furniture and items they have provided for the house are what is currently in their room. I have furnished the entire house, including everything in the kitchen. My issue here is that they hoard plates and cups in their room to the point I sometimes don’t have a plate to eat off of or silverware to use. When I notice things get low I ask them to bring them to the kitchen and that I’ll even wash it for them as I am doing mine at the time.

773,"This happened about 3 hours ago. 

He got his first car from his parents and we were driving around having fun. I barked about a car length away from him. Then he reversed into my car by accident. Due to our ages, our parents have to solve this. Since we do not have our own money. We don't know anything and are just two kids that happened to be in an accident. What do I do now? 

My car's right door got a huge dent that isn't only visible but makes it hard to open and shut the door. Basically this needs to be fixed by a mechanic. But since he reversed into it, he should pay for it. Or his insurance should at least cover it. 

But he is making it really hard for me. His parents are not convinced that he did it. I haven't really been able to contact him since. My parents are really upset that this happened and that their parents don't believe me. There where multiple witnesses. 

I just want to solve this without making it into a huge deal. I feel really, really bad for him, his parents and my parents. If I had the money I would pay for it/ pay for half. But that simply is not an option since I don't have the money. 

My parents want them to pay in full since they believe that I did nothing wrong. They however believe that I shouldn't have parked my car so close to his. 

I have no clue what to do. I'm going to contact him maybe tomorrow or in a couple of hours. This is too much to process since I've never been in a car accident, especially with another person.

774,"Here's some background information. I (M20) am currently staying at home with my parents while I go to college and work part time. I have been working as an intern for a manufacturing company since the summer of 2016. The company had about 50 people as of the start of the week. Corona has since taken a good bit of business from the company because people are scared to spend their money at the moment. Between thursday and yesterday, 9 people have been laid off with myself included.

Since then, all my mom has been talking about has been where I am going to be getting a new job at. She has given me suggestion after suggestion about where to go. They're not bad suggestions, but I feel as though I am unable to figure this out on my own because she wont stop with the suggestions. I can understand that she wants me to not rely sole on them and to be motivated to get a new job to be able to move out, but it was literally yesterday that this all happened. 

As bad as this sounds, I dont want her or my dad involved at all in this.

780,"I've tried /r/relationship_advice three times and got no help, and then I went to /r/breakups and only got one reply.

This will be long, please take the time to read it so you understand whats going on. My bf and I were together a while and everything was perfect. We were deeply in love and wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. He told me he would never leave me or want anyone else. I was the one for him.

One thing he has asked me not to do was tell people details about him. He was fine with people knowing we were together and knowing about all the cute things he did for me, but not random details about himself. A while back I spilled a bunch of things to a random guy and my bf broke up with me for a day, then said he overreacted and asked me back out the next day. I took ""I overreacted"" to mean I could now talk about him with people.

A week ago I mentioned what time he goes to bed in the shoutbox on a message board I run. It was nothing personal about him. All I said was ""My bf goes to bed at 8pm every night, then I'm lonely the rest of the night. Shame the Discord server isn't active anymore."" One person said ""8pm is a strange time to go to bed."" and I stupidly told my bf about it. He blew up at me for sharing details about him with random strangers. He was angry at me but kept telling me he loved me all day. The following day he broke up with me.

I lashed out in hurt and anger and accused him of being off his meds, which insulted him and has made him decide that theres no hope for us ever getting back together. He blocked me on Discord and Facebook. Then he unblocked me on FB in case of emergency. Eventually he let me add him back to Discord and said we could try to be friends. But he was adamant that he was only doing it for me. There was no benefit to being friends for him.

Last night I let it slip that I wanted to be friends to try to fix things. He once again said there was no hope, he would never forgive me. Then he blocked me again. Now hes unblocked me on FB again but doesn't want to speak to me.

WTF do I do? I am so in love with him that the thought of trying to find someone else makes me feel sick. I was so ready to spend my life with him. He was everything I had ever wanted or needed in my life. Our relationship was the most wonderful relationship I have ever had, and I have had a LOT of relationships.

I can't talk to him anymore. Why is he blocking and unblocking me? What does he want from me? Is he just playing with my emotions? I believed with all my heart that God brought him to me as the right person for me, now I've lost all faith in God. I'm lost and hurt and confused. Please don't tell me to block him, cause I won't do that. I'm not like him, I won't just block someone like that.

I dunno what I'm asking for here, I just need some insight. I've had two tarot card readings, both of which hint that things can eventually be fixed. I've called 5 prayer lines and had 5 total strangers pray for us, but now I have no faith anymore.

I just want things to be the way they used to be. It was so perfect. He was everything I wanted or needed and he felt the same way about me. I'm sorry for what I did and I want to fix it, but he doesn't care how sorry I am anymore. I can't just move on because of how deeply I love him. I'm not gonna find someone else. No one will be like him so I won't be able to love anyone else. It will all be empty and meaningless.

Why is he playing with my emotions like this? He was so wonderful before. What happened? I know I did something wrong and I've tried so hard to repent for it, but he doesn't seem to care anymore. I didn't know I was doing anything wrong, I thought I was allowed to talk about him.",21Mar2020,1

Hello all! 

Originally posted this to the relationships sub and the mods took it down because it had to do with COVID-19. 

I (32, F, USA) was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to handle the situation we are in with others and maintain our own mental wellbeing. 

I work in retail banking so I still report to work as usual. I’ve seen a number of people with financial issues during my 10 years of banking but I haven’t encountered the depth that I’m seeing now. I work in a major city and our branch sits right above the transportation center so we are always very busy. There are more and more people coming in who have lost their jobs and are in a panic of everything that is happening. I’m seeing people who make light of their situation, break down and cry in my office or become extremely angry. The past couple of days these clients have been unloading their worries on our staff and I can foresee it taking its toll on us mentally. On top of that we have had some staff members become increasingly panicked and break down at work. I try to remain calm and explain to my coworkers that we are lucky to have our jobs and to have social interactions at work for at least 8 hours a day, a couple of employees were in LTRs that recently ended. But the social interactions are becoming increasingly stressful with clients. It’s beginning to feel like we are social workers and we have zero training with the emotions that clients are coming in with. Yes, we empathize with the client but I want to ensure that we do not eventually go numb. Im going to speak to my boss and have him set up intervals of breaks besides our lunch break so we can just take a moment and clear our minds. Any other suggestions are more than welcomed. Thank you and stay healthy! 

TL;DR - I work in retail banking and clients are unloading on us with their emotional and financial issues. I would like suggestions for me and the branch on how to continue to mentally cope with this.",21Mar2020,1

I work directly with two other women (one a little older than me and the other is a little younger than me), but we also have a second branch that’s all males there. The owner (40s-ish M) travels between both branches pretty often. 

When he talks to our branch, he’s usually pretty impatient and gets really bitchy with us over things that the three of us see as fairly unimportant. He will talk to one of us about firing one of the others, then talk to that person about firing another one of us. He expects us to do things way beyond our job description and gets very insulting when it’s something we can’t perform perfectly. Just about every statement he makes is a contradiction. He will tell me that he wants me to do something however I’d like, then tell me that I should’ve done it this exact way that he wanted it done, but he doesn’t want to be the one coming up with all of the ideas. One day he doesn’t want me to do certain tasks and when I tell him it’s a better idea that I do them, I don’t know anything because I don’t know how his business is run. The next day he’ll tell me to start doing those tasks again because he has this great idea that it’s better to keep doing them. He accuses us all of being too robotic, but only wants us to relay specific information and absolutely nothing else. He doesn’t want us to say anything negative at all, but now we sound like we’re lying and not covering the whole situation.

When we hear him talk to the other branch on the phone, it’s like he’s a whole different person. What I would see as a major mistake is brushed under the rug as, “a non-issue.” Guys that are doing (or not doing) things that are breaking equipment or pissing off customers and costing us a lot money are getting a gentle conversation and told it’s okay. 

I know this was all very vague, but I didn’t really want to run the risk of losing my job, as irritating as it may be. Maybe I’m overthinking things and seeing issues that aren’t there, but I just wanted opinions that weren’t mine and maybe advise on how to make dealing with him less of an issue.

TL:DR: my boss treats my branch of only women very differently than he treats our other branch that only has men",21Mar2020,1
788,"Hellllooooo reddit. Now positing because I’m not sure what to do. I got myself into a fickle. 


Ive never saw mysef being in a long-distance relationships. I know some people make it, but tbh I think it’s difficult dedication and rare. But I got myself into a situation...I’m not sure how it happened I’ll just explain.


I went abroad to my home country. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking. Not to brag, but it might be relevant to the discussion. I get complimented on my looks a lot. Also gay. I was bored and didn’t have a lot of friends abroad. So I went on Tinder. 


I said hello to this guy and we set up a day to hang out AS FRIENDS and go to a museum. I found him rather cute and tbh that’s why I said hello.


Well, we were looking at the exhibits. Started talking about differences in culture. Started talking about differences in dating culture. Ended up getting food after. Then hung out together just walking exploring the city at night. Drank. And well, we ended up at his place and got intimate.


That was supposed to be the end of it. But the next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. So I asked him out to dinner. Hung out until morning. 
I only had a week left in the country. So we made the most of it.


We spent a couple more days together, which included going to an amusement park and getting stranded in another city. Putting a lock on a bridge. Taking cute pictures. Walking in parks. We spend our “1-week” near the place we first met. Etc. Honestly, one of my more memorable times in a foreign country. 


On my last day, we talked about LDR. We both know it’s tough but we both wanted to try. We said we’d think about it for a few more days and come to a decision. We exchanged stuffed animals and t-shirts.
Made promises to communicate so there’s no confusion, to communicate if there was another, and he made me promise that I’d try my hardest if things got tough.

That’s where my dilemma comes.


I told him I still didn’t know if I wanted to be exclusive yet. He wants to be. It’s been about two weeks since my last day. But we’ve been sharing resources on long-distance dating, ideas, started a series together. 


The issue with long-distance is...I have little trust. I’ve been cheated on in my first two relationships (he cheated in his first...I think he redeemed himself when his ex tried to get back with him and he rejected him when he was in another relationship?). Recently, I noticed that his replies are a little more sporadic... but I can’t tell if this is because he is losing interest or because he’s just really forgetful to reply (he told me that he was just really forgetful when we were first starting to get to know each other). I asked him if he still wants to be LDR and he said yes.


Tbh, I don’t catch feelings often but for some reason this time I did 🤡🤡🤡 I don’t think much long-term about being with other people but with him I sometimes think what if 


He’s really active on FB and I saw that other people find him attractive. He doesn’t flirt back but I get insecure. I can’t compete with someone abroad. Also, he’s 19 and I’m 24.

We usually get to see each other maybe once every few months. It’s been basically nothing but fighting and frustrations since I got here and it made me realize this relationship isn’t something I want anymore. 

My flight back is on the 31st (i can’t move it) so I still have over a week before I go home. For the past 2 days it’s been silence but he’s still letting me stay here given the circumstances with COVID-19. I’m doing everything I can for us to still be civil to each other but he’s been pretending I don’t exist since we broke up. 

This morning he went out of his way to tell me he had a dream about his ex girlfriend last night and I wish i could pretend like it didn’t hurt but I snapped at him and told him I didn’t want to hear about shit like that. I’m at a loss as to what to do at this point. Do I just suck it up and buy a newer flight home or reciprocate the silent treatment?

So I've posted this issue a couple of times before, but this time i decided to send the full story to help you guys understand mt problem better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 14 year old male, and i have forever been against porn and masturbating. However, about 2 weeks ago, i decided to see a few porn clips just to see what it was all about. I promised myself that i would never see it again.

Fast forward two weeks later, and every night i watch porn. I watch clips mainly on Reddit. Yesterday i masturbated for the first time, and nutted all over myself. Yesterday, i swore to never masturbate, and just 20 minutes ago, i did it again.

I don't know how to explain it. I promise myself every time that i will not watch porn, but it's like there's this force that takes over me and makes me wanna watch again and again, every night. It's like by morning, i'm the kindest and by night,these demons take over me and make me wanna do things i would never even think of doing.

I think this has something to do with my mental state. I used to top the class, but recently, i got rejected by a girl whom i was madly in love with, and my grades declined, i also have little to no friends and get bullied every day at school. I have these fantasies of me saving people and being respected, but in real life, i'm quite depressed inside. I really don't wanna tell anyone about this as they may think of me as a freak. I try to help as many people as i can, but my life just gets worse. I find comfort in watching porn and i really really want this to stop as this is not who i am.

Please help me. I really want to get back to my old self, but this addiction isn't helping. I really want to stop masturbating and watching any sort of porn.",21Mar2020,1

796,"Hi. Warning- very long post.

I'm sorry if the title was not informative enough, I've never posted on this sub so I don't know what the usual titles look like in these type of situations. This is a throwaway account so I don't possibly alert myself to somebody who might know me IRL.

My mother (58) has untreatable kidney cancer. This is not her first cancer. She has had 4 other completely separate forms of cancer since 2014, all above stage 2. I won't list every detail to save your time, but I am 20 (f) and have lived with this reality since the age of 14. I am now in my second year of college but am at home often. Right now, I'm at home for an indefinite amount of time due to the virus situation. My classes will start to be online starting Monday. 

I love my mother with my entire heart. I have always, and will always, do anything possible to help her and my family. I myself deal with a severe chronic illness and have spent the last 6 years in and out of hospitals and all sorts of invasive and debilitating treatments, operations, medication trials, etc. This is important to know, I think, so I felt like I'd include that.

I have had an intense sensitivity to sounds since I was a child. I stopped being able to eat at the dinner table around age 11, for example, because the sounds of chewing and forks/plates create this terrible rage inside fo me and I get visibly upset. I have always tried to the best of my ability to keep this inside and not ever lash out at anyone around me. It is not their fault, and not their problem. Nobody owes anything to me. I just physically cannot handle certain sounds, even breathing. I'm unable to sleep in a bed with anyone else because of this and I am beyond ashamed and filled with guilt for getting so incredibly angry at people's noises when it is not their fault. Last year I lived in a dorm and my roommate would be very loud and I would put headphones in my ears and cry for entire nights because I cannot stand certain sounds. (This is part of why I now live alone.)

The reason why I mentioned all of the above is because my mother spends every day crying, moaning, screaming, cursing, begging God to kill her, etc. I have no choice but to put aside my stupid phobia for the sake of taking care of her. I am living at home for now due to the virus and spend most of my time caring for her. She often has a hard time doing many things, such as walking. I spend at least a few mornings out of the week cleaning up feces, vomit, etc., and she cries because she feels so guilty for putting me through it. 

What's sad but not necessarily surprising is that I'm numb to it all. I've been doing this since I was 14. I have no problem taking care of her, I love her more than I can put into words. I am used to living with the fact I could lose my mom at any time. I don't get relief from hearing her ""cancer is gone!!"" I know a new one will be back in a few months. Now, do I tell her that? Absolutely not. I don't mean to sound cold, I'm sorry.

**The issue is the sounds.** The crying, the moaning, the *""fuck me fuck me fuck me""* 's being yelled 24/7, the screaming, the wheezing, etc. I get extremely upset because of the sounds. I have to excuse myself to the bathroom and cry and bury my head in a towel to scream as quietly as possible to let this anger out. I occasionally sit in my car in the driveway to cry and scream from anger but can no longer do that since my neighbours currently aren't working anymore and approached me a few days ago. Completely my fault, I feel bad for worrying them.

I've read online it could be ""[misophonia](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia#1)"" but I don't know if that's a legitimate thing and I feel so beyond guilty for being angry at her for no reason. I have my own health issues but I don't know what she's going through. I've been on chemo myself but it is not even comparable to her struggle. 

I'm already on medication for anxiety/panic attacks, SSNRI'S, amongst other medications that have recently saved my life in other areas. I also am already in therapy and starting DBT. Not sure if this info is helpful but in case anyone was looking to recommend seeing somebody, that's already being worked on. 

Also, we cannot afford a full-time nurse to take care of her and even if we could she refuses. 60-80% of the time she is able to function, but many times she is not and I am there to help for anything she needs. My father works until 7-8 pm and can only do so much. Besides, the sounds still will be there and **I just need advice on how to manage my reactions to them.**

I don't know why certain sounds bother me. It could be triggers of PTSD (from childhood abuse from my parents or maybe from past cancer issues), pent up anxiety, misophonia (if that's even applicable to this), or anything. But I could be completely wrong. Perhaps my ADHD plays a role, but I truly don't know.

She also refuses therapy to get help for anxiety/PTSD/ etc. She also has diagnosed but untreated ADHD. I don't know if this is useful to add. But she is not mentally well either.

**I need help- what can I do in moments of frustration because of these sounds? How can I hide it from her? Is there any cause for this? Does anyone relate, or can give advice on any aspect of this situation?** 

Again, I apologize for the length of this post, and I want to make it clear I have NO anger towards my mother right now, I love her and will never stop doing everything I can for her. I'm at my breaking point and feel as if I'm losing my mind. I am also starting online class and I can't handle daily anxiety attacks during class time.  I want to improve my attitude for the sake of my mental health and the chance to be a better caregiver to my mother.

Please. I pray somebody sees this. I'm willing to answer any questions if I'm even lucky enough to have any sort of response. Bless you all and please stay safe and healthy right now.",21Mar2020,1

799,"My Next-door neighbors have kids, and almost every day they let them run outside and scream. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, except they are refusing to have their kids stay inside during a serious pandemic.

800,"So I have been caught on multiple occasions by my parents for using drugs (mostly weed). I have even told them in the past that I’ve smoked weed, as well as taken mushrooms and lsd.

Now before you give me a lecture on how I shouldn’t be using drugs at 17 years old in the first place, please hear me out guys. (I do believe using drugs underage isn’t the best for me)

But I’ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Tourette’s Syndrome, and ADHD. And I’ve been trying so hard to enjoy my life to the fullest, but i feel like I’m just going in circles.

I’m always having these obsessive thoughts about things that don’t matter AT ALL. And I find myself feeling more anxious because of my obsessive thoughts which leads to a lot of anger.

I find myself constantly stuck in this loop that I can’t get out of no matter how much I try. My Tourette’s actually has gotten a lot worse because of it and I’m absolutely torn apart.

I’ve found that the occasional mushrooms and lsd that I’ve used on the past have helped me out TREMENDOUSLY. I don’t use lsd or mushrooms at all anymore though.

But as of recently, I began getting into using small amounts of weed with great success. I don’t actually get stoned because I’m not the biggest fan of it if I’m being honest.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago, I got caught smoking weed by my parents. I totally understand that it’s disrespectful to smoke in my parents house, and I even apologized and said I’d stop.

They didn’t seem to care and went off on me about how I’m a drug addict. Then I started to tell them that weed isn’t physically addictive and how I rarely even smoke.

They went off on me saying that I’m going to become schizophrenic and how I’m already addicted. This made me kind of angry and they proceeded to say “you’re having withdrawals.”

This whole situation got me feeling kind of heated. I understand there are weed withdrawals for heavy users. (but they’re so mild and psychological compared to other drugs)

Now anytime I get upset, they call me an addict and proceed to tell me how “these are symptoms of weed withdrawal”. They even threatened to send me away to a addiction facility.

They sent me pictures of articles that go over “symptoms of weed withdrawals”. I already said I’d stop if they want me to, but they still proceed to make me feel like shit.

I haven’t used weed since they caught me and I feel completely fine. (besides some slight insomnia) which I’ve ALWAYS had all my life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

They don’t let me leave the house and keep telling me that “I’m only leaving to buy drugs”. I told them that I want to go for a run and get some exercise, but they insist I’m “only buying drugs”.

They’ve taken me to therapy multiple times for all of my issues before, but I don’t think it’s helping me at all. They insist I use medication, but the side effects were absolutely HORRIBLE.

I don’t know what to do right now. My parents are the ones MAKING me feel worse. (it’s not the weed making me feel like shit). They’re literally addicted to coffee and alcohol.

But if I smoke weed, ”I’m an addict”. If I get upset or mad, “I’m going through withdrawals.” I’m about ready to just break down and cry. Can anybody please help me and give me advice.

I’m not using drugs right now and I feel fine, but my parents are making me feel absolutely horrible about myself. (and they wonder why I’m upset). Please somebody help me out.

Also, most of the criticism has come from the Senate minority leader Charles Schumer whereas I am more concerned about too small a margin of Democrats in the House passing it as a majority. Do they just want a compromise whereby they increase unemployment insurance in exchange for agreeing with the Republicans’ stimulus checks, and the compromise might include decreasing the maximum income for the check without decreasing the checks for us? I want the check to pay four months of rent in advance so that I can spend all my pay checks in the next four months toward the outstanding debt for this semester at my college, so I can schedule my autumn classes. I have outstanding debt after loans and no grants because I already have a double Bachelor’s Degree, but want another double Bachelor’s Degree in a year to contribute to society. It is crucial to take this class only offered in autumn, which is a prerequisite for a class only offered in spring. Also, I have Medicaid, but people are saying that I do not have Medicaid, because my coordinator put the wrong code in the computer and tho they fixed it, they are not expediting the process to pay me soon. This state Medicaid has nothing to do with the stimulus, but is nonetheless another reason why I need it due to poverty, and having Medicaid does not preclude me from getting the stimulus if they are approved.",21Mar2020,1

He broke up with me saying that it felt more like a friendship than a relationship. Like the way we were acting towards eachother. I acted like I agreed so he thinks its mutual.

Also, the entire relationship my friends made it very clear that they didn't like him and that I ""deserve better"" and that I was out of his league. Another thing, which is a bit alarming, a few days after we started dating we were hanging out just us two. And then he said my home address, exactly. I said ""Sweetheart, why the fuck  do you know my address?"" and he just laughed it off.  Anyways, I just don't know what to do because I really liked him, but did I dodge a bullet?",21Mar2020,1
808,"Dear Redditors, 
I’m 23F IT student and I have problem with my engineer’s thesis (engineer’s degree is at the same level as bachelor’s but it’s more advanced imo). I’ve been working on it for more than a year now. The deadline was on February 2020 but I didn’t manage to do the thesis in time so I took additional semester. Now my deadline is 31st of May.
My problem is that I just can’t do it. I can’t start. I have to write code in python and then a thesis explaining the code. I’ve wrote a bit of code months ago and that’s all. So I have had a huge break since I’ve done anything in my thesis and now I can’t get myself to go back to working on it.
But the main thing is that I think I just don’t want to do this. I hate IT so I don’t want to work in this field anymore. So I don’t feel like I would need these studies in my future life. On the other hand, I’ve spent last 3.5 years studying and the thesis is the last thing to do, so quitting it would be a big waste of those years full of hard work, tears and blood. I would like also to continue my studies abroad, so I’ve already applied for studies in Denmark, but I need to have my engineer’s done before the 1st of September, to be applied. Denmark is my big dream but still it doesn’t motivate me to work on my thesis.
Furthermore my parents and the rest of the family are putting a big pressure on me to write the thesis. They say that I should “get myself together”, “just start and then it will be easy”, etc. I feel like they don’t understand that I just can’t do it, I just can’t get myself together. They just don’t understand how I feel (we’re not used to talk about emotions at home). Everytime I think that I should start working on my thesis I immediately feel that I need to go and hide in bed. And that’s what I do. Then I spend the day watching YouTube, playing games, etc. 
When I have the days like this I’m thinking that it might be depression, but on the other hand I’m going to work everyday, I don’t have problems with getting out of bed in the morning etc. I just don’t have reason good enough to work on my thesis. 
I’ve been seeing a therapist every week since November and we were talking about my problem, but the simplest advices didn’t work so my therapist said that the problem might be somewhere deeper so it will take much more time to find the reason.

So, now I’m struggling what should I do about my life. Maybe should I quit my studies? My parents surely will find this unacceptable. Maybe you have some advices how to get myself to work? Maybe you can tell me if that sound like depression to you and I just need to get some pills from a psychiatrist? Let me know, I would be super grateful for any type of advice. 

Thank you for your time!",21Mar2020,1
809,"Some background:

I am 23, F, and I have a BA degree in Psychology, but did the general degree (3 years) versus the honours degree (4 years). After my program I landed a part time job at a hotel as an operator at a 5 star hotel, and in 2.5 years worked my way into the Event Coordinator position (salary is equal to approx. 35K USD).

Due to COVID-19, my hotel has closed, and we have all been temporarily laid off. With so much uncertainty in the hospitality industry moving forward, and a long path of recouping for the industry, I've been heavily thinking about how to proceed with life in general.

I've reached out to an advisor at my university, and would be able to readmit and upgrade my degree from the general to the honours degree, and it would take a year starting in September. I'd be going back to school, straight into upper year courses, after 3 years of not being in school. 

Or, I could go back to the hotel once the temporary layoff period is over and continue to work my way back into the industry. There would likely be heavy opportunity to move up, with many people not coming back into the industry, but it's also proven to be quite a faulty industry to build a life around.

Going back to school would allow me the credentials need to apply for graduate studies, should I get accepted to one, which of course opens many doors to higher paying careers. Ultimately I would like to do a masters in Criminology.

And no, I don't really know exactly what I want to do with my life. Events is fun and my foot is in the door, but crim and psyc are way more interesting and challenge me more. I feel going back to events would be a cop out since its easy, but has minimal opportunity to end up high up in any industry due to how competitive it is for the top spots. But I would also be taking on a great financial and time burden with returning to school, with no foot in the door yet to either disciplines. 

Would love any advice someone could offer who've maybe contemplated something similar or just who have an opinion, because I am so so so on the fence.",21Mar2020,1
810,"I didnt see anything in the thread about this matter, so I'll pose my question. Obviously with the current circumstances, there is very little legally that can be done. However, I am notifying my employer about this concern.

I work in a large office building that is not closed. My county has very few confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus. That being said, on a state level and my employer themselves have taken drastic precautionary measures related to sanitation in our office.

My employer rents our space from a property management company, who recently changed hands due to the owner of the building being ""tired of constant maintenance requests"" for a 30+ year old building. The janitorial services for our building is contracted out, and those contractors do not do their job to begin with (which has been an ongoing concern for the past few years).

Under the current circumstances, I would have expected this policy to change. However, it does not appear that they care at all, and have not changed their sanitation standards at all, putting us all at risk. While our office itself is constantly sanitized, the rest of the building (including the public restroom) is neglected.

I know this for certain because I just took it upon myself to sanitize our restroom. After wiping down the handicap bar for stability, what I found absolutely disgusted me. That bar had not been cleaned at all for months if not years.

I am curious as to what legal actions my co-workers and employer can take against them, if any, once this blows over. I am also seeking advice on what documentation I can do myself to further provide evidence of sanitary neglect.

Any information is much appreciated. I hope others in more affected areas do not have similar situations. The state in question is Florida.

EDIT: Reposting here to hopefully get some advice on this matter, as some believe it may not be a legal issue. Would appreciate any commentors to detail their experience/background if giving legal advice.",21Mar2020,1

812,"My cousin hasn't spoke to me for three months, after we had a serious discussion at the beginning of January about his mom's (my aunt's) health. For some back story, the family last saw each other before Christmas and both my mom and I noticed my aunt was acting different. She kept repeating herself and asking the same questions over and over, and also having trouble thinking of words such as 'microwave'. Fast forward to the beginning of January, my aunt started sending me strange messages on FB that made absolutely no sense, such as that my mom had said a bunch of things to hurt her the last time we had seen each other and that she couldn't see us anymore because of it.

I usually spoke to my cousin every day and I considered him my best friend, so I immediately messaged him about those strange messages and he had no idea what she was talking about either. Then I brought up how I thought maybe something was wrong with her, such as potential dementia. He agreed, saying he's noticed for awhile now that she's been acting like a different person, repeating herself and asking the same questions over and over, and he thinks she might get lost while driving because she's always gone a long time when she goes places now. We agreed that she probably needs checked out by a doctor. Then, mid conversation, he stopped talking and he hasn't spoke to me since, despite me messaging and texting his phone almost every day since. He doesn't even open my messages on FB, despite being online sometimes. I've even texted him asking if I upset him and asking if he hates me, and still no reply. It doesn't matter at all what I say.

Now it's been three months and he's still going strong on ignoring me and I have no idea what to think. I even called him and left a voicemail the other day, just asking if him and my aunt are okay due to all the craziness with the virus and people hoarding supplies lately, and still radio silence. I don't know if he's just processing everything, if he's trying to ignore the entire situation by ignoring me, or I somehow did something to upset him and now he's mad at me. I don't know if I've completely lost my cousin over this and it's been really depressing me all this time.

And honestly it might be completely selfish of me, but I don't feel like I deserve this. If he needs (more) time to process everything, or even if he's upset at me, I feel like I at the very least deserve to be told that and not just ignored like I'm a piece of trash. I'm at the point where I'm truly ready to just delete him off FB and block his number because I'm upset that he could ignore me for so long. I don't even need an entire conversation, nor do we even need to talk about my aunt's health issues, I'd just like to know if they're doing okay and if he hates me.",21Mar2020,1
813,"I was recently offered a job in a similar field that I'm in now (Retail sales/merchandising). The whole situation was very sudden. I was approached at work (at a store) by somebody that gave me her card. I set up an interview the next day. A few days later I was offered a job with better pay, hours, etc. 

I was given an offer (contingent on screenings) and already have a start date of 4/6 (two weeks from Monday). I had everything completed by this past Wednesday and now I'm waiting to hear if everything checked out. The thing is, I had a Super High BAC, among other charges several years ago, and I'm not sure if my driving record will disqualify me. \*\*I'm pretty sure it will be under my own insurance since I had to call my agent to have my cover changed to meet their minimum requirements\*\*. The lady that recruited me, seems really enthusiastic to have me on board. We had a 45 minute phone interview and I really impressed her (her words). 

My current boss is a cool guy and our whole merchandising team is struggling to keep with the customers at our stores. He gave me a raise a few days ago after a glowing performance review ($14.00 to 14.25 ha). 

Should I say the 2-Weeks Notice is Contingent.. or possibly say I had a change of heart if I find out the that I DID NOT get the job. I don't want to push my start date back on the other job. We're both eager for me to start there and I think if I ask for more time it may appear that I'm hestitant/reluctant.

These problems haven’t just appeared recently, they were around from the day I got it done but have been getting worse only recently. I doubt that my cleaning schedule has anything to do with it because the timing doesn’t match up.

One of my (soon to be) step Brothers moved out leaving his room empty and I thought ""hey, maybe I could move in with my dad and go to this school""
 Basically ever since I came out to my parents my dad has been way more supportive than my mom. My dad's fiance is also super supportive and so are all of her kids.

 I brought the subject up to my mom and after a long period of us talking, arguing,yelling and just not getting along over it she said that I can not change her mind no matter what and she's not going to court. I explained all of my reasons to her and she's just not trying to understand, I don't think see wants to understand.

821,"Hello, first time posting in this sub. I just need some advice during these hard times. 

My fiancé and I are suppose to be married next week. 

We originally were gonna go to the court house but once my family knew of us getting married, they have since taken charge of planning. My mom got me a dress, cards, and all that fun stuff. I don’t mind really. I am marrying my best friend and that is all I care about. We got our marriage license and announcements to send to family (only my parents and his will be at the actually ceremony). 

With the world the way it is and things becoming real, things have fallen to a right mess. We canceled our celebration with friends and even our dinner out with our family. And we can no longer visit our grandparents to share the news. We were still going to have our small ceremony with just us and our parents. 

I have been trying to put a brave face on but all of this has taken a toll on me. Today it felt like the straw that broke the camels back. I called our jeweler to see if my ring had come in, and we were told that they are not getting any shipments today and are closing for the next two weeks. I am glad they are taking care of their employees and closing rather than putting them at risk but it was devastating to me. I know marriage isn’t about the rings but it was one of the few things I thought I would still have. But that did not happen. 

I broke down and just felt like a spoiled child crying over silly things. We are lucky to be healthy and safe. But, I am so done with things. My mother keeps asking me about the wedding that I am just about to scream. She keeps trying to say “well my first wedding there was 8 inches of snow.” I know she is trying to help me feel better but it is not working. I am not sure what to do. 

I am ready to just meet with the officiant and elope with my fiancé and have a “ceremony” later. But I know it will break my mother’s heart.  my parents and his have spent so much on this, and I am just so emotionally drained and tired of crying. 

Long story short. Should we elope or go through with the ceremony? Is there any other choice? (And it cost us 100$ to get the marriage license and if we do not use it in the next 2 weeks, we have to spend it again for another)",21Mar2020,1
822,"context: we're both 17. i'm female, he's male (Max). 

max and i both do performing arts (just gonna call it drama) A level and are meant to have a real exam in May but because of COVID-19, it's been cancelled and the uncertainty of grades has everyone on edge. 

max has a history of destructive behaviour. only last month he was allowed to come back to school because he overdosed on cocaine with a friend. he has mental issues and has spoken to me briefly about it as he feels we can relate to the feeling. we are not close. we don't hang out outside school and only talk when things in drama need doing. 

our class (4 of us) have a group chat for drama and max frequently says he can't be bothered anymore and that he's going to kill himself (i just got one of these which is why i am here now). the thing is, one person in the group (kiki) will joke about it. this is a convo we had a few weeks ago; 

max: i'm act gonna kms

kiki: do it. we wont have to perform \*we had a performance coming up\*

max: ive got mdma, sleeping pills and vodka. i'm gonna do it (picture of these things)

me: max actually don't

kiki: lets make a suicide pact. sega, you in? 

me: you guys need to stop

then the convo dissolved into complaining about school. here's the thing; i am also sensitive to these topics. i have a very prominent history with suicide, depression and anxiety and max's behaviour makes me nervous for him. 

he's currently 'considering' because of the virus and how it wouldn't matter because so many people are dying. he said him dying wouldn't make a difference. i'm worried. he talks like this A LOT but always shows up the next day so i almost can't take what he's saying seriously, as horrible as that sounds but now there is no school. which means his motivation is gone and i can't confide anonymously without it looking really suspicious because there's only 4 people in the group chat.

I have then since calmed myself and don’t start first or break his things. Now I’m a little crazy and controlling about what he does because of past lies and I hate that I let myself get this far but I can’t help it and I try and trust him but I don’t even like him checking out other females even on snap he says he doesn’t even look at those pics since it’s mostly like in between funny videos but you can subscribe to pages that don’t promote any females and it’s not hard to miss when they do post them and he says he doesn’t even know they do but.....anywayLike idk there’s no need to add pages that show naked girls? 
So I got to bothering him basically and texting him in the am and annoying him and told him I was gonna basically move his money to mine to re pay for a pet we took to the vet and I moved it given I didn’t do nothing with it I was just trying to get him annoyed because of the snaps with girls getting me mad. He came in and grabbed my phone and proceeded to throw it and then threw dog food towards me and I went to push him and so then he proceeded to throw more and opened it and threw it at my face and I threw a bottle but not hard I wasn’t even trying to hurt him and he proceeded to pull my hair and put his fingers in my mouth and put the dog food in my mouth ( canned dog food blue buffalo gravy flavor) and then proceeded to sit and me and grabbed my throat and I couldn’t breathe and kept asking him to get off and trying to tell him I couldn’t breathe and he knew he said he didn’t care and then every time I got him off to try and catch my breath again he got right back on until I told him I’d stop having an attitude which is what bothers him but given I am very cold sometimes because he has done things that include other females and it hurts me&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing physical but texting and shit is still like cheating to me because he was being secretive multiple times) 
anyway so I know it’s on both our faults but he proceeded to tell me why I make him get that mad and started crying and telling me he didn’t even mean to do that and he doesn’t like to but DAMN wtf. As of right now I have small scratches on my face from being slapped a bruise from a head butt and my throat what bleeding and it hurts so much I can’t even talk it move my tounge, now he has never abused me when it’s not arguing it’s not a daily thing but when we get like this it’s gotten bad and this is the worst and idk because when we’re good it seems like we do wanna try and he literally does everything for me and gives me what I can like this boy is like a lost puppy for me and we can be very happy but idk and  when he gets mad it’s like he’s a whole other person. (Again our big fights have really calmed and we do talk a lot after but this was a lot)
as I said earlier I badger him a lot for what he has done and I dint mean to but I just do and it does really affect him and I do make him feel very shitty almost every week and then idk it just bursts and I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing! I wanna see us at our full potential but is it even worth it when I can’t trust him and we get like this? ( he has really gotten a lot better with the other female stuff since January But i get triggered him even having pages shows females pictures that are provocative. ) I just need people’s thoughts to be more logical and not in my own head cause I don’t wanna talk to people that know him and I because I don’t like saying what happens and makes me feel dumb so sorry internet people for my bs.

This one hurt. But it could of been worse. I was in the club dark club.. I been getting few numbers through the night. Danced with a few girls didn’t think nothing of it. 

One of them ended up being a trans women. 
I felt so ashamed and violated. I found out 3 weeks after the day in the club. this person hits me up to chill, I was busy that day. I stalked the social media’s ( I have my ways without asking) I always double check. We never really texted so we didn’t have no in deep convo. Something seemed off. Until she hit me that week to chill. 

It’s funny because I try to avoid things like this. Something wasn’t right but I was naive. Pictures super edited don’t really remember how the person looked like.


I found out that day. Started asking questions cause things seemed fishy. Even though after I found out the person ended up texting me the truth. I just didn’t respond and blocked the number. 

(Could of handled it better but I was pissed) all I could think bout was that day in the club 

I felt ashamed. And so embarrassed. Usually in situations like this someone in the club would of tapped me on the shoulder or not maybe no one noticed. 

I feel like they should of told me right then and there.
I never met up with the person so I didn’t do anything sexual with them or go on a date. (Thank god)

I do remember dancing for for 4 secs with them though.

This situation been bugging me for the past month because I never felt so embarrassed in my life. Questions like “how I didn’t noticed?” “Club was loud didn’t get to hear the voice” I should of took a good look at the person” 

I bet People that were at the club that day was like “ I don’t think he knows” or was just laughing. 

I’m a straight male. Dated plenty of women. 
I do care about reputation though. I don’t want to go out in public or a club and people whisper this situation talking about me. Like “ ain’t that the dude dancing with the trans that one night” and worse see that person again because it would just bring anger out.

I been in house for the past month isolated.

My dad has had so many different jobs and it’s caused so much stress for me and my family. I’ve lived in so many different states so it’s hard for me to plan for college and my future when I’m always moving. 

My dad has started getting very upset with me because I told him I don’t plan on attending college anymore and instead want to go straight into the workforce. He’s called me a disappointment to my face, lazy, and how I don’t have any hope for my future, even thought I have a 3.5 GPA and am very smart. I help around the house and try my hardest to make him love me but I don’t feel loved. My mom pretty much steps back and tries not to interfere with what my dad has to say to me.

I live in Ohio now and just moved away from Indiana over the last summer. My dad called me a prick today for losing a cheap basketball ball me and my brother were playing with last week. He didn’t even blame my brother, just me and he went off on me.

No matter what I’m leaving the house, even if he doesn’t want me back anymore. I can’t handle the mental abuse he’s put me through and I need a few weeks to steam off from my family. No matter how mad he gets at me tonight for telling him this, I’m doing it. My question is...

Can he stop me from doing this? My 18th birthday is in 3 weeks, but I can’t do this anymore. What are my options here?",21Mar2020,1

848,"I've been with her for almost 3 years, and it's easily the best relationship I've ever had and we get along great. I do feel like she has a tendency to sometimes act childish, even though we're both in our mid 30s. 

Our state is impacted by coronavirus but our county has so far been spared from a large outbreak. Recently we went to a neighboring county to try to find a couple items we've been having trouble finding in our small town. As we were shopping, she kept grabbing items to look at them and show me them, which I normally just find annoying because I find it really childish. But with the current coronavirus situation in california, I feel like it's stupid. I finally told her I really don't think she should be touching everything, and she was kind of pouty about it. I REALLY don't like to feel like I am parenting my girlfriend - she is older than me! If I saw a stranger acting like she was, I would think they were a complete idiot. I hate to feel that way about someone I love but I feel like my point of view is valid.

Before that, when small shops were still open in our town, she complained about signs asking people not to touch merchandise unless they were going to buy it. I just really think this attitude is selfish and immature, not only am I worried about her safety but I also think it's selfish and inconsiderate towards others. 

She's also still going to work, even though her job is not essential

I feel like she thinks I am being lame by taking the virus seriously. I think she's irresponsible. Sometimes if I try to talk to her about stuff like this, she gets very defensive and kind of bratty. I love her but I feel absolutely turned off by how she acts sometimes - how do I help her work on this side of herself?",21Mar2020,1

I have grown up at this camp and refer to it as my second home. It will be me fourth year on staff and last (if i were to go). I had recently decided to apply to a summer internship that i didn’t believe i would get, and recently i found out that i had gotten the job. I am a rising sophomore with a major in the STEM department. 

I would love more then anything to be a counselor for one more summer but that being said I feel that giving up this internship for a counselor job would be a stupid decision. If i were to work the internship i would most likely be able to volunteer on occasional weekends. What do you think i should do? I love my second home and have a ton of outstanding memories with those my age and with my campers too.

850,"So I've been friends with this person for years now, I'd consider them one of my best friends and basically my only friend (aside from some university friends). Anyways, last December I lost my cousin to mental illness and it was the third cousin of mine I've lost from it. I was devastated. At the same time juice world had passed. We have a group chat composed of 4 people and my one friend thought to make a joke about juice worlds death to me since I don't listen to that type of music at all (I'm not quite sure why exactly, it was a REALLY stupid joke). Anyways, he goes on to say that he's sorry for my loss and that they're all there for me in this hard time. I had to let him know that the day before I actually lost someone. They all left me on read and never responded. They went back to normal later sending memes. I was so hurt and it was finals season on top of it all. I didn't speak to any of them for a month as I needed time away and none of them reached out to contact me. Finally, after a month, I get asked if I died in that group chat and my best friend then calls me. We talk for a bit and she says that if I'm upset to let her know. So I did. I have BPD so I'm not really good with confrontation and I just want to please everyone and I let things slide under the rug all the time. She apologized and then apologized for being distant saying she has no reason and will do better and that I'm her best friend and she would hate to lose me. I hoped for the best as I didn't want to lose a friend. We talked more often and then all of a sudden nothing from her. I've always been the one to put in the effort, so this time I just gave up to and focused on school.  I know I should let her go and people have been telling me that I should've been furious with the way they treated me and to cut them off, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it, but it hurts me when she leaves me on read and never responds yet when we are together she will always be on her phone. I don't want to lose a friend as I don't have too many, but I'm tired of being hurt and feeling ignored. They moved back to town and never even let me know they were back until I texted them.

854,I'm 16. A year ago I was taken to the doctors (other problems not for weight gain) and they told me I was underweight for my age (70lbs) and that if I lost anymore weight I would eventually become anemic. So I started trying to gain weight with the guidance of a nutritionist. It's very hard for me to gain and very easy to loose. In 6 months I had gained 2lbs. At this point I wasn't really paying attention to how my body looked I was really depressed (diagnosed but wasn't on medication as my mother decided that depression isn't a real illness). Another few months passed and I gain a few more pounds. I am now at 87lbs but the healthy weight is 100lbs but I feel fat. I feel disgusting. When I look down at my stomach I feel like it looks big. And family are noticing my weight gain too. They are saying it looks like I gained weight not in a mean way but if they noticed it then it's probably true. So now I want to try to loose some weight even though I know it's not healthy I can't help but feel this way and I don't known what to do. I feel stupid.,21Mar2020,1

859,"We met in December when I was part of the company we both work for's training group. Things went well and we clicked as if we knew each other for ages before. 

Certain things made me a little hesitant about being her friend but I just shrugged it off , thinking it was me over thinking things. 

The first time I felt like it isnt me but her was when she complained that at 21 she should be out partying and drinking and having fun rather than being in university and working. I felt really saddened about her way of thinking because she doesn't realise how lucky she is. 

Then, since this Covid-19 stuff, shes been taking irresponsible actions such as coming into work when she should have been in isolation still (she rang on monday to say shes in self isolation and by the Wednesday she was back in work) , getting a tattoo and just hanging out on that Wednesday. 

Then shes just posted saying that all our world is doing is giving us antibacterial wipes for our computers and hand sanitizer. If she had been bothered to actually care about anything she'd know that a small group of people in work had set up a system for people to work at home, some staff staying way over their shifts and using their holidays to help set up, figuring out how to keep secure details of customers safe such as bank account details and how to get systems in place for work at home in less than 2 weeks...baring in mind that there are over 100+ staff and want most of us to work from home. 

She also posted that she doesnt believe in the virus and that everyone should calm down about it , I felt extremely mad about this as my sister and dad are in self isolation because of my sisters severe asthma and my dsd having a really bad cough and some Cornonovirus like symptoms.  She has no idea how inventive that had meant. I'm not able to see my sister on her birthday because of it. And I cant just pop over and leave presents at the door because I am trying to self isolate when I can - i dont have the option to work at home due to space needed in my house so I'm trying to limit my contact with people. 

Shes also asked if I wanted to stay in a hotel and have a girly night in april ... I said yes at first but as the UK is 3 weeks behind Italy in the numbers, the time we would go would be at the time where things get really bad. 

I don't know how to tell her I don't want to be her friend anymore as we work together on different departments and shes been through a lot and was there for me but I'm not liking her true colours at all. And i am so hurt by them. 

How do I tell her? I don't want to hurt her but I just feel like I can't ignore her comments",21Mar2020,1
861," 

I have a problem with marijuana use. I started smoking in college around 2/3 years ago. Being an introvert and quite shy, I got into smoking alone and spending my highs listening to music, gaming, reading etc. During this time I was suffering bad anxiety and I truly felt like weed was helping me in some way as my life generally was improving around this time.

Eventually I had a bit of a breakdown/psychosis due to stopping cold turkey on my anti depressants and heavily using weed at the time. I'm not sure exactly what caused this to happen (stopping zoloft, weed or maybe something else). The whole thing was bad and my parents were really upset when they discovered I'd been smoking weed.

I promised them I would stop and I did for a while, but eventually I'd start using weed again, mostly vaping. I feel really sneaky and sly as I'm vaping at night when they aren't aware. My parents would kick me out if they knew, that's how against it they are.

Getting high doesn't even feel good anymore really, I just feel guilty the whole time I'm doing it because I know how much it would upset my family. But still, I get high most days. This is the first time I've admitted this in anyway, perhaps even properly to myself.",21Mar2020,1
862,"Ok. Here goes nothing. 

 I have a friend (who happens to be in my class) who is generally very nice to hang out with, and they're (most of the time) not a bad friend at all. However, over the course of time I've known them, they've begun to change..maybe for the better, maybe for the worse. For me? I think it's for the worse. Why? They've begun making fun of me for their own entertainment purposes. They're cracking cruel jokes at my expanse at every opportunity they see, and they're making my other friends laugh along with their jokes too. It's sickening, and I wanted it to stop-even if this wasn't meant to be harmful. 

So I told them (Via Email, because I don't necessarily like confrontations) about how I felt after one particular fight we had over a joke they had made about my depression. They handled it ok, I guess, but I could tell that the email had affected them negatively-and since I didn't want any more unnecessary conflict, I just stopped there, hoping my email had carried my message across: ""I don't like the jokes you make about me, and I'd like you to stop."" And they did stop. It was peaceful....except for the fact that those jokes has started popping up here and there again, and that they're still hurt and angry about my email for reasons they won't tell me about. They even told me that they felt like they could no longer be themselves around me anymore, without their jokes. After consulting another friend and reading up on several articles and forums from various people all over the globe with similar problems, I've come to some conclusions: either I'm too oversensitive about their jokes, which is meant to be a sign of trust and affection in our relationship, or that they're a toxic friend and that I should lessen or cut ties with them. And after a lot of thought, I've decided that for the benefit of both parties, it would (probably) be for the best if I limited my interactions with them. Great. No more stressing fights for the both of us. Yay. 

But like any complicated issue, there's always a 'but' in the situation. In my case, it's that they're an incredibly sensitive person (like me, I guess) who *has* had a difficult past. They also have anxiety and I really don't want to hurt them in any way by doing anything to change our relationship. This person is the type to never forget about an issue that has scarred them in any way, and I don't want my decisions to haunt them forever. I want them to grow as a person in life, and not become someone stuck in their past for the rest of their life. And yet if I try to fade from their life in an unnoticable, natural way, they'll most likely continue to chase me for the better traits of our relationship. 

Should I suck it up and live with those insults for the rest of my school life? Should I try to be less sensitive, and patch up my insecurities for the better traits of our relationship? Or should I take the risks and hurt them anyways, knowing that it would scar them for the rest of their life? If I tell them again to stop it with their jokes, would they even respond in a positive way? What if I end up hurting them even more by saying that? I don't want to force them to change who they are for the sake of our relationship, but what if there are more people in their future who are like me? Would I be hurting them by not doing anything to help my friend change now?

870,"I have a problem with pacing the floor. I put in earbuds and listen to music and pace the floor for hours and hours on end. Even when I am at work or school all I can think about is how nice it will be to get home so I can just pace again.

Sometimes, I'll download full tv series and movies and act out the entirety of the movie using other characters from other movies and series. Its *very* satisfying for me. When there is a sex scene or a kissing scene it feels emotionally stimulating and I feel genuinely wanted and loved in that moment--when I am alone. Pacing. I can't EVER do it when anyone is around.

I'll wake up in the morning and the urge to pace is already a prominent thought in my head. Sometimes, I can't force myself to go to sleep because it is just so nice. Other times I won't shower or do homework at all. I can sometimes go a few days without doing this, but if I go longer then that I start feeling depressed and angry.

This started when I was 12 years old, and I kept it a secret from my family. Until they all grew wise about it. I don't know what caused this either. It just started. Any theories on why?

 Now its just this normal thing. ""--------- has to get home so she can pace.""
""You don't ever do anything but pace."" I am 19 now and have missed out on 7 years of my life and I still can't stop.

I do it on vacations and sometimes I'll even cancel plans with friends and even appointments so that I can do this. I waa going to see a therapist to talk to about this, but the idea of revealing this fact about myself and having to see the judgement from someone who genuinely thinks I'm crazy and doesn't understand is too overwhelming. So I stayed home and paced. I really wanted to move in with my friend but I knew I wouldn't be able to do this.

872,Honestly I’m okay with masturbation in a relationship my boyfriend of 1 year lied to me about it and said I’ll stop doing it and he’s done this 3 times. It frustrates me so much that he keeps lying he expects me to trust and when I accuse him of lying he gets mad at me and runs away and ignores me for a day sometimes when I actually found out the truth from his phone that he was in fact lying . Anyways he finally told me his reasoning behind masturbating was because I’m not good enough sometimes I’m not tight enough it doesn’t feel good masturbating feels way better sometimes that just made me hurt so much.. I get if a guy wants to masturbate when their horny and their girl isn’t around but he admitted to avoiding sex with me because he prefers to masturbate but he doesn’t care that I’m not good enough sexually and still wants to be with me... how fucked up is this cuz idk... he used to want to have sex with me everyday then he started wanting it less to the point he’d go 2 weeks without wanting me... now when ever we do have sex he’ll finish within 5 mins so obviously it’s not horrible or else he wouldn’t be able to finish but he claims it’s that bad. He doesn’t understand why this upsets me so much and think it shouldn’t matter. I love him still but I hate him it’s confusing ... like I don’t know how bad this relationship seems.. basically he didn’t communicate with how he felt for so long a is instead told me that he was just to sore and tired to have sex and lied .. idk what to do it hurts being with him but it’d also hurt to not have him anymore because he still is fun to be around,21Mar2020,1

874,"Growing up my mum was really obsessed with weight and incredibly insecure about her own weight. My entire childhood was filled with fad diets and slogans like “ if you loose weight then you’ll be prettier” or “ nothing tastes as good as being thin feels” or how “ nobody will love you if you’re fat etc” 

My mum would often laugh or point at people in public that were overweight and she’d ridicule how they look. I even recount an incident where my mum saw an overweight girl in the street and then spent the rest of the day mocking this girl and imagining what food she must eat and how many meals a day. So I just sort of grew up with a normalisation of this toxic mentality. 

My friends all tell me that I’m a healthy weight and have a nice figure, but I just can’t see it. When I saw that pic of me from a year ago where I was still really self conscious I actually thought wow, I look alright? I’m normal, I’m not fat or overweight- but I still can’t help and look at my body in the mirror and I think I have a really big waist- that doesn’t go “ in” like most people and that I’m really wide and not petite and feminine and therefore - obese and overweight. 

I know all of this stress is connected to my mum and growing up around it but I’m not sure how to begin this confidence growth and breaking out of this cycle and getting to a more positive mindset. My boyfriend has told me that he’s concerned that I’m self conscious of my body and always mention my weight- I’ve tried to stop talking about it and unfollowed all the Instagram models and things-and started working out at home, but apart from that I still feel self conscious and like I want to hide my body in clothes that are too big.

876,"My 19 year old son feels good when he gets high. He has been doing drugs since he was 15, and drinking since he was 17. He dropped out of college. He takes drugs, pills and shots. He was questioned by the police after they saw marks all over his arm, and after that he started putting the shots in his eyes, so the police don’t see his arms all marked. He also smoked pot, until he had it taken away. He has been arrested once for underage drinking, drunk driving, and falling asleep in his car at a McDonald’s drive thru. He has had his drugs and alcohol taken away from him about 3 months ago. We are about to kick him out of our house, as he is jobless. 

I’m really worried, just an hour ago, he did a stupid thing. We rented a large helium tank from Party City for our party that we’re having tomorrow. His friend told him helium can get him high. He was so desperate, so he locked himself in his car with the helium tank and got oxygen deprived. He fainted and right now, my husband is driving him to the hospital. 

I’m scared, as the hospital apparently will only deal with people who have the coronavirus right now, so they probably won’t do shit to him. He has been trying to get high for a while, and people did stupid things to get high in the past, but locking himself in a car with helium?! Who would be retarded enough to do that?

In this house, the way utilities are split is that everyone transfers $100 every two months to a shady joint account that for some reason is one of the girls' personal back account.

I have moved out today (March 21), told H that I would not be paying the April rent, and vacated the premises.

Here's where things get hairy; I have used 3 days of electricity and water, 11 days of gas, and 6 days of internet. For this, the current tenants, led by E and S, are telling me I need to pay the full month's payment for utilities, gas, and internet for March 13-April 13 in FULL (about 50$), IN ADVANCE.

I refused and said I was willing to pay half of 1/7th (we live in a house of 7) of the total bill for all of those things.

(There are underlying issues with these girls, they truly are awful people, I can elaborate if anyone requires it)

I should also mention that the bills go to one of the tenants (S) and is under her name, and not the landlord.

When I refused to pay the full amount, they told me this:

""OP I don’t think you understand. The bills are paid automatically so when we ask for transfers it is necessary for everyone to transfer when asked and not 2-3 weeks later. If the rest of us didn’t transfer before, we would’ve had to pay extra fees because utilities are automatically paid from the account and are taken out immediately. Not paying your full share of the utilities is NOT an option. It was something you agreed upon at the start. We are understanding for April-May utilities as you have moved out now. If you are not going to pay for utilities, we will take further actions to ensure this is dealt with fairly""

What should I do in this situation? Is there any legal basis for the threat? Is it completely unreasonable to pay half when the bill comes rather than a fixed portion ahead of time?

Thanks for any and all advice :)",21Mar2020,1

I'm a physician and live a 12 hours drive away so for a multitude of reasons I won't be seeing her for a long time. My other siblings and I have tried to cheer her up by sending little gifts in the mail (i.e a puzzle, a sudoku book) and calling daily but she definitely feels isolated as she can't see any of her friends or go to her exercise class, the library, etc.

885,"I (26F) live with my mother and brother. I'm planning on moving out with my long term partner. In discussion on moving out, we (me, my mum and my brother) have had heated arguments about me wanting to take my cat (R) with me. Mum uses the excuse that R is not mine she's ""ours"" however before the discussion of me moving out came about, R was always known as mine and mum had previously expected that I would take her with me when I move out ""one day"".
I pay for vet bills and paid for desexing, I feed her, I change her litter, and she is bonded to me and never leaves my side. We got her from my brother's friend who was moving interstate and couldn't take R with her so we adopted her. In our house, we don't just claim ownership of the cats, we let the cats choose who they bond to, and although it was my brother's friend (another excuse that's being tossed around in the arguments), R chose to bond with me and this has been accepted in our house for the 9 years we've had her, it is only now that I have solid plans to move out and take her that they say she doesn't belong to me. Mum argued that the registration was in her name, but I'm pretty sure we never even registered her. 

I had two cats (R and D) but D, who was very special to me, died recently only a few months after my grandad died. It has been a huge emotional toll on me and I've been suffering severe depression. R has been my emotional support through it all and she's all I have left. 

Mum says that to move R into a new environment would stress her out too much. I disagree, cats are very adaptable in changing environments and I feel that suddenly moving away and leaving R would cause more distress for her because she's got such a bond to me. When I've come home from work or being away for the weekend, mum tells me that R cries for me the whole time I'm gone. I come home to cat toys on my bed and R gets very clingy for hours. 

At home, we have 3 other cats who belong to mum (technically one of them is mine as the microchip is in my name and I claimed ownership but he didn't bond to me). 2 of them are quite nasty to R and attack her all the time. She's always on high alert and scared, she hides in my room and basically lives in fear all day. So of course I want to take her out of this situation. 

If I leave her at home with mum and brother, she won't get the care and attention she needs, because mum is bed bound disabled and the cats in mums room won't let her in, and my brother locks himself away in his room all day playing video games. R will be completely alone all day everyday. 

Every time I try to have an adult conversation with mum about this, she makes up every excuse she can think of and when I explain why these excuses aren't correct, she just starts yelling at me and my brother gets involved and they both yell shit like I'm a ""selfish brat"" 

I feel like the real reason mum doesn't want me to take R is not because moving her into a new environment is stressful, but more to do with mum wanting to control me to stay or visit more. This is evident by a twitter thread mum wrote where people commented saying ""I couldn't take my cat with me when I left home so I visited more"" and mum replied with ""😏""  

I don't know how you can help me, but I'm lost and I appreciate any advice you might have.",21Mar2020,1

She has been having siezures for a long time and didn't know it. My dad described it as her just getting really confused and not knowing what she was doing and it happens a lot. Even more now I guess, which is why it was identified.

890,"so with the building in lock down for guest i wanted to set up video chat so family's could see and talk to each other.

we have a 1 shared pc on each floor that is in a room we can close off so i was going to make up a shared facebook account for each floor that could add family members for residents on that floor and at set times staff could bring residents into the room and let them use it then clean it down before the next person came in.

the other plan i was going to see about is cheap prepaid phones and just not put mins on them (use wifi) only problem is the screen is small so not sure if they would be able to see well if we did that it would be nice to have a lot of them so its not the same one being touched by every one. and not sure where i could get a lot of cheap prepaid phones fast.

we could try to get fire tablests but not sure how fast that would be with amazon shipping right now",21Mar2020,1
891,"HI /r/Advice, 

I'm a 26-year old guy living in the Midwestern United States. After some time overseas, I decided to move back home for several months: I'm *supposed* to receive a graduate fellowship in September, and that fellowship would entail moving and staying abroad for at least one year. 

My decision to move home was made before coronavirus really spread outside China. I'm now in something of a precarious position: I've never got along well with my step-dad, and now I'm subject to his constant scrutiny. 

To make a long story short: he works full-time in a department store and does construction work on the side. He has not decreased his working hours in response to coronavirus, yet gets very angry whenever I leave the house for non-work-related reasons (for instance, he got pissed at me for going to the grocery store yesterday). Several minutes ago, he told me that I couldn't take my vehicle on ""drives"" (e.g., not meeting anyone, just driving around for the sake of it). He also dismissed a question as to whether I could still drive to some local woodlands for walks, because his ""contacts"" told him the state will soon be locked down (the governor said today she has no intent of enacting shelter-in-place orders). 

I haven't met anyone outside my family since coming back to the U.S., and I'm not planning to. Realistically, I don't think I'm *not* taking social distancing measures seriously. And I know two wrongs don't make a right, but it's hard for me not to get upset over the seeming double-standard: it's a fucking risk for me to maybe stop by a gas station, but not for my step-dad to be working full time *and* contracting on the side. 

I work and have classes online, and the entire reason I came back home was to save some money for my fellowship (my mom lived with her parents through graduate school, my sister stayed at home until she was 25 or 26, etc, so it's not like I'm defying familial expectations). 

Provided my fellowship doesn't get canceled, I have the option of moving down south with a friend for a month or two this summer (he's moving out-of-state to start an internal medicine residency and wants some company for the first couple months). 

How do I stay sane until then? I work online and would've just stayed the fuck overseas if I'd known all this was gonna happen.",21Mar2020,1

Theres someone else coming who is a heavy drinker and there’s already heat in the air pre- drunk. 


Now, if the arguments were standard / typical ones then it would be fine, however these arguments can get mildly violent, cause EXTREMELY rude behavior, and cause some of us to not speak for months at a time , screaming matches, etc. 


Basically the arguments are not insignificant 



Not only this, I literally don’t have my own room unfortunately, and there’s a quarantine, so I can’t leave. I can probably  go to my dads if I ask him but I’m not sure.
