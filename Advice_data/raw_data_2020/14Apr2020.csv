0,"I am a woman in early 20s. It’s been more than a year since I went on several dates before meeting my boyfriend. These guys are people I met on dating apps. I moved to a new state so I felt a sense of freedom, being raised in a conservative household. I matched with several guys on dating apps and been talking to them at the same time. I went on a date with a new guy almost every week for 2 months. No one seems to show wanting exclusivity, so I’m talking to them at the same time. No one shows consistency too, like they won’t talk to me for a few days, and say they want to see me again but it just never happened, probably due to lack of commitment and effort. . I was single so I thought talking to different men and dating different guys on first dates was fine. I also hooked up with most of them on our first and only date (no vaginal/anal penetration, just oral sex because I was afraid of going all the way). Some of these guys end up not talking to me for weeks, so I thought okay time to move on. There’s also one guy who consistently talks to me but seems to care about finally having full-on sex with me, which I wasn’t ready for yet but I kept talking to him because I was bored. There’s also one guy I didn’t hook up with, but I went over his place to sleep. He drove me to my apartment the next day and messaged me. I got so busy with my new job and forgot to respond to his message, I ended up messaging him 2 weeks after to which he didn’t respond, so I assumed he had moved on so I didn’t bother messaging again. Then, there’s this one guy I invited over to my place, we messaged each other for around 3 days, and he stopped messaging me. There’s also one guy I went on a date with and wanted to see me again days after, but on the day of the date, he ghosted me. 

Then, after all these serial dating, I finally met my wonderful boyfriend. Met him on the dating app, too. He’s just different from all these men. I felt a sense of commitment and exclusivity since our first date and thought he’s the one. Since our first date, I never opened my dating apps again. Never contacted any of the guys I used to see, as they never messaged me too. We are exclusively dating soon after the first date. 

Then, around 2 weeks to 1 month of exclusively dating with my boyfriend, one by one they started messaging me again. I decided to not respond to the others and blocked them as I have no intention of speaking to them, they ghosted me first I thought and I am with someone. The other guy who wanted to have sex with me, I told him I already have a boyfriend and wished me well too. I blocked them all on social media because I don’t want them to know what’s going on my life. Then, one saw me out with my boyfriend and messaged me, to which I politely told him yes I already have a boyfriend and he wished me well. And he was respectful enough to not message me again. 

I’m with my boyfriend for a year now and it’s going really well. We have plans together for our future. 

Then, just a month ago I received a Facebook message from the guy I invited over to my place over a year ago before I met my boyfriend. He’s the one who I spoke with for 3 days after our first date and stopped messaging me since then so I assumed he ghosted. I thought it was creepy so I blocked him and has no intention of speaking to him. 

Anyway, I guess I just needed to put this off my chest and seek for advice if I did it right. I don’t know why I kinda feel bad about this. I feel like I kinda ghosted them too, although they’re the ones being inconsistent, leaving me hanging for days or weeks until I met my now boyfriend. I guess I needed justification why I shouldn’t feel bad or how to make it feel right.",14Apr2020,1
2,"I'm 19/f. Not sure what it is, but I've been seeing this older guy for about two months now. He wasn't very clear with his intentions to start with, but I'm sure he just wanted sex then. He's aware now though that I'm interested in him, and at first the sex was good, but now it's just like gone downhill because we both have shit communication(over text) and I feel nervous every time I try opening up to him.  And I feel so uncomfortable and awkward when I try to text him about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't want a long-term relationship right now, I'm ok with us just being friends, casually dating, whatever you want to call it. I do like him, he's interesting. And I can tell he cares about me too. But at the same time I feel like I can't trust what he says. I've also found I have such a negative mindset when it comes to sex.. I feel more like an object the more I talk to guys online, and less like a human being with feelings and needs of my own. Like I'm just there to make them happy. And it's so hard to let loose in the bedroom and just relax because I'm always worried the guy is going to get angry/upset and just start going off because I'm not doing what they want me too. But from what I've seen, he's the total opposite of that. Just a giant teddy bear. But I have no idea how to open up and tell him any of this, or that I even should. But it's weighing on me so much, and I feel like I need too. I just don't want to make him feel bad in the process? Kinda feel like I've got no right, as well, to talk to him about any of this. 

I have no idea where this mindset came from either, or that i even had this mindset until recently, when he told me sex is about two people, not just one, and it kinda clicked in the moment that there's something wrong with how I think of sex. I guess it was on a subconscious level...",14Apr2020,0
3,I'm not sure if this is the best site nor sub to post this but I guess it's fine (?) During dinner times my family has been talking about what we want to do in life. I noticed two of my brothers (17) &amp; (19) have their life planned out whilst I still don't know what to with my life. I have three more years until high school and I want to know what the career I want before high school ends. I'm scared that I'll fail to find a proper job and burden my parents but maybe I'm just overthinking things,14Apr2020,1
4,"Honestly as the title suggests my nudes were exposed, on a snap story, and I need some advice. I always promised myself that I wouldn’t ever cry in this situation, but here I am, 1am crying on my bed with nobody to ask for advice because of quarantine, feeling surprisingly vulnerable and lonely at this time. Obviously being a woman this is to be expected and I know that there isn’t much I can do. I just honestly don’t know what to do and overall just confused and in need of some advice to help me feel not completely useless in this situation.

6,"This is really one of my first posts so I'm sorry if I get anything wrong, I'm not really active in this subreddit.

 For a bit of context, I'm 14 years old and currently in the eighth grade. Before I go into highschool, I have the opportunity to apply to go to a college campus for high school and graduate with an associates degree. I've known about this for a few years now because a teacher recommended it to me. My parents have also been aware of it, and they've been pressuring me to enter. It's not like I'm totally against it, I'm just terrified. I've always been a really anxious person and overall pretty sad, and something like this is totally out of my comfort zone. I'd be going to a completely new campus surrounded by people who are probably smarter than me. I'm also worried I won't be able to keep up or do well, or worse, be put on academic probation. I have good grades, never really below an A in any of my classes. Except for math, I've always had a B in math up until this year, where I'm taking honors algebra because my scores qualified for it. I'm awful at math, and I ended up with a D this past semester. I thought it'd be alright, not everyone can't be good at everything, but I know if I take a college level or even just an advanced math course I'd risk being put on academic probation in the college option. It's not only that but I've been ridiculed constantly just for that one grade. 

Normally, considering all of this, I'd be too scared to risk myself like that and just ignore the opportunity but my parents aren't happy with that. My dad has always been disappointed in me, he insists he isn't but I'm not stupid. The past two years he's been angry at me for not being active and doing sports, and he always gets a look of disgust on his face when he notices my anxiety. He's been pushing me to do this, and I really don't want to disappoint him again. This year I had already turned down my student of the year nomination and I hadn't competed in any Beta or Student Council competitions and he's been mentioning it all the time. 

One on hand, this will help me get a lot of what I want in life. All I want is to be successful and to have my dad love me like he loves my sister. It's incredibly hard for me when I can hear both my parents praise and love her, but when they talk to me they're just telling me I could be better. I know if I do this, my parents might be proud and I could skip two years of college in my future which would definitely be helpful. On the other hand, it's a lot of work and I honestly don't know if I can mentally keep up. The program states that you really shouldn't have a job because you'd be too busy with schoolwork and it's already hard enough to pull myself out of bed to complete my work now. Not only that, I'm just so anxious I don't think I could ask for help if I needed it. I also know if I fail and they send me back to my home school then not only will my immediate family be more disappointed than ever but my extended as well. I seen how they treated my eldest sister who's already moved out of the house, and it's awful. When we talk about her everyone seems so disgusted and disappointed. They treated her like garbage up until the point that as soon as she graduated she left and she hasn't come home since. One of my worst fears is ending up like that.

I'm really sorry that this was so long and the formatting probably isn't that great but I don't have anyone to talk to. I've tried mentioning it to my family and friends and they end up yelling at me or saying ""We'll love you no matter what :))"" Which is dumb, I know they won't.

Could someone please give me advice on what I should do??",14Apr2020,3
7,I’ve been offered an amazing job opportunity but the last qualifying requirement is a negative drug test. I use a dab pen because it helped me quit drinking. I use the pen 3-4 times a week and take about 2-3 hits at a time per use. My last hit will be 8 days before my drug test. Am I totally screwed or are there any options for me? I’d prefer to not use clean piss because most people I know don’t have it. Please help!?!?!?,14Apr2020,1

My partner and I moved from ON to BC Feb 12th. My partner had a job transfer lined up, We found an apartment and moved in while I was looking for a job. I had a couple interviews and some unplanned health stuff happen then the lockdown started and the employers informed me they were no longer hiring. 
We have to make a decision by the first week of may if we should stay in BC or move back to ON. 
Our plan moving here obviously did not predict the current circumstances. My partner is luckily getting partially paid from his employer until they can no longer keep paying. I was not able to apply for cerb and havent heard back from EI. Ive continued to apply for jobs, calling grocery stores, liquor stores, and applying through job banks. My original plan was to get a job and go to school in September. 
So the reality of the situation is we have enough money for 3 months (our savings and my partners partial income) then we would be at zero.
So After that we don’t know and we know many other people are in this same boat too. 
We are in limbo on the decision to stay here and wait it out and just hope for the best or moving back to ontario into my partners fathers house (they have a basement apartment) where we can at least save what we have and we both upgrade our education. 
By leaving we loose everything we have built so far and my partner may loose his current job. He may not have a job even if we stayed with how things have been going. The original opportunities we set out here for are no longer on the table. But in comparison life out west is far better quality than where we are from in ontario. We are torn on the decision as moving out here was a year of planning and to finally settle in but feel uncertain is so confusing. 
We are searching for another perspective, what would you guys do ? What questions would u ask yourself ? 
We appreciate any perspective at this point! 
Thank you 🙏

10,"Just for clarification, I'm a 13 year old male

So last Christmas, I gave this girl my heart and asked her out on a date and she said yes but the very next day she gave it away and said she would much rather go as friends. I brushed it off, no longer went on that date (I was upset with her) and got over it pretty quick. I was no longer attracted to her. 

This quarantine has had me think about some random things in my free time and that memory has popped up and ever since then, I have no longer felt like I was myself. I feel as though there is a fragment of myself missing that I can't get back. I have never been depressed and I also live a fairly normal yet nice life. I haven't shown any sad emotions and they have just been inside my head. Rejection happens and I have dealt with rejection in the past but nothing like this has happened before. Does anybody know why this is happening?",14Apr2020,1
11,"So, first off, I’m (F21) super insecure and have never been in a serious relationship before... that being said: 
There’s this guy (M20), we’ll call him David. I’ve had a crush on him for a couple years. We don’t know each other super well, we’ve only had a handful of conversations. I think he’s really cute, pretty funny, and seems like a nice guy. About 5 months ago, our mutual friend told me that he thinks I’m cute! I thought this would lead to something, but it never did. 

I am super shy and insecure, so I couldn’t bring myself to say anything to him, and decided I should probably just forget about him. Then, about a month ago, another guy (M22) who we’ll call Ben, asked me out. He was cute so I gave him a chance. He was a really nice guy, but as the dates went on, I found him to be incredibly boring. His entire personality is bartender and gym rat. 

We’re on quarantine now and Ben and I haven’t been talking much, it’s really hard to respond to dry texts, no matter how hard I try to ask questions or invite discussions. I want to tell him that I don’t think I want to see him again once we’re able to leave the house. But during all of this, I can’t stop thinking about David. I keep telling myself, maybe now would be the best time to try and tell him how I feel, if it goes south I won’t have to see him again until we go back for the fall semester, which is about another 5ish months from now. Should I say something?

Note to take into consideration: David doesn’t really use social media much so even if I do end up telling him, it’s possible he won’t see my message for a long time! 

TL;DR: should I tell this guy how I feel?",14Apr2020,3
12,"So I (21, M, UK) have just come back off annual leave to find that the manager for my place of work has put me down as sick for the rest of the week. I have not called her to say I'm sick and I received a call at 3pm asking if i was coming in, to which I said I am.
I am annoyed at this because I commuted to work, started work and was then told to go home as I wont be paid due to the managers decision to do this.

My question is whether or not the manager is allowed to do this? To say someone is sick to prevent them from working and to not inform them of this?

15,"So my little sister (20) was in a long distance relationship for about 2 years. They had planned to meet in Germany which myself and my family spoke highly against. Mainly going across the world to meet a guy she didn’t know in person alone just seemed like a sketch idea. We live in the US, he lives in Bahrain. From my understanding they had a falling out, she broke up with him, and now he won’t leave her alone. He’s made 100s of fake accounts, because she blocks him any time he tries to contact her. He’s contacted me, threatened to send pictures of her to our father, calls her all day and all hours. He has threatened suicide and sent her videos of how he plans to do it.

As I was about to pass him he stopped me and asked if I want to school which I replied with yes. He asked me for my name and I didn't see anything wrong with tell if him so I gave him my name and he asked me what it was like in school. I told him it was alright but a lot of fine break down and kids have vaping problems. He didn't know what a vape was so he wanted to my explain and told me to come closer. I didn't get too close because he looked sketchy and had what looked like needle marks all over his hands. I explained to him what vaping was so he then said ""why are kids smoking nicotine when they could be smoking weed"". I laughed a bit but then he asked me if I smoked weed (which I do a bit) I said yeah. He grabbed a small black bag from the basket of his mobility scooter and pulled out a bag of weed and asked me if I wanted to smoke a joint with him behind the bushes. I told him no because I have to go to my friends house which he replied with ""I'm no pervert I'm last my prime days anyway"". He then asked me if I wanted weed then wanted for the cars to pass buy then handed me a nugget. He then went on about how I should pray every night and that's it's fine to jack off all I want then went on about how I should find a girl who can provide and not a slut.

It was fine at first, but after the first game with him, it was obvious that he was quite good at the game, yet very childish blaming others for everything that went wrong, not taking jokes as jokes at all, and not taking responsibility.

 It really ruins the game for everyone in our team, and I feel I've made things worse, telling him to calm down and take it easy.

It's hard for my friends to let him go since he is very good indeed, but if this goes on, I don't think I'll continue playing in the team.

22,"TLDR; I (23F) work at a doctors office, we transitioned to working remotely due to the virus. Everyone in the office got the doctors’ number to also be able to contact them if patients need anything (“concierge medicine”). Doctor (60s?Male) started flirting with me over text, finally 3 weeks later I worked up the courage to tell him it is making me uncomfortable and I asked him to stop. Now I am anxious that work will be uncomfortable when I come in (we rotate who is in the office weekly) or that the doctor is upset with me. 


I have worked at this office with this doctor about 6 months now. 


So about three weeks ago we transitioned to working remotely most of the time due to the virus. Everyone in the office got both our doctors’ numbers to be able to contact them in patient emergency or urgent matters about patients (“concierge medicine” idk). By the end of the first week working from home the doctor started up texting me at first just emojis. I had reached out to him asking about a pt and if he was okay seeing her for a follow up in office after a hospital stay. At this point, details weren’t ironed out as to what pt’s we would be seeing and not seeing etc. He said okay but then he started asking me when I am coming back to the office that he is lonely by himself working. I just joked saying that I’m staying home from now on that I really like it. This is where I feel like it’s my fault that things escalated. 


So the next day he texts that he is sending me consults to keep me busy, I replied that I see them and will definitely get to them, thanks. 


The next week he texts me out of the blue that my contact picture needs to be a picture of me and not an emoji (animoji version of me on iPhone) and I replied I like my emoji just fine thanks. (Where I also feel like this is my fault since I replied). And he says you are cuter than that emoji. At this point I felt uncomfortable and ignored the text, but then a few minutes later he keeps going saying it’s his opinion if it counts. 


I ignore the text again and he sends another saying that he hopes he is staying within boundaries and he would never mean to offend me. That he appreciates everything I do and that I’m a wonderful person. So at this point I just said thanks and I appreciate the compliment but it’s my job etc. I know at this point I should’ve said I was uncomfortable because I started getting anxious and uncomfortable but I didn’t know what to say or if it was really that serious that I should say something. I feel really dumb. 


So the next day he sends a picture of him cleaning his office space, sort of an inside joke because I am constantly cleaning my office area usually twice a day and ppl in the office pole fun at me for it. I replied that I was proud of him for cleaning (I do say that to everyone when I finally catch them cleaning, cleaning gets me excited). I shouldn’t have replied. I see this all now as I am looking back. He says that making me proud gives him joy and he starts asking me when I will be back because I am bright and sunny and he missed me.


 He asks me if I can send a picture of me smiling. And I say no...because no. Then he sends me a picture of him and his daughter and I said aw that is sweet and he’s like so can you send me a picture now? Or come to visit me. And I just said no I’m staying in as much as possible, it’s no secret I have lupus therefore high risk. 


So finally today I had to come into work, the other girls called out sick and we were short staffed so I put on my mask and went in to open the office. Doctor finally gets there about 2 hours after we open but he always goes straight to his office. He texts me that that he is so glad I came in today. I didn’t text back. So he comes out and chats with me and the clinic medical assistant. I don’t remember how but Fredericks of Hollywood came up, that old lingerie store that went bankrupt. I passingly mentioned oh man they went bankrupt I haven’t seen one in years. So he’s like oh how do you know about that? I just kind of smiled awkwardly like how am I supposed to answer that? Then I turned back to my computer to work. 


Later I had to help him with setting up a patient televisit there were tech difficulties but as I was helping him set it up he muttered “Fredericks of Hollywood like fuck cumberbatchpls that’s hot” and honestly I didn’t really know what to do I just fixed the technical problem on the computer, told him it was fixed and left quietly. 
Later again he texts me “I want to hear the rest of the story, hope we have time this week, I’m fascinated” I ignored this. 


Before he left for the day he texted again “one day is not enough, you should come back tomorrow. I want to hear about your shopping trip, what did you buy there”. I just said you’re really crossing boundaries and I don’t appreciate it. 
Later again he texts “oh my god I hope I didn’t offend you cumberbatchpls, I think you’re amazing I guess I was goofing off. Apology accepted? You’re amazing”


I finally got up the courage to say that “I would like to keep a good working relationship with you Dr. .... I have tried to be polite because I don’t want to cause any scene or make it awkward. But those kind of comments you made and have been making are uncomfortable for me. I would appreciate it if you would stop.” 


He profusely apologizes and says that he is sorry for crossing any boundary that it was inappropriate. He says that he will delete this whole text thread conversation, that it was not correct. Any contact here on will be professional and respectful and that there’s no need for him to text me further. 


I haven’t responded to this. I don’t know if I should take it to my actual manager I report to or if I should let it go. I’m feeling guilty that I did something wrong and I’m scared that things will be awkward at the office. I’m sorry this is so long I just needed to talk it out and ask for advice. I know I played a part in this too, I shouldn’t have been so friendly with him in person or over text and I shouldn’t have let things go so far. I’ve always just wanted to be helpful and be thorough in my job which takes having a good relationship with my doctors. 


Has anyone ever been in this situation? I haven’t even told my husband about this whole thing because I’m scared he will be mad at me or try and go up to my work and do/say something or convince me to say something and I’m still trying to process what has happened. I’m just feeling a lot of guilt and I need opinions.",14Apr2020,1
23,"This feels like an odd question to ask, and I’m not sure if there’s a better subreddit to ask this. TLDR at the bottom.

I’m a nineteen year old guy, and I look young. Plus being five foot seven doesn’t help. People are rather touchy with me. Meaning they do random things like jab at my sides or stomach. This isn’t just family. My friends and even coworkers I wasn’t well acquainted with would do this. That’s just scratching the surface.

I came out as Bi-sexual to my good friends, and it’s nice that they’re not bothered at all, but it’s like they’re messing with me almost. My best friend can’t keep his hands off me, and even yesterday he put his mouth on my arm making me wildly uncomfortable. He’ll grab at my side or my legs and I’ve told him to stop but he doesn’t.

Then there’s the guy I’ve had a crush on for a while. This is the most extreme case. I thought he liked me back so I wasn’t too bothered by his touching. He’s gone as far as to nibble/play with my ears, and has even stuck his tongue down my ear on multiple occasions. This guy isn’t afraid to put his mouth on me, and I should’ve done something. When we’re alone together we’re almost always touching side by side, or he’ll lay on top of me, or some form of close interactions. This is on top of stomach jabs, grabs, tickling, etc. that seem to happen to me.

I don’t know if it’s just a “homies” thing or what. These two claim to be straight, but they’re the ones that do it the most. It makes me super uncomfortable, and it’s worse that I like one of them, but they both tell me they’re straight. So it’s like they’re messing with me. Both have no affiliation with each other. They’re a part of two different friend groups. 

I don’t remember giving any indication that my personal space bubble was nonexistent. Except that I allowed my crush in. This isn’t just about them. It’s like people don’t understand, even after being told, that I don’t like them poking at me. 

So what do I tell my friends, and crush? This doesn’t feel ok so how do I handle them? Ask questions and I’ll answer them. The more detail I can give the better response you can give. Any piece of advice is helpful. Thank you!

25,"I adopted a cat 10 days ago. I chose this cat bc the shelter said that people don't seemed interested in adopting him bc he's timid. When I met him at the shelter he was locked in one room with another cat bc he didn't like being around the other cats in the main part of the shelter. He was hiding and the volunteer picked him up and he seemed scared at first, but quickly warmed up and started purring after she began petting him. He then started walking around and rubbing against my leg and was receptive to me petting him. 

After I brought him home, he hid as most cats do. He would come out at night to explore, eat and use the litter box. He would let me pet him, but seemed scared. He would also occasionally explore the rest of the house during the day, but would run and hide once he saw us.

He has seemed to regress. The volunteer at the shelter suggested I force him into a spot where I can pet him and feed him treats at the same time. Another volunteer said I need to force pets on him bc he won't come out of his shell otherwise. However, he now hisses and scratches me when I try to pet him.

27,"my [16 f] boyfriends [16 m] parents have always been very crazy. I’ve known them to be as abusive to him. i know one time where they offered him money because they didn’t know what to do when they knew he wanted to die. 

I’m scared for him right now because the last I’ve heard of him was on Snapchat when he told me that his mom was making him block me and she looked thru his phone. now I think she saw more than she should of. we only text like that in private manner but never send pictures and we are under age so I get why she would do that but I think it is very much none of her business. 

I’m really not sure what to do because it’s basically like a ghost situation. he blocked me on messages and on snapchat . his instagram doesn’t have me blocked but i can’t be for sure he has the app downloaded anymore, as he is not a very social person. he never texted about breaking up he only said that his mom saw our texts he never specified how much but he said that she’s making him block me. 

I’m not sure how temporary this is and I have a feeling that he may be grounded but I am not sure that when she gets his phone he’ll still be allowed to talk to me. I am very scared for him right now because I want to know how he’s doing because he is very suicidal and he told me a lot about himself and that I was the only one that really helped him through anything and that he could talk to. 

I have him only on Instagram Snapchat and messages and I don’t want my friends to call him because his mom might see and he might get in more trouble. But I need closure and I cannot just leave him like this because I believe strongly that I love him it may not be true but I do care about him a lot. I don’t think I can move on yet until I have closure or know for sure what is going to happen between us next. i know his mother had always liked me anyway but now i’m sure not so much.

Does anyone have any advice ? I can elaborate more if I need to and I will respond. I just need all the help I can get or reassurance because I’ve never felt like this towards someone and I don’t know if I can move on because I’ve invested so much time in him and we are very very close me and him both have some of the same issues so we bonded through that.

30,"So I came home from work a few days ago to a yellow legal not pad piece of paper with the words “FOR SALE” in bubble letter on one of my cars (I have 2 one I use every day and one that just sits in a parking spot because it miss fires and I’m waiting to get it fixed to sell it). There is nothing else on the note not a price, phone number, apartment number, just the words ‘for sale’. 

I took the note off my car and wrote a note back informing the person to not leave another note on my car. Today I can back to find another yellow legal pad note paper in a gallon ziploc bag. The note read “Do You Party?”  I’ve left another note again informing them to stop a little more harsh this time. 

My question probably isn’t that simple, any suggestions on how to catch this person or get them to stop? I’ve thought about getting one of those dash cams u can rig to start recording when the car gets jostled but I’m afraid that they won’t bump my car hard enough to trip it.

My brother has caused many problems for this family and has been kicked out by both parents (they split up) so they can each get a break from him. However the main issue I have is that my brother contributes absolutely nothing to anything and expects certain things to happen. He isnt entitled by any means and is just clueless, but over the years my dad has over time gotten progressively more tired of his crap. I have told him that he should kick him out if he still lives there when he is 25 but my dad is too kind to do that and I know it. 

What should we do?

Extra info: 
My brother caused one of the two heart attacks my dad has had, hence why I dont want him near my dad  anymore so he can relax. Also my brother in no way is in financial trouble  and could easily afford to live alone but just doesnt.

33,"Hey friends. I'm really at a loss here, feeling disrespected and ignored. I have a really stupid situation that has developed into something that is really bothering me. 

A couple of things to know, for context: I live in a very big and beautiful house that I rent with 3 other people. However, one of their boyfriends and my girlfriend are almost always here, with my room mates boyfriend planning on moving in. We are all good friends, but there have been a lot of issues. I can't leave this place. It is my home, I have a large investment in this space and I need the shop to do my work. Im a recording musician working on producing my own album, and I need space for recording drums, mixing, and a few guitar amps and keyboards, and I need it to be quiet at the very least while I'm recording vocals and acoustic instruments, which I have asked many many times for from them. Just be kind of quiet or at least try to avoid being loud when I'm working.

So here's the thing. One of my room mates and his friends and my room mates boyfriend skateboard. All the skate parks are closed down. And he skates inside the shop I record in. All. The. Time. As you can imagine, skateboarding is INCREDIBLY loud. There is virtually no insulation in this tiny room I'm recording in, and you can hear everything including cars driving by 50 feet away if the microphones are recording. So I'll be working for a while, recording guitar and vocals, and then I'll hear the shop door get yanked open, the skateboards start flying, and speakers blasting music come on. They skate all around every room in the shop and dont care at all when I ask them to stop for a minute so I can just do one last take or tweak one little thing. They instantly hit the ""You Mad Bro?"" Button and become hostile to me, provoking me and acting like I'm being mean to them when they know this is how I make my living. 

At this point it's an every day thing because the skate parks are closed. At this point, they've set me back WEEKS on this project. At this point, I don't  know what to do or say. It's the loudest possible thing they could be doing and all I need is some peace and quiet. They blast music and skate for hours a day, and it's driving me absolutely crazy. The speakers they are using for music are mine, but If I take them or disconnect them, they are going to be angry and call me a dick. 

Do I just stop caring what they think? Do I keep trying to ask them? Do I invest a bunch of money in soundproofing this tiny room? They forced me into the smallest room in the house because they all need big bedrooms for their... I dont know, clothes and beds and desks, when I communicated very clearly to them that I need space and quiet to work on music or I won't be able to finish any music. I know this is weird, a musician asking for some peace and quiet, but I don't have the option of renting a recording studio or moving. 

They get incredibly offensive when I try to say anything to them about how I kind of need to work on my album, they are all students still and their parents pay for everything for them. I'm just trying to finish this damn record in the next little while so I can put some food on the table [If it even sells well].

any advice at all is welcome, maybe I just needed to rant for a minute. I'm terrible with confrontation and these guys are so testosterone and marijuana fueled that I dont feel like I can convince them that my work is worth their consideration. I csmt get a word in edgewise, and it's making me really really angry.

Ahhh. If anyone here has any experience with situations like this, it would be amazing if you could let me know of anything that might help. Thanks for reading this, have a nice day.",14Apr2020,1

35,"Someone I know seems to have some new ideas that I think are pretty radical if true. However, I’m having trouble validating the information they’re giving me. They sent me to a video documentary on youtube that I’m very skeptical of. I watched this one [first](https://youtu.be/MY8Nfzcn1qQ) and this one [second](https://youtu.be/bpBX-32mkL0). I’m sure there is more videos and articles they have been watching/reading but they seem extremely convinced of all of this. I am incredibly skeptical, as it sounds like a bunch of “conspiracy theory-esque” kind of things. There is common use of the word “they” (without a ton of explicitness) and “the elite” that immediately make me feel as though this is all a stretch. If you’ve watched those videos, I am not trying to say that sex trafficking does not exist and that it isn’t happening to the extent the people from these videos are saying but I want to know what the people from the video’s credibility is, and if other credible sources can confirm the same information. For instance, the International Tribunal of Natural Justice, what is it, its credibility? I looked up their site and I’m still skeptical of it. The person I know is also saying things that sounds preposterous to me like Bill Gates is playing a role in the coronavirus because he’s part of the “elite”. And that the government is using the coronavirus as a curtain to guise the the military intervention of sex trafficking. This all just sounds crazy to me.

So am I crazy for not really believing all this, collectively? Or are they, the person who’s been telling me this, crazy for thinking it is? Am I being too cynical rather than skeptical? Please help. Thank you.",14Apr2020,0
36,"Hi r/advice, I need some input on how to handle the situation. I am renting my apartment, and this is my assigned carport, accessible by an alley that is kind of hidden. A homeless man has chosen to use my car port area for ""managing their affairs"", and sometimes sleeps there too... he leaves a mess, and rummages around in the trashcans back there, and occasionally seems to be having a bender there

a few weeks ago, my neighbor told him off but he is back again... i told him off today, but didnt do a good job of being angry, upset or assertive. It does bother me, but i'm not sure how to approach the situation for next time

Can I beat up the mofo with a bat, or stick? can i call the cops when i see him next? if he is casually in the alley, minding his business and rummaging about, is that enough reason for me to be paranoid?

37,"Hi everyone. I wasn't sure where to post this question, and genuinely want some feedback and brainstorming so hoping you can help.

I live in a beautiful 10 person co-op. We share food, and lots of other items, but of course all have personal items as well. Once we got our shelter in place order in the state, I've been trying to figure out how to get my cardio in, especially because I have an old injury that's required two surgeries on my knee. I usually sweat it out on a spin bike, and when I found out we may be inside for a while, I started researching home spin bikes. 

I emailed our house and asked if they'd be interested in splitting a Schwinn spin bike with me. An older model would only be $300, a fraction of the ridiculous Peloton price I can't afford. No biters. Then 2 weeks later, when I realized we for sure would be indoors for a while, I asked the house again if they wanted a bike. No biters. I also looked online and saw the Schwinn IC2 model I wanted was sold out everywhere. So, feeling nervous, I put my energy into figuring out an alternative option, and pulled the trigger on this comparable bike for $350. 

When I told folks I bought the bike, they all were really excited about using it, and asked me if they could use it too. Instinctively, being a generous person, I said ""yea, sure!"" but now I'm feeling bitter, in part because I asked if people wanted to go in and I got zero responses. One of the challenging things about sharing everything is that someone still may ""own"" the item at the end.  But, I'd imagine that at that point, I'd just buy them out of their shares, assuming there haven't been wear and tear repairs needed.

So I guess what I'm grappling with is, do I tell people they can't use it? I'm leaning against this, because it seems dumb to have a bigger piece of home exercise equipment just for me in a co-op. Or, how do I express my frustration and also come up with a workable, fair solution? Here are some ideas I'm playing with:

\- Everyone who wants to use it pays a share, and also splits the maintenance cost if it's in need of repairs (for example, the felt resistance pad will get more worn with more ridership). Upon moving out, I buy them out of their share. 

\-Everyone who wants to use it just splits the maintenance cost if something were to go wrong in the future.

\-People pay a modest ""fee"" if they want to use it. I paid $350 total, so if 5 people use it, they each pay $20 or the cost of one spin class.  This amount could cover future maintenance, so likely wouldn't be envisioned as ""refundable.""

Or something else? Ultimately, I'm a little pissed that no one wanted it until I decided to throw down myself, and also want to strike a balance between being overly generous and being petty.

I've never really had a career path in life. Never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. Until I finally found a school for 3D modeling.  
I've been going to the school for almost a year now, my grades are good. I dedicate a lot of time to my work, and I know it ends up being really beneficial for the finished product.

I dont mind the job, I like the work. But I'm scared that if I lose focus on school, I'll end up too far behind.  
I want to ask if I can switch to part time, but I worry my manager will get upset and possibly just cut my hours completely, or tell me no.  
I know with part time (around 25 to 30 hours a week), I could pay for school and have time to focus on my school work.

46,"So this is a petty apartment neighbor problem, but I’m genuinely looking for advice. 

So about a couple months ago one of our dogs got out into our apartment hallway without us knowing.  Someone down the hall caught him and called us, so we immediately ran down to get him.  As we were running down the hall, another neighbor stopped us and told us that our dog just attacked his girlfriend while she was walking their dogs and was visibly upset.  We were surprised because our dog has never been aggressive and asked him what had happened.  He blew us off and walked back into his apartment without telling us anything.  He didn’t try to talk to us or give us any details about what happened, which I thought was weird.  

But I was just focused on getting our dog back so I met the lady down the hall who caught him and she told us that those people who we’d just talked to were being really mean to our dog when she found him and we shouldn’t trust them and keep our dog away from them.  When we got our dog back to our apartment he had a pretty broken nail on his back foot and was bleeding.  I was just completely embarrassed he had even gotten out and felt (and still feel) horrible about the whole situation.

The couple down the hall never tried to talk to us about what happened despite seeing them several times over the past couple months, so I just assumed everything was fine and we had moved past everything.  

But then comes today.  We were walking both our dogs and passed by our neighbor’s apartment as the girlfriend was leaving with her own dogs.  Her dogs are very reactive and started barking and pulling the leash (not aggressively) and we just sped up to get the dogs apart so they would calm down.  As this was happening she starts SCREAMING at us in the hallway that she’s “so fucking sick of our dogs” and “did we know our dog attacked her” and “fuck you guys”.  We both didn’t know what to say and she continued to yell as she went down the stairs.  
This really bothered me because it came completely out of no where.  We’ve seen them multiple times over the past two months, they never tried to explain to us what happened, never wanted to interact at all and all of a sudden she’s screaming at us in the hallway.  

Should I say something to the leasing manager?  Or is there anything I should do?  Should I just let it go?

I don’t want to start some sort of neighbor battle over something like this, especially when there’s no proof that anything ever happened.  Maybe she was just having a bad day and decided to take it out on us by screaming at us in the hallway, but I don’t know if it’s something I should have documented by the leasing office or not.

I got into a relationship with a girl who I knew had sociopathic and borderline tendencies before we even started dating, but she seemed normal and I was bored so I started dating her. well, i cheated on her a couple times and I wasn’t rlly sorry but I said I was so we could keep dating. after that I dumped her cause I found a different girl and we get along a lot better. well now she’s harassing me everywhere, on discord, on reddit, etc. i need some advice she’s an evil bitch with zero empathy or compassion.",14Apr2020,0
59,"Why am I so cold? 

My family has told me that I'm heartless. They're great people, and I love them. But I just can't really make conversation with them, and I've never felt particularly close to them. They tell me I need to fix my attitude as we frequently argue, and I feel like I barely smile around my parents.

I can never get too close to my friends. I can't trust any one of them with my life or my deepest ""secrets."" I have a decent amount of friends, but I either 1) hang around them because they're fun and I can't share my ""secrets"" or my ""feelings"" around them or 2) if I'm fairly close to them and do end up sharing my feelings to them, I still feel so distant. But what mostly happens in the end is that I have to end up dropping them. I've been thinking about it recently, and I realize I have dropped a considerable amount of people in my life. I feel so lonely, and I don't know why because I have so many people around me. When I'm out with my friends, I feel like I overcompensate for my true hidden feelings by smiling/laughing way too much than I need to. I feel like I'm basically pretending and hiding under some sort of mask. People for the most part think I'm ""really nice"", but they don't know what I'm like at home (when I barely smile and argue often). When I begin to get really close to someone or when I start liking someone, I try to distance myself. I don't want to get hurt or let myself have feelings for anyone (toxic relationship from 2 years ago).

I don't understand why I'm like this. Why am I so cold? Why can't I trust any one of my friends to the extent that other people can? Why do I feel like if I get too close or try to get really close to someone, I'm going to have to end up dropping them/or they will drop me? I mean, if my own family thinks I'm heartless, how can I let someone get close to me without thinking I am heartless too?",14Apr2020,1
62," My brother has a long distance relationship with a girl who I've never met in person. The only time I've ever said anything to her is from over his shoulder while he was facetiming her. A couple of days ago, she texted me about some joke I had made. I don't feel any romantic feelings for her and the texts between us have never gone beyond joking.

 She has made some compliments to me while he was talking to her and it seemed to make my brother jealous. He has also said to her that he doesn't want her talking to me but when he said it, it was supposed to being jokingly. 

 I don't know if I should tell my brother and risk him getting mad, or if I should just start ignoring her. I don't really want to go on texting her with him not knowing because then it would feel seedy and like I'm trying to hide something",14Apr2020,1

65,"I was in a car accident a few days ago. I must have been day dreaming and didn't notice the cars in front of me stopped (not at a red light, not sure why the front car stopped - they left the scene) and I ran straight up the back of a car which push their car into another a car in front. Fortunately nobody was injured.

It was completely my fault and I'm feeling a lot of guilt about it. My car and the car in front of me were both totally wrecked.

I thankfully had third party property insurance which will cover the other cars (my car was only worth $3k to $4k so not worth covering). I have lodged a claim.

Is there anything else I can do in the meantime? I just feel so bad about the situation and really want to do right by the other drivers.

If anybody has been on the other side before (not at fault driver) is there anything the at fault driver could have done to help you?

66,"I will be attending college fall of 2020. I've already committed to an out of state school. I've chosen to go to this out of state school because my boyfriend lives there and I want to close the distance. He's helped me with my depression and is honestly the sweetest guy I ever met. 

But I was going over financial aid statements from my other schools and they offered me more scholarships and it's cheaper. I can withdraw my enrollment from the out of state school but I would only get half of the money I paid to do so. If I continue to go to the out of state school I will be paying $5000 more then my other schools and that's not including room and board. Also, if I do continue to go to the out of state school, I will be living off campus. 

I know I wouldn't have chosen the out of state school if my boyfriend didn't live there. But I really want to close the distance after two years of dating. I love him and one day I want to marry him. But my debt is going to be so much higher because of it. Moreover I plan to go to law school, which is high in debt too.

74,"I’m a senior in college. I’ve had this big group of friends since freshman year and there’s always been this one girl let’s call Sandra who I’ve always thought hated me. Sandra is one of those people who can dish it out but not take it. She’s incredibly sensitive to jokes but then can be actively rude and insulting to others. Because of this I genuinely thought she hated me, until about a year ago when outta no where she started treating me like a best friend. She started inviting herself over a lot. And started taking the same classes as me. I find it sweet and I do like her in small doses but honestly she pisses me off a lot... she’s constantly asking me questions about literally everything and it can make hanging with her feel more like those conversation with children where every response to an answer is “but why is it that way?”. And if I’m being honest I never felt a real connection with her which I think is why it made me so annoyed. 

Once we started taking more classes together it only got worse. Initially they were online classes and she asked me if we could take the final together. I was hesitant but I agreed because I’d never done it before and I wasn’t doing too well. I deeply deeply regret it. From the very beginning I was answering every question and having to go into incessant detail to explain why it was the right one. It took away about 30 minutes from my exam, and I noticed that I was doing 90% of the work. She also got super upset because she got one point less than me, even though she checked all her answers with mine and then heavily insinuated it was my fault. Keep in mind I was able to find all the answers to this exam from my notes which we were all allowed to use. So in the end I didn’t need her, and honestly I felt awful about cheating on the exam. 

I’m not like morally against cheating it but it does make me feel guilty, especially when I don’t need to.  We started taking other classes in person and the issues pretty much went away.  Instead of taking finals together we would study together which is perfect! I didn’t really care about all the questions now cuz I knew it was helping her and we began to genuinely bond. 

Ever since all our classes went online due to covid-19 she assumed we’d take our finals together. I was uncomfortable with this so I told her no. She continued to beg me and would find every excuse when I told her I found it distracting and unhelpful (which is true). After literally and hour of her pressuring me i agreed to text her while I took the final if she had questions. The thing that annoyed me so much was that she was way more prepared than me. I saw her searchable study guide it had everything! She doesn’t need my help and I told her that. I told her she should believe in herself because I can see how much she studied and I don’t think she even needs my help, in fact it might hurt her performance. She did not listen at all. And she actually ended up doing worse because of a wrong answer I gave, and then got pissed despite me actively warning her that it was a risk. 

This new term we have another class together and it’s already begun and it’s on things as small as weekly quizzes, so I can only imagine the pressure she will put on once the final is here. I’m getting exhausted of finding excuses on why I don’t want to cheat, because apparently not wanting to cheat is not a good enough one. I’ve tried to tell her that I don’t like it but always having a tumultuous relationship and her being incredibly sensitive makes extremely hard. Apparently giving strong hints like actually saying no is not enough. I don’t even think this would be an issue if I could hang out with our group rn and I could actually talk about it with her, but I can’t. I’m worried that confronting her about this will cause cracks in my friendships with the others since they live together and I’ve seen them gang up on others and pretty recently cut our other friends out of our group for reasons that I find ridiculous.  

Overall cheating is just kinda messing with me I understand that it’s not that much different me than using my notes for an open book exam and me getting help from person. But I want to be able to feel proud when I do well on an exam instead of this weird guilt. Is there a way I can be clear that is will no longer be doing this without an incredibly sensitive person getting offended? 

I was thinking about just taking the quiz by myself and saying it forgot we were supposed to take it together, but clearly being passive or aggressive has not worked. 

Info: we keep taking classes together because they are required for my major and she needs the credits. We are in similar science majors. Most of them were not planned. The difference is these specific classes I have to take them for my major and she does not, she’s can just take them for credit in her major. 

TLDR: A friend who is very sensitive has continually asked me to help her cheat on exams and I need it to stop. How do I tell her this is not something I’ll be doing anymore?",14Apr2020,1

76,"I know, I know. Most of you are going to say to move on and find a different girl, which I could do, but I just need advice on how to apologize and get her to respond.

Backstory: We’ve been talking about a week or so, and planned a date for this Friday. (Yeah yeah social distancing and all that crap, we’re only going for a walk in the park.) Last night, she told me she had to take her dog to the vet today because he’s bleeding while urinating and some other stuff I can’t exactly remember. She said she was afraid they might have to put him down, and me being so stupid, I told her my sister’s dog had the same problems and had trouble moving around, until one day he collapsed and my sister had to take him to be put down. I immediately knew I fucked up and apologized, but I still knew that made her really sad and just didn’t know what else to say except keep apologizing and trying to make things better. She texted me after I went to sleep saying I didn’t make her upset, she understood I was just trying to be helpful and caring. I still felt bad in the morning though because thats not something I should have told her. Then this morning, she said her mom was at the vet with her dog. I said I hope all goes well and told another thing about my dog saying the vet will probably just give her some medicine to try and to change her dog’s diet and see how things go. After that she just stopped responding to me, left me on read. I didn’t know if I messed up again and said something wrong? I tried to get her attention by sending a game of Cup Pong (stupid decision probably) and saying if I lose, I owe you a big hug. I lost the game, then texted her saying “darn, I guess I owe you a hug now.” It’s been a few hours and she hasn’t responded, leaving me on read, while she normally responds within less than 5 minutes to every text. How should I apologize and try to get her attention, at least to get a small response? Even if it means we stop talking, I still feel awful for making her sad and I’m not the best using my words right, as you can obviously tell, and I’m super anxious about it.

tl;dr: Made a girl sad, now she won’t respond to texts but will still play games with me over iMessage. How do I apologize for making her sad and hopefully get a response to spark a conversation? Tired of feeling so anxious about it.",14Apr2020,1

82,"My dad must have a habit of accusing me of lying constantly but dont know how to stop it. My sister does pretty much any drug you can think of and gets away with it because shes always had good grades in school and gets away with it even though she likes to my dad for no reason sometimes. I mean I do acid, shrooms, and weed but I've never lied to him about it. I've also never had a lying habit and dont lie to him (unless it's about not snitching on a friend) I usually take the blame. I've had C's and B's until 8th grade and now I have straight A's but he still punished me for no reason and says it's because my grades are shitty. The other day his trashcan lid was broken and asked me why but I had no idea. He didnt believe that and kept asking me what I did but I kept telling him I didnt know until he eventually he got pissed and starting hitting me but he didnt get as mad as he usually gets which is good. I dont think hes abusive the worst hes ever done to me was push me into a bathtub and dislocate my neck so he really isnt that bad with the punishments. Recently though, my mom (who lies to doctors, school staff, and him to try and get me diagnosed with autism and adhd which I obviously dont have) told him I stole a bunch of her pills (which I didnt) and he believed it for some reason. I got punished but mostly my phone, playstation, skateboard, laptop (which I need for school) and my dog got took away. Plus I only got to leave the house for 1 hour a day. (I'm writing this off my friends phone) until I tell him where I'm hiding the pills or else I'll never get them back. Any advice on how I can convince him to believe me on anything I say?",14Apr2020,1
83,"My(21) boyfriend (20) used to sleep with one of his friends of 4 yrs. He wasn't fond of monogamy when we first met. So when I told him that the conditions of being with me was to be exclusive he was a bit skeptical but he agreed. It wasn't a forced thing I simply told him that if he wanted to continue being in a non-monogamous relationship then keep sleeping with the girl he's sleeping with an leave me alone. He said 'i am tired of sleeping with her and I already slept with her'. Him and the girl had a conversation and he essentially ended their situationship and didn't talk to her. There were a few times within the month that he had that conversation with her where she texted him asking for sex, but he declined everytime and eventually she stopped texting him. He kept her number in his phone which I found a bit concerning but it was nothing to fret about.   
Fast forward 3 months  they still haven't spoken, but on March 16th he told he that he texted her on February 21st to say happy birthday and to ask if she wanted to do anything for her birthday. I was upset because we established a line of honesty between the two of us so I felt betrayed because he waited an entire month to tell me. (Just to be clear the girl has bipolar disorder, and according to my boyfriend-who at the time was my friend, he said that she had a tendency to act erratic. She also refuses to take her pills) he told me that he did it as a wellness check to make sure she didn't off herself, he said that if she would have answered (which she didn't) he would have told me about it. I asked him, if they would have planned to have gone somewhere would I have been allowed to go with him and he said yes. I kinda let the situation rest but I told him that it made me uncomfortable that he reached out and I cried about it in regards to my feelings of betrayal. He told me that he sent the message, she didn't answer so he deleted her number.   
My biggest issue with that entire situation was I'm telling me that he was tired of her and he didn't want to speak to her anymore however I asked him if she were to reach out to him tomorrow and want to be friends again would you be okay with that and he said that he's not entirely sure how he would respond because she was amusing when they were friends.   
Ever since that situation I have been on edge and constantly thinking about them speaking again.   
Fast forward to April 3rd, she messaged him to ask him if he was doing okay with the covid-19 stuff going on. Their convo was short and basic. He deleted the thread and when she initially texted him he had to come up with a lie because he didn't know that number, but I was irritated because I again had to ask him about it rather than him coming out and telling me straight up. I've always said that my concern was never them ever having sex again it was more so the emotional aspect of their friendship. I'm scared of him and her gaining that emotional bond again and then essentially leaving me behind. And I know for a fact that he wouldn't sleep with her again because he said numerous times even before we were serious about each other he said that she would be the last person he'd ever want to sleep with ever again.   
I told him my concerns in regards to the emotional bonding regained and he told me that even if they did become friends again it would be on her record because he doesn't have her number anymore and it wouldn't be a relationship like what they had before. he assured me that the stuff that he has told me is nothing in comparison to what he told her he told me more things than he told her. But I still get nervous.   


He hasn't given me any reason to be distrustful of him, he has been forth coming with a lot of things, i just feel like when it comes to this specific girl, there's always something i dont know about this relationship. And him not telling me stuff until i ask doesn't make my feelings any better.   
I am speaking to a therapist about my trust issues, and wanting to be a more trusting person and a person who just accepts what happens. Because I do have relationship anxiety, but at the same time the idea of him being friends with a girl who he had a bond with, and with someone who asked him to have sex with her twice even after he told her that he was in a relationship is scary. And he has other female friends but they're more respectful. They always ask him how him and I are doing and they have their own relationships. I just don't want him to regain that bond with her... Am I overreacting? 

  
TL;DR: I'm a bit concerned about my boyfriend regaining a bond that he had with an old fuck friend. They're no longer on speaking terms, but she texted him a week ago and I've been nervous about her texting him again. He doesn't have her number anymore, but I'm still concerned.

84,"My aunt is in her mid 20s, so she’s actually not too much older than me. I have a pretty young grandma as well - she wouldn’t qualify for a senior discount at most restaurants. 

I’m currently living with my grandma due to some unforeseen circumstances, and I constantly have to deal with my aunt’s temper tantrums. Yesterday my grandma had bought some shorts for my aunt in the wrong size. My aunt took this as though my grandma thought she was fat, and instantly began screaming at her. They just keep going back and forth until they’re both in tears. This argument is still going on today. I’m currently chilling upstairs just listening to them scream and scream over shorts. 

As a result of recent events, my grandma is now working from home. I had to help teach her how to use a computer. Admittedly, it was stressful teaching my grandmother how to use the computer, as she didn’t even know how to use the mouse. I was trying my best to go slowly with her and explain how things were working as we went along. My aunt on the other hand, gives up 10 minutes in and starts calling my grandma a raging bitch and some other things that I don’t have the courage to type. Granny is just sitting there crying while my aunt is freaking out at her: “You fucking BITCH you can’t even copy and paste?” 

I don’t find politics as engaging as most. Her on the other hand, oh boy. Don’t you dare have a different opinion than my aunt. While we’re trying to hear the latest on coronavirus, she’s screaming at the TV about how this whole thing is the fault of politicians. She’s absolutely consumed by propaganda. She has no problem cussing out people with opposing views.

I remember one time she was bringing me and my grandma to the store to get a few things. She said we had to be in and out in 15 minutes because “If I don’t go on my walk by 7:00 I will have a fucking panic attack.” That comment stuck with me. Honey, a panic attack is being swarmed with bullets on the beaches of Normandy, not you not getting to go on your precious walk. It’s pathetic, really.

She’s always been this way. She has her good days and her bad, like everyone. For the most part though, she’s been a spoiled brat. She was never told no as a child. She got everything she wanted all the time. She also swelled up like a balloon due to lack of self control. Now that she’s older, things have only gotten worse. Someone bumping into her can completely ruin her day. I don’t think she understand how good she has it. People dream of giving their kids the childhood she had, myself included.

87,"Hey Reddit, I need a bit of help. 
Or a bit of an assessment. 

I’m 22 years old, M, currently living at home whilst I finish my second to last semester of college. My dad runs his own business, he and I are the only ones home, my mom and siblings went to our family friends as my mom under no circumstance can get corona with her lungs.

So for the past few weeks it’s just been me and my dad. 

He said I’m not allowed to go to work and I’m not allowed to leave the house. Okay, fair enough. I’ll keep a routine here. 

Fast forward to about a week ago. My dad came into my room while I was asleep. He saw my vape. He told me he’s taking it away.. and that he wants me to quit. he’s a smoker himself but I understand he doesn’t want me doing that. 

We made an agreement that we would both quit. 

I went for about 5 days before caving in to buying a black and mild. I decided to save it for the night. I had a bit of weed left over so I decided to smoke some weed and the cigar late at night on my roof which can be accessed by my window. 

The following morning my dad comes into my room again while I’m asleep. He notices my bowl and half of a cigar on my windowsill and starts freaking out calling me a pothead and that I think life is a game. I didn’t show it but once he left for work I had a bit of an impulsive fit. I ended up punching a hole in my wall.. stupid I know.. but seriously I feel like my life is under a microscope and I have no way of escaping.

I don’t even fucking smoke that often. 

I used to commute to school everyday, I used to go to the university gym everyday, and now I’m just stuck in a house. 

I texted my dad today and apologized for having a bowl in the house. However I addressed his behavior in response to the words he said to me, and that I’m trying to quit and cold turkey isn’t easy. He responds to me by telling me that he won’t retaliate my actions anymore and that he expects me to know what needs to be done around the house from now on... 

Go figure, fast forward to dinner he’s quiet and emotionless the entire time.

He states we’re going to “talk” this week. I’m seriously beginning to lose it. I’m 22 years old. If I’m telling him I’m making strides to quit I feel as if that’s something he just needs to believe I’m going to do as opposed to micromanaging my entire life. 

He called me a pothead again. I drill a bit back because that one irked me a bit. I remind him that he was supposed to quit smoking cigarettes over 10 years ago when I was a kid. Imagine how that went. 

“You are nowhere near close enough to me to compare yourself to me”

Just shuts himself off again and goes upstairs. 

It’s just like what the hell man? It’s a hard habit to kick and you’re forcing it upon me... it’s starting to drive me crazy.

This one is going to be good they said, it wont have ""bad hair"" and it will be a cute skin tone, they are hoping that the child wont be ""jabao"", which is a light skinned black person with very black features. Because black features are ugly. 

My mother makes comments about not accepting me if I have a black boyfriend, about how cute white people's kids are and how ugly my baby nieces and nephews are because of their bad hair and black noses, a out how I shouldn't go out into the sun because my skin tone is just passably pretty and if I get darker I will be ugly.

92,"Hello friends

I (26F) am a teacher of four years living about 4 hours away from my parents. I just got married about a month ago and we live in the city of my husband’s parents. 

My mother (mid 40s) about six months ago ran into some health problems where she can no longer work at her high intensity job or drive. She began working at her and my father’s business and he would drive her to work. 

My father has now been diagnosed with cancer. He has had two intense surgeries in the past three weeks and has more to go. Now both he and my mother cannot drive or work. 

The doctors have not been specific on an outcome or a timeline for his cancer so we don’t really know how long or intense his treatments will be. My mother will probably never be able to drive again. 

I have two adult brothers who live with my parents. One is in college but is currently home due to the pandemic. They are both working at my parents business to keep it afloat since my parents cannot be there. 

I have been considering moving to my parents’ city to help take care of them since neither can drive and both brothers are doing the best they can to keep the family business afloat. But their city is more expensive and harder to live in as a teacher. I wasn’t planning on leaving my school yet or going through interview processes again. If the doctors were more clear, I would be able to make a decision easier.

98,"So I have this ""friend"" that I'm not close with and they have never taken the time to ask about me or even held a full conversation with me. We're only friends because we're in the same social circle. This friend has used me a couple of times and I've let them. Now they are always asking for homework answers and asking for help in their classes EVERY day even though I say I don't know often. We're both in college and are adults (f/20s), we're also not in the same classes either. They expect me to go out of my way to do problems for them and give them the answer. I'm trying to drop the hint that I don't have time to deal with this because I have my own classes and academics to take care of but they're not getting it. How do I not feel guilty for not helping this ""friend""? I feel used. I feel bad for not helping them but I also can't because I don't have the time and I'm not their tutor/professor.

She said that when he confessed to her that she felt confused about how she felt towards him. She said if she could travel back in time to change what she did she would. I’m 99% sure she doesn’t like me anymore and I thought I was over her too... until recently. I began having second thoughts. Do I just miss her friendship or being in a relationship with her? 
When became friends before we started dating, we had a really strong connection. Even when we broke up we still did. When I learned she dumped me because of that dude... it faded away. I don’t know if I just miss having that or miss being able to call her my gf. I’ve never had a connection like that before. Regardless of if I was in that kind of a relationship with them. I just don’t know what to do. She hurt me but I feel just miss her so much. What do i do? I’m hurting so fucking much. It’s been 4 months since she dumped me and I thought I moved on. I’m just so confused.
To add to all of that, I have a gf currently. But I feel like shes just using me because she’s horny. That’s what 85% of our text convos are about. I know I should ask her about it but she’s going through so much right now. She’s trans and being quarantined with her transphobic family is really hurting her mental health.

I (16f) have a sore throat and due to my past anxiety I now have developed corona anxiety. Every potential symptom I twist and I turn it in to potential Corona virus. I haven't been in the public since Thursday and the people whom i live with and are around me feel fine. I just have a sore throat but I have no idea if it's from the anxiety I have. Just some back story I basically talk all day long and I also screamed to annoy someone for a few hours. So that might be why but I can't tell but whenever I look up symptoms I only have one.

107,"I graduated college last summer and I don't know how to drive. I live in one of the biggest cities in the U.S. and I've never had to soley rely on cars. We have great public transportation and a lot of people walk, use scooters, bike, or take the train.

Since Covid 19 hit, mostly everything is closed and going virtual. My governor extended our shelter in place order and I don't know if this will continue into the summer. The reason I mention this is because despite all the sadness, I had a Zoom interview for a position out of state that will start in late summer. The director personally called me because he was so impressed with my experience. He said he wants the other senior staff to meet me asap and that they'd be happy to have me.

The only hang up is the position requires that I drive. In the initial application, driving nor having a license was specified as a must. At this point I don't have the funds nor the resources (family/friends) to help me. The DMV are closed and I don't know when I can get credentials. Obviously I know there's a chance I will have to decline this ""offer"", but if I can keep it, I want to. The job is contract for 2 years and they have driving schools in their city that I could use.

We are starting our lessons online because of the current Virus situation. I decided to join the conversation and hang out with everyone in our Group in Discord. Like, It is better to talk than staying in the conner in lectures. Everything was going well until they started shipping and annoying one of the guys with me. He is supposed to be the king, and I queen because of the simple reason I'm the only girl. I just wanted to chat and make jokes, not to get shipped. Furthermore, the ship continues and is complicated because the dude already has a partner. Like please, can you stop. So everything continues and slowly I start to notice that the dude (king) stops messaging as he used to. Like, they sometimes ask for help, I help them when I have time. He also asks for help and I help him. It's complicated. The ships continue and his friends annoy me with yeah, why not? and I play the game. I just don't say okay then. There is no problem with that, I actually enjoy it. However, I got tired of it, and said to stop again, he has a partner. I can't be with him because it is not right, like tf, I personally consider wrong to still boyfriends. The ship slowed down, and I'm curious to know if my words actually hurt him, because he been avoiding me each time I enter to chat in Discord. Ahhhhh!

113,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love my dad very much, and admire how hard-working he is, but my god can it be a pain.

So Reddit, here goes. I (15) just finished after 3 hours of helping my dad stain the front of the porch (wrap around porch, we'll be working on the rest throughout the week), and afterwards we were talking about how the previous owners of the house kinda just let it rot, like I'm talking our neighbor, who we'll call H, had to help them clean up the backyard and told us that there was lots of ivy up the back of the house. My dad said he'd been told that the previous owner's wife never did any work outside, and I asked if they'd had kids (they had), and why they didn't have the kids help out a little. I said something along the lines of

'Well at least you have \[Brother\], \[Mom\], and I to help out.' to which he basically responded:

'Yeah, but I'd like you guys \[Implying brother and I\] to help out more...'

Needless to say, it did not make me feel okie dokie. My brother and I do a lot of work around the house, like there was a stretch of time where we essentially worked on the yard 9 AM to 5 PM (lots of acres), with no pay. I also frequently babysit my younger siblings to give my parents a break, and just try to do my best.

119,"I (25F) have had a lot of issues with my landlord and my new apartment, and I guess part of the reason there are so many issues with the place is because the tenants before me were awful. The maintenance guy told me that they cleared out more stuff from the apartment than what I have in there, and I have it well furnished. I also found crayon scribbles on the wall in one of the closets and crayon wax on the carpets (neither of which have been cleaned) as well as holes in a lot of the doors and a lot of other issues.

Anyway, I was working out in my second bedroom, and I was on my back stretching, and I saw a very faded but very clear swastika on the ceiling. I had never noticed it before because I have never had a reason to look at the ceiling in there. It looked like it had been washed off but not painted over or anything. 

I feel like I need to tell my landlord about it if only because I want to make sure it doesn’t come out of my deposit. Although I feel like they might already know about it and were the ones who tried to wash it off. However, I have been in my apartment for almost 6 months now, so I feel like they might wonder why I didn’t say something sooner. I am generally a very good tenant in what is a pretty crappy apartment building.

So I have two questions:

1. How should I tell my landlord? And what should I ask them to do about it, if anything?
2. Any suggestions on what I can do to cover it? I can’t paint anything because of my lease, but I could probably hang something there. I’ve never done anything like that, so I’d love some suggestions of things I could do that would work and be cute!

130,"Hi,

I am 29 yr old straight male.

About me:

I  have always exceptionally done well when it came to education, hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really appreciate any help. I  need some \_/\\\_.

Here's what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -

2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had

2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.

2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design

2015  - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started smoking as  well regularly

2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.

This continued slowly until I graduated and moved

2017  - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, didn't work out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they were  toxic.

2018 - My sexual  frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just  liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do  anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess  it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated  because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I  felt stuck.

2019 -  Met a girl  through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all  wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of  surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at  them as well.

2020 Jan -  This  year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found  out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex  boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.

Feb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.

Mar  - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a  guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses.

1  week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf  in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,  where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And  none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.

I  made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started  working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex  even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of  such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started  apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I  tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona  outbreak.

Last week - she  contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She  did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told  me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able to  move ahead.

I feel like I have hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I don't feel like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.

133,"I work at McDonald’s, and the current agreement policy is that we have set shifts ever week. I have two set shifts, with a total of 11 hours all together, but we get the option to pick up more hours, so our set hours is our minimum. 

A couple weeks ago I was rostered literally my set shifts and that was it. I usually get more than 20 hours, so getting cut down to just 11 really annoyed me. I’m a good worker, I have a good attitude, I help out in areas that need help, and just do whatever I can to help out, so I feel like I’ve earned more than just 11 hours. I sent a Snapchat to some coworkers, one of them being someone we’ll call Gina.  The Snapchat said  “only got rostered my set shifts and that was it, fukin mint aye cunt”. The rostering manager (we’ll call her Amy) knew I was angry about the roster and my cut hours, and asked Gina if she could see the Snapchat I sent. Gina showed her the Snapchat. Of course Amy was hurt cause I criticised her rostering. 

So now Amy won’t talk to me, when I go into the managers office to talk to her she says “this so the managers office you can’t just barge in here” and “it’s actually time to work” but when other workers go in there to grab a pencil or look at the daily roster she isn’t phased by it. She unfriended me on Facebook, and just ignores me on shift. She’s in charge of rostering and therefore my financial position, and having someone with that power that has a hatred towards me is not ideal. Since that week I’ve been rostered just my set shifts and that’s it.

I don’t know what to do, I’ve apologised for what I said. I’ve tried to talk to her. I don’t know what to do. Do I talk to our restaurant manager and ask for a mediation meeting if that even is a thing? Do I just leave it and give her time? Do I quit? Like what am I supposed to do, on one hand it was a private snap where I was venting about a situation like me and all my coworkers do, and having that shown to someone feels like then reading my diary and then getting annoyed at what they read about them during a time that I was angry, and on the other hand I did talk shit about her rostering.

tl;dr: talked shit about our rosters on Snapchat, coworker showed the snap to our rostering manager, and now rostering manager won’t talk to me, and it has affected my rostered hours.",14Apr2020,1

143,"Help me get back at my sublet scammer

Hello everyone, first time reddit user here! I was having trouble coming to terms with this injustice and thought this would be the right community to turn to for advice.


My partner and I of two years were living together and decided to break things off before our lease ended, leaving us to need to find someone to take over the lease. Only one person reached out to both of us about our separate postings, and she seemed like a pretty normal person. We met IRL a few times and she seemed like someone I would meet at a bar, have a ton of fun with, then never follow up about our brunch plans we made for the following morning. She was pretty open about sharing information with me (sending me a picture of her drivers license, adding me on social media, I even have a copy of her rental application form that has all of her information on it, including social security, previous addresses, places of employment, you name it). You’d assume someone who is so transparent about all of these things would be legitimate right? WRONG.

The lease my partner and I originally signed explicitly stated no sub-letters, however if you are trying to move out of your apartment before the lease-end date, you are eligible to have someone apply to be your “roommate” and if they are accepted, leasing will take the original tenants off the lease. Keep in mind, this was all happening in the first two weeks of March, when the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to really shake up the United States. She needed to move in March 15th latest, and I was ready to do anything to get this lease off my hands, so I made the mistake of allowing her to move in a couple days early. I had her fill out the roommate application form on the spot, and even submitted her pay stubs, application and government ID to the office myself to ensure it got there. Before I gave her the keys, we both signed a sublease agreement that was notarized by the state (just in case — i didn’t want to hand over the keys without something in writing, but I also didn’t want to leave this person homeless in the midst of a pandemic). Again, I had no reason to believe this girl was sketchy or would be rejected. Low and behold, about a week and a half later, my leasing company informs me she has been rejected. They couldn’t tell me why, but they said they let her know why and that, depending on the reasoning, she would have the opportunity to reapply. This was around March 27th, so rent would be due soon and I didn’t want to mess up my credit, so I asked her to send me April’s rent so that could at least be paid while the appeals process was happening. 

And that’s when it started.

Excuse after excuse after excuse, “sorry I’ve been MIA my boyfriend broke up with me”, “i lost my debit card”, “the banks closed due to corona and i need to make an appointment”, “[various third party payment apps] aren’t working”, blah blah blah. She could tell I was on my final straw and I told her I need her to pay me by 6pm otherwise I would be looking for another subletter. She claimed to be on her way home to retrieve her new debit card but “she got a flat tire” and proceeded to send me a stock photo of a tire being popped. Obviously at this point I called her on her bluff, and had no other choice but to let the leasing office know what was going on. I am getting evicted (never thought I would be happy about an eviction...) but I cannot seem to let go of my resentment towards this girl. I want to warn other Boston renters or people looking for a sublet but I have no idea how to do that. At this point there’s nothing legal I could do, so now I am looking for ways to inconvenience her for the rest of her terrible little life. 



TLDR: I had a subletter who scammed me for $3000 and I am (legally) looking to make her life a living hell",14Apr2020,1

At this point, I understand my chances are near nil, esp. b/c she's out of my league, but I wonder if she's worth keeping as a friend or if she just responds to be polite? Do I just stop imitating and see if she reaches out again?

147,"The end of this month is the only time I'm able to visit my family until Thanksgiving, so I'm going despite the risks.  I've been self isolating and am not planning on visiting any of my older family members, so I'd rather not hear about how I shouldn't be travelling right now.  My flights have been changed a few times now, and my only option going home is to overnight at YVR.  My brother, let's call him Dean, lives about two hours away from the airport and I usually overnight on his couch, but I don't want to put him or my sister in law at risk.  They were supposed to be opening a restaurant as the pandemic started, and I really don't want anything to happen to them.  My dad has been helping me out with my travel arrangements, and I told him about staying in the airport.  He was super against it, and suggested a hotel or to stay with Dean.  I told him I was fine in the airport and didn't want any extra money spent on a hotel since we already had to pay extra to get new seats to get me back to where I live now.  Plus I'd like to avoid extra travel and risk in staying in a room after someone who's also been travelling.  My dad insisted I talk to Dean, so I just sent him a text and said I planned to overnight in the airport because I had a 16 hour layover and if he wanted to meet up it would be nice, but I understood if he wanted to keep self isolating.  We have a good relationship, so he wouldn't turn me away to be rude or anything.  He told me he'd have to pass this time and wished me safe travels, said maybe when I'm on my way back.  No problem.
Now though, I'm worried about telling my dad.  He's very level headed, but I'm his 'little girl' still and he can get insistent when it comes to my well-being (understandably).  My other issue is that Dean was at least 10 when my dad and mom got together, and I'm really worried he's going to think that Dean turned me away because of that.
I don't have any reason to believe it since they don't have any issues (that I'm aware of) but I can't shake this anxiety.

PS I'm not afraid of sleeping in the airport alone, or upset with Dean because I told him my plans and he has no obligation to put me up for a night, plus he's got a lot going on.

TLDR: My dad wants my brother to let me stay the night at his place instead of the airport.  But I don't want to put them at risk, my brother said maybe another time, and I'm fine staying at the airport.  I'm worried my dad will be upset with him.",14Apr2020,1

150,"Hey guys, so I kinda got into this predicament and I wanted advice. So for reference, I’m a guy, I’ve only been with guys and I prefer guys over girls and since I can’t do anything I changed my tinder preferences from just guys to everyone so I can find new people to talk to and hang out with. I find women attractive and such, just don’t know if I’m comfortable being with them. Anyways, matched with this one girl who is a fellow dancer, which is why I swiped right, and holy shit. I did tell her I prefer guys and I wanted to just y’all as friends. Friday night was the first night I talked to her, and she immediately started talking about how she’s “used to the pain” of guys hurting her and she told me about a specific guy who blocked her and how she cried three days because of it. The next day she got upset when I said I wanted to be friends and if I don’t respond in a timely manner she flips out and keeps going “are you ok” and “are you there” and “(my name)?...” and shit. So many other red flags besides that like her asking me to turn my read receipts on so she’d know if I left her hanging which I said no to, and a couple other things. Besides that she’s 20 and acts like a middle schooler and I don’t wanna be mean but I don’t wanna talk to this girl.

151,"I want to say, I don't think my wife is mean or malicious in this act and I can 100% see where she is coming from, I just happen to disagree.  We are both firm believers that a dog is a lifelong commitment, but lately, we have been wondering if one of our dogs would have a better life with another family.

We are a dog family and each family member has their own.  My wife got a dog for our daughter, but my daughter is still so young that it is really my wife's dog.

There is no problems from this dynamic.  My son's walk and train and keep their dogs in their rooms at night.  My dog stays in his crate at night and I train and walk him.

The problem is that my son's dog, which is a mix that might be pug/chihuahua, is getting increasingly aggressive towards my wife's dog.  This weekend was a BAD fight between them where the smaller one latched onto the neck of my wife's dog.  My wife thinks we should get rid of HER dog and not the aggressor.  I think that would be a mistake because I can't be sure that the aggression wouldn't then be shifted to another dog.  The other dogs are much bigger though so I don't know if that's a risk.

Her justification is that during the day she sees her dog, push the smaller one by either humping, or just staying ""in his face"" when he's relaxing and other similar pestering behavior.  I've seen this behavior.  Her dog is a big dummy.  Like a loveable kind.  He just doesn't understand to leave a dog alone.

Her dog is also TERRIBLE in the house.  He is constantly picking up kid toys (I have 3 kids under 10), and either swallowing them immediately or taking them to his crate.  This has already led to a 3000$ surgery.  I feel like this might get better with age of the kids, but I recognize it's unreasonable to keep kids from having toys around the house, no matter how much we yell.  This leads to him spending more time outside than I would like which leads to less human interaction between him and us.

I advised against getting rid of her dog mainly because he isn't the one who has been attacking but I might be wrong because he is the one instigating by constantly pestering the smaller one.

I don't know what to do.  I get her point, but I also think maybe we should find some way to get through this because we made a commitment when adopting this dog.  But then I also fear that I'm not giving this dog his best life because we can't give him the safety he needs.  From what I'm reading, I know that some dogs just prefer to be the only child.  I really don't know how to handle this.  

Should I get over myself and let the dog go to a better home fit, and knowing my daughter isn't very attached?  Or should I get rid of the aggressor, which would CRUSH my son.  Or both?  I don't know what to do.

152,"So I (17m) was adopted when I was a year old and had contact with my bio-mom and dad until I was five and then I moved with my adoptive family to another state when I was five or six. Anyways, I haven’t seen my bio-family in 12-13 years, but I have been in contact with them for four months now and am so happy and excited to finally talk to them after searching for 5 years on my own. Alright now to the question at hand, I have been discussing with my biological mom and dad about spending the time I spend in the state I was born in during winter break this year (2020)  with them, which happens to land on my birthday and I haven’t spent a birthday with them in 12-13 years. Anyway, I was wondering how I ask my adoptive mother if I can spend my birthday and possibly the time (6 days) with my bio family. I really need to know a way that I can ask my adoptive mom and brother (he’s basically my father figure) to allow me to visit/meet my biological family for the six days that we will be in the state I was born. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Edit to add info; I was given up for adoption because my mother was in high school and couldn’t take care of me. I lost contact because my adoptive mom didn’t tell my biological family where we were going or that we were even leaving. I moved four states away from where I used to live. And I was the one who reached out to my bio-mom",14Apr2020,1
154,"I have lived with both of my parents for my whole childhood and my parents have started the divorce process. Jut for some context, my father has been abusive (physical on several occasions, police involved on 1, and emotional/verbally abusive for as long as I can remember). I'm not going to explain any further as anything else is a bit redundant. 


My parents are going through the financial agreements and disclosures currently and my dad isn't being very cooperative and it is obvious that he is trying to deceive my mother so that he can have more money at the end of it (most of the money they have is in a private limited company where my mum has 49 shares and my dad has 51). I'm not going to go into how he is doing said trickery, but it is obvious that he is doing it. This just really puts the icing on the cake after years of abuse and a shitty childhood for as long as I can remember. He is also adamant that, despite me being 15, he and my mum can choose where I have to live. This isn't the case in the UK, and especially in my scenario as the police have been involved for his abusive behaviour once. 


How can I explain to him that I want nothing to do with him after this divorce is done? He is very narcissistic and he believes that my mum has manipulated me, which is clearly not the case. Although I am not a petty person and I don't want to make him suffer, part of me wants to say to him that we will put in the paperwork that I live with my mum all the time and I can visit him with more leeway than a black and white agreement on when I visit each parent. *If* he agreed to that, I would then never visit him again as I have no interest in seeing him. 





I have already experienced the pain of an estranged relationship for ages, and it will only do good for myself if I just detach myself completely from him. I can't take it, I dealt with anger issues when i was younger, and although I have improved I really do struggle when I'm with him. He is also incredibly unpleasant to be with and i can't take the stress of it. I am considering another approach where after the divorce I write him a letter because that way he will read it and he can't shout over me, like he would do if we were to have a discussion. His justification for shouting over me would be that I am being stupid and he is right, so a letter would be the only way to get my point across. It feels so heartless to say to him that I don't want anything to do with him and that I don't love him at all. And I know how much it will hurt him because deep down I know he loves me. But that doesn't justify how he behaves. And I don't think I should subject myself to the emotional struggles I would have if I had to be with him just to keep him more or less happy, especially with how he has treated me and my mum for as long as I can remember. If anyone else has had a similar experience, it would mean a lot if someone could help me and give me a bit of guidance",14Apr2020,1

163,"My fiancé’s 21st birthday is coming up and for me drinking has always been a sore spot. Most of my family are alcoholics and I’ve seen what it can make people do. I think alcohol makes bad people do bad things and in my family that’s lead to divorce, cheating, prison etc. I told him he of course can do what he wants but if he’s going to get drunk I’d rather not be around. I spend the night at his place and he drives but I told him on those nights I’ll just drive separately and head back to my place once the night had progressed enough. In no way am I telling him not to drink or go get drunk or whatever I just don’t want to be around past him just being tipsy. He’s upset saying I smoke why should alcohol be a problem and I honestly totally see where he’s coming from and I feel horrible. Just for me I do see them as two different things although it’s becoming more popular I know lots of people will disagree and say weed is worse than alcohol. I really do think it sways to either side just in my life it isn’t pretty. I also know I wouldn’t be fun to be around while he’s drunk because I’ll be anxious and honestly a little triggered and he doesn’t need his anxious 19 year old fiancé hovering while he wants to be vibeing. 
I’m in therapy and working on my issues but haven’t had a session since February with the lockdown. Like I said I do really feel horrible and I don’t want to be a hypocrite but in my life so far I’ve been yelled at and belittled until I’ve cried and had things thrown at me due to alcohol and weed has helped me manage my symptoms.

Of COURSE that didn’t happen, but the boy is clearly curious and kept asking me to pull my pants down, touching my butt, pulling up my shirt, and other very inappropriate things that made me very uncomfortable. 

I’m not sure how to address a situation because he’s so young and curious but doesn’t understand boundaries. How strict should I be when telling him no? Do I need to be harsh and firm to emphasize that it’s not okay to ask me to get naked? Or do I softly continue telling him no and just leave it be? I assume this is normal for a young boy?

Except ""bad"" isn't exactly the right word, it is just non-existent. We live in the same home, eat often at the same table, see each others around, but never talk beyond ""hello"" ""how are you"" ""good."" Thats just how its always been. As a kid, they never spent too much time with me, and I had a lot of friends in the neighborhood so I was never really at home. They run a small business and so are always working, so I just never interacted with them too much. To this day, its just too awkward too look them in the eye. I feel embarrassed to say anything too personal too them, Im about as close to them as friendly strangers would be. They are not uncaring, in fact I think they are both hilarious nice people. Sometime I hear them talk to their friends and wish I was friends with them. We share absolutely no interests in common, we have a very small family (so no ""mutual friends"" to discuss), there is no easy conversation to make. They put food on the table, never hit me, and generally checked all the boxes. But thats about it, they really just check the boxes, never anything deeper.

This really weighed on me in high school, how they could just seem so aloof. Not even vindictively aloof, just sheerly uncaring.

Right now due to the virus I have been at home for some time and so I take the time out of my day to go and cook for him. Every time he eats something, anything he will criticize it. Almost always.

From the moment he gets home he starts yelling that all I do is laze around the house when a big portion of my time( 3-4 hours) goes to cooking for him. Today was the last straw for me. He is yelling and yelling about different stuff. I got tired of hearing it so as calmly as I could I asked him to stop. To listen for once. He just blew me off. Says that everyone would die without him. That we depend on him. And it has gotten to the point where he uses it as a shield to deflect any sort of argument used against him. And he brushes me off and it has gotten to the point where the only way i see him listening to anything I say is to become independent of him completely.

But I'm studying right now and while I could find a job a become independent I fear that I will not be able to finish my studies. Right now my house is just absolutely toxic and I believe that getting through him will cause our family to be closer.

He has changed with age I will admit. He wasn't always like this or if he was I didn't notice due to being young. Before he had such pride in me but now he doesn't acknowledge anything. I had previously went to a technical high school getting a degree in electronics. I went through such stress in those years only for him to knock me down by saying that I was the worst technician he had ever seen. That really hurt but now I have gone past my anger and just want him to realize what he is doing.

I have forgiven a lot of people over the years. Some have taken advantage of this to abuse my kindness. Others have truly changed for the better.

Basically, I’ve had a lot of dumb experiences and bad mistakes. Not terrible, but bad mistakes. But they could have serious consequences. I’m only 19 but my mistakes are so serious because of their nature (sexual).

About a year and a half ago, I masturbated in a car with a girlfriend and her friend as a joke but it shocked her

About a year ago, I slapped my friends girlfriend on the butt cause we were dancing 

I thought these were funny, and didn’t necessarily see the problem. Until recently

The quarantine forced me to look at everything in my past. And I realize the consequences these could hold. 

I basically don’t see a future for me. It makes me cry to think about it, and this is what makes me suicidal. My mind sort of goes between ok and terrible.

I was just a kid when these things happened, I didn’t know any better. But the judicial system doesn’t care, because my age was right. So I’d be tried as an adult if anything came of it.

So I’m basically over it. I just want a shotgun to blow my brains out and be reborn somewhere. I’m starting to be okay with hanging myself. I didn’t want to at first but anything to get rid of the paranoia and trauma and constant pain and fear.

My husband and I have been together for five years this month. Our wedding anniversary isn't until October, but this month marks five years together in total. 

Just a little backstory: Over the last five years, my husband and I have rented at least three different homes with the help of a roommate. He works afternoons and nights, I work days, and with a roommate there's never any alone time for us. We never have much of a chance to get out and do stuff together as a couple which has pushed us further apart. We don't have any children of our own, which has always been a dream of mine. I've also dreamed of owning my own home to raise said child/children in.

With COVID-19 going on, we've both been forced to work from home which has been good for us. We've been able to go on walks, have dinner together, play games, quality time, etc. During our walks and dinners, we often talk about owning a home and having a child of our own. We both want a garden, a free space for our pets to roam, and to live outside of town where we wont be bothered. We need our alone time to be together and be a couple, and we feel like now would be a good time for us to get started.

I'm twenty-six years old, and I have poor credit due to a family member using my identity for their utilities. I work a decent paying job, and I'm currently in the process of repairing my credit. With my husband having child support, I feel he wont be much help financially, so I am also looking into temporarily working two jobs. 

One option we've had is building a home on a acre of land that a family member owns, but she has a loan on the land, so I fear what will happen if she misses payments (which she's known to do). She makes decent money, but her lowlife alcoholic husband has been known to take her money and screw her over, so I'd rather not take my chances and see what other options are available.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have considered buying a RV and living at a long term park to save our money, but we would have to get rid of our two pitbulls. We've also looked into apartments and trailer parks with lower rent and fees to save our money. We've looked into rent-to-own. I've asked about mortgage, and my husband is against it. I don't know where I stand here or what I should be doing.

What are some suggestions you would give to someone who is trying to repair their credit and tired of renting their home?? Anything is helpful, and I appreciate your feedback.",14Apr2020,1
190,"This is a very complicated story that I need someone else's POV of.

&amp;#x200B;

This quarantine has been very boring and I noticed how much I rely on seeing my friends at school. lucky for us, we have some (fairly) new neighbors and have been getting along with them. I know that we are just supposed to stay inside and to keep distance but we trust that our neighbors will self isolate if they get the virus. plus the wife is VERY pregnant, they have a 2-year-old daughter, and the husband works a lot of the time. so we tend to spend a lot of time with them which I think is ok since we are helping them out a lot.

 On Easter Sunday our mostly judgemental (no offense) family had set up a zoom chat with each other, we had forgotten and had been at our house talking with our neighbors. my dad had told his brother (my uncle) that we had been on a walk. when my aunt (that brother's wife) texted me and asked the same question I told the truth and said we were with neighbors. (ended up going on the voice chat by my self and had fun.) later that day my grandma came over and saw that we were with our neighbors, she ended up getting mad that we were not social distancing and (we believe) told the rest of the family (we are a very gossipy family) my mom has been really worried (IDK why she even cares) about what they think of us and has been telling multiple white lies to cover up what we were doing. 

today my (best) aunt said that since we weren't quarantining she shouldn't go to a picnic that we have been planning for a long time since she is around her dad which is immunocompromised. I then wanted to Text her the whole truth because I am not sure what story she has heard (weather from my moms white lies or my grandma making a mountain out of a molehill) and decided my mom should look at the text before I sent it and she got very mad at me that I should NOT send that to my aunt and not to worry about it but I like this aunt (she babysat me for the first 6 years of my life) and I'm not sure what to do? I don't wanna get in trouble with my mom, but I also want to explain to the rest of my family that what we are doing isn't a bad thing. Please help me.

191,"Hello reddit! I’m someone who hasn’t had much experience with liking another person, but recently I’ve been thinking about this one person. I found out sometime earlier that they liked me. I don’t know how to differentiate actual romantic feelings from deep admiration though. Is there certain criteria you have to meet to make sure you like someone for sure? I’m thinking of pursuing that person, but I want to make sure I’m not confusing what I feel for that person or forcing myself into thinking I like them.  I want to make sure that I don’t like them just because they like me either. I’m not desperate for a relationship. Just making sure that I don’t end up hurting that person’s feelings later on if I realize that I didn’t like them in “that” way.

Hello! I need help. My neighbor is threatening me and I just want to know how to resolve this confusing situation. 

TLDR; my neighbor has weirdly specific info about me and my visitors. Has threatened me, said she will ‘kill me’, spread slander about me being a criminal, and completely embarrassed me in front of my whole neighborhood. Police are doing nothing. How do I de-escalate? 

In August 2019 I bought my first home and moved into it immediately. All seemed cool, had a small issue with a parking violation in the beginning. Nothing big. I now expect my neighbor was the person who kept reporting my extra vehicle. 

On March 20, 2020 I was walking my dog during my lunch hour. This lady who lives next door to me was also walking her dog.  Now I just avoid all dogs bc my pup gets so excited and wants to paw them to death. Naturally when I saw my neighbor and her dog I tried to avoid them all together. This didn’t work. I ended up having to cross paths with her, granted I walked across the street from where she stood glaring at me.  
*Keep in mind, I have maybe had two conversations with her before this and they were pleasant and lasted less than five minutes. *

Then she yelled out ‘you better watch your back!’

After some words were exchanged (me being severely confused) and her saying ‘you better watch your back’ again and  ‘yeah you and your thug boyfriend better watch your back!’ I eventually responded ‘is that a threat?’ She said ‘yeah! So what if it is?! What are you going to do about it?!’ I walked away, hearing her say into the phone ‘they think they know me’ 

I reported it to my HOA and decided not to call the police. I wanted to ask around to learn more about this woman. I learned her sister lives here, they both have caused unnecessary drama, and possibly both on disability. 

Come round to today. I walk outside with my dog and friend (who was about to leave). I come around the corner and go away from my street, I hear her talking to someone. She gets more shrill and I decide to turn around and ask

 ‘are you talking to me?’ 

This was the wrong thing to say apparently. Five minutes of her
threatening me, calling me white trash, that I am a fraud, I steal, How I am a criminal, how my boyfriend (now ex.. he moved out months ago) is a thug, how my friend is a thug/punk finally coming to the most outrageous statement ‘you better in, you better watch your back and your thug boyfriend or I will kill him’. 

During this conversation she brought up weird facts she knew about us, like my friends fathers name, my hometown etc. i also recorded this, and spoke with a few neighbors once she walked inside who witnessed the situation and who have my back. 

I’m not scared, but I am nervous. I hope she is alright and I would like this whole situation to come to a peaceful resolve? I need ideas bc all my people are just angry and want to antagonize the situation",14Apr2020,2

Today I lost my shit with him. And now im stressing and texting this from my car. I'm sorry for all the typos I'm panicking and i dont know why but I cant calm down and I'm breathing to hard. Theres no reason for this. There was a couple times in our past where we had a bad time. One point involved him getting angry and pushing me down from behind and being forceful. 


I try my best to not acknowledge it and he screamed at me the other day about how he remembered raping me and that o deserved it because of me previously (about a year or 2 prior) I did lose my shit after I'd caught him cheating on me and when i tried to leave him he kept sayimg how he was gonna kill himself and you know the usual bullshit. I lost my shit and I did somethint pretty fucked up I stuck the tip of my pinky finger in his urethra.  Big mistake i know. I regret it. Ive never stopped feeling guilty for it. But to be told that was why i deserved to be raped (not counting all the other forceful times like that (I cant acknowledge it is that, I can't. Everything flies out of control for me when I do) but that was why  I've been avoiding him since thathappened. 


Hes come over everyday for various reasons since And today he came over and I just couldn't get the sight of him out of my head and everything just made me angry the sight of him talking to ne acting like everything is so normal I kinda snapped. He kept touching me and trying wrestle with me  I pushed him into a playful choke hold position when I finnally got out from where he's grabbed me and I mayve just lost it out of nowhere and I may or may  not have lost it kind of out of nowhere and I may have choked him a little harder and longer than I should have. 


My brain started saying just do it and I I stopped myself as soon as I realized this is because this is insane this is this is nuts I need to stop and he knew by that point that I had probably tried and but he took it well trying to offer me tips on how to do it better but he told me he knew what i just tried but it was pretty week. I don't know why I did this i know how wrong this is I just flipped and I dont know why. He acted very very nice with me the rest of the time trying to get me out playing with the dog. He told me to come over after work and I said maybe probably not ive been pretty upset today and I told him it was because of that. I admitted to it. Now maybe theres a logical explanation mayne he forgot something at my place but i didnt notice anything before I left and he had his phone in his vehicle when he dropped me off.


 but his vehicle was outside my work tonight when I got off, either he was asleep or not in the vehicle but i called his phone to ask if that was him. He had it earlier in the day but no answer. He never came out to talk to me either so I dont know why he would be there. I had a bad gut feeling and I suddenly panicked and left But I left and texted him asking if it was him and i still havent recieved a text back. Am I over reacting and just being nuts? Should I go back and check and make sure hes okay? I dont know why I panicked and drove away so fast should i go back and check on him?",14Apr2020,1

203,"My first time posting! Hopefully I do this right! 

Me (22F) and my husband(24M) and our roommate/ my friend from highschool (21M) have been renting together for about 2 years. The first year it was us three and two other people, them sharing a room, my husband and I sharing and my friend had his own. It was in a considerably cheap apartment for our area and we split the rent per room. This current year we wanted a nicer apartment. So my husband and I offered to split the rent per person so he would be able to afford it. Now, a lot has happened since then, I lost a high paying job, my husband was and is still going to school so he's got a part time job and we just cant afford over $1000 in rent combined. My roommate pays half that. He thinks that rent should always be split per person because he thinks if it was per bedroom he's paying more than us individually. We are planning on moving into another cheap apartment in July and have started looking at applications. We are also looking at adding one or two more roommates that are okay with sharing a room so that rent is even cheaper for everyone. What is the best way to split rent or what is common practice?",14Apr2020,1
204,"This is going to be a long post, but I am honestly freaking out. I want to preface this by saying yes, I know. My sister and I are stupid.

In the summer of 2017, my older sister was living with my grandma while my parents lived in another state. She was struggling to get a job. One day, my aunt and uncle were going to my grandmothers house. Before they arrived my uncle messaged my sister, asking if she had Kik. She said no, and immediately got bad vibes. When he arrived, he went into her bedroom and closed the door. He told her he has a “friend” interested in buying photos, and that she should do it to get money since she didn’t have a job. She had JUST turned 18. She was reluctant, but agreed to get Kik and message him. He cornered her, and she was very scared.

A few weeks later, my sister went to a concert with our aunt and uncle. The man my sister was messaging said that her uncle would deliver the money. At the concert, my uncle discretely slipped her the money. After this, she was suspicious and had a feeling the man she sent her photos to was our uncle, so she deleted the app.

Fast forward to the beginning of 2018. I decided to move in with said aunt and uncle to go to school. I didn’t think much of his proposition to my sister, but I made an effort to never be alone with him. Living with them was awful, I ended up getting kicked out because I planned a trip to see my boyfriend (payed for with my money I earned and my parents approved the trip because I was 18.) 

After I was kicked out, I started college. I was struggling with money, but I was waiting for my financial aid refund to hit. I randomly get an email from a user with the name “John Doe” (fake name just in case). The email said that he found my email and thought I’d be interested in doing surveys for money. I was sure this was a scam, but I inquired where he got my email. He gave vague answers and said to download kik. I reluctantly did, determined to figure out who this person was.

I ended up going through old emails, and in 2014 I got an email from the same address. He also added me on google +. In the first ever email he said “I am a 17m I need someone to tell me if it is okay to like guys and girls.” I stupidly messaged John Doe on Kik, and he played stupid about the whole thing.

He told me that all I had to do was answer his questions, and he would pay me for it. He started out with normal questions, but then they got sexual. I kept answering them. I had just turned 18. This went on for only a few weeks and in total he sent me $180 before I deleted the app and stopped talking to him.

I forgot about the whole thing.

Months later while I was bored, I went on Venmo. I found my uncle’s account. He had been paying girls for their photos. I thought it was gross, and felt bad for my oblivious aunt.

This year my W-2 got mailed to my aunt and uncle’s house. My uncle sent me a photo of it and then said he was going to shred it. I did not answer. This is also the first year I’ve had to file taxes. When my father went to file my taxes, it said an account had already been created with my information. I investigated and it said a recovery has been sent to an email. All but the first and last characters were blurred. The first character was the first letter of my uncle’s name, and the last a number.

I got suspicious. They had my W-2 and all my information, and they have a motive to steal it. My parents hate my aunt and uncle and they can’t really ask them if they filed my taxes because that is a heavy accusation that would start a family war.

I was talking to my sister, explaining to her that I thought my uncle stole my taxes. I then said “I could expose him for his venmo history. (Aunt) is probably oblivious.” She then tried to find his Venmo, and when she did it was under the name “John Doe.” The same name that emailed me in 2014 (when I was 13) and also this year. The same man who’s sexual questions I answered.

I told my sister about the emails and Kik conversation, and then she searched her emails. She also had emails the same year from this “John Doe.” She logged onto her old Kik, and the same man she sent photos to is the same man that was asking my sexual questions.

We connected the dots, and we are convinced that “John Doe” is my uncle and has been trying to groom us since we were barely teenagers. The first emails were in 2014. He has 2 kids, and who knows if he’s trying to do it to them too.

We are honestly freaking out that our own uncle could do that. If its not him, then its a pretty crazy fucking coincidence. We don’t know if we should say anything to anyone, or pretend it never happened. I’m also unsure if I should pursue the tax situation. He has my sisters photos and knows all about my sex life. 

TL;DR: My sister and I suspect that my uncle has been trying to groom us since we were teenagers and that he also stole and filed my taxes.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",14Apr2020,1
205,"Hi, I'm C. I plan to run away and never see my mother again. I have had a rocky relationship with her for the past 2 years and at this point, it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I've tried to take countless of chances to mend what's left of our bond but it's not doing any good.

 If there's one thing that I need to say about her, it is that she's damaging and ruining my mental health to the point where I have depression and anxiety. She's mentally and physically abusive. Everyday, I fear to wake up from my bed and open my room door. I'm scared to even go to the kitchen or the bathroom, in fear that I will see her waiting for me, sitting there silently. Screaming at me. Ready to throw accusations to my face. Hitting my arms. That constant fear lingers in my mind all the time. It's gotten to the point where I would not leave my room at all, starving and thirsting for days on end. 

Whenever she yells at me, she would make accusations against me. I think that this is one of the ways she 'guilt-trips' me into thinking that she is the victim. I do help with the chores around the house, sometimes even doin double the work she asks me to do. But she's there, sitting at the dining table not doing shit at all. She claims that she's doing work and having important meetings on her computer, but I don't believe her. She complains of me talking to my friends on the phone the whole day and telling me that I'm lazy. She would then go into fits of complains that she has to work hard and without her, I will not survive in this world because she gives me food, money etc. I know that's true but I'm so fed up of it. She blames my 'disobedient' behaviour for fucking her up mentally. I don't have any say in that.

I'll let her believe what she thinks is true in her mind.
We once got into a heated argument because I had turned the A/C on for too long. She then barged into my room. I tried to push the door close but she shrieked at me not to and started questioning my attitude. I then yelled at her for invading my privacy She goes on to tell me that I keep hoarding the food that she buys and I'm a selfish, little brat. (I have an eating disorder, but she doesn't need to know that. She'll think that its an excuse for me to eat more of the shit she purchases.) Oh well, I guess all of this yelling and arguing is normal for me now.

I just feel empty and miserable in this house. I long to escape and never come back. I never want to see her face ever again. Her voice brings me fear and anxiety. The banging of her fists against my door just shakes me up badly. I feel so fucking traumatized by it. 

If I were to run away, I have no idea where to go honestly. It's either:

1) My friend's house. We're good friends but I'm uncertain if she'll help me. Her parents might restrict her from doing so. 


2) Book a room at a cheap motel. I have enough money to bring with me but I don't think its going to be enough for another 2 years until I'm whisked off to college. Plus, have you seen those documentaries online? People get killed in those kinds of places. Haha, I'm kidding.

Anyway, the point is that I want to find a way out. A way out of hell. Away from my mother and family. I know it's going to sound shitty of me but I plan on cutting ties with her. Like, bye-bye for real. I don't think that I'll have any regrets ever after doing that. If an escape route means a life away from her, then I'll willingly take it. Nothing can change my mind.

I'm tired of dealing with the hits that I get from her, the screaming, the yelling, all of it. It feels like I'm in a stuffy box, cramped up and sweating, unable to breath. That's how I feel. 

So please, if anyone has any advice or has gone through something like this, I beg of you. I need your guidance on what I should do.

210,"Super long post but: 
I work in a youth development agency that, like most places,  has had to go online due to covid-19. That's no problem. I absolutely love my job and the kids I get to work with. I can't see myself doing anything else. 

 However, I've been dealing with problems from my boss for almost the entire time I've worked there. I've worked late because the job required it and not been paid ( like an hour a night) which isn't a huge problem. I've had my programing that is planned a month in advance looked over and replaced 5 minutes before I lead a class because my boss thinks my class won't do the activity (they are reluctant to do anything). My boss expects me to plan detailed classes but does not expect to pay us for planning and preparation. (It's a 20 hrs/wk job but I spend closer to 40 hrs/wk) My boss has not believed me when I told her there are behavior problems that I'm having trouble addressing and need assistance. 

Since we've had to go online I've been working from home and things have gotten worse. I'm still in college and doing classes online which has resulted in a need to spend a lot more time on school. Instead I've been working more on programming for my job. It takes a lot of time to plan and prep classes and we have other things to work on as well. I've been working probably more than what I should anyways but on my last paycheck my boss only gave me half my hours. I asked about it and I was told there was no proof that I worked anymore hours. I was told before this that we did not need to submit things day by day and I didn't. My boss did not contact me to see what was up (my boss had to have known I was not submitting the amount of work required if that was the problem) or let me know I'd be getting half my usual hours as well. 
I let it slide and moved on. A job is a job and it paid something, right? My boss then started putting in deadlines so we knew when to submit certain things, which is awesome... Except most of the deadlines had already passed by the time we were told. I submitted material as quickly as possible anyways. I was a day late on a couple of things but I kept everyone in the loop about it. As a full time senior in college whose coursework just doubled, I'd say that's pretty good. 

Anyways, everything seemed to be going good. My boss threw me under the bus a couple times to our CEO but whatever. I was late on a couple things. I kept working the hours I should have been working. My boss recently asked for us to turn in our hours worked which I did. My boss then responded with something along the lines of ""You worked all of these hours? You don't have the work to prove it."" AGAIN. My boss said I hadn't attended work meetings or done any virtual classes. I had. I responded and said to just put however many hours my boss thought I should be paid. I would have argued it but it's literally like arguing with a wall. So now I don't know how much I will actually be paid even though I worked the same number of hours I would have if we weren't working from home. 

We are under close supervision from our board of directors to make sure we are actually justified to still be paid during all of this, but I'm not sure what other work to do as ""proof."" I asked coworkers and they are doing roughly the same work as me but getting full hours. I understand I have not been the best employee and been a little late sometimes but most of the others aren't in school or have a lighter course load. 

I have bills (like car and loans not rent) that need to be paid and I have school work that I haven't even touched because I have been so focused on work. I don't want to quit my job because I adore the work I do and my clients. My boss is making everything so unbearable though. I'm not sure how much more I can handle. I'm the only one she does this too and I have no idea why. Am I overreacting? Or am I justified in wanting to quit?",14Apr2020,1

Hello! I’m a 17 y/o female, I have endured years of abuse from my drunk step dad (verbal &amp; physical). I have major depression, anxiety etc. I’m on 2 anti-depressants and an anti-anxiety medication. my mom has many mental health disorders making her convinced she needs him and can’t be alone. Well about a year ago DCFS got involved with my household. I ended up moving in with my maternal grandfather. Him and I used to be very very close. I’ve lived with him for about a year. My mom recently had twin boys, that he has custody of. So my mom lives here, takes care of the babies. 
My grandpa is very much a pig, misogynistic, and just hasn’t been very nice. Quarantine isn’t helping, as we’ve been butting heads a lot. He is constantly putting me down. Saying mean things, making me feel bad for my weight gain etc. 
For example I admitted myself to the behavioral health floor this past month for suicidal thoughts and major depressive episodes. while waiting in the emergency room my grandpa made the comment “Were really going to need this break from you”..that made me feel great. 
Well tonight we got into it again, he was saying very mean things and then proceeded to come and drag me upstairs to my room. I got very triggered (from my past abuse) and started kicking and screaming. Causing him to drag me off the couch, making a large gash on the side of my thigh. Of course I get blamed because “he wasn’t trying to hurt me”. My mom witnessed everything, but she wont say anything because she wants guardianship of the twins and won’t go against him not matter what he does. 
Im not sure what the laws are, I live in Illinois. Is there anyway I can get out of here?! I start college in January. But I can’t do this anymore.

Hi i am 16 now and i have made some really terrible mistakes that i have to get off my chest. When i was 14 i started to pretend to be a few girls from my school online and send people non nude pics of them to get there reactions or comments to help me get off. I stopped doing it a few months after turning 16 and i am disgusted in myself. One other thing i am feeling alot of guilt for is uploading some of there pics on Reddit and asking really wierd questions like smash or pass them or would you jerk off to this. This awful mistake was only for a 2 week period and I usually deleted every posts after an hour but it doesn’t help the fact that it’s really disgusting cause the girls were only 16 and 17. I have been clear of all of that stupid shit for 4 months now and i know i will never do it again. The guilt has been killing me the last month every day and i feel like the worst person on earth. I am started to even want to kill my self over all these mistakes. The fact that everyone I know would hate me if they knew about this stuff scares me. Lastly i feel guilty cause I probably could’ve gotten in trouble to and lots of the people I talked to probably have their pics.I just want to be a good person but i feel like that’s impossible after this. Thanks for reading this if anyone has any advice for me I would love to here it.",14Apr2020,0
214,"Hello everyone. I (23M) and my (22F) girlfriend recently found out that she  is experiencing a very harsh pregnancy that is very taxing on her. We didnt want to have kids, and it was a shock to both of us. After a visit to planned parenthood, she will be having a medically induced abortion tomorrow. We are both aware that despite having no desire or attachment to a future child, hormonally and physically it will be a very difficult experience for her. 

Im hoping the reddit community can help with some fun content to watch while it all goes down. I know this is not nearly enough to fully deal with such a severe matter, but im here for her emotionally, and i just want to help take her mind off of things. 

Anything that would be lighthearted, funny, or generally easy to watch, without dark humor would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all, and I hope you are dealing with the quarantine well as we all settle in to a whole new lifestyle.",14Apr2020,1

218,"Btw I'm 17 F
For the past 4-5 years, my parents have believed that  I want to be an engineer. They have my life mapped out, join jrotc, go to college, serve in the air force, and get married and have grandbabies and live until I'm old or smth.
The problem is that the only reason they think I want to be an engineer is because i said i was working ahead in math in 7th grade. I'm in 11th grade now.
It's not like I've tried telling then.ive told my mother that I wanted to be a photographer, but she just said ""you need to join the air force! Your stepdad did, so you should too!"". Another time I told her it was my DREAM to do photography as a living. She looked at me and told me ""it doesnt matter, it doesnt pay as much as engineering.""
So, right now, I'm in a bit of a pickle. I want to honor my parents but becoming an engineer, but I also want to be what I want!
I want to be a teacher or do something with psychology! I hate math and everything related, it makes me frustrated and it gives me really bad anxiety and anxiety attacks. On the other hand, helping kids and learning about the human mind and helping people? It just sounds like something I would want to do until I die. 
I dont know how to tell them this since they've believed that I'd be an engineer for so long. I feel like I'm disappointing them. They worked so hard to live comfortably and now that I have a chance that they didnt have I feel like I should honor them by doing what they want. But i know that if I do go into engineering that I'd probably fall back into depression.

219,"I (27m) started seeing a woman who is 13 years my senior last year.  She said on the first date that she was soon moving to another state 16 hours away; oddly enough, the state and city she was moving to is where I was born, and where all of my mother's family is.  We both thought we'd have our fun, she'd move, and that'd be the end of it.  Boy were we wrong.  Turns out we both fell in love really hard for each other.  She was the smart, fun, energetic, beautiful, talented, loving and amazing woman of my dreams.  

However, she was getting over a divorce, and another failed relationship, and was ready to move to be close to her family for the first time in 15 years.  And, since she is now 40, the prospects of having a family are biologically quite difficult and become increasingly more challenging with each passing year.  But to be honest, I love her so much none of that matters. 

Despite the fact that I didn't want her to leave, I still helped her move every item she owned 1,000 miles, got her set up in a new apartment, met her family, and did everything in my power to make sure she felt emotionally taken care of.  She was starting a new life over at 40, that's a huge move to make, and I wanted to help her as best I could.  And this process only brought us closer together.  

Over the coming months I would visit her as often as we could manage, and talk whenever we could.  But eventually the prospect of being apart became too overbearing to ignore.  So, she asked me if I would move down to live with her and begin a life together.  

But here's where things get tricky.  My mom is dying of a rare and aggressive form of dementia; and my father, who is her primary caretaker, suffers from PTSD, depression, anxiety, and some anger issues.  He loves her with all his heart, but struggles sometimes to cope with the intense amount of stress that is involved with caregiving for someone with my mom's illness.  My sister will be leaving in a couple of months to be with her new husband while he is in the military, and we have no other family here.  So I will be the sole support system for my father and my mother.  My father has done a good job of isolating from any support from my mom's friends, and won't allow in-home care;  so all of the emotional and physical support has to come from me.  

The whole familial environment is incredibly toxic.  I love my mom with my whole heart, and she doesn't have much time left (maybe a few years).  But the more I deal with my father's emotional state and the depressing nature of my mom's illness and death, the more I feel dragged down, stuck, and angry.  My father tells me that it's ok to go be with my lady, but I know that he couldn't handle doing everything alone.  And I would feel so guilty leaving my mom alone with him for the last years of her life.  And then what would happen if I moved in with her only to find out that our relationship doesn't work and further waist what precious time she has left to start a family?  

Do I choose to be with the girl that I love and attempt to start a family and a new life, or stay and take care of my dying mother and toxic father?",14Apr2020,2

My mom is a single mother and has been for nearly 5 years, my dad cheated on her, left her pregnant, then broke up/moved out. I only see him once a year (on my birthday), my siblings see him twice a week. I don’t feel comfortable around him because he’s homophobic (15f I am a lesbian, not out yet). My mom has been saying more recently that she hopes she dies, and keeps saying she won’t see my youngest sister’s (4f) graduation. I always say “stop thinking like that” or something similar, she responds with “then you all will live with your dad, he’ll finally take care of y’all”. I asked her why she thinks he will outlive her (my dad is overweight, an alcoholic, and much older), she never responds. I don’t want her to die, I need her here. I’m unsure of how to help, she’s so stubborn and never listens to me. This whole situation has worsened my mental health, any advice is appreciated.",14Apr2020,3

225,"“Dee” (36f) and I have been friends for 12 years.  She’s very pretty. She’s very responsible and goal oriented. She has a good heart. She’s quirky and fun. She honest. She’s outgoing af. Shes not the smartest, but she takes care of business. She’s also very needy and has extremely high standards. Too high, If you ask me. She requires SO much attention. She gets very emotional when her needs aren’t met. She thinks guys need to text her first (often, at least), and she expects an immediate response when she needs them. She’s just so damn dramatic and clingy. 

Since I’ve known her she’s casually dated probably 100 dudes. She falls in like/love very quickly. It never lasts more than a month or two and it’s ALWAYS “their fault.” Frankly, I’m over consoling her. I’ve hinted at the fact that she needs to just chill out, but she gets defensive and starts listing all the things they did wrong. I’ve tried to suggest maybe going to therapy, but she blows it off.

(found this out during the divorce settlement). I met a girl online about a year ago and we became friends. After a few months of that I despite my fear of being hurt decided to give it a shot with her. She was and is everything that I could ever want in partner. She is encouraging, kind-hearted, and understanding of not just my past but also supportive about my future endeavors. And man I fell for this girl hard, after a few months we met each other's family which is a big deal to both of us. I finally felt like I could finally trust again, and I could see a future with her. Everything was great until....That dreaded conversation.

Currently, she is working on getting an advanced degree and working full time in her career field. She tells me she loves me but everything is just overwhelming right now. She didn't expect her advanced degree to take as much out of her both emotionally and mentally. I want to support her and I do and I support her decision, she needs to be healthy. The part that kills me is when I offered to wait until she is done, just about a year and a half left, she says that ""it's not fair to you for you just to wait for me."" I told her if you say you love me then I don't have a choice but to wait.

SHE did, and she's freaking out and panicking and screaming at my sister and I because she can't find it and is blaming us. She has always been like this but it all got amped up once we moved into where we are now. She makes everything so difficult.

I'm a 19 yo, turning 20 this year. I've talked to my parents about wanting tattoos for almost two years now and my dad, especially, is heavily against it.   


I was 18 when I brought it up, and both my parents said it would ruin any job opportunities in the future because the tattoos I have would create a bad first impression, which I think is both fair and stupid. So I told them that I'd not have it tattooed on a visible part of my body, because I'd like for my tattoos to be a personal reminder of the things I love and live for, to which they argued, ""Then what's the point of getting a tattoo, if not shown to others?""  


So for two years, I kept telling them that I will get a tattoo and I think my mom is okay with the idea now, but my dad is still very against it.  


Both my aunts have tattoos on their bodies and I've told them about wanting one (and possibly more) but my dad is, like, ""hell fucking no, I forbid you to have one."" And both my aunts said to me, ""it's your body, do whatever the hell you like. Besides, you're a fucking adult, he can't control you. Especially when it comes to your body.""

240,"TL;DR at the end

I am a 20 year old male. I have been addicted to porn for around 10 years. It didn’t really start getting bad until around age 17. 

When I turned 18, I lost my virginity to a prostitute. I am not a bad looking guy, and have had plenty of women throughout the years express interest and find me attractive. But for some reason, I still let anxiety hold me back with women. This has led me to seeing escorts for the past 2 years. I’ve been with over 20 escorts. I have probably had actual sex with at least 6 of those escorts.

The biggest reason for me seeing escorts was for my foot fetish. I’ve had it for as long as I could remember, and I’ve let it have me do some weird stuff over the years. I was always too embarrassed to bring it up with the few actual non escort girls I’ve been with. Unfortunately I’ve pretty much only had sex with escorts. 

The tipping point was recently though, just before and during the quarantine. These addictions has led me to have a transsexual foot fetish. I have just recently seen 2 transsexual escorts to fulfill this fetish. After seeing the second one, I have realized that this has gone absolutely too far. I am literally wasting my money and youth on this addiction shit. 

I have no reason as to why I can’t excel in the dating game. I just have to try. But this has made me realize that I need to end this addiction and get on with my life. I’m done. I mainly made this post to vent, and ask for advice. I posted this in NoFap as well.

I’m prayerful and hopeful that I can become a normal person again. Any advice helps at this point.

I don't know where to begin, I'm in my 1st month of Quarantine amidst all the panic and madness. I think I may have lost my marbles. I'm a senior in high school, in fact I'm almost 18, 4 days from now. However as I become a physical adult, My mind still cannot move on from who I was as a freshman in High School. 

When I was a freshman, so 13-14 years old, I had a huge crush on this cute woman, (Let's call her Ailen). This woman showed me torwards the end of my 1st semester had to have been one of the kindest women I have ever met. She showed me a basic sense of compassion that I have never experienced before. She began to push me to get into Snapchat. Torwards the end of freshman year, She began to really act kind to me, however at that point my insecurities started to kick in and I began constantly nagging her about pointless stupid garbage. I was like a dog with separation anxiety. Not to mention, She had a boyfriend named Joseph starting at the end of Freshman year further fueling my insecurities. Eventually, They broke up because he cheated on her with another woman, She was broken and all I was able to do was think about how this would affect me and I was going to sweep her off her knees and swoon her over instead showing some compassion and comforting her and helping to heal her. Now I realize that I could've done better, much better and now I hate myself for it. 

Later on, my usual nagging had gotten to a point to where one of the most gentle and kind human beings on this god forsaken planet had to block me on SNAPCHAT. The platform she initially pushed on me. I was truly deep in a pile of shit. After a while, I began to settle down, bit my insecurities still began to rattle in my head. Troubling thoughts of how to control this woman so that she could ""love"" me, this woman who at that point, was entirely justified in putting a bullet in my skull. 

Fast Forward to present time, and relations between her has gotten better, she even invited me to stay after school with her to accompany her to a Lacrosse game alone but I had to decline because my parents would have said no. Now I realize the shit that I am standing in. My Self-Hatred for myself is building in my head and its my greatest fault. It originates from the story above I now I ask for some advice from you reading this. I am torn from my soul. I don't know if I should tell her how I feel about her given how I've been as human being and potentially put her through more emotional trauma and be a nuisance or to bottle it up and just take my losses and leave her alone, let the Lord make her happy and forget about people like me.",14Apr2020,2
252,"I'm writing this because I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place at the moment. (I apologize for the wall of text). It all started when spring break ended and as everyone knows, Covid-19 was not particularly letting anyone out of the house. So me and my friends played video games all break as a way to pass the time. Flash to the last day of Break when they tell me to give them the Xbox because now online school is starting, which I obliged with a little hesitation because they have taken it before and not returned it. So I give them the Xbox and then they try to take my phone which is new because they only do that when I'm in trouble. Easter Weekend rolls around and I ask them if I can have the Xbox back so I can play with my friends. 

Context, Xbox is mine, was given to me by my younger sister on my last birthday, she didn't use it anymore, they gave it to her for Christmas one year. My dad has a Shaw Bluecurve router so he can try and block anyone's internet access for whatever reason he deems necessary, (Some of those reasons would make you laugh).

So I ask my mom, ""Hey, can I have the Xbox so I can play with my friends?""

and she goes, ""It's not at the house anymore.""

And now I'm mad because not only did I work a 9-5 shift before this, they have taken something of mine and physically removed it from the house without my knowledge or consent. Apparently I'm addicted and don't know when to quit and played too much over break. They then proceeded to write up a two page contract for me to sign to get the Xbox back. Filled with a mess of rules and stipulations for me to follow and if I don't then they will take it entirely. This thing included stuff like keeping my phone at least 5 feet away from me while doing homework, behavioral changes and me having to have an average of 85% just to get the damned thing. Immediately I revolted stating that I wasn't going to sign it because I didn't like how they had taken something that belongs to me and are holding it over my head as a way of forcing me to sign these damn pieces of paper. They are now currently saying that if I don't follow with the guidelines they have provided they will not only take the Xbox for good, they will also shut my phone off, they will take my laptop, turn the internet off completely for any device I could use, and force me to go to the actual school in the middle of this pandemic. They are also telling me I will be nothing, that I will get my athletic scholarship revoked and a whole bunch of other stuff on top of that.

I need help sorting through all of this and am asking for your advice and wisdom, I don't want to cut them out of my life but I can't deal with them any longer, they have no respect for boundaries or personal well being, they are controlling and manipulative and frankly I'm done with it all, if I could walk away I would, but I am not at a place in my life where I can leave and be good on my own.

Okay so here is why Sarah is a pos. For starters she has made fun of my Autistic brother on multiple occasions because he has tantrums. Second she is the worst daughter imaginable. She literally talks shit about her mom to everyone and yells and steals from her mom. She disrespects her mom and many ways. Especially name calling. She hasn’t disrespected my dad from what I know but she sure does use my dad way to much and doesn’t even appreciate him. Thirdly she cheats on all her long term boyfriends. She has been hopping around men while dating guys. Past 4 serious relationships she has been in she manipulated and cheated. She is even cheating on her current boyfriend now whom is an awesome guy who doesn’t deserve it. 
Fourthly she disrespects me. I have tried so hard to be nice to her and help her but I’m done. I am disabled from 2 serious car accidents in one year (not my fault) and am being treated and also just had hip surgery. I have a few other procedures that are coming up for my neck too. I have fibromyalgia and occipital neurolgia from the accident and other things just don’t really want to talk about it. I do my best to not let my disabilities get in the way of me doing stuff. I clean and I also deep clean. But, there is things (like going up and down the stairs carrying heavy things, bending, fully squating, standing long etc) I can’t do yet. My doctors and therapists don’t want me doing it. But, my step sister Sarah literally belittles me about being disabled. She bitches about me not doing stuff and claims I can do certain things I cannot. She also talks nasty about me to her mother. 
Being we share a bathroom I have to pick up after her a lot because she drinks then forgets to clean and she also says she doesn’t want to clean. She also blames me for all her messes. I have dealt with it for 5 years now and so over it. I left the house for 2 years to live in another city with my boyfriend and she uses that as an excuse for her not to clean “because she cleaned for 2 years”.  
She brings strangers into the house to have sex with them. She plays loud music (I can’t stand it because I live with a chronic migraine condition that isn’t being treated right due to money). She knows I have a list of disabilities from my car accidents but literally tells everyone I fake it. It’s kind of hard to fake surgeries and procedures and PT! Anyway the list goes on about her. My dad is aware she is nasty to me but can’t do much because he wants to keep his wife happy. I don’t get why she is such a bad person. Ive tried to understand her but I just can’t. 
She literally just enjoys being a bad person. She laughs about talking bad about other people and hurts the people around her. She drew the line the other day and I’m just beyond frustrated and trying to keep my cool. What do I do? Seriously don’t want to hear “big the bigger person” right now. I’m so tired of being stomped all over and being her punching bag. 
Revenge sounds so much better but there’s nothing I can do anyway. So what do I do?",14Apr2020,2
254,"Using a throwaway because I'm not sure if this would affect my job. Within the past year I've started having what I can only describe as flashbacks of memories at random times. Some days it's more frequent than others and sometimes a day goes by where it doesn't happen at all. I know it's common for trauma victims and people with ptsd to have painful flashbacks but I haven't experienced anything I would classify as traumatic. The memories are also a mix. Sometimes good (someone stroking my hair) sometimes bad (someone yelling at me) I wouldn't really care except that it's started to be distracting in my workplace. I'll be sitting down at my desk and suddenly a face will pop up in my mind, so vivid and I'll hear their voice before I snap back to reality. I've started occasionally zoning out when people are talking to me or violently flinchijg at a bad memory and my coworkers have started to notice. They ask ""where I went to"" Or ""why I made that face."" I also keep seeing random familiar faces in strangers. I'll have to do a double take before I see their face as it truly is. This all started when I moved to this new place with a new job. I don't know if this is normal or honestly if I'm losing it.

261,"So I am 18 years old and ever since I was little I wanted to have friends to hang with ,I liked hanging around close friends (they weren’t friends I texted I just hanged with them at school and that’s it) As I grew older that wanting to be social part of me went away ,by the time high school came I didn’t care about anything anymore not school ,not money ,not people. I barely graduated, never had a girlfriend (I’d say I’m a decent looking guy so it wasn’t cause I was ugly) but girls didn’t approach me either so idk , also never really talked to people throughout my whole school years. As of right now I’m in a state where I’m not sad yet not happy either. I don’t really like holding conversations because they just don’t interest me they seem meaningless and I hate small talk, tbh idk what’s the point in small talk it seems dumb like get straight to the point like geez tell me about your life not “what’s up”(tbh idk how to text anyways), unless it’s about something deep. I also feel like everyone in society is fake nowadays trying to put up an image for other people , sometimes even for themselves trying to be something they’re not. Sometimes I wish I was born in another era when technology wasn’t a thing. Also lately I’ve wanted to have a girlfriend because I feel like it would give my life purpose , yet when I texted a girl I liked recently and we talked for a while it didn’t excite me so I was wondering what you guys make of this? Also I might add that I I’ve never shown my emotions not even to the people closest to me. I’ve always been open minded if that’s helps.

266,"This is kinda long, I’m sorry!

Okay so a little bit of a backstory before I get into the actual thing I need advice on. I’m currently 18 years old and a freshman in college studying psychology. From the time I was 11, I’ve struggled with horrible depression and anxiety. This caused me to be hospitalized numerous times throughout my high school years, so obviously my attendance was poor. Because of this, I had to get an alternative high school diploma. It wasn’t horrible, however I definitely didn’t get to explore different classes, clubs, passions, etc. Right now, I’m in a dilemma because I genuinely have no idea what I want to do with my life. I used to be passionate about helping others and fascinated by psychology as a whole (cliche I know), but now I find myself dreading college and have tons of feelings of uncertainty. I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t want to do anything directly related to helping others with psychiatric issues (therapy, social work, crisis, etc). I’ve considered dropping out of college and taking a year or so to really figure out what I’d like to do before spend a lot of money on more college, because I genuinely have no idea what I’d like to do as a career or where I see myself in the future. The problem with this route is that I live in a small area and don’t even know where to begin with “finding myself”. I’ve also considered just riding out my degree in hopes I’ll figure something out by the time I graduate. I’m somewhat interested in writing, and I think I’m decent at it, but I don’t know if that’s something I’d like to pursue as a career. 

Long story short, should I ride out college and get a psychology degree in hopes I find something I can see myself doing or should I take some time off to figure it out?

268,"I(30f)have 2 male friends (both 30M), whom I am really starting to dread talking with. I also fear they are trying to ruin my relationship with my husband.

First thing: I will admit that I am a very friendly and positive person. And I don't know if it could be misconstrued as flirting or not.

Now the Backstories:

Male A: is married to my best friend of over 10 years, and called me up telling me that he was thinking about leaving his wife(he claims to still be in absolute love with her, but can't deal with her self image issues, and she apparently knows he loves me, which could be true because he is BRUTALLY honest but that could be a lie too), and is absolutely convinced that if he did, I would be with him and destroy my own relationship and friendship(which is absolutely nuts because I would never ever be with someone who dated or married one of my best friends). I ended up blocking him on all social media, all phone and texts due to him calling me almost every day for 2 weeks and trying to convince me that I actually love him and I should embrace my feelings so if he divorces his wife we could be together(I told him to back off repeatedly).I only unblocked him recently because my best friend has not been well lately and I worry that something could happen to her.

Male B: I have been friends with him for about 15 years now, and he ""accidentally"" sends me inappropriate texts saying of that was for the wife or one of his best friends. I was an emotional shoulder to cry on at one point(marriage problems on his part,but before I met and married my husband) , but now he is also using me as retaliation against his wife(she absolutely loathes me because he will tell her that I would run off with him in a heartbeat(I would not) and if looks could kill, I would have died a while back) any time they fight(I have heard this from a few mutual friends).

I hate that I am feeling that they are trying to ruin my relationships not just with my husband, but with my best friend as well. My husband has seen all the texts and the amount of phone calls I got and knows I am very upset about them both, because to me, it feels like they want me to cheat(never going to happen). My husband is friends with Male A, but never met Male B because he lives far away and never came to our wedding.

I miss the ""normal"" talks with them. But at the same time I am really starting to hate conversations with them because of what they are expecting from me.

I am not sure how to proceed with if I want to be friends with either of them. But I also don't want to lose my best friend either because one is her husband.

So here's the thing I received a check on March 26th but was told by the owner's daughter not to deposit the check.

Some of my co-workers and I were supposed to receive another check from this restaurant on April 10th for the few days we worked. Today is April 13th, and we are yet to receive any updates from the owner or his daughters. I can't reach the restaurant owner because he's currently in Mexico.

282,"Backstory: Our professor discussed the switch to virtual lectures online before the entire campus went virtual and my understanding was that she was to record and keep her lectures upload on the page.

These discussion questions will remain open for submission for one week following the lecture. The responses to these discussion questions will provide you with credit for attendance and participation.

My best friend is autistic [20 M], he is from Spain and lives there, but he is not really high on the spectrum, so he is not a Sheldon Copper, he can make jokes, understand mannerisms of society etc. 

Among a other themes there is one in special that makes him very depressed and it's that he doesn't find something that he can do on life, he doesn't feel like having a goal or a job determined to him. Everything seems like a loss of time, a waste of his potential and many phrases more that he says. He is studying but he thinks that is a loss of time (which tbh is useless, because what he is doing doesn't help him at all he is studying whatever just so his parents don't kill him for leaving studies and do nothing).

I've told him that he doesn't need to have something exactly that puts in play all of his potential, he can do more than one thing, not stick with only one thing, but he doesn't like that idea because he tells me that doing more than one thing is for people that are good not at anything. I've offered him some options that in conversations that we had he framed them as attractive but when I mentioned them he didn't want them, some examples are: PI, writer, actor. He has told me how much he likes the idea of being a PI, and I think he'll probably be a good one, but for being one you have to do certain things that he doesn't want to, why? Idk. But the idea that he has to pass through that process makes him stressed.

I've tried to tell him to do whatever feels comfortable to him, I tried to discuss his future and that he has to decide by himself because nobody is going to do it for him. I tried to explain that if wants to become a PI he has to pass through that little thing he doesn't like but it will be for a good reason. I tried almost everything to make him decide but without putting pressure. 

This theme doesn't emerge a lot but when it does I don't know what to do because I ran out of ideas and advices for him and I feel that everytime is worse because the time passes and therefore less time to decide. 

Sorry for the usless details and terrible text order, I still don't have a high end control/management of English.

287,"I have just started working a job at Publix a few weeks ago. This is my first job and I just turned 18 in December. I got assigned as a Deli Clerk. Everything was going well in the first couple of shifts. I can handle the labor aspect, and customers will be customers. I can handle the occasional insults. The associates on the other hand are the real jerks. I'm the youngest person in my department currently and everyone just walks all over me and treats me with the utmost disrespect. They're bratty, petty, and overall just likes brining misery upon people. However this was not the issue.

The issue started when the Covid-19 virus started rapidly spreading in my area. My mother is a respiratory therapist, so she is in contact with patients.  She got a call from her job one day exclaiming that she had been exposed to Covid-19 patients without her knowledge a week prior, and she wasn't wearing her personal protective gear at the time so she was put under self quarantine. A day later she started showing symptoms. A typical fever,cough, and extremely runny nose. And then the next day I showed similar symptoms. I called my job to notify them and the store manager put me under quarantine. Now this is where the real problem begins.

Without my knowledge I am set up for 40 hours the following week, even though I am part-time and under SELF QUARANTINE as the STORE MANAGER requested. Apparently the Department heads were not notified, so a week later I get spam calls from the department to come in immediately. Basically my manager chewed me out for not showing up and missing all of my shifts and he doesn't care what happened. This is when I was really confused. I was being told two completely different things, and on top of that I'm still in high school. The online virtual learning isn't going well.

295,I have this friend I met about a week ago. We've talked quite a bit and she's trusted me with a lot about her life. She informed me of this person she used to talk to and somewhat had a relationship with. Apparently it had gone very badly and he threatened to blackmail her and release all of her personal information. She was terrified because she has a husband and 2 kids and doesn't want them to be in any kind of danger so she did what he said and kept him happy. I feel so bad for her and I want to help but I just don't know how. I've told her to try and get authorities involved but she refuses because she doesn't want anyone to know about him. Apparently aside from me now no one else knows about this guy. I fear for her safety and I really want to help but I'm not sure there's anything I can do. Any ideas reddit?,14Apr2020,1
297,"If someone has gone through a similar situation, please help me.

Ok, so me and my friend (F16) have been sneaking to be together. I have gone to her house during the night 3 times to kiss and spend time together without her parents knowing. On the 3rd time it got very intense and we humped while naked, but didn't have actual sex (penis in vagina). She told me she had her period the very next day, so I was calm for a while (I also did a little research and saw that we didn't have to worry because probabilities of something going wrong were very very low).

On the afternoon of April 9th, I suddenly got worried that things might go wrong and couldn't calm myself about it, so I bought a pregnancy test and told her we needed to check that for me to be calm about it and not worry anymore.

So I went a 4th time to her house, got inside her bedroom, gave the test to her and then she went to the bathroom to take the test. It came out negative, so we both were relieved and decided (very stupidly) to spend that time together.

It got a little bit intense and we kissed, she gave me a blowjob and some of my cum stayed on her hand. When it was time for me to leave (about 5 am), we discovered that her dad went to sleep on the living room.

I tried to leave without waking him up, but he woke up very suddenly and saw me leaving. Long story short, my parents got wind of it, I got into a lot of trouble for it and had to ask forgiveness for doing all that. I have a lot of guilt in my chest until now.

Thank God her father was kinda chill about it later and said that we all make mistakes when we are young, but I'm still worried about 2 things: 
A. Her/My parents discovering that I went there because of the pregnancy test (We gave an excuse that we needed to talk urgently, things like that) 
B. That she is now pregnant because of what happened. I know she can't pregnant from the BJ (duh) but I'm very scared that she touched her vagina later or that somehow my sperm got through after we humped with our clothes on, because I was wearing shorts with very light material and she was in sweatpants.

I can't just give her another test for obvious reasons and I'm afraid of talking to her and just asking if she got her period this time as well because I don't want her to tell her mom.

It's like I'm at a dead end and need to wait, so I'm anxious about it and would very much like advice on it.",14Apr2020,1

But all of that has been met with indifference. He’s not particularly interested or motivated enough to do any of them.  I’m hoping maybe someone here can suggest something that we haven’t thought of?

299,"I've had a crush on my former best friend for abt 8 years.

I didn't even say bye to him on the last day bc he was sorta mean to me yknow? He's still close to where I live (abt 20 min) but different schools. Were both freshies in high school now and I've never lost feelings for him. Is this love? Or am I just too attached to him emotionally and as friends? We never talked until 8th grade spring. We texted for hours and he kept mentioning the past and how he misses us as kids. Now we don't talk as much. I REALLY want to tell him I like him, but I'm terribly scared of rejection (he's done it b4 in 6th grade lol.)

1. How should I keep her interested until then?
2. I’m nervous about starting a relationship now because I’ve never had one and I’d be nervous I would fuck it up so how do I avoid this?

301,"I work at a smaller veterinary hospital, as a receptionist, but I've been working really hard for months for a promotion, and finally, I was offered a promotion and raise. I'd been doing most of the parts of the job for months, but there was some new additions, but it still caught me a bit off guard the the Boss wanted myself and the other promoted staff member to do the job for a month before we got the raise, but I figured one month isn't so long.

Of course then COVID hit, and the boss told us because of monetary concerns, the raise was postponed, but we could give back responsibilities if we wanted. Originally I said I would probably have to do that, but we'd have to see, because I had so much on my plate, but I've been working really hard to keep up with everything and I haven't needed to. I also thought it would be silly to teach my boss the stuff for two weeks and then take it back, plus I understood that we were in a hard place financially.

Then a week ago, the other staff told me we were all getting a temporary raise, which isn't quite what my raise would have been, but close. Apparently they found the business was actually doing well, so they wanted to do something to thank the staff. Which is very cool, it's awesome, but it makes me feel a little taken for granted, since I was told I couldn't receive the raise because we had monetary concerns, so while I get the temporary raise too, it's not as much as I would have been earning for the promotion I've been doing.

And that's not to mention that frankly my job has been much much harder with COVID. I've been having to go in on my days off often, and I get calls for help with stuff up to three times a day, often waking me up, or causing me to have to stop dinner with my boyfriend to walk employees through tasks while he finishes dinner, so it feels like I'm on call all the time. And sometimes I feel obligated to come in when someone is sick, because I want to help, but it seems my boss doesn't notice. Not to mention how hard scheduling has been (scheduling was one of the new responsibilities, but I'd already been kind of doing it), as a different person is all of a sudden out each day for an unspecified amount of time, so the schedule has to be changed constantly. I'm happy to do all this, but honestly, not if I'm not appreciated. And perhaps I sound petty, but it's not as if I'm thanked for any of this, and now everyone else has a raise due to COVID, and I still in essence have a pay cut. Perhaps I wouldn't care so much, but I've been working for this raise for months, and now I honestly don't know if and when it will happen.

But my Boss especially (she's higher risk) and other employees are very concerned about COVID. I am too. So I feel weird asking about things like a raise. But I'm risking myself too, and I'm doing a lot more anyway, and I would rather just be a receptionist and cut back my hours for safety, and start learning coding in my spare time for hope of a better career if I'm not going to get a raise anytime soon. But I'm not sure it's appropriate to ask when everyone is worried about staying alive. And honestly, I'm great with administrative stuff and computers, which is what my promotion was about, but I'm not good at dealing with supervisors on delicate matters at least. I have no idea how I would even bring that up.",14Apr2020,3

312,"Hello! I’m new to reddit and don’t properly know how to format so forgive me! But I really need advice.

So I had to move back home from college because of the virus and I (f18) live with my single mom (47) and my grandma (72). My dad was a deadbeat and left when I was younger so he isn’t in the picture and my mom never had any boyfriends or anything like that while I was growing up except this one guy for a few months when I was in middle school. Let’s call him Ryan. 

I never liked Ryan, he was never around a lot but when he was it was just weird and there were just so many things about him that I didn’t like. And I for sure couldn’t picture him with my mom. I know some people may blame it on not wanting to let go of my mom but I swear that that’s not it! I would love for her to get with somebody, but just somebody who isn’t like him. She’s my role model and an amazing mother,  but we live in a small town and there aren’t many options. Plus she’s been single for so long that that is why I feel like she went out with Ryan. But he definitely wasn’t good for her. (I for sure didn’t like him after I found out that he had a wife who he was ‘taking a break from’ and using my mom basically as the other women, like wtf!!) They only had a fling for about a year but then they broke things off. Well apparently while I was away at college they got back together, but not for a normal relationship. How do I know? 

I SAW HER SEXTS. Yep. It was horrible. 

Okay, so I admit I partially snooped because I saw on her phone that he was one of the recent people she texted, when I was borrowing her phone for something. So I looked at the texts (I feel really bad about it and thoroughly regret it so please don’t attack me too bad for doing it!) and it was all very disturbing ~messages~ that nobody would want to see on their mothers phone. I actually figured this out during one of my first break back home from college in the beginning of the year and just decided to ignore it, since as much as I don’t like him, she is a grown women and I really didn’t want to make things awkward between us. We normally tell each other everything and she obviously does not want me to know about him, so that’s another reason why I think it’s not a ‘real’ relationship and just a fwb thing.

But now I’m out of the dorms and back home because of COVID-19 and guess what I saw when I went to borrow her phone to text myself a picture from her phone? Yep, more messages from him. And you know what I did? Snooped again - I just wanted to see if they were talking more like a couple or if they were still... you know what. But I saw that it said something about meeting up and it was recent, which made me upset since she shouldn’t be meeting up with him while we’re self isolating!!

And tonight it was confirmed that she’s leaving to go hook-up (I gagged typing this) when I went into her room at like 10:30 to ask her if she had any midol. But when I went in she wasn’t there. So I checked her location on find my friends and she was on the other side of town where I remembered his house is. 

Like I said earlier, I live with her and my grandma. There has been an outbreak of the virus in my town so I’m even terrified when my mom leaves to go to the grocery store that she’ll contract it and then possibly give it to my grandma. Ryan is a construction worker and idk if they are considered essential and still working? But even if he isn’t who knows if he’s seen anybody! 

So Reddit, should I confront my mom and tell her I know about her meeting up with him and ask her to stop so we can keep up proper social distancing and make sure that none of us, especially my grandma, gets sick? I know that if my mom and grandma (and probably me!) get it and I didn’t say anything to my mom I would hate myself for it, but I also really don’t want to bring it up to my mom since she is definitely trying to hide it from me and it’s just super awkward!! So any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Sorry this was so long!",14Apr2020,0

315,"Hi. Posting on a throwaway and English is not my 1st language.

I'm a architect and on the group of high risk of complications due to covid19, I have a severe chronic illness, and a month ago decided to talk to my doctor and he put me on mandatory quarantine.

Today, my boss called me and told me that the company is no longer interested in keeping my contract but I probably will have my position after this thing is over (I don't really trust him).
But here's the deal: I truly love my job, but for the past few months I've been catching feelings for my boss as well. He's a handsome guy, very smart and we were always kinda close to each other

Now I am really considering asking him to keep me on my position and immediately go back to work (my job is in construction field, and on the ""essential services"" in my country, so we will not stop), but I'm afraid that I'm doing so because of these so called feelings.

I really need advice towards making the best decision I can. 

To make a few things clear:
Being unemployed is not a real deal for me. Will be short in money but my house, food, medication and everything are kinda granted.

I am actually on a internship program, so I really fear losing this job due to practical experience needed to my graduation. The construction market were already down in the past few years, so I don't think there will be lots of work when everything go back to ""normal"".",14Apr2020,1

322,"Hello reddit, I don't know if this is even going to reach people but I'm 17 yr old female and I am scared that I might me be pregnant. I don't even think this is right thread for this but I just need help / advice or whatever

Like the tittle says I've never had sex meaning a penis has not gone inside but me and a male friend (17 as well) were together a couple of days ago and he came over even though we are supposed to be in quartine.
 I know that itself is a problem but he only came to drop off school work since everything is online now and I don't have a printer at home and he does and doesn't mind printing work out for me.

We have feelings for each and things got heated since its not the first time we've done stuff but there has never been intercourse. The reason I'm so scared is that his penis was near my vagina and we were both fully exposed to each other down there. I could feel precum but he was never inside me. He finished but it was on my butt. 

The way things were happening is that it was as if we were having sex but he was never inside me and was almost using my inner thighs/ the outside of my vagina to get off. He said that when he relaised what was about to happen he got his penis away from my vagina before he finished. 

The reason Im so scared is because I don't know if cum was near my vagina and it could've gotten inside me without him or me noticing. 

As soon as we realized what happened though I went to the bathroom to clean myself up and had wipes to wipe everything off of me and away from my vagina. He then went and did the same since he finished. 

I'm now playing the waiting game and its killing me. Today is the 14 of April  and accordingly my period tracker I should be getting my period before around April 17 till the 25th. I am so scared and honestly pray that I get it sooner then later. I am feeling like I usually would before my period meaning my breast are tender and I'm feeling very tired and I'm starting to get very weak cramps but from I've searched up those could also be signs of early pregnancy even those symptoms don't show up till a bit later and since this just happened less then a week ago I doubt its pregnancy symptoms.

This isn’t an ongoing VN or anything, it ended in 2016. It’s actually a bit obscure and there’s barely any media to consume of it, but I keep thinking about it and the characters on repeat and never get tired of it.

350,"Hello all. I am a 20 y/o man about to go to move out and for the past few weeks I’ve been feeling very conflicted about my sexuality. I’ve grown up in a house with a very religious father and family and with a more accepting mother but I am petrified of coming out as bi. I have many concerns:
What if girls don’t like me if I’m bi? Idk what it is about being bi but from the outside it looks like a predominantly female group.  

I’ve always been into girls but as I’ve grown up I feel a certain disconnect from other guys and feel attracted to some. This has all occurred while I have had a gay best friend. They say you become like the people you associate yourself with and I’ve noticed a change in me since we became close. I’m not attracted to them at all so that’s not the case. 
I’m just scared in general about the community outlook on me, family and friends changing their minds about me, I just don’t know what to do when all this could be a fluke anyway. I’d appreciate any advice. If you need follow up questions answered feel free to ask. This is my burner account also.

357,"Im a student who lives in an apartment complex, due to COVID I am now unable to pay my rent. The issue arose when I realized my lease requires a $200 fee to break from it, and also requires me to cover all rent charges for the remaining time (4 months) . My parents are instructing me to move out and come home (since school is moved online) and tell them (apt complex) i simply can not pay. Their reasoning being that with so many people not being able to pay rent or utilities they wont come after me specifically in a legal matter, and while there would be bad renters report on my guarantor (dad) and me, they believe the next place I rent at will overlook the fact I have a negative review because it happen due to COVID.

364,"My girlfriend is being abused by her step-dad. She's 15 and I'm 16. He calls her names like whore, slut, psycho, or bitch and he also beats her. He shoves her into things and slaps her a lot. Sometimes it leaves marks, but they usually go away after overnight. Since we've gotten together, I've been trying to help her try to find a way to get him arrested, and our plan is that the next time he beats her and it leaves marks, she'll take pictures and we'll go to the police with them as evidence. She's also started writing down everything he does to her and when he hits her and what he says to her. We desperately want him to be gone and out of her life, and I'm trying all I can to help but I don't know what else to do. I feel like I could do more. We want this issue to be solved as soon as possible, and we hate having to wait until she gets beaten again that badly.

So I guess my question is, is there anything we can do to get him arrested right now? We don't have the photographic evidence of what he's done, but we have what she writes down, her sister, who also gets abused but not as much, would back her up, I would back her up, my family would also back her up, and the police has already been called to the house before for her step-dad beating her mom after she talked to her mom and her mom confronted him, and I know he got into some sort of trouble with the police for it. I'm just desperate at this point. We don't really want to get CPS involved right now because we don't think we have enough evidence and it'll only make things worse.

I must say, that I'm a newbie, and the firm new that. I didn't have any work experience before. For the first few months, I was doing quite well for my level and even handles a few tougher tasks. Then I was given a bit more serious tasks all for myself. And that's where the downfall begins. I couldn't handle all by myself. And I don't know what happened, but I lost my confidence, and after that wasn't able to handle even the easiest tasks. I told my concerns to my supervisors, that I see that I'm not my best, and ill try to work it out. But never recovered from that. And now we have quarantine, and as all of you know, the economy is crashing, and the job market got small. So I can't quit or be fired from my current job so that just adds up with more stress on top of not performing well. I have to say, that I'm really trying, but most of the remarks I get now, that I'm too slow. And we don't have time for experiments. I try to work as fast as I can.  I tried stress comping mechanisms like meditating, reading, not using social media, playing with my pet. But that only works at that given moment. The second I sit down to work, all the stress comes back and literally I can not focus. I feel like I don't know what to do, doubt myself a lot.

Sorry, if it's a wreck to read, but I'm kind of in a really fked up situation. And actually the only reason I say, I would quit, it's because the city I live in is small, so rumors spread fast around, and I would quit before I'm ahead. But now, there's literally nowhere to quit.

You can go check that out for context and background. 

I am trying to cope with moving on. I am not sure how to. Last night during dinner, my family found out I was speaking to him secretly. The person who is taking it the hardest is my brother (28). He said he hates me and some other statements because of how many times I’ve broken his trust, so he isn’t speaking to me currently. My plan was to continue to advocate and say I want to be with my boyfriend, and this sounds fine right? Until I found he has blocked me on every social media possible.

I did find ways to “get in contact” with him. Both through reaching out to his friends in multiple platforms and creating secondary accounts to message him. He’s explained to me that he is trying to help me by cutting himself out of my life. That we could try again in the future but he doesn’t want me getting hurt. After getting this point across, he blocked me again and all of his friends followed suit. Today alone I’ve been blocked by 5 people on several platforms including him. 

Many of my friends say that if he truly wanted to be with me then he wouldn’t have chickened out, and that this was his way of escaping the relationship. I am having difficulty believing this because not too long ago he earnestly said to me that I’m one of the best things that’s happened to him, and that he doesn’t appreciate me as much as he should. I made a final snapchat account to send him my messages and thoughts, asking for closure and the truth. 

My plan was if he blocked this last account without trying to communicate with me, then I will just try to move on. So I guess I am asking for advice on what I should do now moving forward, and how to cope with moving on? It’s painful one sidedly fighting for something.",14Apr2020,0
371,"On mobile and using a throwaway account for this. Went grocery shopping today at Walmart with the bf. The total was about $200. I ran my EBT card then the bf ran his debit. We were rushing to leave, so we didn't think too hard about the 94cents change she gave us. The bf remembered she said something about that being normal with EBT (makes no sense) and had no charges on his card. We looked at the receipt and apparently my EBT only got charged $5 while the bf didn't get charged at all. She apparently keyed in most of the transaction as cash.
My dilemma is that there is no way they didn't notice her register being almost $200 short. I'm fairly certain they've already fired her. Now, I won't lose sleep at all about Walmart being out some money. Being that it was such a huge error, I really don't think going back to make it right will help her keep her job.

M(26) having issues with understanding feeling and mutual reflection.


I have lived with my girlfriend (24) for 6 years. Fell on hards times and had to move in with her parents for a few months. I dont have family alive and the family that is alive do not really care for me. I'd say I'm very laid back and understanding.also sensitive as well I struggle with depression and anxiety since my mom has passed 5 years ago I take on a lot of responsibilities even extra ones because I know how cruel life can be for my family which has now put in me a hard place financially. Living has been a little rough and I have had to say no to more things than usual which hurts me inside because I hate not being able to just say yes. And help. In doing this it has caused tension among the family and her family little arguments arise and can be blown to huge proportions. I had honestly felt like I was being used. I felt like I was getting treated pretty poorly and even saying that did not do anything. Just kinda the stance""your the man figure it out and stop being so sensitive. Take a joke."" Would just make.everything more stressful for me. Financially hurting and given a set time to be out of parents home I'm the only income so it definitely is stressful to me with also dealing with other financial problems. We live 45 mins from town by car. My truck just recently broke down and I lost my job to the virus and havnt worked in 2 weeks so I'm more scared of anything. If I did have a job I wouldn't be able to ask for a ride to and from work from her family. They think I have to find a way. this weekend there was an arguement over food. I hadn't eaten all day but I was also feeling sad that day. And let it be known to my gf. The argument was about. Me just going hungry since I was not hungry at the moment the food was ready. when I pay my side of the rent and food to eat and then some. So the argument subsided some and then it went to other topics of issues. Small things annoyances things like that but it seemed to be pointed at me. This has happened pretty recently other times as well. Just felt picked on and forced into a position where If I dont do x I get kicked out or belittled or scolded until I do it. So after some time I started to pack.my stuff and start to leave I had many reactions. Get lost or please stay. At that point I was exhausted in trying to prove I'm doing everything I can and that I'm a good person and to be treated like one. I walked for 7 hours to get to town in the middle of the night jobless carless. And barely had anything to my name. Waited til morning when it started to rain. I had to call my remarried grandmother (56)who I hadn't talked to in 6 years. She's in my opinion not really an understanding person she sees black and white. She has no kids, has worked at the same company for 30 years 6 figure salary and lives in a small mansion house 3 story home with 8 rooms and bonus room. As a kid that grew up in poverty she was amazing. I always loved her hanging with her but as time grew and I had to work at 16 I was already helping pay Bill's and becoming a functioning adult figuring myself out we kinda stopped talking due to time scales. During those times I was definitely not the best person. I never did anything illegal but I was very much weird and emo so interaction with her became seldom because it almost always turned into a discussion of me and that there was something wrong. So I called her to tell her what happened because I lost my parents at 21 I couldn't turn anywhere.else Sad thing is she still sees me as the teenager that just didn't fit in and was just kinda off. That's been over 10 years ago. She came.and picked me up put me in a hotel I asked to split. I dont ask for help at all nor do I take help due to I'm scared of making the other party mad down the road. Like if you give me 10 dollars I'd pay it back I dont like being in debt to someone because it can cause issues later. And makes me.feel less than a man. So I begged her to not do it but she insisted. Me feeling bad for even bothering her. She's pretty well off. I know I'll never get to her status unless I get lucky. But just felt awful. I tried calling shelters and work agencies because if I'm in town I can at least be around work if something opens not a days walk away but everything's closed due to the virus so the next day I leave and she hands me 100 bucks and I just cant accept it. She's already done to much. But insists so I sit there and vent kinda telling her the last few years the things I've been through. Short lived homelessness, work related issues, physical abuse from partners, etc.. she stares at me and says I did this for you dont go back I gave that money to you for help. I cant take you home and dont know what else to do. I said I really cant accept it. Makes me feel weird. Obligatory to you. She then says to me ""you seem to sit there and blame everyone but yourself. I think you need to take a look in the mirror and really ask yourself maybe your the asshole"" I started crying and said "" that really hurt"" but I would not sit there in a place I'm not wanted being told I'm nothing but scum. I looked at her and that's the issue I'm having no one believes me when I say these things. I've been abused I've been used. Brought down. I'm not perfect but I'm caring in a big way. I insisted on giving the money back after that. But she had already started to close the door. I now feel guilty for taking the money and even telling her the issues I'm facing. I was dropped off at a walmart until I can find work and a place to stay. 3 days later i get a call.from my girlfriend to come back home to the parents house with them. I'm still hurt. I feel disrespected and know that it will happen again but I do miss my daughter and still love my girlfriend. I have saved her from a lot of trouble and spent 6 years with her. She's like me lower income. I have a.college degree yet struggle to find work. And living in a will to work state I can be fired for no reason which has happened many times in the past. I feel I am.being taken for granted in certain areas but as my grandmother stated that phrase. I now have very much doubted myself in the last few days. Thinking do I deserve this treatment. Do I just stop trying to acheive more and just enjoy my socio economic status am I really the issue to the things that surround me. Is it safer for me to just take it with a smile like I have in all aspects of my life while inside I know in my heart it's wrong. I ended up swallowing my pride and took the half day walk back to my girlfriend's parents house and was not greeted to well but she just said take it and at least your safe. I feel guilty about my grandmother but I feel every other choice felt wrong as well. I'm in a moral and emotional position right now and I'm scared I feel cornered. I feel overwhelmed and doubtful.

I had a really awesome high school experience and I’m blessed for that cause I know not everyone can say the same, I had a big group of really close friends that I have known since elementary school, I was very involved in my school, and I was always just having fun and living it up.

377,"Firstly I should try to explain what a twin flame is, as just like me many of you readers might not know about this. I don't even know if I can explain it properly because to be honest, I don't understand it myself.

So... Twin flame is a concept in spirituality (in which my girlfriend strongly believes). Twin flames are two people who were split into different bodies but have the same soul. When you meet your twin flame, It feels like you have known this person your whole life. Everyone was created with a twin flame but not everyone is lucky enough to meet theirs but when you do, it's a life changing experience. It's a connection you've never felt before, something incomparable to anything you've ever felt with anyone you met or dated in your past and a feeling you will never experience with anyone else in the future.

I met a very pretty girl at college who I almost immediately developed a liking for. We became friends and very soon we got into a relationship. We didn't even know each other very well at the time when we started dating but both of us did like each other. 

Spirituality had been an alien concept to me until my girlfriend introduced me to it. I still don't believe in any of what she told me but I do respect her beliefs.

She met a guy two years before we started dating. She had a very strong emotional and spiritual connection with that guy and she thinks that guy is her twin flame.
My girlfriend and her 'supposed' twin flame are not in talking terms since over a year now.

My girlfriend is a poet and some poems written by her are the best that I've ever read.  The problem arises when sometimes she writes about unrequited love and how hurt she is because her twin flame left and I know deep down she still loves her twin flame and she's thinking of him while writing those poems. Sometimes she'd be alone at home and when the loneliness would take over, she'd all over again be upset over her long gone twin flame and then write sad poetry about it. And it is disheartening for me to see her upset.

Both of us have talked this through many times. I used to think that whenever she writes a poem about her lost love, her scars heal, bit by bit. But soon I came to realise that every time she writes, she's grieving about the past and still holding on to it. Which I feel is unfair to me. She wouldn't accept it but I know she still loves him and this upsets me. Her healing process is hurting me.

I don't believe in concepts of spirituality. This twin flame concept sounds really exciting but I know that I will never ever find my twin flame. And the sole reason for this is that I don't believe in it. 
Maybe if my girlfriend didn't believe in such a thing, that guy would have been just another guy in her life and I could have had a happier and healthier relationship.


I'm not the kind of guy who'd get insecure over my loved ones past. But this time it was different. Something that sounds absurd to me, something that I don't believe to exist, is hurting my relationship and I don't even know what I should do about it. I sometimes feel that my girlfriend doesn't love me as truly as she can. She could have loved me much more deeply and we could have been a better couple if she just didn't believe in twin flames or if she just hadn't ever met that guy.

Lately we've had a few fights over this issue too. I respect my girlfriend's beliefs but I just can't accept the fact that something which is nonexistent to me is hurting both of us and our relationship too ! 
I really love this girl a lot and I'd do everything in my power to make this relationship work. 

With tears in my eyes, I'm signing off...

380,"I currently work as a retail assistant. Sadly I haven't been able to do internships as both my mother and father passed away in the last few years and it has been5 years now I was only able to work casually as I had to settle their estate with lawyers etc...(it was a complicated mess).

Now, I really want to further my career and do something with my bachelor of digital media (graduated in 2014) and get things onto my resume. It is hard to get internships now  and was wondering if there was a way I could ask my large chain retail for opportunity in internships?

I am just worried as their main company is in another state, if it is something I can do perhaps online?

381,"(for background) my friend, and I have been friends for 7 years, and after some changes, our only way of talking is via the internet. we used to talk 24/7, and shared everything, but on on and off, for around a year, I feel like it’s more one sided.

I feel like our conversations are only started when she has a problem, which is fine. I’ll stay there while she types paragraphs, and talk her through it. after, she apologizes and tells me to vent all I want. I don’t want to overwhelm her, so I usually don’t share much. However, I recently have been dealing with something, so I’ve been typing a little and waiting for her to respond so I can delete it fast. (it’s a bad habit, but she knows I do this)

but she just never responds. over the course of days/weeks, she’ll open it or leave it delivered. and when she finally responds, she’ll hardly address it, and then vent again. I know that i shouldn’t expect the same in return, and I don’t really. I enjoy talking to her, and care about her a lot. it just makes me feel shitty, which is another reason why I hold back. 

knowing her, she probably doesn’t realize it. I guess my point of venting is, should I talk to her about it? or am I just overthinking everything?",14Apr2020,1
382,"I had to store my contacts in water for a few days because I'm waiting for more cash flow. I have more contact sets but not a lot more so I dont want to throw them away if I dont have to.

Anyway a few months ago I messaged her on Instagram since we both followed each other but she just ignored it. At the time my Instagram name was some dumb meme kind of name and theres literally not a trace of me on my page so I think she may have not replied because she didn't know who I was my exact message I sent was ""Hey"" which I think was a mistake.

I have literally ZERO experience with talking to girls and I don't know if I should message her a 2nd time where I'll tell her who I am and see if she remembers me. If I'm being an idiot here please give me some advice and set me on the right path. I really like this girl but I have no confidence. The problem is that she talks to a bunch of people at my school that would constantly mock me and make my life hell if they heard I messaged her.

387,"I feel kinda sucky for actually asking for advice on here, because I really try giving it to others instead, but I do need help on this one. 

As a child, I was abused. As a result I developed strange habits to cope with anxiety. In my sleep, I used to itch my inner thighs until the skin got raw, and eventually bleed. I would also get very disassociated, in the sense that I would focus on everything *but* my feelings by over-immersing myself in video games or other activities. Because of that, I could only sleep when I became too exhausted to stay awake. If I tried to lay down and lull myself asleep, everything would come rushing back and I’d end up sobbing my eyes out or stressing obsessively about a specific thing. 

Recently, I’ve woken up to my forearms being red and raw from scratching them. I tried wearing long sleeves to reduce the behavior, but just roll them up and continue. I’ve started experiencing the sleep deprivation and nighttime thoughts. I’ve even started playing video games or watching videos consistently at all times. Even if I’m doing something that makes me unable to use my hands, I’m watching YouTube. Doing something where I can’t focus my eyes? Podcasts. It’s gotten quite ridiculous. 

I’ve also began having lots of physical effects from my problems, even though I’m not actively feeling my emotions at the moment (another dissociative episode, I believe). Whenever I get overwhelmingly angry or even excited, I start getting extremely dizzy and start to *actually* see the room slowly spin. Even when I’m driving, parked at a stop sign, I experience optical illusions that make it look like I’m rolling backwards, because the scenery seems to get farther away. I’ve also gotten nauseous at the very smell of food, and have to force myself to eat. I’ve lost a substantial amount of weight. 

Due to the pandemic, my therapist’s office is closed. I have the option of voice chat, but I don’t feel comfortable with it. I don’t want people in my household to hear me on the phone, and I feel silly speaking to a professional on the phone for some reason. I’ve been medicated for anxiety before but experienced weight gain as a side effect, which made me even more depressed. I’m also horrid at taking pills and end up missing days, which puts me even more out of whack. I really don’t want to go back on medication. 

Any advice to improve my behaviors? It’s been years, and I’ve shaken them for quite a while, but it’s all starting to happen again. And I don’t even know why.",14Apr2020,2

391,"*skip to last paragraph if you dont want to read my ""long story"" explaining my life*

Before I had gotten pregnant I used to be pretty active. I used to walk a lot, would skateboard every now and then, I was pretty small.
I had my baby in December 2019. My doctor told me I can start exercising in mid January this year. I was stoked to finally start working out and lose this belly fat but! 
How does one have the time for that? I haven't dont much since janurary besides attend to my newborn, eat, sleep, repeat! I hardly showered. I couldn't keep my eyes off of him. 
Did that until mid Feburary. I got a job. Now I work about 3-4 days out of the week.  Not a lot but for me it is. My siblings and husband when he isnt working watches over the baby. 
With that being said, hes 4 months and still takes little naps throughout the day but he does take a good several hours of sleep at night for the past 2 weeks but lately hes been staying up longer each day by an hour or so, only messing up the sleeping schedule. So now I sleep at 6am and wake up at 3pm. 
I feel uncomfortable with my body because I am not used to this. I mean we all aren't. Us moms go througth a lot mentally and physically. And I know it's okay to love your body the way it is. Nothing is ever wrong with it! But with my lifestyle it's pretty hard. I want to go back to skate boarding and hiking. So being active again is pretty important to me.

I get little hours of sleep already. I WANT to have a better diet. I WANT to workout. Go outside and walk/run do something good for my body. My question is, can I still workout and perhaps get toned or lose weight while I have little hours of sleep? Is sleep a big factor? Will I get no results in my shape when I get little sleep?

396,"Hey guys, 20F here. This is going to seem like the biggest whinge from just another drop kick millennial scrolling the web with no real life problems. 

I’ve just been feeling really lost for about a year or so. I was always that kid that every time you asked them ‘what do you want to be when you grow up?’ would always have a different answer. 

I’ve never had any serious interests or hobbies. Again, I could never stick to one sport or extra-curricular activity throughout my childhood or teen years. 

I feel like these things have really inhibited me from developing any real passions or desires in life. I work a casual job that I hate, but painstakingly slog through because I have rent (at home with my parents) and a car payment to keep up with. The car payment especially leaves me feeling too trapped to leave my job or venture other options.

The same old painstaking routine has completely drained the life out of me, and I feel half the person I used to be. Combine that with a uni degree that I’m failing (I was never the academic type) and the constant pressure from society and my relatives to be making big life advances and achievements are killing me. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I am doing psychology at uni because it’s the only thing I have a mild interest in, but even then, I’m not too keen on it. 

People always say ‘what would you be doing if money, time and experience weren’t a factor?’ as a question to help me figure out what I want to do. But honestly, even with money, time and experience were out of the equation, I still don’t know what I would even do for fun, let alone a career. 

I feel like so much time has ticked by (3years out of highschool) that I have done nothing with. My savings are disappointing, I haven’t gotten any skills under my belt even. 

I guess what I’m asking is, how the hell am I supposed to keep up with the rat race that is money making and life when I don’t even know myself? I don’t know what defines me as a person, or what i am interested in. 

I get home from my job and watch YouTube and tik tok for the rest of the night and procrastinate uni work. I make time for friends on weekends but that’s about it. 

My boyfriend and I brought a 4x4 car to do up together as a kind of ‘adventure car’ (which I really used to be excited about) but even that I dread doing. 

Basically I’m a shell of a human who is just getting by on sarcasm and self-deprecating humour. 

If any of you have been through something similar, how do you figure out what you want to do, or even what hobbies you enjoy?",14Apr2020,1

399,"My sister is getting to the age where she refuses to go school and creates consistent arguments with our mother. Sometimes resulting in physical violence.

I don't live at home anymore but I keep getting very long WhatsApp messages from our mother and a social worker called me to say she can't reach my sister and if this keeps going, court is going to take action (I dont know what that means).

My sister refuses to talk to anyone and basically shuts herself in her room with her phone 24/7. She came over last weekend to ""have a talk"" and it just resulted in avoiding the situation or blaming everything on the mother. She's basically refusing therapy and with the current Corona crisis it's practically impossible to ""see someone"". She actually started seeing someone a few weeks before the pandemic, but that got shut down now basically.

Our mother isn't the greatest or the sanest person but she's not the devil. She has some deep issues herself that she refuses to acknowledge and has scarred me mentally quite a bit. Nevertheless she's not an alcoholic or aggressive. Just a single mom ""karen"" type of woman.

Now I'm trying to stay best friends with my sister but I also try to stay firm and make sure she's doing everything possible to make the best of a bad situation but she's very stubborn and not open to input.

This whole Corona crisis has given her the chance for remote school work without the burden of social anxiety, but she hasn't done any of it. And on top of that they're locked in with each other and driving each other up the walls.

Well, when I was having the talk with her it all felt sort of ominous. Like we were having this talk but I never expected her to actually come to me for advice or help. Maybe its because I have a hard time asking for help, so I just assumed she would be the same way. ANYWHO. 

Yesterday she asked me for a condom. I panicked and asked when she would need it by (like a deadline). I don’t think she’s ready but I don’t think I have any pull on the decision either. My boyfriend was also very shocked (he is as close to her as I am) but he suggested I take her to the store so she can buy them for herself. My only problem with this suggestion is I don’t want to associate a weird feeling of guilt and shame that I know can come with buying condoms to her specific experience. I don’t want safe sex to make her feel weird, if that makes sense. 

I also don’t wanna go just buy her a box of condoms and let her have a free-for-all. I’m only 22 and shes my only sibling so I have never dealt with this. Any advice on what to do or how to do it???

409,"Hey there, gonna try to keep this short and vague.

I have a friend I've known for eight years now. Suffice to say I know enough about him to understand I am being mistreated. About two years ago when I got my first job is when things have become bumpy (odd thing to mention but I'll explain later). I feel like he does not respect my time, whereas I always try to be considerate with him. I give warning in advance if I'm late or if I can't attend an event or gathering of some kind. 

He's the exact opposite and in fact when he needs to wait for me longer than 5 minutes, he tends to become agitated and gives me attitude. You'd think this would be different with all of us staying at home because of corona virus. It's not. To clarify, he takes too long in the most menial tasks and I feel like it's deliberate. Just like I feel like it's deliberate to show up 1 hour before I go to bed and make no mention where you've been all this time. This is something my other friends and I always talk about. ""Hey yeah, where you've been? How do you do?"" I get none of that here.

Furthermore, because we live in a poor area, me landing a decent job has had an impact on our relationship. I thought it'd only be an improvement because I knew I could afford for myself and my friends certain things we'd enjoy in our outings. I'd be able to provide birthday gifts that they deserve and I've been doing that because I like giving to my friends.

However in our latest conversations I've had the odd realisation he shows signs of jealously, usually through small insignificant things. As an example I'll say  - I have a better phone, to me it's just a phone. I don't care. I'd give it to him if he asked for it. 

What's worse I feel like my success has brought adversity from him, where he won't even hide his agitation at times.

414,"Bit of background, I adopted her about a year ago. I started out by giving her only wet food everyday. I still lived with my family at the time so I had the extra money to spend on her. This lasted several months. Since I've moved out (and especially now with being laid off) I simply dont have the money to keep this up for her. I've been giving her dry food with the wet food since I moved out, and she does eat the dry food once the wet is all gone. That was great, already saved some money instead of a full wet food diet. Now I dont even have the money to give her the one can a day. I've been trying to balance it out for her. I tried giving her wet food every other day, but all I get is her meowing constantly and running to her bowl on days without wet food. I know its her telling me she wants the wet food. I tried taking it out of her diet completely, ""no more wet food at all"" I told her, but it resulted in the same thing. She kept constantly meowing and going to the dry food, looking at me, nonstop for weeks. She'll eat the dry food eventually, but it's not without constant screaming on her part. And I feel bad. I want her to be happy, but I have no choice.
Its not the dry food that's the problem, I tried a couple different brands and flavors and the one she has now is one she likes. She'll eat the dry food happily AFTER she had a can of wet food for the day. Its the switching to ONLY dry food that's the problem. I'm at my wits end and not sure what else to do.

416,"I was friends with this person for about a year online. I always thought he was a great writer and a smart guy. I never fully trusted him but he seemed like he was an honest person. As time has gone by I’ve been noticing little things here and there that were raising red flags for me. I was already starting to get the feeling that the majority of things he has told me about himself were lies and he was just trying to make himself bigger than he really is. He does have a lot of behavioral issues due to alcohol abuse and bad things that happened possibly in childhood. He is refusing to address them so I know that’s what’s fueling all this. A while back he confirmed to me he was a liar. He posted two very professional looking portraits on his Facebook profile and claimed he had been working on them for like a year or two. This was odd to me as he had never even mentioned to me that he liked to draw or had any interest in art. So I saved one of the images and did a reverse image search. Sure enough it turns out that image was created by another person and it was printed on some cards in 2016. The other image he claimed was his literally had the artists name and watermark on it and someone else called that out. When I mentioned the one I searched he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about even though I sent him screen shots showing his post and the google search results I found. He ended up deleting it later. All that being said, all this has made me realize he could be lying about everything he’s ever done. He claims writing is his passion and how he expresses himself well. He normally posts a lot of long posts about politics or posts poetry he claims he wrote. I recently started copying parts of the text from his posts and pasting into google and sure enough more often than not he’s using other people’s writing and claiming he wrote it. I know it’s normal on social media to share famous quotes or other people’s art but most give credit to the authors/artists. He is literally saying in his posts that he wrote it. Most recently he posted a poem that he said he wrote a while back and didn’t know why he made the poem but it fits for whatever he was talking about. But when I googled it it was a quote from something Audrey Hepburn wrote. I had Unfriended and blocked him on everything recently because he has been lying and manipulating and when I finally confronted him about it he tried to make it seem like I had the problem and I wasn’t acting right. After days of not talking to him he finally contacted me on the one app I left him unblocked on for the purpose of having evidence in case he lost it. After some time he finally apologized and said he didn’t want to lose the friendship. I told him I needed time. So tonight I was contemplating things, maybe at least unblocking him from Facebook but before I did I used my alt account to check his profile and that’s when I saw that Audrey Hepburn post that he is claiming is his writing. He’s a damn liar and I am honestly disgusted at all the work he is stealing to claim as his own for whatever reason. I am not sure what to do at this point. I know the plagiarism line is kind of blurred when it comes to social media and I still have him Unfriended and blocked so it’s not like I can say anything on his posts.

i was in an abusive relationship three years ago. i was emotionally abused and manipulated for almost seven months. it was the worst seven months of my life. 

i wouldn't wish that on someone. i don't want that relationship to define me. 

i don't want to be that. 

how do i stop?",14Apr2020,1
419,"I need advice BAD. More like a plan. My boyfriend and I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend because she needed help with my special needs neice. My sister started a new job requiring her to be away from home 14-16 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Her relationship was on the rocks and she didn't trust leaving my niece in the care of her father so I agreed to nanny my niece 14-15 hours a day, 5-6 days a week for room and board (my bf works full time so I wasn't worried about money considering our rent and other household bills were taken care of) That ended when my sister changed jobs. 
      We agreed that we will simply rent the room monthly and stay living together. (There were no jobs in my field locally and employers I guess didn't like the year gap in employment so I struggled finding a job so that was the most cost efficient plan.) WELL. A year later, I DO have a job, the boyfriend/baby dad was kicked out, sister started 'partying' a lot and made some scummy friends. 
    In the last two months, these friends are at our home 24/7. Three specifically. But about 7-8 other random people float in and out. It's pretty much turned into a flop house. We literally installed dead bolts on our bedroom door so stuff doesn't get stolen. There is NO RESPECT for us. We are the ONLY ones paying rent to my sister. I have brought up many different issues with these junkies to her and I get told that I'm just renting a room and it's HER HOUSE. We are talking loud music till 7-8am if it stops at all and random people in and out all night. 
    My niece is in the care of friends (Child services got involved because her kids father called and made a report because he saw how she is living). I know the obvious thing to do would be to move. With the current state we are all in, that's not really an option. We don't have any family locally either. My bf wants to threaten to not pay rent in order to 'scare' her into kicking these people all out and getting her life back on track.
     She is starting to get drug tested through child services (they were just called two weeks ago) so she isn't doing drugs.. She is still drinking heavily because they aren't testing her for that. So she's still not thinking straight. I told her she needs to tell her friends to kick rocks if she wants her daughter back home because it's not a good/safe environment until they are gone. She agrees BUT says she will kick them out AFTER her daughter comes back to make it safe for her. After many arguements, she says she let's them stay here because she is bored. She gets paid to be her own daughter's CNA (through the state, for therapy she needs) and my niece gets a disability check so she has a decent income to just... Stay home.
      My bf has COPD. I BEGGED her to limit the people coming through because he might DIE if he gets this virus. No change at ALL. What do I do??? I literally pay monthly to live in a trap house and put a roof over these scum bag's heads. I can use the stimulus check to move out but fear failing to get more hours or a second job to help pay for our own place until this pandemic improves. Then I would have to crawl back! Need. Advice. Please.
       Also, we HAVE threatened to move out and she laughs it off saying to go and she doesn't need our money. When she and I argue, no matter what the subject (it could be over who ate the last slice of pizza), she tells me to GTFO. Then doesn't even remember the next day or pretends it didn't happen.",14Apr2020,1
420,"I share a bathroom with him and he smokes in there every day. My family members have talked about it to him several times but he doesn't listen. I'm afraid to talk to him directly. But tomorrow I'm going up to him myself for the first time. After so many years of secondhand smoke exposure, I've had enough. I won't tell him to quit directly but maybe convince him to smoke outside, slowly reduce consumption, use nicotine patches, then gradually quit.

424,"My dad's been telling me ""You need to get a girlfriend"" or ""what's wrong with you?"". I'm 20 years old, I'm not a virgin, but I'm not an incel either. 

His statement haunted me the other day. He said ""everybody in this house is in a relationship except you"" (I live in a house of 9 family members). And sadly, that is true. Then he brags about how many girls he banged in his younger days.

Having a body count isn't in my priorities right now. I have 2 jobs I have to look for, money to save, depression I have to get rid of, weight to lose, a grandma to take care of, and a lot of stress waiting.

428,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a 16-year-old nearly 17-year-old guy and I’ve been just noticing how unsatisfied and irritated on how my life’s been going. 

There’s a lot to say so I’ll try to sum it up but it may end up pretty long so bare with me lol as it's some feelings I had for a while and recently. 

To start I’ve really for the last 3-4 years now been having an unhealthy lifestyle. I’ve been in my room on my computer for most of my day. For the last 2 years or so it’s been really progressively worse. Especially recently from all the coronavirus things going on. I really only got out for school and now I can’t really do much. I fear for this sort of lifestyle after Senior year although I do plan on going to college so maybe I won't be too bad in that. 

I can’t really stop my addiction on the computer either as most my friends in real life are online and I feel as if I stop I sort of miss out on a lot, and I don't really even know what to do for my spare time. This isn’t to say I don’t go out much or at all. I do hang out with my friends from time to time outside actively I’d say once every 2 months or so and I do go out every once and a while on the weekend with my family. But with my friend's relation being good, I feel my family’s relationship is going down.

See, I love my parents and my older brother they take great care of me and I love them. However, I don’t know if it’s just me being a teenager, or just how anti-social I kind of become from my addiction to electronics, or both at the same time, but I feel I’ve sort of fallen out of touch with them. Sometimes I would talk to them and there would be conversation but other times being most times, it’s the same response both ways of “hows school” “how’s work” “did you eat” etc or just some awkward talking. I’d try to start conversations too at times and they would too but it just sometimes ends in silence of one-word answers. 

The thing is also they still view me as a little kid in still calling me nicknames I joked around with when I was like 12 while sort of giving me a baby/kid tone when I talk to them which makes it a bit difficult to really interact. This is also much different from me talking to my friends and a bit of my older brother where I’m much more social and much more I’d say open and more true to self. 

I don’t know if I’m like trying to hide my true self from my parents where I’m just a typical teen near-adult who is just starting to know the world and progressing my personality vs I think of them just seeing me as their 12-year-old boy. There’s just sort of a disconnect between both me and them.  I really want to establish to them that I’m growing up and being more adult and independent but I don't want to really say it in a mean way/break their spirits of who I am and not their 12-year-old boy if that makes sense. I want to just talk to them where I can be open, adultly, and true to self, while also having just conversations with them without it being just awkward or they see me as their young kid if that makes sense from what I said. 

I also though just feel bad that I’ve been for the most part cooped in my room for a couple years and have been really not been active as a teen should be. I feel I’m sort of a bad son for letting them on a bit that I am just their 12-year-old kid who responds to their silly nicknames and stays in my room not really being social or true to self to anyone except my friends online and at school. 

Along with that, most of my friends are learning how to drive and are starting to be active while I’m just sort of stuck. I’m having struggles learning to drive and I’m feeling just now irritated at how my life’s going as I'm just being left behind. 

I can’t get the hang of driving, everyone in school and my friend group are getting jobs, getting their license, being active,  while I’m sort of stuck, I feel I sort of wasted my life on my stupid computer, I have strange relations with my parents with awkward conversations and where I believe they see me as a young child when I’m a teen near-adult. 

I don’t feel depressed or anything like that but I just feel sort of trapped and irritated at how my life has been and how it’s turned up how. I love my family and friends but I just want things to get better for me and to just find a balance of everything. I plan on talking to my parents about this but I don’t really know how to approach it or what to say. I just need advice on all my different situations I kind of said of what I’ve been feeling and if anyone can help. 

Thank you for reading it all if you did and if you need any more information or clarification on things let me know as I kind of rambled on and just wanted to get all my feelings out there :)

Also if this is the wrong subreddit to post something like this I’d appreciate a redirection to where I should post this. 

Sorry for the long post and for all my repeated sentences and rambling, but thank you again if you read it all. I'll be sure to respond to comments and leave updates!",14Apr2020,1

I hope it helps considering these are just the video titles and the videos itself will (hopefully) have much more depth. Now I'm hoping that I'll be able to do decent videos, and I'm hoping there's someone out there who has actually a good idea for a name. Because i did not. I only had two ideas which are

1. OPINIONATE

and

2. ShitTalk

431,So about a year ago I sold AirPods to a friend for 40 € (they were worth about 100 € at that time). Now he bought AirPods Pro and tries to sell the old ones for 60 - 80 €. I approached him and told him that it is kind of weird in my eyes if he still makes a profit out of it. He said it is weird that I would rather give a bargain to a stranger than let him have a profitable deal. Is he right?,14Apr2020,1
432,"Hey guys,

I feel I'm the bad guy in this story, and to start with, I really do feel horrible with all that, I'm just torn. 

So, back in 2018, I got with a guy,let's call him A, I had known shortly before, it was completely unexpected, we haven't really flirted (well, later he confessed he had a crush on me before) it just happened. I spent about a month with him in my city (he's from a different country) I was super happy and on cloud nine. 
He's very sweet, very intelligent and basically my dream man. Also, he's really intellectually stimulating and inspires me a lot. 
But, after that month, a day before my birthday, he decided he's back on tour, basically his lifestyle is travelling around the world, so I respected that, of course, I was really sad, but what can you do. 
We continued with our relationship, we got on together like a house on fire. After about three months, I got a little disheartened with the waiting, he was supposed to come back after 6 months, but it felt so long, he also mentioned staying away for a little longer. After I told him I just feel bad with it and want to find some solution, he immediately went on with a long ass message that he agrees that we should end the relationship, which was not at all something I meant. 
But on his end it was already decided, so after a few harsher messages we settled that were through. 
We still kept contact, although it was dry and very scarce. 
I'm sure he didn't cheat on me. 
I was really heartbroken, couldn't get myself together, missed him all the time. 
Then, about 4 months later, I met with my friends, some of them I hadn't seen for a long time. There was the guy that I have met, we'll call him B, but didn't really talk to, we spent the party together, he was a little flirty. After a few days, he invited me to his friend's  birthday as a plus one, said he got flaked and didn't have anyone to go with. 
So I went, we got quite drunk and hooked up. I found him quite attractive, but not really my thing, also, he is younger, which I'm not really fond of. After the hookup tho, I kinda felt we're like, together, so we went out a few times, then I told him I'm not sure I want to continue, cause I'm still not over my ex and don't really want a relationship now. He also has some characteristics that put me off, for example being very pragmatic and not the brightest. 
He started to insist we try, he was very stubborn. So I kinda rolled, not a good move, I know. 
A month passed, during which I was trying to find excuses to break up with him. 
Don't get me wrong, he is really lovely, I just had A on my mind, even if we did not talk nearly at all during that time. 
Then, after I have encountered some serious problems, B proved himself to be the sweetest, the most caring and emphatetic guy you could think of. 
He didn't really inspire me, but I felt good with him, I liked spending time together. 
So, we have been a couple for nearly 10 months now, I love him, he's great and I think it would really hurt him if I left. 
We do have very different ideas about the future though - he wants to settle, have children and work as a physical worker, while I want no children ever, get my education and travel. 
About two months ago, my ex, A, texted me saying he missed me and hadn't stopped loving me.
I was happy, but didn't get excited, I thought by then I  had lost all the feelings I had had for him. 
We started talking, still do, but I messaged him that I don't think it would ever work, so let's just stay friendly. 
He said ok, but now I see he's being overly friendly, a little flirting, nothing obvious though. 
Now, I might be developing a little feelings again, cause I feel he's my soul mate, the problem is, if I leave B for him, I will hurt him real bad, and I don't know if the rebound with A will work, at the same time I haven't told A that I have a boyfriend, I'm worried that if I do, I will lose him, and I still love to have him in my life as a friend, but I don't want to lead him on. 
I have no idea what to do now, I would be really grateful for any insight really. 

Thank you for reading that hell of a long ramble :')",14Apr2020,0

437,"Hi all. I am facing this issue since a few years, my underpants start getting brown at the crotch area with time and in half a year or so they look like the insides were originally brown. All of my underwear have this stain, some have less some have more. Machine wash does not help and I have not tried scrubbing. Googled this and no solutions either, so I threw away many underwears in the last couple of years. What could this be and how can I wash it off?

Info: I’m a male and I do not masturbate, so sometimes I have very little cum on the tip of my foreskin. Could this be cum stains? I clean my butt thoroughly with water so this is NOT poop stain.",14Apr2020,2
438,"I have always been a very touchy person, but I stopped at some point a while ago. 
I have my husband and a kind of friend a work i get along with. Frequent socializing with both if them plus the little time here and there with other acquaintances were good enough for me, but I always felt that i needed more friendships. I guess I was a little lonely. 

Now with this whole pandemic, shifts have been segregated and changed. I see my husband less and my work buddy not at all. I work with this other person who serves as a bit of an outlet, but lately I feel off.

I am starting to feel really lonely, and i am afraid a little depressed too. Lately, I've been havingthis massive urge to just surround myself with people and cuddle with them. I think that touchiness is coming back.

It's making me feel apathetic and unmotivated about things i have to do. What do you all advise?",14Apr2020,2

There was a time when I had no physical imperfections nor a questionable resume. I missed the train and it's gone. I had no wrinkles, no grey hair, no haemorrhoids, no blotch on a leg due to circulatory issues, no floppy skin. And I had a future ahead of me. No results? You're young yet. Done nothing? You're brilliant, you'll do something awesome.

And... I didn't date. I desperately want to have the experience of feeling confident in my perfect physical attributes, the way I did back than, and go out clubbing, dating, feeling desired, finding a very good looking partner with brilliant prospects. Basically someone who understand the importance of aesthetic beauty (think pottery or textile or jewels), and athleticism (think warriors) and elegance as a way of life (think fragrances).

Now it's all gone. I wasted that time of life that comes only once, and now it's just a long slow decline an then we will not get a second chance. I'm crying so hard. It's not fair, it was not my fault. Why I have to pretend to depreciate that qualities just because I can't have them? I've missed out on life and things that mattered, and the person I was is gone. I don't want what else is left available, I want that experience. How can I stop suffering so much?",14Apr2020,1
440,"So before i start i just want you to keep it in mind that out of my sight she really is a great person, but obviously the problem lies in the bad stuff so most of the things might be negative that i might say.

L(the girl its all about)

Here it goes:

Beginning:

We met through a mutual friend and we knew each other before but never hanged out much. We kept hanging out with our friend which slowly turned to also hanging out just the 2 of us. We started talking and she opened up to me told me about everything that is going on in her life and well after about 2 Hours of driving and listening to her and seeing that she is about to cry i noticed she never had somebody who is always there for her. I PROMISED that i will be that person and she can always count on me. Life goes on we hit it off pretty good, go to clubs and bars. Chill at her place just the two of us or the three of us. I started getting physical and grabbed her on my lap or when we slept over at her i would always keep her in my arms and stuff like that. And she was ok with it since she trusts me and knows my morals. For context, she is really attractive but i never got aroused or whatever i dont know why but may be relevant. 

Turning point:

I dont know when it happend but i just kept noticing i care too much about her. And i just enjoy being with her and always love talking, cuddling and laughing with her and thats where i noticed i got feelings for her. So i confess to her. She gives me props for it but sadly it is the wrong time she says and also im not her kind of type. I break contact for a day. I couldnt last longer but we meet again and surprisingly its not awkward between us. I talk with her why she rejected me since i always want to better myself. Out of my perspective the ""not my type"" point was really short and she told me its not my physical appearence or my character, its just that she didnt catch feelings. And she tried to drive the its just bad timing point since she was freshly out of a relationship. I just swallow it and say i respect it and will still be there for her since i cant blame her for not catching feelings. Life goes on and i try to be a good friend for her. For example at a club a friend of her, was trying i guess to hook up with me or whatever. Her friend was getting physical with me even though she only knew me for like an hour but i didnt push forward because i only had eyes for L. I noticed some guy was getting her drunk so i go over and ask her ""Do you like him?"", she says ""no, but i wont deny a drink"", i intervene and keep her really close to me and the guy eventually gets the hint and leaves her alone. She is really drunk i tell her friends i will walk her home, which is about a hour long walk. We walk and well she is drunk there is nothing to say about it. We arrive at her place, i lay her in bed and she asks me if i can wait until she falls asleep. I agree and cuddle next to her. About 30 mins later she falls asleep and i leave of course. (Nothing happend that night)

Last straw(Sunday 12.04.2020):

L was meeting her dad on the weekend so we met on sunday when she returned. I was pissed at her but we wrote on Whatsapp and cleared it up. But i still wanted more anwsers. I pick her up and drive her to a mountain which has a nice view over the city. And we start talking. And here shit hits the fan. I heard from a friend that she got Tinder. I ask her why because she said she doesnt want other guys. She says i misunderstood, she still wants to get laid atleast. I say i understand that because of the natural sexual drive but i am hurt and will be definitely heart broken if it happens with some guy. Somehow it shifts to us two and that we cant bang or whatever because im hard coded as her best friend in her brain and she doesnt want to hurt my feelings because i want more than just sex. So she asks the crucial question, can i be there for her if she bangs some random guy. I think real hard and say ""no"" i cant do that for you, we will have to break contact. I see it in her eyes, i shattered her heart. L says ""Everybody promises me something, and always breaks it"". She opens the door, and wants to walk home. I click and run after her. She is crying. I tell her whatever happens will happen, but i wont leave you. I tell her that she is too important for me. And if i get hurt of whatever she does, ill survive it but i will never leave her. We drive to her place, i stay the night, we cuddle the whole night and watch a horror movie. 

Our Relationship to each other:

I told her a day after the last straw, that we pretty much are just like in a relationship. We do stuff that normal friends wouldnt do and the only thing pretty much missing is the sex and kissing. She agrees, we dont continue on that topic. 

NOW: What the fuck should i do. I cant leave her, she is way too important for me and i care about her deeply and so does she for me. Corona fucks my shit up, i cant distract myself through clubs or other girls. So im stuck and dont know how to proceed.

Legal Notice:

L is 17 and will turn 18 soon and i am 21. We are in Germany. Everything is perfectly legal here and no we never had sex or any intimate contact.",14Apr2020,1
442,"Hello I'm a 13 year old girl and my little brother who is 12 has been getting super angry and acting very irrationally. For example we were playing cards one night as a family and he kept losing so he wasn't having the best time. He arranges and plays his cards at a really slow pace at least compared to my mum and me so sometimes we would ask him to hurry up a bit as we would just sit there waiting for 3 min as he decides which card to play. 

Recently though these nights when we play he gets really really angry about really small things and then would proceed to quit in the middle of the game run to his room and slam his door as hard as he can. These days he rarely has his door open and is almost always locked. I don't know if he has many friends but he never seems to play or talk to any online so he always bugs me to play games with him. Obviously I can't always say yes because I would be busy in the middle of doing something. He also doesn't really eat at all. Except every night at around 12 am he eats his ""meal"". I think he doesn't eat food during the day because he can't and doesn't like to cook and when My mum or I cook he always thinks that it's not good enough for him. 

His attitude and behaviour is the polar opposite of mine. The thing is my parents unintentionally spoils him a lot. Before when his behaviour was worse my dad used to drive him to Maccas when he wouldn't eat fostering his bad behaviour he also never gets scolded when he screams or throws things at me. Example, one day I was just really not feeling it and was very irritated already from school so when I got home and he immediately does or says something rude to me I replied with an insult making him angry yet again. I don't know what's wrong with my brother so it would mean a lot if you could help. Thanks! ",14Apr2020,1
445,"im 17(f) and my parents mom(43) dad(45) have been married for 20 years.  they are like every other couple and have fought about everything since i was a child.  initially we were very close with our neighbours as they were a couple ( around same age as my parents) and have a 10 year old daughter and we clicked. but for the past year or so they stopped  talking to us and whenever i used to run into them its used to be very awkward especially with the wife. i also started noticing that my mom is always on her phone now and she keeps giggling and smiling at it. when i tried to look at what she's doing she tried to hide or rushed to the washroom every time . today  i sneaked around her phone(not my proudest moment)  and saw her texts with him, the neighbour. she referred to him as sexy and was talking shit about my dad. there were many other things that were highly disturbing for me knowing that he has a whole family and so does my mom.  my dad though isn't a perfect man does not deserve this. what can i do they have been texting for almost a year now?

448,"Hi, never done this before. 

I'm a mature student at university and as such realistically only have this as my last attempt to finish, currently in my second year about to move on to my third with exams starting in the next fortnight.

My issue is that (rather niavely) I had a fling with a housemate that admittedly did not end well (I know the rule, dont **** where you eat, I'm human) one way or another, it led to bitter resentment from her side that despite my best efforts led to her moving out. 

Now this would all be pretty much resolved if, Coronavirus hadn't hit, as now, all other housemates have moved out to be with families and I cannot due to protecting my own family (and a complete lack of wifi if i did) 

The housemate in question has the wifi contract under her name, it's not transferable. Now despite me offering to cover it fully financially and explaining how important it is (my university has moved everything, including exams, online) she is now cancelling the wifi.

She knows full well that retakes arent an option for me and the full extent of what she is doing.

 What can I do?
And if she does this, is there any action (legal) I can take against her? 

Thanks",14Apr2020,1
449,It really upsets me that my boyfriend keeps lying to me about masturbating. The beginning of our relationship like the first 6 months he wanted me every single day and even told that he’d masturbate every day before meeting me but now he never does and I believed that but then after those first 6 months he started wanting sex less and less so I started to wonder why but he would say he’s more tired now and he’d even get mad at me for even asking for sex he would even claim that he never even had sex with me everyday and he never would masturbate everyday either so he was straight up lying to me hoping I would just forget about it and believe him anyways I kept finding porn on his phone and every time he’d be like I only watch it every once in a while and I’ll stop now never do it again. Basically I do not care if he wants to masturbate I just don’t want to be lied to and told that he doesn’t do it and I want him to straight up communicate with me why he doesn’t want sex hardly ever. I’m pretty sure he just doesn’t want to tell me hey I got bored of having sex and would rather masturbate. He thinks it’ll make me mad and avoids conflict at all costs that’s how he is. But it makes me more mad being lied to. Should I just leave him? Or is this a normal thing for guys to lie about. Idc if he wants to masturbate but I do wish he wanted to have sex with me more unfortunately I think he just prefers masturbation over me idk what to do,14Apr2020,0
450,"So basically this guy hits up my girlfriend and she sent him picture of her butt way before I was with her, anyways she keeps this guy on Snapchat and stuff and he just always hits her up asking for nudes ( to me it’s suspicious she didn’t block him when we got together but whatever) he hits her up and she tells
Me about it so i wouldn’t get upset and I get made and say jsut ignore him stop communicating with this guy, so I message him asking if he knows Amerie and to stop hitting him up ( she told me she was freaked out by him and stuff) and he’s like who’s Amerie and what not and I then I call her buy her nickname ammie and he goes oh that’s my home girl, Anyways me and the creepy guy go at it and he goes I’ve seen your girls nudes and I can already mad text my girlfriend being like wtf. She immediately texts him asking for the pics and saying where are my nudes then and when did I send you nudes and you’re so tough where are my nudes then and tells the guy she’s been with me since September ( I’m like okay whatever she didn’t send him anything because she clearly stood up for herself and wouldn’t risk doing that had she sent anything) when my girlfriend is chewing him out he just avoids answering her and says he’s not dumb and that her auntie loves him and basically being a twat.

Cut to sometime later and I can’t stop thinking about and I message him and tells she was wearing white panties ( as far as i know she’s doesn’t own white panties), he says she was doing a certain pose and he says she sent it conveniently between September 9th to the 16th ( we got together on the 9th) I call his bluff saying I was over for those days and he retracts the statement and I don’t actually believe he knew we got together in September until she said that 

This causes huge term oil in the relationship and I keep messaging this guy and i keep finding into it and my gf somehow stayed with me.

It gets too the point where I say to this guy I’ll give you whatever you want if you tell me the truth and he immediately says it wasn’t when you guys we’re together and I thought you were her ex the whole time and shit like that and whatnot trying to get whatever I was gonna give him.  I also sent him a random picture of a girl of nsfw subreddit and he was like yeah that’s the one she sent me and when I asked again he was like it was one of them.

When I messaged him a final time he just said he didn’t know if we were together or not.  My girlfriend posted stuff on social media about him calling him out again saying it’s pathetic that he saying he got nudes from her and another time when i was with her this guy was doing a live video and she went on it and I was making fun of him and she was like do you remember me and shit, he would always say shit to me but when my girlfriend called him out he would barely say shit to her. 

It was good for awhile and now I’m like having a Vietnam flashback and now my girlfriend was like I’d do a lie detector test to prove to you nothing happened 

Maybe I’m being dumb or naive or something, she has a history of cheating in the past but she was younger then and those guys used her and treated her like shit so I can get over that, sorry if that story made no sense but I tried to put everything in order",14Apr2020,1
451,"I went away to college out East this fall and in turn I broke up with my boyfriend. It was really hard, and we were very happy until I moved away but our relationship wasn’t very long prior. Magical but not long. Moving away caused a lot of problems with trust and we ended up breaking up through a long dismal process and after the whole trial of breaking up, writing letters to each other back and forth, we have cut all contact. No one ever got closure and we never talked about why we stopped talking it just happened. I didn’t talk to him over Thanksgiving because I was scared and didn’t want to break down. Same with Christmas break really. A big problem we had was this because of this girl name Katie. Katie has played my ex a lot but they’ve always been friends. During our time together she had a boyfriend and would still text him and drive by his house. He was loyal. When we broke up I couldn’t help but think it was because of her as she constantly texts him all the time. He ignored her throughout our whole relationship, but after we cut ties they have talked. She has a boyfriend but my ex and her have cheated with each other at least 2 times. He won’t date her and hates that he likes her and tries to ignore her so she keeps her other boyfriend around. Complicated mess if you ask me. 
Now that I’m home from college because of COVID-19 I can’t stop thinking about him and all of our memories together. I have too much time to think and home reminds me of the summer I spent with him before I left for school. I know I shouldn’t miss him, as his actions are a reflection of his character; a character that I know I do not deserve. It’s just very sad because he was the funniest, thoughtful, nice, selfless person when we were together and I’m not sure if I brought out the best in him (I’m not trying to make myself sound amazing or anything) and his true colors are showing or if he’s just changed and it’s hard.

But the question remains: what is the ""minimum"" that I have to do to feel like I've done what I can to make the lives of others better?

460,"My (17m) apprenticeship is a 9-5 job monday-friday. It is a customer service apprenticeship and it is in a windscreen company. Recently because of the coronavirus I have been working from home. The coronavirus has affected the company that I work for massively and has placed 50% of the employees on furlough leave because of it. Unfortunately I wasn't offered furlough leave because I am an apprentice and I am on a training program, I believe that is not the real reason why I wasn't offered furlough. I am on half the wage of a regular employee but I have been working for longer than lots of them. The job is really easy but it is really repetitive and boring. Also i don't enjoy working from home because I am sat at home in my dark room, away from everybody else.

I usually have half a day on course work on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursdays but recently because of the lack of employees they have been taking me off of course work to take calls for customers. This has became a repetitive thing in the past few weeks because of the coronavirus. The course work recently has become much easier and faster to complete because they are running out of things to set us. My manager (who is great) is keeping a tally of how many hours we lose on course work so that we can get those hours back but they said that in november/December and we haven't been given our course work time from back then.

There are 6 other apprentices 2 of them have been offered furlough leave because they can't work from home. 1 doesn't have a computer and the others broadband won't allow him to take calls. So I was thinking that I could do something similar because I am getting paid next to nothing and most employees are getting more money than me when they are on furlough leave. The company also decided last week that they were going to ask employees if the want to have 20% of their wage cut so that the company has more money and can stay open. I couldn't get 20% of my wage taken off of me because that would put me on less than minimum wage.

What should I do. Should I keep on working even though I'm getting used for cheap work or lie and unplug my psu from my computer so that hopefully they are forced to give me furlough leave. Any suggestions are helpful",14Apr2020,1

462,"Ok, a bit of backstory...

I live in a large boarding house on the outskirts of a major metropolitan city. The house itself was once an old mansion (built sometime in the 1840’s), and underwent several renovations, but definitely kept its charm. It’s been my home for the last two years, and the current owner (our landlord who lives in the basement level) couldn’t be more accommodating and gracious (especially in these times).
The house contains five full rooms, three of which are currently vacant. I live on the third floor. 
I am considered essential, but decided to use my vacation time to quarantine myself along with the rest of the house. We are blessed to have balconies where we can still chat with neighbors, place orders with our grocery runners, and enjoy the sunsets..etc. 
Quarantine wasn’t too terribly bad until I shared some drinks with my fellow tenant on the second floor last Saturday, wherein he decided to share some things with me that now has me considering ratting him out to our landlord. He and I have always been friendly, but not very close. Quarantine has naturally led us to spending a good deal of time together, and boozing has become one of our favorite pastimes. 

Anyway....

Plain and simple, he takes shits in the shower, and “mulches” his turds with a contraption he made resembling a Rubbermaid salad-spinner, to which he fitted a toilet seat. He shits in it, turns the “crank” until his shit is liquified, then he sends it down the drain. 
He did not demonstrate the device, but explained its workings clearly enough.

I didn’t discover the “mulcher”, he showed it to me when we were in his room having drinks. I’d asked about the various spare materials he had laying around, and if he was pursuing a project of some kind..etc 
This was when he led me to the bathroom and showed me his turd-chipper. 
Yes, he was drunk. We both were. 
He just flat out told me that he enjoyed shitting while in a hot shower, so he built the device. I laughed, played it off, and even jokingly said that he could market and sell them.

I mean, he’s a good guy, and I’m glad for the company these days, but now whenever I hear his shower running, I think he’s taking a shit, chopping it up, and sending it down the tub drain! It’s just weird! 

Do I tell the landlord, or do I keep my mouth shut??
We’re in quarantine together, so I don’t want to make an enemy of him, but the tub drain isn’t where poop is supposed to go.",14Apr2020,2

But on the other hand, I worry theyll take me signing up as a red flag that I dont care about my job so I feel like I should wait for the mandatory stages (in which I feel like they will still furlough me because the company will run fine without me being there, I'm not testing CV19 samples).

She has this dominant way of speaking, which makes me feel like I'm her intern. I've just shrugged this off in the past, thinking that's just her character.

We separated our tasks mostly, but we are both responsible for everything that is done. She is weirdly defensive about her tasks, when I suggest doing something differently.

The job I found paid more than the market and was more than I had expected so I took it , it turns out everyone on staff is amazing except for the company's owner . He is one of the worst people I've ever met . 

What he does is pressure his employees more and more everyday with extra responsibilities until they snap , when they do he lays off of them for a week or so and then starts again . Working at this job has been a wild ride of depression and anxiety every day and mini heart attacks when he calls me to yell at some trivial thing for half an hour like the asshole he is . Every employee is working as much as 4 or 5 people at the expense of their mental and physical health and their personal time , when I was working I was working 12 hours a day 6 days a week and not answering your work phone even outside of working hours is banned at the company and he will punish you if you're not available to talk all the time at his convenience. 

The actual place of the work is a series of villages about 90 minutes away by car and I can't move because I'm living with my parents so I can't leave them and I can't really support myself and live alone at the same time . 

At the beginning of the pandemic he gave an open vacation without pay to half the management and I was one of them but now my direct boss is telling me to go back to work because they need me and because I need money . 

The problem is he if I come back he will order me to move to one of the villages since partial quarantine means I can only work for about 3 hours a day when subtracting my commute , but living at them is absolutely hell getting a furnished apartment is really expensive and they're usually in a bad state and very dirty . And getting an unfinished apartment and buying furniture is going to doom my savings into hell and it guarantees that I will almost never be able to look or find another opportunity and I will be stuck there . And if 24 quarantine starts I will be stuck there until the pandemic is over (by all expectations 3 or 4 months) . 

So even though going back to work is the obvious choice here since I'm lucky to even hold a job right now the amount of anxiety I'm feeling every time I think about going back and thinking about moving away and leaving my elderly parents alone is not making the decision any easier .

What should I do , shouls I go back and potentially lose all my savings since he will not give me a penny to relocate or should I stay and ride out this pandemic without pay and then go back if he will take me back ?",14Apr2020,1
476,"I (21F) have hated my father since he left my mum and I when I was 4. He had multiple affairs and was abusive up until the point he left and then continued to be verbally and mentally abusive to me after the fact. I had to go through the courts until I was 12 because both my parents were trying to get custody of me, so I had to grow up pretty fast being the weird kid who always had councilors coming to school... 

Long story short, once I got given the choice on who I wanted to stay with, I swore I would never see him or his horrible girlfriend again. After that point I wanted his punishment to be not knowing me and not being able to say he had a hand in bringing me up. I held onto so much hatred for him which caused me a lot of issues as I got older, but I am trying to sort through them... Which brings me to the point of December last year where I decided to contact him. I decided to do this so I could have answers to some questions I've always had, like if he ever loved me or hearing from the horses mouth that he was sorry. I got one of those two things since I don't consider it an apology if you deny and say you can't remember what happened.

I tried getting over myself and attempted building a relationship back up with him after all these years. I mainly I did it for myself, but I am finding that maybe it was a mistake and maybe I have gotten everything I can out of this newly formed relationship? I have met my 11 year old half brother, I've seen all the wedding photos on the wall, and I've seen their fancy house. I had been trying to get over myself and build our relationship up again, but I found that even the small things my father wouldn't remember about me. It got to the point where I asked him if he even remembered the day I was born and he said ""you'd know more about it that me."" If he really cares about me, regardless of the situation he was in, could you really forget your own child's birth? I feel like I am a stranger to him, which may partly be my own fault but he doesn't remember a single thing about my childhood. What do I do? Do I shut him out and move on or do I try talk to this stranger and bring him up to speed on the last 21 years of my life? What's even the point if he now has a golden child and a perfect life? What can I possibly add to that?

I am finding that every conversation with him and his family is hard, and he still has a lot of anger towards my mum and her side of the family. Will it do more harm than good continuing to talk to him? Is there anyone who has been through some good ol' daddy issues who can help give me some advice?

Thanks for reading and letting me vent.",14Apr2020,5
477,"I am a woman and I have 23 years old. I am really concerned about myself because nothing turns me on anymore and I am not attracted to anyone anymore. I don't know what it is wrong with me but I have been feeling like this for a year and a half. I read something on the Internet that it may have something to do with porn.Well in the last years I used to watch porn a lot but only to masturbate (I was even addicted to masturbation) and I think it traumatized me because I used to watch it even when I was really young. It created me a really bad image about men and about the way they treat women. Everything was fine until one year and a half ago when not even porn turned me on anymore, I feel absolutely nothing. Since then, I watched porn only ocassionally to masturbate (maybe 3 times per month). The problem is that the situation is not getting better, it has passed so much time and I can't seem to heal.I feel the same as I felt one year and a half ago (nothing turns me on and I feel asexual) and I feel like my head is broken. I know that I am really traumatized and I read that healing can take years .Has someone experienced something like this ? Is there something I can do to heal ? I have gone on dates with different guys (amazing guys) but I still cand get myself attracted to them at all, there is no attraction. I miss the times when everything would have turned me on.

479,"My godmother took me in when I was just a baby because my biological mom got pregnant really young and didn’t want to be a mom.

My godmother treated me like her daughter and I really love her but her family didn’t like me much as I wasn’t blood. She doesn’t have kids and was never married so I’m basically the only one she has other than her siblings and nieces and nephews who, again, don’t like me. Because of all the conflict in her family, they even accused me of stealing from them, I ran away from home when I turned 19. Her family called me and told me to never contact her or anybody from the family ever again. So I did just that.

I finished university and graduated with the help of my now fiancé and now I’m about to migrate to another country to live with my him.

Anyway, my godmother wasn’t exactly young when she got me, mid 70’s, and now she’s in her late 90’s and is very sick. Her sisters have contacted me and told me that I could visit since I volunteered to buy her medicine and milk for when I could afford it. The only rule was that I couldn’t talk to her, she became blind so she couldn’t see me, so that I won’t upset her.

I’ve lived with those rules for two years until suddenly she has a stroke and I rush to the hospital and that’s when her sisters told me to talk to her to comfort her.

She survived but the right side of her body is paralyzed and she can barely talk. Her family is now asking me if I could help in the payments for her hospital bills and her caregiver, which she now requires.

I gave them as much as I could and I’m just glad that she’s safe. That was about 3 months ago and now she’s in the hospital again and they’re asking for my help again.

I really want to help but as I’ve said, I’m moving to another country and really do need all of the savings I could muster but I feel guilty that I can’t give her anything. 

What can I do?

480,"I planned to move out next year by the time I start university. (Which is just at the beginning of March)
At the moment, I live with my sister, my brother (who is nearly 22 by the way), and my dad. 
I pay $100 a fortnight (I know I have it easy), while I’m trying to save. I’m about to buy a car for myself which is good because then I am solely saving to just move out. My brother has now decided he wants to move out in a couple of months which means I’m going to have to start paying a lot more rent (like basically nearly half), which is basically my whole pay. 


My whole question really is;
How am I going to move out as planned when I’m not going to be able to save any money? 🙁🙁🙁 I feel so defeated right now, because I had this all planned out in my head for over a year (I have anxiety, which makes me panic heaps when my plans are changed or messed with) and until I started discussing with my dad my plans to move out, my brother has decided he wants to go now.

I’ve tried quitting numerous times, but I just cannot seem to do it. 
I’m very disappointed in myself, and I’m afraid of having one of my lungs collapse. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t try any Nicorette or patches or any of those nicotine-aids since my mom won’t let me leave the house due to corona and if I ordered something in the mail she would see it and kill me (she doesn’t know I vape).

482,"So, i’ve been exercising at home and i really want to change my eating habits, but like the title says my family wont let me. Im kinda overweight, and need to lose 50 pounds, they have no problem with that. But i’m sick of eating fried chicken and fries, those are pretty regular here, sometimes i eat sandwiches instead because i’m tired of the oily foods. It actually makes me feel disgusting tbh.

So yeah, its not just fries and fried chicken, maybe imagine everything else that is really high in fat. And it bothers me because i have a pretty skinny family and clearly they only think of themselves, they enjoy those foods without gaining weight, i’m the opposite of that. My mother wont let me eat anything healthy because “it costs more to eat shit” meaning that she thinks buying healthier food is pricier but doesn’t taste good. “A waste of money”.

I don’t know what to do, i’m not allowed to cook for myself because i’m not good at it and, like i said, my mom thinks its either a waste of money or food. If i want to eat mashed potatoes using a healthy recipe, i cant, because my mother will be mad, why? Because she wants to slice them up and fry them. Im so sick of everything in this house, i cant lose weight and eat shit at the same time. 

I eat fruits and vegetables like apples, bananas, carrots etc i’m lucky that i can convince her, but the thing is, we are in a good place financially, but she doesn’t bother to consider the fact that her son doesn’t want to be obese and have cardiovascular issues. I feel like not eating in my case would be healthier than deep fried shit. I literally have to eat more fat than actual food.

That made me bored, exhausted and tired of it. I feel like failure, since being singing and trying all my life iam nothing and gone nowhere with that and iam 26 (I feel old af). 

My second issue is that I've had hormonal problems that cause me to have eating disorders which exploited me slowly, made me depressed even more. 

But I always had passion for body building, fitness, MMA, boxing. 
That was the only one moment in my life, when I was actually healthy, but I had to take steroids (also because of my hormonal imbalance). The reason that I quit it was my ""music career"" because I started losing my voice due to androgenic steroids.
Also, as I said before I should take them cause of my health problems but I didn't want to lose 4 octave voice. 

Now iam fucked up, cause I have horrible body that I hate, I have to restrict myself to not gain more, I feel bad cause of hormonal imbalance, that all actually is making me so tired that I dont even want to sing, I started to avoid people if I gained something then I restricted. I wish I could back to being fit and not losing my voice. 
But I guess that impossible. 
Finally I'll have to make choice between 
Music - Gym
Voice - Body
Feeling horrible - Feeling great
Career - Mental health

I hate to say that but deep inside I know iam gonna hate myself for quitting music since that was my greatest dream. On the other hand I am gonna be unhappy about my body and mentally as well to not take medication. But looks like I fucked up and I'll have to change my road. Regret till the end of my life.

490,"Hey, 

I'm 26M

I've had a lot of childhood trauma,albeit not like the one you usually see in the movies, but it was trauma enough to leave a lot of scars that I continue to deal with.

My parents did not invest enough in my early childhood education, didnot encourage me to take up sports, I was beaten occasionally, verbally abused and also bullied by classmates and cousins alike.

Now, I see that one of my parent seems to have changed from the time when I was young.

But I still feel that the experiences I had when I was young still dictate my life pretty significantly.

I feel that I'm ugly, with no personality, no communication skills and I have never felt loved in my life, despite having never lived physically alone.

Sometimes I also feel suicidal and think that maybe I should just end it all at once, but I beleive that I still deserve to give myself a second chance at life.

How do I start afresh and let go of all my insecurities and scars.

Also, I dont think I can afford therapy at this point in time, so please give me that ""Go get a therapist""-Bull crap.

I've also started Losing productivity, Like I don't do my hobbies as much as I used to because of the fact I'm too focused on not busting one out.

And Finally Nofap is actually causing me to have sick thoughts in my head that I should harm myself and that anything sexual is bad. Like for example I sometimes think about stabbing my hand in order to get rid of the sexual energy and no I'm not much of an exercise guy so exercise wouldn't work out for me...

So basically I share a space with three others, my boyfriend, another girl, and this guy...

The flat is great! However this guy is the polar opposite.
- He stomps around at unsociable hours and uses the microwave and slams the door when it's next to my room and it wakes me up
- He smokes cigarettes and also weed in his room which is against the contract and also as a smoker who recently quit this bothers me personally as the smell goes into my room
- He does not respect other's property 
- He takes other roommates food including mine
- He plays his music really loud in common areas
- He does not clean up after himself and his room stinks of urine
- He is slow to pay others back, sometimes taking weeks
- Does not consider anybody else's requests to use up the living space even when they ask
- Makes a mess everywhere he goes and also leaves coffee stains everywhere, his things are left everywhere in common spaces 

Me and the girl roommate are thinking of moving out as we have already told him once, and the second time I told him he got extremely aggressive with me.
Due to the COVID-19 lockdown the situation has got inevitably worse. Now we all keep our food in our rooms and we try to avoid him at all costs.

516," This Coronavirus has completely turned my plans upside down and now I have no idea how to proceed...
I was “temporarily” laid off from my job a few weeks ago because of all of this and my boyfriend was cut to 30 hours, which means we’ve lost over half of our income. I applied for unemployment in my state (NC) but because I started work in November it denied me because of not making enough money last quarter. I can’t get anyone from unemployment services to help me which means I’m getting no money and none of the extra pandemic unemployment either. I’ve called daily for 2 weeks and can’t contact them any other way. What little savings we have is beginning to dwindle because his paycheck is enough for rent and bills, not food or anything else we need. On top of all of this, we are renting an apartment on which the lease will be up in June. Our original plan was to put a small down payment on a house through a first time buyer program here and make that permanent for a while, because a mortgage payment is cheaper and we need the space,but due to the coronavirus they’re not even taking applications right now. The apartment we are living in now told us that we have to give them 90 days notice before moving out, and if we decide not to we have to pay month-to-month, which is $100 extra that we absolutely cannot afford.So now, with no one knowing when the world will start turning again, I can’t even really look for a place for us. I just want to sit down and cry. I have no idea what to do or how to proceed. Do I get stuck renting for another year? Do I just bite the bullet and pay month-to-month for a few months and look for a house? I’m totally lost.",14Apr2020,1
517,"So I and a few other students are moderators for our high school's upcoming student council election (for next year, we vote early.) It's completely student-run, with no aide from any teachers.

Yesterday, a candidate (we'll her her Ashley) emailed us airing her concerns that another candidate (let's call him Chris) was stealing her campaign speech points. (Every candidate's speech is public to everyone.)

 Ashley says that she came up with those specific points. In addition, all candidates had to put a campaign video. She posted her video with her ideas in it, but his campaign video had no ideas in it (e.g: he was just saying 'vote for me,' 'i have experience..' etc.) 

I wasn't present when the decision was made, but the moderators decided to send an email to Chris telling him to knock it off or he'd be disqualified (there are no rules against plagiarism in the elections, it's generally frowned upon.) They also sent an email to Ashley informing her what they were doing. She responded saying she doesn't want her name on the email.

So, sidestory. My mom is my biggest confidante. She's really good at smelling manipulation and bullshit. I ran the story by her and she shook her head.

According to my mom, Ashley is causing a big fat mess and leaving it for us to clean up. She also said that Ashley and Chris were rivals in this election and she's just trying to slander his name and manipulate us by ruining Chris and making us wary of him. She thinks it's even weirder that Ashley doesn't want her name on the email. 

Now, I feel horrible because not only did I not see this coming (from Ashley of all people), my mom is very sternly telling me to keep my mouth shut and not say a thing. 

Chris isn't the nicest person on Earth but he doesn't deserve to be like this. My mom started heavily watching my phone to make sure I don't do anything.

What should I do????? Do I say something to the moderators? Do I keep my mouth shut? My mom says it's none of my business but I feel like I can't let this just happen without knowing I can stop it.

I think one takeaway from everything is that in the next election, no one will be able to view the candidates speeches but the candidates themselves.",14Apr2020,1

2 weeks ago I had bad allergies, but for me  that's normal, I wake up almost everyday with allergies. The next day I  had a fever, my mouth was dry and I was short on breath, I got scared  and I quickly went to the hospital with my father. They test me for the  flue and mycoplasma, I was negative for the flue but positive for the  mycoplasma. I was sent home with medications and right now I'm off work.

529,"I’m sorry if this is too long but I would love an outsiders opinion. I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3 years. He is my first and hopefully last as we are planning to get married soon. He has helped me get through a lot of my own mental blocks about being able to be loved. When we first met I had lots of trouble dating. I was still feeling badly about how guys treated me in high school and called me ugly because I had dark skin. My parents did not help and would criticize my whole body along with my relatives. It was a really dark time and my self esteem didn’t improve until I left for college. While I was there, I got therapy, a gym subscription, and I eventually met my boyfriend. 

Due to Covid-19 I had to move home. Before the move, I got depressed but I was able to cope and improve my mood in healthy ways (going out with friends, seeing my boyfriend, volunteering, etc.). My boyfriend and I were in a really solid place. Now I’m back home in the same environment that made me feel so bad. 
My self esteem has plummeted and I don’t know how to get it up. Specifically, I’ve been blaming my problems on being ugly. I’ve started to believe that maybe if I was prettier, thick, or another skin tone I wouldn’t have been abused or bullied. 

It’s been hurting my relationship with my boyfriend because he gets so upset when I say these things but I just feel really bad about myself. We end up fighting because I say that I’m sad over my ugliness. My family has been treating horribly while I’ve been here and it’s so confusing. It’s gotten so bad that I seek out validation on the internet from strangers. I’d use anonymous apps and share a picture of myself. None of the opinions were bad. The strangers would say I’m cute or pretty and not to worry but I don’t believe them at all. I just keep seeking it out from different people when these opinions shouldn’t matter when I have someone that loves me unconditionally. I’ve stopped myself from doing this because it’s dangerous and unfair to my boyfriend but I just look in the mirror most days and cry. It’s like there couldn’t be enough positive comments in the world to stop the pain I feel.

I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to put him through this anymore. Why can’t I accept these compliments from my boyfriend or anyone else? Why can’t I be happy with myself? What can I do to improve my self esteem when I have none right now?

539,"How should I tell my parents I was accepted to my dream university in Europe, when they may likely cut off my funding to make me stay?

TL;DR: My parents demand that I go to university near them. I applied for a top European university without their knowledge instead, got in, but cannot go without an advanced loan from them. And they may very likely refuse.

So I apply for a top 20 university in the EU without my parents’ knowledge and to my extreme excitement, was accepted. I plan to support myself and pay for my tuition fee by working part-time, as my degree requirement actually includes 20 hours per week of paid internship. I know how much I’ll be making, and that the university basically guarantees a spot for each student. And if I am lucky enough to keep up my grades, I may get a scholarship.

But there is one obstacle. I’m not a EU citizen and am not entitled to any financial aid, so in order to get a student visa I need to pay for my first semester upfront. I will need a loan of about US$8000 from my parents, so I basically can’t go without their blessing. They can easily afford that amount, but I don’t know if they will.

You see, they are kinda controlling and part of the reason I wanted to go so much was to get away from them. They demanded that I can only go to university near us and only in pre-selected majors they approve of. They will most likely be angry and/or sad that I wanted a different career path for myself in a foreign country. In fact, they will most likely cut off my funding just to make me stay.

I couldn't believe my eyes and it just broke my heart.

A little update: 

Sorry if the question seems stupid, but this whole thing felt just so absurd. Also what made me confused was the location of the company, i wasn't sure if i should contact police in Cyprus or my local police  or maybe Europol. PornHub is a huge provider of porn and it felt like it would not have been enough to report this to my dusty local police station that is more concerned of local, bored teenagers blowing up mail boxes, you know?

547,"[TL;DR At bottom]

Yesterday I anonymously confessed to a girl I used to like that she had been on of my first female crushes. She started begging me to privately message her and reveal myself but I was very reluctant, largely because she I know may still be in contact with my ex who's currently in prison for abusing me.

Backstory time...

At the age of 17 I was dating said abusive ex. He has a female friend, (Who was also his ex, but they still got along) who we'll refer to as 'Jamie'. She is bi.
I First saw Jamie in pictures on his Facebook, and instantly developed what I can only describe as an infatuation for her. At the time I was very bicurious, (Still am) but hadn't realised/accepted it due to being religious. However in hindsight it was obvious I had the hots for her.

I Was lucky enough to meet her in person once, with my then-boyfriend, and was happy to discover that was well as a beautiful face she had an amazing personality to match, like she's one of the sweetest people I've ever met. Me and her had a bit of an online friendship after that, and she suggested we meet up again, me and her, but sadly it never happened. We were  talking for a bit even after a split from my boyfriend, but it faded over time, and eventually she ended up removing me as a friend during a facebook clear out of people she never talks to.

 I eventually build up the courage to report my ex. He ends up being found guilty and gets sentenced to 6 years, which he's currently serving.

Fast forward a little to after he's already been sent down. I'm On an app called 'MeetMe', which is a friend making app. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, one feature of this is that it let's you know who's viewed your profile. I Get a notification one day that who is looking at my page? None other that Jamie. I Wonder why she'd be checking me out,  curiosity and temptation get the better of me and I add her as a friend. I Can't remeber who messaged first, but we begin talking, one of us says something like, 'Haven't we met before?' and for a moment we're just awkwardly dancing around the fact, both of is trying to suss out if the other remembers. Until finally she says, ""I'm Not sure we should be talking."" I Ask why and she says, ""I Know everything,"" Then revealing she knows I was the one who reported my ex and sent him to prison.  We start having a conversation about that, me asking her how she knows and who else knows, (I'm Supposed to be anonymous, it's a crime to reveal a victims identity) and she was also asking me for my side of the story. I End up showing her the screenshots that were used as evidence in court, where my ex admits to what he did. She was surprisingly understanding and neutral. She just said she doesn't know what to believe, that she doesn't see me as a liar but also doesn't want to think her friend could've done something like that. I Said that's fine and she doesn't have to pick a side. She revealed that she phones in him prison and has even visited with his family. She said she doesn't know what she'll do when he gets out. The next day she messaged me again saying even if she may not know who to believe she's got my back and she won't show anyone that we spoke.

Back to present day, I'm now 23. I Discover her on one of these anonymous messaging apps. I Descide to send her one basically saying that she was one of my first girl crushes but I wasn't out at the time so never acted on it. She reacts positively and says she wants me to message her, I said I don't think it's a good idea as she's friends with someone who doesn't like me and that she might freak out if she knows who I am, I also mention that last time we spoke she seemed weird about it at first and wasnt sure we should. (Referring to MeetMe) She carries on insisting, promising she won't 'freak out' or anything, she's not like that.

I Ended up giving her a compramise that at some point in the next week I will add/follow her on some social media, (She'd been asking me to add her on fb) and if she wants to talk she can message me. She said 'Sure, add me whenever you're ready.'

Now I'm wondering of I should go through with it, considering everything. I Think I've given her enough information that she must at least suspect it's me, so she wouldn't keep insisting i reach out to he u less she wanted me to...On a secondary note I'm wondering which social media I should use? She said Facebook but to me it feels a little to direct, and I feel she won't was me on her friends list in case others see. 

What do you guys think?

TL;DR Anonymously confessed online my feelings for my old teenage lesbian crush, she's now insisting she wants me to add her on fb and reveal who I am, but I'm reluctant as she was friends with my abusive ex who's in prison because of me and I don't know if they still talk.",14Apr2020,1

Thoughts? Is there a better way do do this? I’ve also looked at robocall filters and do not disturb settings but everything is inadequate. 

I’d be happy if I could just write something simple in swift that would check the phone number, if it’s in my contact list let it ring /text/iMessage through, if they aren’t in my contact list refuse to connect or send them to voicemail refuse the text/message but apparently no one has figured a way around cell phone companies restrictions. Though I’m absolutely sure there’s a gray area that would allow software to function like this. I don’t need to talk to anyone who isn’t in my contacts and everyone who needs to reach me can email me if they can’t get through to my phone.

It’s extremely annoying waking up to texts asking me what my q.v. rate is, if I’m working tonight, and other inappropriate things.

And thoughts/tips would be appreciated.",14Apr2020,0
556,"My 7 year old sister watches too much unfiltered content on youtube. She used to watch those stupid toy unboxing videos and 5 minute craft videos but has now graduated to ""Sophie Dossi"", a gymnastics channel that makes vlogs. 

I don't want her to watch these things, I remember watching useless cartoons as a kid as well but these vlogs are like crack for her and she doesn't stop. 

All this being said, I need help with a few things: 

1) How do I make my case to my parents since they don't particularly care about what she watches and I usually can't put into words how harmful it is to fall into this YouTube sinkhole

2) Is it okay for her to watch those vlog videos? They aren't doing anything particularly predatory but it just doesn't sit right with me for some reason. 

3) How do I deal with this? Do I stop her from watching youtube entirely? I tried to make her watch animal planet and she did enjoy it but she eventually rebelled because she understood that I was making her watch it and she doesnt like doing what I say.  It's near impossible to regulate what and how much she watches because nobody gives enough of a shit to time her and I'm incredibly busy with college work atm. I know she needs entertainment, I just don't know what's good entertainment and what isn't. 

My main problem lies with the content she should be watching though and what alternatives I have (and why I should choose these alternatives)

I desperately need help with this.

561,"**TL;DR:** Man had sex again the next morning, didn't cum but whole body went shivering and dizzy for several minutes. Kinda worried.

**Background**  
I am a thirty-something male.  
I think I'm healthy. I eat healthy food, drink plenty of water and I exercise regularly.  
I haven't had any real relationship for nearly 20 years now. I have had a one-night stand maybe once a year on average but that's about it.  
There's also been a certain level of background-stress most of my life. I won't go into too much detail but I've had some depression moments. Then again, who hasn't?  
In general though I live a comfortable life.

**The event**  
After an evening drinking and being intimate with my girlfriend and then being intimate some more, we went to sleep. I slept fine.  
The next morning I woke up with a hangover, but I had an amazing girl next to me so it's all good :)

We proceeded to get intimate again, as new couples do.  
I wasn't able to orgasm just yet, so she stimulated me and though it was a little sensitive sometimes, it felt great.

I really wanted to cum and I felt the tension rising, but the big moment just wouldn't come.

And then it happened.

I didn't cum. There was no short violent burst of ecstasy in my nether regions.  
What did happen was way beyond that.  
There was an increasing tingling sensation and it started to take over my body. I was panting like crazy. My fingertips felt tingly and my toes and then my shoulders and then my legs.  
It was like when your leg has fallen asleep and the feeling is starting to come back, but then over my whole body.  
As seconds turned into minutes I started to feel dizzy. My heart was racing and I felt something like tremors coursing through my body. My head was the only part that felt normal but the rest of me was nearly shivering.

This was starting to get scary.  
My girlfriend had stopped when all this started and told me to relax and don't talk. I tried to relax, I focused on my breathing, checked my heart rate, but the feeling didn't go away.

Then I started to get emotional. I don't know what I was feeling, but it overwhelmed me and I actually started crying.

As I lay there for maybe five or ten minutes I slowly, very slowly, started to recover.  
I think it took maybe 15 minutes or more before I felt stable enough to stand up.

**Epilogue**  
I have never had an experience like this and I'm a little worried.

Could this be caused by having too much sex in a short time? Is it nervousness? Were there feelings I've bottled up over the years that finally came out? Is it stress? Relief? Or is this a physical thing? Low blood pressure? Or just the hangover?

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Should I be worried?

We're taking it a bit easier now so I doubt this will happen again, but I would really like to know why this happened.

I hope someone here can help me understand this.",14Apr2020,2

However, latetly my buddy has been telling me about all the money he and his girlfriend (both also late 30s) are spending. They received both their taxes and the stimulus check, so they have some extra money to spend. However, I'm still working and paying my bills and I haven't done ANY excessive spending outside of the necessities.  


It just makes me mad because, here I am trying to do my best and work. Meanwhile, my buddy is at home this whole time getting paid to play video games because his job was considered ""non-essential."" He and his girlfriend have recently purchased a new couch, a new TV stand, several new cat trees, new curtains for his house and then he told me yesterday that he recently purchased a few new video games.  


Meanwhile, me, ""Mr. Essential worker"" hasn't purchased anything. No, all my money is just sitting there in my bank account collecting dust because my wife says we should only be buying the essentials. I guess it's just really hard to hear about people making all these big purchases when there are some people out there who are starving to make ends meet. Or, in my case, still going to work every day and receiving a paycheck.

566," 

I (28F) work as a professional in a mid-sized business reviewing and drafting contracts, and assisting with real estate transactions. I have my JD. I graduated from school last year, and have been working at this job for a little less than a year. During school, I never had a problem with motivation. I would get my work done a week in advance. I could sit and my desk and read for hours. I was able to focus for hours on the work that needed to get done. I felt driven and passionate when I was in school. I always had a goal that I could work toward.  


When I started the job I currently have, I started finding it hard to focus at work. My mind would drift off and I would think about other things like traveling and my house work. I could never find the motivation to concentrate on the job at hand. My work has started noticing that I am slacking off, and they had some conversations with me. I know that my job is on the line now, but I just can't focus.  I've tried different methods to get motivated. I've tried checklists, and different ways to keep track of my accomplishments, but none of it works. I feel like I wanted to be a professional my whole life, but now that I have achieved this goal, I feel like I don't care about it anymore.   I worked so hard for my degree and job, yet, I feel so unfulfilled.

I don't have this problem in my personal life. I am an athlete and I find it easy to get motivated about improving my performance with my sport, yet I can't find this same motivation for work.  I LOVE the people I work with. The work environment is the type of place that I always pictured myself at. Yet, I feel lost and lazy. I don't even know where to start.",14Apr2020,1
567,"Hey, everyone. I’m at a loss of what to do, and I’d appreciate input. My instinct is to stay where I am, but I feel guilty either way. Let me know what you think. 


Early in March, before the COVID pandemic gained so much momentum in the US, I travelled with my two young children from Maryland to South Carolina. The trip had been planned for several months so that we could visit family while my husband, who is active duty military, was on a work-related trip out of town. During that time, obviously, corona has spread significantly. 

Now that my husband is home, the question is whether or not we’re returning to Maryland as well. We were supposed to be back already, but I wasn’t sure until recently if it was legal given the stay-at-home orders I’m both states. I called and spoke with the Maryland State Police, and they said that it is legal for us to return because we live in Maryland, but we’d be quarantined for two weeks in our home. That being said, Maryland has more than twice as many cases of COVID-19 as South Carolina does, several of which are in our home county. 

I don’t want to get anyone sick (if it’s possible we’re carriers, for example) or contract it ourselves... I know children are usually fine but I don’t want to risk their health anyway. So I feel guilty and reckless if I leave. On the other hand, I feel guilty that my husband would be alone in Maryland if we don’t return for the time being, especially since we don’t have any idea how long these stay-home orders are going to last. He’s not allowed to leave the immediate area, so he can’t come to us. 

So my question is, if it were you, would you stay at your parents’ home with your two children, or would you drive back to your home to be with your spouse? I’m sorry for such a long post, I’m just confused and I feel bad no matter what I do. This whole situation is scary and I really wasn’t prepared to make these kinds of decisions. I just want to do the right thing. Thanks in advance.

Updated to add:
When I spoke with my husband about it, he said he wants us to come home but that it’s ultimately my decisions because I’m the one that has to make the drive and he doesn’t want to expose us to the virus or the possibility that we’d get stuck somewhere in between. More or less an “it’s up to you” response. My parents say we’re welcome to stay as long as we’d like, but refuse to offer further advice because they don’t want to sound biased in us staying at my husband’s expense.",14Apr2020,0

574,"I’m 20F. College student. All my friends are either online and/or far far away from me. The only person I consistently talk to is my boyfriend and we’re in an LDR. I literally have no friends right now, no best friends. The people I knew in HS live in different states and we never talk anymore. I feel like everyone around me has some sort of best friend or close friend, and I’m the only one who’s just alone. People I thought were best friends of mine walked away from me and turned out to be fair weather friends.

I feel awful saying it but quarantine is one of the only times in recent history that I’ve ever actually felt peaceful. Finally I don’t have to feel guilty for staying in my room all day and rotting away, never visiting anyone, because it’s not something I’d be expected to do right now. I took a leave of absence from college because I was so depressed and my parents flew me home because of the outbreak, so there’s literally no obligation for me to do anything other than exist. Even without any pressure to do anything, I still feel miserable and alone, but way less so than what I would usually be feeling. I’ve got a psychiatrist and a therapist but idk I guess I just feel beyond help or something. 

When the quarantine ends, I don’t know how I’ll be able to force myself back into going through the motions and resuming college. The only people I’ve really got right now are my parents, and as essential workers they haven’t got the time to constantly be babysitting me and I’m going to have to leave them to go to school anyway. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I keep thinking like maybe in all of this I am the common factor and it is me who is the problem. Anytime someone has something positive to say to me like “you’re a nice girl, you’re funny and smart and will find better friends” I can’t help but think I’ve just tricked them into agreeing with me somehow. 

What can I do to force myself to keep moving forward once the quarantine is over? Is it even worth it for me to bother trying to make friends if I’m just going to do something to screw it up eventually? I just don’t really know what to do anymore.

576,"I wasn't quite sure where to send this post, so I'm hoping I'm doing this the right way, but also that it'll reach some people to give me some guidance. I'll do my best to keep this short:

I've recently become aware that I have a tendency to do most things on autopilot. Meaning I don't really think about what I do, or the reasons behind my actions, I just kinda go with the flow. Nothing bad has happened, but because I'm aware of it, it has been bothering me greatly and I want to go about doing something about it.

I'm an avid gamer, have been my whole life and also liked thinking that I'm pretty good at it too. I enjoy playing chess and liked strategic games since early days of gaming. A friend of mine recently pointed out that I have a tendency to react more than taking charge. Instead of having spacial awareness, taking note of what's around me (in game) and strategically thinking about what to do next with the information I've gotten, I just stroll on until something happens and now I have to react. In short, I'm choosing to be a passenger instead of being a driver.

Since this is all gaming related, why would it bother me so much? 

It made me realise that I've been following this exact same routine pretty much my whole life. Not sure when this started becoming the norm of my life as I was introduced to a wide array of intellectual stimuli throughout my life, yet somewhere along the line, I think it just became easier to have others smarter/more experienced than me to do all the thinking. To be honest... I don't even know why, I just kinda woke up now to realise this is what I've been doing and I want to solve this problem.

So where does the guidance part come in?

Honestly, I don't actually know how to start... A bunch of things go through my mind of course like reading more books, playing chess (and focusing), finding puzzle solving games etc. Perhaps I've already answered my own question, but truthfully, it would be awesome if I can have different points of view on how to address my lazy-brain syndrome (invented term).

584,"Ok. So for reference I’m 16, or so I’ve been told. I look nothing like my parents. I have brown eyes, they both have blue. 

So first off: I don’t think my parents are my biological parents. I don’t look anything like them, like at all. I’ve always been asked by other kids if I’m adopted as soon as they see my parents. We’re all the same race, but I have brown eyes/ am short both my parents have blue eyes/ are much taller. I’ve asked my parents several times if I’m adopted and they always deny it. 

Secondly, I know this is a stretch but I think my parents might’ve lied about my age. I’m registered in school as 16 with a certain birthdate, but I’m not sure if that’s possible/easy to fake? I’ve always been way shorter than other kids my age (I was 4’11 freshman year) and idk, it just seems weird? I’ve never seen my birth certificate or anything either. I don’t know why my parents would tell me that I’m older than I really am and register and such but I’m starting to really think that something isn’t adding up. I have an older sister and she says that she doesn’t remember me when I was young (which is fair, she’s supposedly two years older than me) but just.. something isn’t adding up. 

Most of that is just conjecture: but I have some confirmed cases of my parents lying to me as well. I was always told that my name was (fake name for example) Anna Lee Smith. That’s what I’ve always said my name was, it’s what I put my name as at school and stuff, but last year my parents were getting me a passport and told me that my legal name isn’t actually Anna Lee Smith, it’s Anna Lee without a middle name. They said they just preferred Anna Lee Smith after I was born so that’s what they told. me I don’t know why my parents would lie to me about this? But they did for the first supposedly 15 years of my life. I’m just confused and not sure what to think anymore.  

It’s possible that I’m just being paranoid after the name incident, but honestly Im not sure what to think anymore. Any advice would be welcome. Also I’m not sure if it’s even possible to fake records and stuff for school, so if that’s not possible that would be somewhat reassuring, although obviously I know you’re not supposed to.",14Apr2020,6

After my explosive and mentally scarring break up with him, I thought that this friend of mine would just be friends with my ex since they're clearly closer. But he still wanted to be friends with me.

But I'm the type of person who doesn't like to text with people a lot, I just don't like to use texting as a prominent form of communication. And I've explained this to him on multiple occasions. But at least once a week he will message me saying something along the lines of ""well u clearly hate me so bye""

It's happened around 7 times already and I'm sick and tired of it. He expects me to text with him more than I do my closest friends and I just can't meet that expectation. I've explained this to him several times but he never stopped. A couple times I got really mad at him and he said that's it's not his fault because he has abandonment issues. I explained that that's not an excuse to treat me like this and he would apologise before doing it again the following week. (Also he would often threaten suicide during these arguments)

599,"Hi! I would love some advice or opinions here. Please  read!

Brother-in-law: 31m (let's call him T)
Gf: 22f (let's call her E)
Dating for 2+ years now.

T is kind of a loser. He recently moved out of his dad's basement into his brother's, and all he does is play videogames. He lacks ambition, doesn't have a spine, and pretends to love his gf when a year and 1/2 ago he's openly told the family that he doesn't.

E is very naive, and infatuated by him. She thinks they will marry someday and spoils him with gifts he doesn't deserve. 

T over the past 2+ years:
- Tells her he loves her but actually doesn't.
- Tells her he sees a future with her but doesn't.
- Has openly said to us:
  ""I'm not attracted to her.""
  ""I don't really love her.""
  ""I don't see a future with her.""
  ""I stare at other women when in public.""
- Calls her every night but he seems bored or disinterested on the phone.
- Tells his family to save face around her (we feel uncomfortable contributing to the damage).
- Many times isn't very openly affectionate to her, while she is to him.
- Glued to his phone when E's around, which makes her cling to my husband and I in which we feel like we're babysitting her. 
- Does all the typical ""boyfriend things"", not cuz he wants to, but like it's a chore.

He knows he should break it off but doesn't wanna ""hurt her feelings"" or ruin their friendship. He's not the breaker-upper type. Who knows how long he'll string her along.

Of course we've repeatedly told him our concerns/uncomfortability but he gets defensive, gives excuses, and tells us to put up with her when we visit anyway. Husband puts up with it to retain a good relationship with his brother. 
But as another female, it pains me to see her put such effort in what she thinks is a forever relationship without him being honest with her. How long is this gonna go?

So, AITA if I told her since he won't? What's the right thing to do here?

TL;DR: Family member leading his gf on in a dishonest long-term relationship. He's ""meh"" about her but she's hoping to marry him. 2+ yr relationship and ongoing. Should I tell her since he won't?",14Apr2020,1
600,"It's been two months since I met that guy on a dating site I liked his pictures and he said he liked mine too . he added me on FB and he was talking to me every day and it was always him to initiate the conversations . We even exchanged phone numbers because he wanted to make sure I am fine when I am not online .

Anyway , after a few days , he asked to meet me and that's what we did . The date was fine and he was really a gentle man  , he never stop complimenting me the whole day . I couldn't hide my feelings and I never stopped smiling . 

After the first date we got closer to eachothers , . and  the more w talk , the more I discoverd that we can't agree about anything , we don't agree about politics , sport , religion .. .. I sometimes find my self shouting , we used to have those little fights sometimes , then we get back together because we really loved each others !

We met several times after that and were planning to meet again but we couldn't because of coronavirus and quarantine :( we both were sad because we live far away from each others but we never stopped talking on messenger and through the phone.

One night , we were talking and flirting and then , we disagreed as usual and I found myself shouting against my well and then he said : "" what an ignorance ! Go read books ! "" and I said : "" you are the last one to talk about ignorance ! You didn't even go to high school man ! Wake up ! "" And he insulted me using bad words then I told him how much he is vulgar and does not deserve me and I said : good-bye .

After 10 days , I decided to call him because I couldn't wait anymore . He answered , he was calm . I talked about the fight and I said that I was nervous and didn't mean to understimate him or something , he apologized and then I said I missed him ... And ( silence ) .. .. he didn't say a single word 

Now, We are talking but my bf is never the same, he became cold, He rarely texts me . Sometimes we don't talk for days . He stopped blaming me . I feel that something died inside him . I am afraid he decided to leave me . He even told me once that we dont get along . I said to myself maybe he is trying to break up in a nice way , he may be even talking to someone else ! Then I decided to stop contacting him and that's what I did 

After a few days , he texted me on messenger he asked for a pic of me saying he missed me and he complimented me alot . We talked for few minutes then I asked him to call me but he said he couldn't and he must go and then he went offline

Now it's been 2 days since that last conversation on messenger . Well I won't lie to you I am still hurt due to our last fight . I can't forget the bad words he said to me . I still hear his voice insulting me whenever I go to bed and I feel like screaming : WHYYY ??? why did this happened to us ?

does my bf still want me ? Or .. he is just breaking up with me ? Should I stop waiting for his messages ? Because waiting for him to contact me is painful",14Apr2020,1

And not because I genuinely like these things. I think it's because I'm afraid of making my own choices and becoming a fully autonomous (and responsible) individual. And clinging to the image of my former child self makes me feel justified in avoiding that.

The only thing I've really grown in is intellectual pursuits. I've become an avid reader of difficult books and I love taking online courses on all sorts of subjects. Maybe it's this obsession that's stopping me from developing socially, emotionally etc. by taking up all my time and energy? For some reason I don't feel the urge to act dumber than I am, in fact, I put (healthy, I think) pressure on myself to be as learned as possible. It makes me happy.

608,"TL;DR a mirror fell on me two months ago and fucked me up, bad. It lacerated the back of my ankle and my foot. When it happened the pain was instant and I was literally screaming/couldn't walk. They didn't take any x-rays/I was sent home with fourteen stitches.

Fast forward a little over a month later, I'm still having problems, the stitches still hadn't fully healed so they ordered x-rays to check to see if there was leftover glass, everything came back normal so they're having me do PT.

It's now over two months later, I still can't bear full weight without experiencing that pain, and I've noticed a weird bump sticking out from my skin that moves when I try to flex my ankle, there's significant swelling, and obvious deformity. I tried calling again today to basically say something is seriously wrong, the front desk to the rehab clinic immediately asked if I'd had X-rays done after I told them everything and I said yeah but they said nothing was abnormal/pain was due to inactivity so they sent me in for PT.

611,"To keep this anonymous, some of the details will be scarce and or changed, but this is something that has happened. I'm from the UK

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a quiet town in a somewhat quiet area. Around a year ago, some old neighbours moved out, who were also noisy, playing loud music for an hour occasionally (Bass mostly). And shortly after that, new neighbours came in. This is a terrace by the way.  I live with three other people, it's a shared house. The new neighbours are apparently a family of five, but four for reasons later on. Including two children. I hear the stomping and banging occasionally, I can take it because I understand they are children. 

These neighbours, have been a problem since day one. They had a house warming party at the end of their first week, it was noisy, but I can forgive. Shortly after that... problems. Loud music. That annoyingly loud bass during the day. I am unable to work, and I use a computer all day trying to do art for a living. I hear this music once per day, for an hour. It was constant. And it's annoying. I'm autistic and loud noises bother me. At some point, my roommate had an argument in the backyard with that neighbour about the noise, and it got worse from there. A few months later, there was a suicide next door. I think it was that person my roommate was arguing with. I do kinda feel bad for them. But shortly after, they began having banter outside at night, with another person, according to my roommate. My roommates work. I later discovered they were still playing loud music, but downstairs instead. In the kitchen. So that was a positive for me, but not the best for my roommates who were downstairs. Then police came round their place on a few occasions. Mainly when they were not in. 

My roommates idiotically decided to do a BBQ without telling the neighbours we were doing it. A few weeks after that, these neighbours, set fire to their own wheelie bin. Which would have set the houses on fire had we not noticed. We had to put it out because they weren't there. At this point, you might be wondering why we haven't reported it. I don't know either. I don't know where to start, which is why I'm asking here. I have anxiety. However, this isn't the last of this anecdote.

It's now the Covid-19 lockdown. Everyone is social distancing. Except the neighbours. They invited a friend over. Who lives in a van. Now sitting in a parking spot, near other houses. And now the noises are worse. And I'm surprised nobody else is complaining about it. They speak loudly. Shouting across the road to the neighbours. Then the gypsy (sorry if that's the wrong term), began playing LOUD MUSIC from the van. For hours every day. I am not able to hear it luckily, but my roommates are. This is just getting ridiculous. Then they had a bonfire, without telling anyone. Rushed to get my clothes in. I'm now giving them the death stare whenever they walk past. I'm not intimidated. I'm just disappointed. And just to top it off. Just a few minutes ago as I wrote this, the neighbour, drove their car over our their own, and our front lawn, and beeped for someone inside their house. Not knocking anything over, because there's nothing there. My roommate was able to snap a picture to hopefully provide some evidence why these people should be evicted and possibly put in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm asking for advice is because I feel powerless. I don't advocate for violence. I don't believe it solves anything. And I also realize by evicting these neighbours, someone else is going to have to deal with them. Someone probably with more to deal with than me and my roommates. I also acknowledge that this may be immoral of me, because I understand there is a risk that we may do more harm than good. I don't think my roommates realize that, but I feel trapped in this situation. With not many options. I know this isn't the average neighbourly noise complaints. I'm always a skeptic when it comes to these damned if you do and damned if you don't situations. Maybe I'm missing something?",14Apr2020,2

615,"Hey everyone! 
After a series of mental gymnastics about a recurring theme in my life currently, I have come to the realization that I become extremely anxious when I make plans. Fun plans, too, like trips I have always wanted to take and so on. 
I feel like this makes no sense at all. I have these dreams about what I want to do with my youth: quality time with friends and my SO, my family! But when it comes to actually having these things happen, I get so anxious, I start to sweat, shiver and cry. I feel like this is too extreme of an emotional reaction. And if I do power through and carry out with these plans, I don’t hate the experience, but I am in a constant state of mild anxiousness and irritability. 

As an additional detail, I am quite “introverted” and do need a lot of alone time, but I think it isn’t exactly the fear of socialization that gets me feeling this way. 

I guess I’m asking if any of you know this kind of feeling and for advice about what to do. Thank you!",14Apr2020,3
617,"My renting situation for this year is somewhat questionable. I was not asked to pay a down payment, my move-in date was late because the landlord's daughter was dragging her feet about moving out, so the lease dates on my rental agreement are wrong. As of the past year, my roommate (another one of the landlord's daughters) has been paying the bills out of pocket when they are due, and writing down my half of the bills on a small post-it note that she keeps on the fridge. I had asked her several times to please let me know at the end of the month what the bills are, but she insists it's ""easier this way,"" and continues to let months' worth of bills rack up before she asks for a check. I would just write her the check for the bills at the end of the month myself, but she doesn't tell me when all of the bills for that month have come in, and sometimes writes them down all at once. While this was mostly an inconvenience, I didn't have reason to think that she might be overcharging me until recently. She has a printer in the house, which she let me use about three times (to print a total of about 20 pages). I told her I would pay her back for the pages, but recently discovered from her post-it note that she was planning to charge me $25 for a new ink cartridge...two months before my lease is up, so I won't be able to use the printer when I move. While the printer charge is not a big deal, I am now worried that she may be overcharging me on other things as well. I have no proof, however, as she has thrown away all but two bills that came in the mail. I am considering moving out a month early, as there was no down payment, and the safety of the house is questionable (her ex boyfriend got drunk and destroyed some of our property with his friends while my car was IN THE DRIVEWAY, and she suspects he has been driving by the place to monitor it. Not to mention, he might still have a key, and had broken in before and stolen her things from her bedroom. The locks were never changed.) I have no idea how to proceed from here. I would consider just packing up and moving out since there was no down payment and it's not a safe place, but my landlord has a position of authority at the school where all of my sisters are enrolled, and my family is afraid that moving out might cause problems for them. Two of my sisters are not even in middle school yet, and have years left of being around this man (and his wife, who is actually one of my sister's teachers.)

I'm quite new here and need some help. Okay, so like I'm 16 y/o female living in Europe and I've been going through some mental breakdowns. Since quarantine it's been so much worse.

I'm currently living alone with my dad (65 y/o) who's trying his best to be a good Muslim. I grew up with the religion but honestly, I don't feel connected to it at all. My big sister (32 y/o) who's already moved out 5h away since she was 16 isn't a Muslim and told me that I'm not forced to be one. Okay, my problem is that I'm suffering from some mental health issues. My dad is an emotional mess as well since my parents are divorced and I feel so trapped at home. Ramadan is around the corner and I don't want to stress my dad even more because he tends to yell at me or says things like that he's the worst father, it's all his fault and I don't i feel bad. When I cry, he doesn't say anything and just looks at me with a guilty look on his face. I actually feel like it's not right to pretend to be religious because it's disrespectful to the religion itself, you know? And I still want to be the best human being I can be and lying doesn't feel right but to be honest, I'm so scared that my dad is going to be full of rage when I say something against his beliefs.

I used to go to my boyfriends place - btw my dad knows about us - to calm down and to get a grip of myself. At home there's always this weird tension and honestly, it makes me so tired. I've been experiencing more panic attacks lately because I'm not able to hang out w my friends and/or my bf. They were my safe place. It's not like I hate my dad or that our relationship is very bad but I don't feel comfortable at home, I always have to filter my words 3 times to make sure he doesn't yell at me. Negative thoughts are following me 24/7 and I feel like I can't breathe. I don't want to disappoint my dad because he's the only family I have here but I also don't want to suffer anymore and lie to keep him calm. It's not worth to destroy our relationship, i guess?

Can someone please help me? I've been desperate for quite some time and it's almost like I feel like dying.

635,"Hey all,

I just want to say before I start this whole post that my parents (dad / stepmom) get me everything I need. I have enough clothing, I have good food to eat etc...

&amp;#x200B;

So this has been going on ever since I dropped one 'education' level in Dutch high school (HAVO to VMBO). They were very proud and supportive whenever I tried something new or whenever I got some good grades back. Since I dropped one level down they've been very dull and distant from me. Conversations have been awkward and feel forced for the last 4-5 years, we don't really laugh with each other and I honestly don't really feel like a part of the family anymore.

I've had a history of violent fights with my dad often resulting in me sleeping in a parking garage 50km from home and a bunch of other shitty stuff. After something like that happens it feels like the clock resets and in the next months/years we build up to the same thing happening over and over.

It still happens but I managed to live with it by staying away from him as much as possible, but he'll also get mad if I do that too much because then 'I'm trying to distance myself from the family' so at the end of the line it's a shitty situation but I'm able to cope with it for the time being...

What my problem is is the negativity whenever I try something/come up with something.

For example: I had to choose a path to follow for the next school (MBO), so I researched what I'd like and what would be a safe future etc. etc. They didn't like it and they showed it in every. way. possible. Whenever they ask a question and I answer, they laugh. At a birthday party? Tell everyone in a 10km radius about how stupid my choice is. Crack amazing haha-funny jokes 24/7. After a year of doing that 'education path' I found out it wasn't for me so I had to choose a new school and the whole shitfest started again times 5.

This was just an example but this basically happens with almost every single thing you can think about.

I don't have a lot of friends and that is fine since I'm very (i dont know the word for it, but I don't mind being alone) since I was a little boy and that worked out fine since I could always go to my parents for the issues I had but since that's not the case anymore I feel pretty lonely and desperate sometimes.

All that got me pretty insecure since everything I do is laughed at and told to 10 other people. I try my best to keep distance from them as much as I can but sometimes stupid me gets so excited about an upcoming project that I want to tell them the in and outs of it only to get hit by a disapproving look followed up by endless jokes about how dumb it is.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my question is; help?    :   )

636,"i need immediate advice(sorry for bad formatting)

tl:dr at bottom (but please read i need help)

so i have had depression for the past 4 years or so. even before that my parents would always fight, v normal nowadays tho. anyway so whenever i 'fuck up' or am in a depressive state my dads way of parenting (screaming, telling me what to do, getting angry when i dont do something) would kick in and he would get mad. his anger issues have gotten so bad over all my years of me living hes broken glass shoved and hit me and my mom(. btw i live with my mom dad and my older sister anyway he gets very angry and sometimes i understand because me or my sister would do something wrong. but most of the time when hes angry at someone (mainly me or my mom) it would be out of control for no reason, and he is always the one to say that its okay for him to be yelling at us and that he just wants to have a normal conversation. he also is very quick to invalidate someone opinion if its goes against his.

ive called the police on him one time because i was at school and was so scared to go home. (they didnt help me) i already have a lot of anxiety anyway and he heightens it. he makes my mom very anxious too because hes constantly lashing out at her and trying to get her down or tell her shes done something wrong. he claims he just wants to help and have a normal conversation but his way of helping is attacking the other person and saying how bad of a job they did at something. he will get mad at me if i dont spend enough time with him and expect me to trust and respect him and tell him everything about my life, even when he has no respect for me or my mom and has hurt me physically and mentally so many times. my mom knows about me questioning my gender but i doubt ill ever tell my dad.

is it bad that i wouldn't mind, id probably even prefer if i never see him again? i know he wants to have a normal relationship with me but i dont think ill ever be ready for that. i dont want to say him yelling is traumatizing but i can barely make eye contact with people anymore and had to quit band because the director would always yell and get angry at the rowdy kids (he was a good teacher tho) and me and my mom get bad migraines to so spending a day of him yelling at me and the spending the night crying is bad and intensifies the headaches.

I know this subreddit isn't the best choice for my issue because im already trying to move out but i didn't know where else to put this.

if i am able to move out im going to try to get emancipated too, ive been on medication for depression and anxiety before but i am not currently, ive been to therapy before too but it was too expensive and i still haven't found a good therapist i like.  (in my state i would be able to get emancipated) if i just show them somethings. A testimony, of trauma or the environment i live in not helping my mental health, from a mental health professional would help my case but again its to much money, anyway, i just want to know if im going to regret not giving my dad a fourth chance for us to rebuild our relationship, i told my mom im kinda done with his bs because of how he never tries to help himself.

tl:dr my dad is physically and emotionally abusive towards me and my mom, i want to move out but done know if its the right choice, this has been going on for over 4 years, every time i say that im going to forgive my dad and everything is gonna be fine but he keeps acting like this and getting super angry. if i move out is it the right choice? or should i give him another chance to help himself?

i would be fine living on my own i just need some advice on what to do or if you think their are better options for me thank you!

637,"As the title says, I plan on making masks to give to people for free, my only concern is people not wanting them because of social distancing and everything going on. I that sounds like a defeated attitude, however, this is also truth. I still plan on making them I just need to know how to go about it. 

Even though people are ordering items and touching what others have touched, I just wonder if people will want them being I’m handing them out and that effects people differently than sending via mail. 

My other idea was to sell them online for a low price so I could send them to people, I really wanted to give them free, if you have any ideas on what I should do please let me know.

638,"Hi everyone,

I’ll preface this by saying that I am a graduating senior and have loved just about every single professor I’ve had up until this point. This makes me both very lucky, but also clueless as to handle this situation.

I’ve had issues with him since the beginning. This is a literature/ENGL class (my major), and I’ve always gotten As in these types of classes. He makes us write “non-traditional” close reading essays. There is no rubric or anything in the syllabus about the instructions on these- we only have a very brief email telling us what to do. 

He emailed me after my first essay saying he will fail it if I didn’t redo it. I, of course, complied. He still had issues with my redo, but did give me a passing grade. I had asked him for help clarifying the instructions and expectations, but he uses really big, vague language and it didn’t help at all. I even went to office hours to get help and it was the same. I’ve not missed class, take notes, and stay on top of the readings. 

Jump to now. We meet via Zoom in groups of 8 for 15 minutes MWF. There was one day I didn’t speak, and after he emailed me saying I was being “conspicuous” by not talking, even though there were three other people who didn’t because the others had a lot to say (that was fine by me, I liked the reading and was interested in what they said). I emailed him back and apologized, said I’d be more assertive, and that I’m working 50 hours a week right now- I must’ve just been tired because I did the reading. 

We have another paper due this Friday. I work literally all week and have a full-time class workload, so I finished a rough draft this weekend and sent him it. Let’s just say, he didn’t like it. He started the email with “Ms. LastName, you wrote a research paper?!” (It was not a research paper, I just included one citation other than the main piece about Ethiopia because it was in my analyzed quote, and I know nothing about it on my own. It wasn’t even important, I could’ve just taken it out). The first paper I wrote was so bad because I talked to much about “subtleties” and “subjectivities,” but he called this one a research paper???

He said if I didn’t redo this by the due date, I would fail. I will redo it on obviously, but I have no idea what I’m supposed to do. I clearly don’t understand the assignment and have probably emailed him 6 times over the course of the semester asking for help on them, and there have only been 2. 

- I have given three other professors who I am very close to the email about the guidelines, as well as his emails with the feedback. They think I’ve done exactly what he asked in all three of them, and they don’t know how else to help me/interpret what he’s asking for. It’s not their job to do so anyway, so I’m really grateful for them. They’re amazing. 

- I talked to my therapist who used to be a law professor, and she cannot understand what he is saying/asking for either. All she knows is that I’m losing my marbles.

- He talks down to me immensely in our emails, and they are unhelpful. He makes me feel stupid. I don’t get anything from them, so I don’t even know how to get help directly from him. I went to him for online office hours last week, as well as once before the quarantine and I just don’t know what the heck he’s talking about and have told him I’m confused.

- I talked to the dean and nothing can really happen until the end of the semester where I file formal complains or grade appeals.

This is the last paper. I graduate in a MONTH. I switched the class to Pass/No Pass. How do I do this paper?! I don’t know what to do, and I’m at my wits end. It feels like he just doesn’t like me at all (if you read the emails, you’d understand), and I don’t think there will be anyway I produce something he approves of.  I don’t want to drop the class.

Does anyone have *any* advice at all for finishing this semester? Should I email him again? If so, what should I say? How the hell do I write this paper?",14Apr2020,1

640,"(TLDR at bottom)

I'll start by saying that I'm (22M) not formally diagnosed with anything, but over this past semester I tried a few sessions of therapy for the first time to deal with my increase in anxiety. Most days I would feel fine and would be able to deal with any issues arising from it, but there were a few times where I had no control over my symptoms which is why I decided to speak to a professional. Since the therapist I found was older (70s or 80s) I didn't really feel comfortable talking about certain things, particularly issues related to social settings, with her. I always found myself having to explain things I would consider trivial and it seemed like she had a disconnect from what a younger person might experience. After a few sessions I decided to stop going and look for another doctor. Unfortunately I pushed it off a little too long and then the COVID-19 quarantine kicked in which has made it really hard to find someone new.

These last few days, I've noticed myself becoming more and more anxious and uncomfortable with everything going on. I'm becoming irritable with my family, I'm eating less, and I'm constantly worrying about even the smallest of things. I feel like this pandemic has taken away my ability to have control of my life - probably because that's exactly what's happened, but I'm still struggling with this. 

I can't go out and get an in-person doctor's appointment, but I was thinking about finding an online appointment and seeing if a doctor would recommend a medical marijuana card for me (it's legal in my state).  But I'm worried about not only the idea of being rejected but also causing rifts with my parents as they are not the most pro-marijuana people. I'm also concerned about putting my future job offer in jeopardy - I'm not sure if the company drug tests and while I've made a few good connections at the company, I'm not sure if it would be a poor reflection on me to ask a question like that. I've stayed away from recreational pot use for a year now just so I wouldn't be in a risky position should an employment drug test arise.

I don't know if I should ask someone at the company what the policy is. I don't know if I'm overreacting. But I feel like I'm unable to deal with anxiety with my usual tactics of distraction since all I can really do is sit and contemplate all of this shit that's happening. Does anyone have any advice or thoughtful input to help me decide what to do?

**TLDR - my anxiety is starting to spike during this pandemic, I'm entertaining the thought of applying for a medical marijuana card (in a legal state) but am unsure if I should due to family/housing issues as well as my future employment. I usually deal with anxiety by distracting myself with friends and loved ones but that's not really an option at this point due to the quarantine. What do I do with all this shit?**",14Apr2020,2
642,"Hi, 

I was just thinking about this. I am 28. I have a comfortable job in hospital management. I was going to go back to school for a masters in business. I think learning a trade like programming would be great or at least understanding the trade. I was thinking of switching to a masters in computer science and engineering. But I don't know much about the area. I would like some recommendations on where to get more information or some insight on personal experience. I have always been interesting in sciences and robotics. I have a degree in chemistry. I was wondering if I still can get in. Most masters in computer science and engineering programs, I assume it isn't like business school. You go from undergrad directly? Or basically, if I would like to get into that field, how would you recommend I do that? Masters in Business and try to get a job at a company and work around it?

646,"I don't fit in anywhere, and I'm not sure what to do about it. When I was in school (before quarantine) I always had trouble with conversations. I used to be in a different school with lots of very, very close friends, like honestly probably my soulmates but in a platonic way, we were that close. I used to he able to talk to them for hours and hours and I would never get tired of talking or worry about what to say next. But now that I'm in this new school with new people and a vastly different social culture than the one in my previous school, I can't seem to relate to anybody.

648,"[Sorry, this a long post but the details are important]

Me(24F) and my bestfriend(25F) have been friends since my jr year of high school. This year will be our 8th year of friendship and I’m honestly thinking of ending the union of 8 years because of her selfish ways and low vibration. My bf has severe self esteem issues, childhood trauma, family drama, alcoholism, depression, and I feel she’s sucking the life out of me. I identify with a lot of her issues because I have some of them as well but I’m working on changing myself for the better and healing from my trauma while my bestfriend runs away from her problems. Here’s just a couple of situations that have happened in our friendship that are red flags that are red flags:

1. My bestfriend Stopped talking to me for 6 months at the beginning of our friendship because I couldn’t do her hair for her birthday. Reason being that I wasn’t driving yet (I was in HS @ the time) and my mom didn’t want to drive me to her house even though that was the plan (It had just snowed in our city and my mom is terrified of driving in snow due to black ice which is understandable). My bf wasn’t driving either at the time. She called me after 6 months to reignite the friendship but never apologized nor acknowledged what happened. 

2. A couple of months ago she called me while I was on the way home from driving to work after being told I wasn’t needed for the day (I was kind of  irritable because i wasted gas when I could’ve still been sleep lol). While i was driving, my check engine light came on which stressed me out more because i didn’t have the money to get my car fixed and didn’t know when i would have it. It didn’t help that my hours were being cut at my new job. My bestfriend called me to tell me about some drama that happened at work. Despite everything I had going on, I still listened to and reassured her and made jokes with her to lighten up her mood. She got off the phone because she was at work and called me back a little while later. She asked what I was doing and I told her I was taking my car to the auto shop to see what was my best option. I guess I didn’t sound like I was at my happiest so she hurried up and got off the phone with me. It kind of hurt my feelings bc it’s like i have to help her deal with her problems but when it comes to my issues I’m all alone, but honestly I’m used to it. A few weeks later her car ended up completely breaking down and who do you think she called repeatedly to vent? ME! I even drove an hour away to pick her up from work.

3. She calls me 1-2 times everyday usually to vent and talk about her problems or to joke, gossip and talk about other people. Not only that but she thinks nothing to call me at 6,7,8 in the morning. I make it a point to enforce boundaries and not answer usually during those hours and she’ll still call. She KNOWS I’m not a morning person. The only time I regularly allowed this is when I got my first salaried position with an hour long commute. We both left for work at the same time and both drove an hour to work so it was cool to have someone to talk to during the morning rush. It was also hard not to answer because she knew i had time to talk. I don’t work that job and those hours anymore but she’ll still call me that early sometimes even though she knows I’m not up that early if i don’t have to be. I’m starting to see that it doesn’t matter, if she has a problem or needs to vent she’s going to call. It’s to the point that if she were to call with a dire emergency, I wouldn’t really know because she calls that much and at inconvenient times. Just recently when i ignored one of her calls, she  messaged me on FB telling me to call her when i can. Being naive, I thought she was in some sort of emergency and needs help. Soon as I called her back, I find out she just wants to vent about something her granny said that pissed her off.

4. On top of that, everyday after work we would talk to each other on the way home. So imagine that, every morning and everyday after work we would talk to each other Monday-Friday. I’ll admit a big factor that comes into play would be the toxicity of my first salaried position. I was so depressed and hated every second but i needed the money. During this time I vented more than usually even though my bestfriend would still change the subject and not give my problems much attention as I gave hers. It just felt good to get it out after being bottled up for 9 hrs and i couldn’t afford therapy. Even though we talked so frequently she would still want to hang out at any chance. It’s like she was kind of obsessed/ possessive over me and wanted to spend all her time with me instead of working on fixing her problems. At this point I was working on fixing my situation and starting my business. I felt like me hanging out with her was taking away from progress towards my goals, especially towards saving because when I’m around my bf she’LL usually just wanna smoke, drink, and ride around. She’s always broke but will still find a way for these things and constantly borrows money from everyone she knows to support her habits.

5. Last year I started being fwb with one of the guys she calls “bestfriend”. They have a platonic friendship from HS and never dated or anything like that. Our fwb situation wasn’t anything serious, just casual sex and we would smoke together occasionally. After we started messing around my bestfriend would make it a point to read me his Facebook statuses even though I didn’t ask her to and I don’t have him as a friend on FB. Some of the statuses she read from him where kind of derogatory and jokingly mean, but there was no context that insinuated that he was referencing me. And honestly I didn’t care because like I said it was fling. I don’t know why but this was a red flag for me. I felt my bestfriend was somewhat jealous and wanted me to feel embarrassed but I refused to give her the reaction she was looking for. I would never think to read her ex’s FB statuses to her bc I honestly don’t care. And truly, I wouldn’t have to because she reads his posts herself even though they’ve been broken up for years and only fuck every now and again and he has a child by another woman. She reads the babymama’s statuses too.

6. Just recently I lost my contract job of 2 months due to Coronavirus. I’ve yet to receive any unemployment or any sort of assistance and I’m still expected to pay bills. I’m not complaining because I feel things are going to work out but I’m extremely stressed due to finances. I used up my savings after quitting that toxic salary job and I was just about to get on my feet with my new job when this all happened. I’m surviving and paying bills by doing Instacart and Postmates, which is sort of putting a lot of strain on my body from having to do so many orders everyday. I try to stay off my phone when I’m doing orders due to me accidentally mixing up 2 customers orders when I first started and having to drive for over an hour to fix the issue. My bf is an essential worker and is still employed, she only lost her PT weekend retail job. She was still calling me 1-2 times a day but I eventually had to text &amp; tell her that I needed some time to myself because I’m tired, stressed, and trying to put energy into filling out job apps &amp; benefits and starting my side hustles. I also just didn’t have the energy to listen to her complain and vent  anymore esp since I’m going through so much. On top of this, a few months ago i had to take my oldest brother’s 2 son’s (3 months &amp; 3 yo) in the home i share with mom due to a CPS case so I’m going through a lot right now. Despite me telling her I needed some space, she started back with the calling marathon a couple days later, like 2-3 days later. At this point I became really annoyed and didn’t want to talk at all. I started ignoring her calls and she would call even more. I gave in a few days later and answered her call and we talked( i don’t remember the convo). She went back to the calling marathon and I texted her again that I needed some alone time. I guess she got mad because she didn’t even respond back. I felt bad and ended up calling her the next night after finishing IC orders but she didn’t answer. The next morning I guess she saw my missed call and proceeded to call me at 6:38am and 8:45am. I texted her once I got up around 11am that I was sorry that I missed her call but that I was sleep. I went to do some IC orders and she called me again at 1:30pm. I told her that I would call her later on because I was doing Instacart. I was short on my rent and needed to make quite a bit of money. I called her later that night and she didn’t answer and hadn’t called me since.

I contemplated calling her again but I feel like I’m giving into her games. At this point I’m really reevaluating if this a meaningful friendship. I’m not sure what I really get out of it but i know I give a lot. Even when i express my problems and vent i don’t get much feedback because she doesn’t have that much emotional intelligence, she’s still sort of childlike. For my 24th birthday i didn’t get a single thing from anyone but i went out of my way to celebrate my best friend’s 25th even though I’d just quit my job and shouldn’t have been spending any money. I just wanted to bring her some sort of joy esp since everyone else disappointed her. I didn’t complain about not getting anything for my bday because I’m used to it but I can’t help but notice a pattern. I’ve also helped my bf financially, but once again, different story for a different day. 

Though nice and funny, my bf is very greedy (i didn’t get expand on this trait of hers in this post. Different story for a diff day),selfish, and tends to run away from her problems and throw them on me. I know she needs help and I want to help her, but I also need help and I feel that I should help myself first and focus on me since I’ve had to build myself back up after dealing with so many energy vampires in the past couple years. At this point I’m 24 and she’s 25, we’re not in high school anymore. I can see she uses me as a void since she’s unhappy with her life and I’m overly empathetic and a listener. I have plans to heal from my trauma, become an entrepreneur and create an empire and joyous life and I don’t see how I can fit my bf in my future if she doesn’t change her behavior, which I don’t feel she plans to since she’s been this way since I met her 8 years ago. I’ll admit I’ve held on this long because I’m afraid if I end the friendship she’ll go deeper in depression and alcoholism.

What do you all think? I know I tend to be overly emotional and dramatic sometimes lol so I would like honest feedback. Thanks✨",14Apr2020,2

651,"I (M25) enjoy working out, before all this pandemic stuff happened I was attending the gym around 4 times a week with a day of rest in the middle. I decided at the beginning of lockdown and working from home, I would work on my cardio and start running. At the time my housemate (F26) said she wasn't interested in running. Fine by me, no issue at all. 

The first time I went for a run however, she decided to tag along. Again, no problem, or so I thought. I have a very relaxed attitude to excercise, having not worked on cardio much for the months prior I was planning on easing into it. My housemate had other ideas and started to push more than I was comfortable, eventually she ran in ahead and I returned to the pace I was comfortable with. I caught up eventually and she continues to berate me about how I should run more, quicker, push myself etc it felt like running with a drill sergeant. 

She now likes to bring it up, remind me of how I can't run for more then 5 minutes, that I'll lose all my progress from the gym, I'll put on weight, etc. I think she's trying to motivate me, but honestly it makes me feel awful about myself and has killed any and all motivation I had. I haven't excercised or worked out in a couple of weeks now. I'm not the most secure person, I'm a little over sensitive, I get anxiety attacks and struggle with my self esteem and self confidence. It's something I'm finally working on with a therapist.

I sent it yesterday night, she saw it, and still hasn't replied, same situation from my dad, my aunties and uncles would have not hesitated to say no but my own parents are doing this to me, They've been doing this to me for the 1.4 years I've dated, always shown some kind of 'ugh' towards the idea of mixed race blood in our family tree, even though my cousins are dating mix raced people and my cousins parents are very supportive, my parents are not, and at first was out right against it but now its just silence, feels like I cant even talk about my gf next to them.",14Apr2020,1
655,"So heres the deal.

I was somewhat romantically involved with one of my coworkers at one point. Nothing beyond making out though. I couldn't give her the commitment she wanted, so I told her that, and we decided to break it off. 

I left my job for an extended stay in another country, but due to coronavirus, was forced to return.

This is the kind of job where we live at the same place we work. So we are coworkers but also housemates in a way. 

While i was away, this coworker got in an extremely intense argument with the other workers there and now she cordons herself off and doesn't talk to them at all. 

These other coworkers are friends of mine, but she claims they've deeply mistreated her while I was away. I didn't see any thing so it's all word of mouth. Since I got back I haven't seen mistreatment of any kind. She refuses to tell me any details of what happened, so I'm completely in the dark. 

She's an extremely intense person emotionally. When she saw me hanging out with the other workers she got very upset, got me alone and told me she ""didn't like what she was seeing and she'd have to cut off contact with me"" if she saw more of that behavior. 

Of course I didn't want to pick sides in this battle so I basically said ""That's your decision but I can't live here and isolate my self from all my coworkers just because you feel mistreated."" 

So I keep hanging out with my coworkers because what the hell else am I going to do. 

A couple days later she gets me alone again and says she can't communicate with me anymore. She demands if I have anything to say to her. I say ,"" uh... I wish you no harm but I guess you have to do what you have to do."" 

So I stop communicating with her completely out of respect, and keep hanging out with the other people. 

Not 2 days later she sends me a text ""We need to talk, let me know when you are free""  with no explanation. 

WTF? There's that sinking feeling again.

I need to emphasize that this is strictly a no-romance workplace, it's considered a firing offense, so she has that over me - she could spill the beans over our former romantic escapades and really hurt my reputation. I don't think she cares about her own here, since she's already basically an outcast. 

But I have no idea what to do. Obviously I don't want to give in to her demands either. I feel like she's manipulating me emotionally and it's really freaking me out. 

I just want to do my job and eat my food and go to sleep but this woman is making all this drama for me. How to deal. 

Thx",14Apr2020,2
656,"Her, and my BIL were doing something I didnt like, and I'm sure most people wouldnt like. Hopefully, shes considered, and rethought after I talked to her about it, but she said in cooler days, my BIL will bring their dog with them to sit in the car, whil my BIL works. She said he goes out, and takes him on poddy breaks, and leaves water with the dog, but I'm thinking ""cooler"" might be a lot warmer then my version of cooler. I texted her, and told her my concerns, and that I could come, and check on the dog at home (they'd have to leave the dog in a crate, that's why my BIL take the dog with him) or that I could come get the dog, and take care if it for the day, and that leaving it in the car is a risk. She essentially said that shes tired of me acting like everyone's an awful dig owner, and that she doesnt see a problem with keeping the dog in the car on a cooler day. I then asked what she considers a cooler day. She said that shes not gonna tell me, because I'm just gonna go on the internet, and tell her shes wrong. My guess is cooler to her is more than what the internet says is safe to keep a dog in a car. I just left it at that, because I didnt want to argue with her anymore. I wanted to try in let her know that it was wrong, but she doenst think so (or maybe she does, and that's why she for offended).

659,"Hey all  


So, here's my current situation. I'm a full-time student that has been working at a warehouse for 3 plus years. I have got to the point the only thing keeping me from quitting is the money. The job is very mind-numbing and isolating and due to social distancing rules it has become even more so. Some days are really bad on my mental health due to being isolated for 8 hours a day. I have been doing therapy provided by the university and I went on a rant about all the negative feelings that I have fostered from working my job where its to the point where I'm jaded by it. It scares me. I just want to have a job that doesn't make me feel subhuman, and that I don't dread clocking in.

At this point I feel like I have worked there so long that there is nothing left for me there, and it just brings up a lot of negative feelings whenever I show up for my shift. However, I fear that I won't be able to find a job if I leave due to how bad the job market is looking these days (with no hope of improving in the near future?). I have some savings to stay alive for a few months but I don't want to have to use up my savings trying to look for a job.

660,Basically the title explains it. My roommate started getting aggressive with me over minor things in December when I was home for Christmas (we both live in different states than our parents for college). I have tried to go to court to get a protective order after she sent me texts threatening me and my belongings in the common area. It wasn’t granted due to the judge saying something more physical had to happen. She has done this twice now (not including her going into the common area to talk loudly on the phone about how she wants to fight me and break my things if I hadn’t moved everything to my room). Today she tried to push her way into my room and stopped only when she noticed I had someone else in my room. She then continued to bang on my door (which I got a few seconds of on video but I was too slow to catch everything). Is there anything I can do?

662,"I live in the South of the US and it seems like everyone here is a Christian. Everytime I enroll in a new semester at college, there will always be a discussion about religion and my classmates always get me roped into it. For example, one girl last semester tried to get me to believe Jesus by sending texts on Bible quotes and how Jesus loves me etc. She made rude remarks about how my unhappiness came from not reading the Bible. I really wanted to curse her out, but I had to compose myself. I’m agnostic but leaning towards other non-traditional beliefs rather than the mainstream here, should I lie and pretend I love Jesus and that I’m Christian to get them off my back? Because I once explained my position, and I was ostracized from the entire class because of it. Also people ask me questions like “What did I do on Christmas?” Or other religious holidays, and I always tell them I don’t celebrate these holidays.

Disclaimer: This is a rant / story + questions. I don't really talk to people about my problems but i reckon people wouldn't care either way so might as well get it off my chest.  


Hello r/Advice , I am a 23 year old immigrant somewhere from Asia. I migrated here in North America when I was only 16-17ish. Before migrating, I've already finished High School in one of the top schools back in my home country; I had a solid plan about my future, I want to be a sailor. I want to go around the planet, explore places, learn different cultures and different languages, meet friends and all that exciting stuff; but that all changed when I got here.  


First, I was told that I can't apply for College/University program because my High school diploma is not recognized by the board because the curriculum of the two countries are different. Second, I nor my parents were aware how schools work here. So I was told to take an assessment exam and they thought that they should put me back in grade 10 because my English wasn't the best, like what are they expecting from a literal Fresh off the boat immigrant who just arrived a week ago?   


And so my post-adolescence-ish High school experience starts and I am now bound to a class room with kids 2-3 years younger than me; for some, this might be not an issue, but for someone who came from Asia, this is a lot of stress--repeating high school...friends / peers being ahead of you... I literally lost all motivation to study, I've became the lazy Asian kid who succumbed to playing League of Legends. For 2 years, I wasn't even trying to, but I just keep passing the classes; not with the very best marks tho. Then this other immigrant kid that really studied a lot, does 100 math questions in a day kind of asian kid, really inspired me--So for my senior year, I tried my 70% in studying...but my marks in the past 2 years weren't good enough to get me a spot in a good uni. I was told I'm a disappointment by my own guidance councilor etc. I was sad, Depressed, and I Just wept. I really have no ideas anymore, no plan ahead of me anymore, just a young man slowly fading away.   


I thought maybe, I would like Electrical job, since I like building weird shit when I combine my toys when I was younger, I enjoy experimenting with batteries and small motors; so I took Electrical in College. Things were going smoothly... then I got a girlfriend...\*\*\*Dunn! dunn! dunndunn!\*\*\*  
to cut the story short, we be banging and not studying. Marks dropped, classes failed, retakes etc.   
She then decides to make it more interesting and cheated on my ass, now I'm dumb, lazy, and no clue what to do with my life. Oh, did I mention she also called the cops on me because I've told everyone she's a cheater so I got arrested for ""punching her"" (Not gonna lie, I lost my cool and rage took over me. I admit my mistake and I've took responsibility for my actions.)  which made my life more miserable. Now, what am I again? Lazy, dumb, a disappointment, and a criminal.   


I stopped school for a year because I was removed from the college and as of today, I am still in probation.  For the whole year of 2019, all I hope was for things to go back when things were normal, when I was just dumb and lazy, so I worked and saved money for tuition and when the school academic probation was lifted last January, I re-enrolled myself without thinking whether I want to go back to this course or not...Then I realized I don't want to be in this course anymore, getting good marks doesn't excite me, listening to ""new"" ideas no longer makes me curious, this program and me are over but I'm trying to finish it because life is hard without a diploma; but I really don't think I want to do this any further. Right now, during the quarantine and pandemic, I have so much time to contemplate about my life, but my mind is just sooooooo full of doubts about my own capabilities, so full of questions and so much--sooo much fear of what kind of useless I will be next.  I am literally just scraping by to get this semester done, and I might stop studying again; but if I fail this sem I will be kicked out of college for good, so that's more stress and worry (I'm trying, I really am).  I recently felt like I want to do my original plan, to go around the world etc; so I thought, maybe I'll teach English back in Asia? Maybe I can be an English teacher (heh, so ironic. my life turned around because of my English skills now I want to teach English? Lmao. ) So I thought I'm going to take TEFL or CELTA; but then it says I'm mostly NOT gonna get a job without a degree.... so now I'm struggling to pass this semester and hopefully not get kicked out. There are so much things to consider, my parent's opinion in this, etc.   


Has anyone been in this kind of position in life,  where you feel like you have nowhere to go anymore? You feel stuck? You feel like you were never meant for anything good?   


I will respect everyone's opinion.   
I just need an advice from anyone, any motivation.  
I just feel so, lost and desperate to change. I want to change.  
I want to be better; I want to help myself, and help others.

666,"I have a complicated family situation that I need advice on:

So I'm a 15 yr old female and I have two younger brothers who are 3 and 12 and an older sister who is 16. So both my parents, especially my dad, have anger issues. They can lose their temper easily and my dad gets violent when he does lose it. His last anger episode was around two weeks ago. We were sitting in our living room when he suddenly lost his temper because my sister spoke back to him. He threw a plate across the room at her and it broke but thankfully missed. He then got up and slapped her and then came to me and slapped me even though I hadn't said a word during the whole thing. My mother did not try to interfere; she simply took our 3-yr old brother to another room to keeps him out of it. After my dad had cooled down, my mom actually said it was my sister's fault for speaking up to him. I just think it's very unfair for us to get treated this way because my sister hadn't even raised her voice at him. She was just calling for my 12 yr old brother who was in another room, my dad accused her of yelling at us, she said ""Seriously?"" and then he lost his temper. This is just one of many times this has happened and when I asked others for help, they recommended calling social services. There are many reasons I cannot do this.

First, even though my parents can easily lose their temper and get violent, they're really nice otherwise and I just don't think it's the right thing to do.

Second, I know my whole family would hate me if I did that. I once mentioned it to my sister and she immediately started yelling at me about how my parents love even though they are violent sometimes and it would break their hearts if we were taken away from them. I know for a fact she's right but to me, the times they do lose their tempers overrules the times they are nice to us.

Third, if I called social services, I would have no proof of them abusing us and I don't know if my siblings will tell the truth. And as soon as my parents find out I've called social services they will definitely become more physically abusive.

So, right now my plan is to finish high school, graduate, and cut all ties with them. The only problem is, I currently have no funding for college and I mean NONE. Like $0. Also I'm planning to get a job this summer but my parents refuse to open a saving account for me and say any money I make will go into the family banking account, and I am absolutely sure that it's not going for my college. Also once I'm out of high school and cut ties with them, they're going to get real mad and I know they will take it out on my two younger brothers and that is the last thing I want happening.

I'm just really confused because my future is so unclear and I don't want to live with them for any longer than I have to but I also don't want to hurt my siblings in the process. I also don't know if I'm over-reacting because even if they do get physical, they've never caused serious injuries or anything like that.

To give you an idea of what they're like here are stories of times they've lost their tempers.

Once my dad got mad at me for slamming a door in the bathroom so he barged in, started screaming at me, and lifted me by my head (i wan't naked or anything I was just going to brush my teeth.) That was one of the few times my mom came in to stop him.

Another time my dad had come home from work and I was sitting on the couch reading a book. He got mad at me for ""disrespecting"" him because I didn't look up to face him when I said hi. I got a slap in the face and I wasn't allowed to sit down for the rest of the day and had to remain standing.

My mom once got mad at my brother for speaking back to her when he was 11 so threw him down to the ground and kicked him. It did hurt but there was no bruise or broken bones.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to mention that even though they do get violent, these things only happen around 6 times a year, so that's one of the reasons I hesitate to go to social services. Again, I don't know if I'm over-reacting. So far, they've never hurt my 3 year old brother physically\_only verbally.

I should've mentioned this earlier but we're refugees who moved to the US five years ago so we don't have any other family here. All family friends do not know about the situation and think we're ""the perfect family."" My parents don't interact with any neighbors so if I called social services anonymously they would almost surely know it was one of us kids.

This isn’t the first time this has happened- the last I heard of this he had a mental breakdown and was taken to hospital for observation. I am unsure what time he was let back inside the house-his partner is a piece of work…heartless and selfish. 

Our circle of friends have tried approaching the subject for about 2 years now, but he mostly deflects the subject.

I like programming but only to an extent, not really sure if I can handle programming that well compared to the other students and also not sure if I can do programming as a career.

682,"I have a friend; let's call her S. 

She's been a good friend of mine for 2 years or so and we've gotten very close. She has extreme insecurities because of the people she's been surrounded with constantly berating her and making her feel unworthy of relationships, bullying her physique, etc.

She got on Tinder with me at some point in time and we were both doing incredibly well, she more than I. This was an extreme ego boost for her, since she felt valued as a person, and felt incredibly attractive. The problem is though, the feeling was temporary. She needed to sort of ""replenish"" that feeling with a new guy to unhealthily obsess over (and by obsess, I mean find their family's Facebook, their best friends' social media, etc).

She recently started texting a guy whom she believed to have liked a lot. This would've been her first proper crush, since she's very anti-relationship too, so the feelings were new to her. Turns out they were also temporary, but she is insistent on talking to him in a non-platonic fashion, despite knowing he is incredibly interested.

S has the need to be complimented; even though she gets disgusted by it, she thrives off the attention. He is the only guy that hasn't physically complimented her to this day, and it's driving her senile. I'm literally cringing as I'm typing this, because I never pictured her to act this way.

She wasn't necessarily nice to him either. She said she had a type for tall buff guys, knowing his height was average, and her sarcasm isn't that easy to read over text unless you've spoken to her so she sounded like a dick in a lot of screenshots. She also blatantly COMPLAINED to him about guys that messaged her with compliments. OF COURSE HE ISN'T GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH COMPLIMENTING HER.

The advice part comes right here. I have no clue what to tell her. She wants the normal girl advice on what to text, but I don't want to indulge that behavior. I keep trying to tell her she's being toxic, and that keeping someone around for validation is hurtful for both sides, but she literally ignores me... as in disregarding the message entirely and changing the subject.

I have no idea what to do, and she's texting me less now because of it. I feel as though she thinks I'm being a dick, but I do have the right intentions, I just don't know how to get it through to her. 

The first step to solving a problem is to recognize it. How on earth do I get her to recognize that she needs to seriously learn some self love instead of trying to get men to simp for her constantly?",14Apr2020,1

Just us 2.” When she said that I was convinced she was meeting with the guy she was talking to. My heart dropped. She continued to act even weirder.

690,"My mother has worked for a company for about half a year. Until recently it's been fine. However the last few weeks my mother has been told they cant her and several other employees for the last few weeks that she has already worked as they're out of money. Its been a fight to get some of the money she is entitled to as the boss found out about a private group chat between employees where his name was slandered due to this lack of pay and communication and due to this he fired my mother and several others - this is unprofessional as it was a private chat used  in out of work hours that he had no business snooping around in.

There was a meeting today between the employer and the staff to discuss the sudden firing and the missing pay. During this meeting he verbally attacked my mother and the other female employees, using deeply personal insults, belittling and humiliating them and lying about things he had allegedly seem and heard over the CCTV and microphones in the workplace to turn friends against each other. He threw some cheques at them and told them to take it or leave it as that's all they're getting. These cheques were a lot less that what they were supposed to be receiving and he told them he didnt care. 

The boiling point for me as a son, was when he threatened them all by saying ""if any of you DARE to try and slander me and my company over social media or if you TRY and sue me or take me to court. I will find you and you will be FINISHED. You will be homeless by the time I'm done with you"". When asked if that was a threat he replied with ""yes it is""

This onslaught of personal attacks, humiliation and general unprofessionalism from an employer, along with the direct threats made have been recorded by multiple people, and we have proof of previous shady instances from him and his company. I do NOT appreciate my mother and her family (ie, me and siblings) being threatened to be 'finished' and made homeless if any legal matters are pursued.

Any advice or help on what I or my mother can do? This man, as both a human and an supposedly professional employer, is a disgrace and needs to get what's coming to him.",14Apr2020,1
691,"Why am I so frequently rejected in life?

I get that this will probably be hard to answer considering no one knows me personally, but I'll do my best to give you the general idea. I live in a small town, I'm a straight, white, and intelligent young man, so theoretically I should have all the advantages in life. I'm somewhat charismatic (not really but I can fake it well enough) and I'm pretty agreeable. I'm also in good shape for my age. Somehow though, I get rejected constantly, to the point where I'm wondering if there is something blatantly wrong with me that no one has ever pointed out before. It's infuriating.

Despite having two years of job experience in fast food, I couldn't get a job anywhere in the past 6 months. I filled out numerous applications for a variety of places, called to make sure they received my application, the whole nine yards, yet not one called me back. Until very recently I'd been turned down romantically by everyone I spoke to, and the more I'm getting to know my current girlfriend I'm afraid that she only started dating me out of kindness. We're really happy together now, but at the beginning of the relationship it's clear she didn't expect me to be a great bf and only really dated me out of pity. When applying to honors programs in college, I was regularly rejected in spite of my high GPA, test scores, and diverse high school club experiences. The final straw cane today when I realized that a group of supposed friends had been deliberately cutting me out of a club that I founded and was an officer in. I did most of the work, planned the events, and even though I knew I was the ""outsider"" of the group I always at least thought they appreciated the work I put into the club.

I know after reading this you might think I'm just an entitled brat who thinks I deserve everything on a silver platter but I really don't. I'm just trying to understand what's going on and how I could improve myself to have a better image or make better first impressions, whatever is wrong with me. Rejection didn't used to be a problem for me; of course it happened but eventually I always found a job, relationship, etc. Anyone have something similar or advice.

Idk what has gotten into her as she kept texting me, calling/chatting me each and every day(no exaggeration) about her drama and her affair until her bf caught them one time. and we all know what happened. 

I thought from that moment that she will change but then when she asked forgiveness from her bf and they reconciled, she went back at it again with her boss. and every day, she be telling me about her drama, her issues, her stalking techniques and I got to the point where I decided she is too toxic, not only to me but she is toxic as she doesn't seem to have the conscience that she is ruining a family

697,"A little background, my mom has never been the homemaker kind of person. She was quite well-off and always had people taking care of her (maids, cooks, etc.) One defining trait / skill she has is that she's very sociable and good with people. Having said this, she's always out (like 90-95% of the week), either at work or on trips with friends. However, due to the recent lockdown situation she's cooped up here at home with me and my siblings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mainly the one who cooks meals but ever since lockdown started, she's volunteered to do the cooking. I thought it was pretty sweet and thoughtful so I let her. Didn't really know what I was expecting but... it wasn't good and most of the time she cooks way too much food. I gave constructive criticisms every time to point her to the right direction (""It was too salty maybe next time you can adjust it or taste it first."", ""It was a bit overcooked, maybe next time you can try cooking it low and slow."", etc.). She takes it well, but she gets irked when we don't finish the meals she prepared or when my other siblings try to cook something additional on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I get pissed too at seeing how much food goes to waste so when it comes to more advanced dishes I tell her I'll be the one who'll do the cooking. But recently it's as if she's putting a stage for it all and says she'll handle it, she read this recipe online / watched a video of it. I get her eagerness but it's not a joke to waste food (especially now when resources are limited and a lot of people are actually struggling to even have a decent meal) but even more so, to force people to eat something that tastes like actual poison.

Even though 2019 wasn't the best year so far, it was far better than 2020 has been this far. I'll try and explain this as best as I can. Last year I was diagnosed with depression, and finally began to be medicated \[Sertralina Zentiva 50mg\], and my goal for last year was to enter college in the major I wanted. Which I did, with flying colors. Everything was okay, I was getting better. My anxiety was getting better and so was my depression.

The first semester didn't go incredibly well. That is because I moved 3 times in that time span. So I thought I'd do better when I was finally settled in my college dorm in January and would get my loge together and pass this semester with good grades. And everything was going fine.

Until mid February. My grandpa wasn't doing well before, but now he was even worse. And let me explain. My grandpa is the most precious person to me. He took care of me since I was just a couple of weeks old while my parents would be working. He was always supportive and just the best person. I was already worried constantly about his condition, but nonetheless I was trying to do my best at college. Unfortunately, my grandpa passed away on the 27th of February. I missed about a week of college because I had to be back at my hometown. I did get to say my goodbye and all that. But still. I lost my most important person.

Of course it's normal to feel down after losing someone. The thing is, then this pandemic started, some issues between my mom and my grandmother keep happening, and I am just generally very stressed and depressed.

I feel like I've gone into a depressive relapse of some kind. Whilst I could get up and attend my online classes for the first month or so \[I've been having them since March 9th\] now I don't have the energy to. Even the classes I loved.

I am ignoring my responsibilities and throwing my college performance down the drain and that just worries me more. But instead of making me want to do better, I just feel more depressed.

I don't know what I should do... It's not easy to see my psychiatrist or talk to a therapist. I also considered emailing my professors. But I am not sure if they would understand. We're all going through a hard time after all...

705,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post here. I’m helpless about everything in life recently and I decided to reach out to you as my very last chance for redemption!


So.. It's a pretty lengthy story, but I'll try to be as straight to point as possible. The problem is Mike, my boyfriend’s brother. (*TL;DR available at the bottom)


March 2016. I (today 23F living in Poland) made some friends in Overwatch: let's say Tim (27M) and Mike (26M) - who were brothers living in England, and Stacy (30F) - living in Hungary. We really got along and played together almost every day. 

May 2016. Tim and I realized we really liked each other and decided to meet irl. But given my chicken nature, I wouldn’t let it happen until a few months later in September. We sometimes would flirt whilst playing with Stacy and Mike, but I always thought we were rather ‘civil’ and that we didn’t do that often. So September came, our ‘date’ went great and we decided to give it a try - even though I had to stay in Poland for another 3 years of my Bachelor’s degree. 

January 2017 - my birthday. Tim gave me Divinity OS2 and inspired others to get it as well so we could all play together. Stacy and Mike loved the idea and we were scheduled to play it after my exams, so they had to wait a couple of weeks. And here is kinda when it starts… So, in 2017 my English wasn’t the greatest and I was extremely insecure about it. I would often mishear or misunderstand what Stacy and Mike said to me if it wasn’t in text (as I spoke to Tim a bit more often I got used to his voice quicker). Also, my vocabulary was rather limited. Which is why I was scared that when playing Divinity I would only slow us down and annoy everyone. Besides, I was the only person from the group that hadn’t played any games from the series before, so I didn’t know anything about the mechanics. In the end, I asked Tim a day before our scheduled session to show me around and explain the main objectives so I wouldn’t look dumb.

The next day Stacy and Mike were being late to the session. I don’t remember the details, but iirc Mike texted something weird and salty in our group chat on Discord. So I asked both Stacy and Mike individually what was going on and it turned out that Mike saw on Steam that Tim and I had played Divinity the night before and he felt left out, which sounded understandable and I immediately felt sorry. I apologised to him and tried to explain that we’d done that so I wouldn’t be a burden and that we hadn’t even gone past the character creator. But he blew up and ended the conversation calling me a ‘fake bitch who only pretends to be nice’ or something. Stacy basically agreed with everything he said. And later they cut off both me and Tim completely - even though Tim and Mike still lived together. Apparently they didn’t talk for half a year after that, that is until their mother told them to finally make up lol. All because of something that seemed like a minor misunderstanding.

I was in shock, because we had never had any fights prior to that. I understand Mike might’ve felt like I was slowly taking his brother away - because ever since we started dating Tim had to split his time between me and Mike - but at the same time I don’t think I deserved that much hatred. 

So, I had tried to fix that multiple times with no result. After a few months, they’d sometimes invite Tim to play Overwatch together and then Tim would drag me along, but they would never even acknowledge my existence - they would never say hi or reply to anything I said. I felt a little dehumanized. The ONLY time when they did acknowledge my existence was when I played for the first time in 3-4 months and wanted to try out a new character. They dissed my gameplay in a non-ranked match and would constantly tell me to switch off my hero if I ‘couldn’t handle it’. In just one 8-minute match! Tim wouldn’t even say anything in my defense, he was quiet. So I just left the game and texted him to never invite me to their sessions again because I didn’t need that toxicity and they had crossed the line.

Actually, until that point I had never met Mike in person. Our first meeting was when I met their parents…

Christmas 2018. I was supposed to spend them with Tim and Mike’s family. I was a little anxious, but at the same time hopeful that maybe if Mike and I met in person he’d finally see that I’m not that bad and he’d give me a chance.

When I arrived at their house their parents were the only ones to come to meet me. On that day I only saw him for a second - when he rushed to the kitchen for a drink, pretending not to see me. Even though his parents and I were chatting in the same corridor he had to go through! When his mother told him to greet me he only mumbled ‘hi’ and disappeared.

Long story short whenever I visited Tim’s house - which has happened quite a few times by now - I would always try to talk to Mike whenever Tim wasn’t there, but he would always run away from me. He wasn’t necessarily mean, but rather distant and was waiting for any chance to get out of the conversation. I’d even give him little gifts for various occasions, such as Valentine’s Day, or him getting a new job, etc. - always with no luck. I even let him win in Scrabble lol (I used to play in tournaments so I guess it wasn’t that easy to beat me). Ah, too bad.

September 2019. My life has changed forever - my only sister died in a tragic accident, caused by her husband who had been like a brother to me. Tim isn’t the most socially aware person and it took him over a month to inform his family about my loss - which was extremely weird as my parents already treat him like a son and always ask about him, etc. Why wouldn’t his family want to know about something this important? I’m his first girlfriend and at that point we had been together for 2 years and we had spent multiple holidays with each other’s families. Eh… But as soon as his parents found out, they even sent flowers to put on her grave - even though they had never met her, which really meant a lot to me and was a nice gesture. Whilst Tim’s brother never bothered to call me or text me with condolences - and we used to be friends years ago! Heck, I remember telling them both and Stacy about the wedding and how beautiful it was (it took place a couple of months after we all met online), how happy my big sis was that everything went exactly as she had planned... Eh, my sister was just a few months older than Tim. It’s truly made all the bad memories about Mike come back to me. 

Christmas 2019. Tim visited my house this time and, to my surprise, brought a present from his brother. I have no idea how can you not ever call after someone’s loss, but still buy them a gift. We really hadn’t spoken for months. So why?

Easter 2020. I have been in dark places recently. My cousin has attempted suicide, my mother’s best friend’s daughter committed suicide and didn’t even have a proper goodbye because of the pandemic. My dream about a postgraduate degree in the UK has been ruined by a mix of Brexit and the coronavirus. And no one seems to acknowledge that I’m still mourning - my family assumes that just because I still get decent grades and have a cool job I’m fine, but I’m far, far from it. Probably my friends are what’s the worst about the situation - they don’t talk to me anymore because I was ‘too depressive’ after what happened whilst I should already be ‘over it’. One of my friends even tried to imply she had it worse because her nearly 100yo great-grandma died a month before my sister and she was ‘the Queen Elizabeth of the family’ - ? Of course every death is tragic, but I dare to say there is a difference between a woman who’s probably tasted everything in life and my sister who died at just 27yo 2 DAYS before moving into her dream house which had been in development for the past 2 years! The said friend never said she was sorry about my loss, she instantly changed the topic to her grandma. Instead of ‘I’m sorry’ it was literally ‘you know, I’ve lost someone too *insert a whole sob story whilst I was only allowed to say one sentence ‘my sister has passed away’*’. Ehh… So, the reason why I’m saying this is that I want to highlight how much I sometimes miss the good old times when Tim, Mike, Stacy and I were still buddies and would play every day to kill our loneliness. Therefore I’m very sensitive about this topic…

So, given my not the best mental state, I’m always happy to hear Tim proposing to play together. I myself just don’t think about it now, even though I really need another human being not to go crazy. 

However, on Easter Sunday I did think about it. So, I implied that I’d play some Overwatch in the afternoon. And then, it turned out that he was already invited to play by Stacy and Matt who I believed were already out of the picture as I hadn’t heard about them in a while. And then I experienced a mix of emotions - definitely overreacted but I couldn’t help it - Tim went to play with the enemy whilst I’m suffering during the first Easter without my sister. I felt betrayed. I tried the best I could not to be a bitch about it, but it didn’t quite work. When he invited me to play with them I just replied with ‘no way’ and then something about playing alone being awesome (childish, I know). As he didn’t text anything back and I saw he wasn’t online in Overwatch, I checked Steam to see what he was up to. And, of course, Divinity. The cursed game which in the end we only played in two and still haven’t completed it. He played it with Stacy and Matt, after all we’d gone through, after them bullying me and never trying to reunite in any way. I felt completely neglected. After Tim was done I shared my thoughts with him and he acknowledged my feelings. 

So, the big question is - is there any way to make Mike talk to me like to a normal human being again? I suffer greatly, as - even though I’m a loner - I’ve always enjoyed my family life. And now I lost my sister, her potential children - which she had always wanted to have many of, and I definitely will never speak ever again to her husband or his family (which I also knew pretty well: his brother was my prom partner, and their mother was just awesome and would always bring me pressies from abroad where she lived at the time). I want to be on good terms with Mike and be able to hang out together again. I’m sorry for having made him feel left out when I started dating Tim, but I really did my best to make up for it and I don’t think I deserve this much spite. And I still can’t believe that Stacy took part in that unnecessary drama given her age, instead of being the adult and trying to fix us all - so I guess duck her, she had no reason to do what she did, unlike Mike. 


TL;DR: My boyfriend’s brother and I used to be friends, but then I played Divinity OS2 without him, even though we were supposed to play together. I did that to get the gist of the mechanics which he had known from previous games - I had not, so I was worried about slowing us down. It’s this bad that after 2 years he still doesn’t acknowledge my existence and didn’t even send me condolences after my sister’s death. What can I do?",14Apr2020,1
710,"My dad owns a business, and I'm pretty sure its not doing well right now. I'm a full-time college student that also does work-study.

However, I do have enough saved up and in investments so that I'll be able to kinda make it out until next semester when my job starts again. Idk how long it'll take my dad to recover financially, though. 

He normally helps pay my rent, as I would not be able to afford paying it on a regular basis. This is was written out in his and my mom's divorce papers, as the money he's paying me is child support and other stuff he owes my mom. Knowing this, I'm worried that if my mom finds out that he cant pay me she'll bring the papers into court.

I thought for the longest time that's what I wanted to be (since middle school) and I even was apart of a special STEM academy in my high school but now after having been doing it for 2 years, I don't think I will be happy. I might be content with it, but not happy.

Problem is, I don't know what other major I would be interested in. I've been so set on engineering for the longest time that I never really considered anything else.

However, I do have a passion that, while is very unreliable and unrealistic, is something I feel wholeheartedly about and passionate about. I really enjoy content creation in the form of streaming and YouTube. I'm not really anybody at all in the scene but have been doing it for a while and know that I would love my life if I was able to do that for a living and would put 110% into it. Of course you can't major in content creation so I would still like something to fall back on.

712,"I realize this sounds very naive and lots of people will probably tell me I won’t make it and it’s a horrible idea, but my biggest dream is to move to Southern California to work on films. 

I’ve got some family in Santa Monica I’ve visited a couple times, and I once lived with them for a month over the summer. Ever since then, I’ve felt a connection to the place like nowhere else and I feel homesick for the ocean breeze and the palm trees, and the whole atmosphere. I imagine if I were to move out there they’d let me stay with them for a bit, but the family I have there are also the type of people to try to talk “realistically” with everyone all the time, and I know they mean well and just want to give me good advice, but hell, I’m young now, and if I don’t get there now, when will I ever?

Of course I’d try to get a job before flying/driving out, that way I could pay them some form of rent or compensation or at least buy my own food and that kind of thing. They’d probably be okay with taking care of me for a month or two, but I’d feel guilty about it.

After graduating May 2019 from HS in Chicago, I got a job and had around $5,000 saved up. I’ve had to loan my parents money for bills and costs of living and they’re working on paying me back but in all honesty I’ll probably have to loan them again because their financial situations aren’t the best. I need to get out of here while I can.

I’m supposed to move across the country to a national park to clean hotel rooms with the cost of food and housing taken out of my pay each week, and I hope to save up the money left over without spending any while I work there through September. After my seasonal work there is done, my loose plan is to fly back home to Chicago, visit with family and friends for a couple months while putting everything I need together, and to move to California by the end of January 2021.

I haven’t gone to college yet because I can’t bear the thought of taking classes I hate at community college, and would rather just go into a creative field such as photography or videography, or perhaps writing. If I were to make it to California I’d like to get a job as a Production Assistant on a film set, or any other small job I could get that at least gets my foot in the door. In my off-time, I’d try to set up a photography business or take photos for local bands or anything really.

The Chicago seasons really take a toll on my mental health as it’s shitty here for like 5-6 months of the year, and I hate being cold. I’d like to live where the weather is nicer so I could just get outside with no excuses about being cold. And oh god, I miss the ocean. Not to mention I’ve lived in the same town for my entire 19 years of life and I just can’t take it here anymore.

I really think California is the place for me. I’d be okay living in a studio the size of a closet if it meant I could be closer to my dream place. I’m thinking Glendale might be an okay place? Or maybe the Southbay area? I also think just going somewhere I know I feel healthy at will allow me to branch out, try different jobs and find out what I might ACTUALLY want to go to school for, or not go to school for and just start making things, even if it’s all behind the scenes.

Heck, if I lose all my money it’d not like I have much saved up anyway and I’m not even 20, why should I wait to start pursuing my dreams?",14Apr2020,1

My computer setup is downstairs and that's where all my friends are online waiting to play. However, my family says I'm spending too much time on the computer and I need to spend time with them.

Sure, fair argument. (I spend wayy too much time on it) 

But when I do hang out with them, they all sit on their phones with the TV on. It feels like everyone is spending time alone in the same room. No one really speaks, and the channel has to stay on the news so there is nothing new to talk about.

Should I ditch my family for my own benefit? Or should I sacrifice my time sitting in a quiet living room?",14Apr2020,1
723,"So a couple months back I (21M) moved in with a ""friend""(20M) of mine whom I met at work. We were really good friends at first and even hung out outside of work a few times. He didn't drink or smoke or anything and he was very pure. I was looking for a roommate at the time and decided to ask him. He was up for it so we moved in together along with another mutual friend.

 The first night we moved in he invited some people over which was odd because we hadn't even gotten our furniture situation set up yet and that night he had started smoking for the first time. That's where the problem started. Some time goes by and he is now a full fledged stoner. But he was the type to leave his blunt wraps and guts on the table and not clean up after himself. That was strike one. He hasn't bought groceries since the ENTIRE time we have been moved in. It's been 4 months already I believe, another thing to mention is that I just broke up with my ex a couple months back and since then I have been getting word that he has been hitting on my ex for sometime and she is completely weirded out about it. When I found that out I completely lost him as a friend.

 Last month, the rent for march, he was a bit late on but nothing too crazy. Still brought to my attention. I heard from my other roommate that he had been calling into work because he just simply didn't feel like working that day which is completely uncool and immature of him. either way, he got march rent and utilities paid. Then, Covid-19. He got laid off but instantly got another job as a pizza delivery driver. This was a week before April rent was due. I asked him multiple times when he would have rent and all he could say was ""soon, I'll have it soon"" after the first he still hasn't sent me a penny of rent. yet he has been working, buying food from to go places. He will buy pizza non stop. and not even get it for free from his job. He goes to a completely different pizza shop and spends over 20 bucks each time. He buys weed, alcohol, etc. so he has money. but why doesn't he have his rent money?

 On top of that, since this lock down has been in effect, he will still have people over. Every time I will kindly ask him to not invite people over and respect my decision. should be understandable since their is a pandemic happening right now. Yet he doesn't listen. He had friends over again last night. And now, on top of that. it is already the 14th of April and he has yet to pay a single dime of rent. I texted him over social media about when i'll be getting rent and he ended up blocking me. And since I've been continually telling him not to have people over, he will go over to friends houses. which isn't any much better. I want to take legal action but I don't know how to approach it. I live in Texas by the way so this will be Texas laws I have to follow.",14Apr2020,2

I have no problem with starting small and working for us to be all right and look into universities in her state later on.

Younger bro is an idiot that hangs out with idiots.

My brothers mate lets call him **H**, owes people money $2500, those people contacted my brother through Facebook and asked him where **H** lives etc they want to talk to him.... my brother... doesn't think any of it is a big deal and gets in the car with them, they drive to H's house. **H** refuses to come outside. **Hs** mother says she will give them the money tomorrow.

They now take my brother to an abandoned place and beat the shit out of him and show him their guns etc tell him there gonna shoot him and your family if you go the police. They want him to hand over his car but the car is registered in my sisters name.

They drive to parents house to get registration papers, tell my mother that my brother hit their car and they refuse to get it fixed through insurance, they want the car. They will be back tomorrow for the registration papers.

Younger brother is in hospital and refuses to tell police, we live in Australia btw.

I don't know any of the people after my brother, I don't know **H** either

Call the cops or let them take the car? Neither my brother or my mother want to involve the police, is it my call to make?

726,"My bf (32m) is CONSTANTLY helping his older (40ish) sister. 

It’s been a frustration to me for a long time now and I recently brought up several points of this issue to my bf. He doesn’t agree with me and thinks I shouldn’t be upset about it bc he’s not. But it makes me so angry to see him be treated the way he is. He says I don’t understand bc I don’t have siblings. I think she is using him and taking advantage of the fact that he is always willing to do things for her. 

Am I wrong for telling him that he should set some limitations for these situations???

She is a married adult w 2 children but she can’t seem to do anything on her own.  She has 0 independence, and seemingly 0 capabilities. She seems to always be looking for the easy/quick way to do things and often that entails having my bf do it for her. She acts quickly and makes (IMO) poor decisions (for example, up and quitting her job w no plan b and 2 children to care for, when she is always complaining about needing more money). 

She CONSTANTLY is calling on my bf to help her do things. Anything from physical labor, like hanging light fixtures, (her husband is a contract btw) to ordering things online (like presents for her children), or helping her apply to jobs (resume/cover letter writing, looking up open positions, giving recommendations, reaching out to people in his field). 

She doesn’t do anything on her own. It baffles me that an adult parent is in so much need of constant help. I just don’t understand why there is no effort for her to even TRY doing things on your own. Okay, you want to take advantage of his prime account, but then send exactly what you want to order, not leave me bf to do an hr of research to find the item you want. 

My bf rationalizes everything. “She doesn’t know how,” “I have a prime account,” “she’s my sister, I’m going to help her.” “I’m capable of doing it”
UH and she is an adult w a college degree, is she not capable of learning how to do some of the things?????

I get that family is family, and of course you are going to want to help, but it is ALL THE TIME. Multiple times a week. She seems incapable of doing anything on her own. 
I feel like my bf just enables her too and makes excuses for it all. 

On top of it, she treats him poorly. His birthday just passed and she didn’t even get him a card, nothing?!!??  He couldn’t even choose the restaurant for his own bday dinner. Him and I both went out of our way to give thoughtful gifts to her and her family and she couldn’t even have her kids make a card?????!!!! 
She speaks as if no one else’s opinion matters, like anything she says is fact. “We’re going to do this” ??  I’m sorry, shouldn’t  you ask first???? 

She also traps him into doing things bc she doesn’t ever communicate the full extent of the favor she’s asking.  (I need you to hang a light fixture turns into hanging 4.) This often leads to “quick errands” unexpectedly lasting 5+ hours bc it was more than what was said in the first place. 

There have also been plenty of times where my bf will spend a greet deal of time and energy on something for her and then she turns around with “oh, I actually didn’t need that” and she knew but never bothered to communicate that to him. 

He is constantly going out of his way to help and she doesn’t do anything in return for him. It seems very one sided with him constantly going out of his way and doing things for her. I don’t feel that it is fair. I feel like he is being disrespected and used. 

Am I wrong for being upset for him?? Do I just not understand????  
I don’t understand. 
I’m sorry for the long all over the place post. I’m just confused and upset.

TLDR: I think my bf sister is using him by constantly asking him to do things for her. He thinks it’s okay because he is capable. I think just because he can doesn’t mean he always should. 

EDIT: what made me say something is that yesterday my bf was asked to help install a light fixture. He ended up in a house w multiple people for hours and having to go out to stores. With everything going on right now, why does he have to be put at risk?????  Does his health not matter????

EDIT: I asked my bf if it were the other way around, and I were in that situation, what he would say to me. He admitted that he would feel the same, but that’s not going to change what he does now. I’m not asking him to stop helping his family of course. I just think that there should be some level of respect there for him.",14Apr2020,1

My parents have never had a lot of money but have worked their butts off to support our family, which I appreciate so much. They’re amazing. But because they worked all day every day and still made pennies, I feel like I grew up alone and missed certain experiences other people have. I have no siblings. I barely see or talk to my parents and have little relationship with them. I’m 22 now and still saving up for a used car so I can’t even drive myself anywhere, I take a bus to work. My family has never gone on a vacation because we couldn’t afford it. I stayed home alone all summer on school breaks which made me very depressed. We never celebrated birthdays or holidays because my parents worked so much and we have no other family in this country to celebrate with anyway. I fully appreciate my parents sacrifices in helping to raise me and support the family. But sometimes it just makes me sad when I hear about other people’s lives: going on vacation every year, celebrating holidays with families, getting cars gifted to them from their parents, etc. I know some people I went to school with are spoiled, but I can’t help but feel jealous sometimes about their lives. It’s really getting to me. How can I stop thinking this way? 

I don’t mean this in any sort of offensive or condescending way. I know I’m not entitled to family, money, or a fun lifestyle. But it makes me sad when I see how fun others people’s lives are compared to my lonely, boring life. I need to get over this and just need advice. Thank you",14Apr2020,1

741,"

Note: This takes place in a minority community where people know each other and in an extremist Islamic country.. so please keep that in mind while reading my post. Any suggestions and advices would be much appreciated.

Sorry for the long post but I think the more data I provide, the better the suggestions and advices will be.

First up some background of my own family:  I'm the youngest daughter of my family of 4. I live in a family where girls are forced into marriage at a young age. I myself got engaged at age 14 and married at the beginning of 2019. My family doesn't appreciate girls just like any stereotypical Muslim family. Not even my birth was celebrated because who would celebrate a baby girl's birth. But still I was cared for not as a daughter of the family but rather as a human being. Not as someone who could they be proud of but rather as someone who could potentially ruin family image.

&amp;#x200B;

As if my life couldn't get any worse, I lost my father in 2011 to a blood cancer. Ever since my eldest brother have taken the responsibility of running the family. He has a sick and twisted ideology. He has this disgusting mindset of exchanging girls. To put in simple words, this means in exchange for a sister-in-law, you give out your sister. I personally am affected by this. I was forced into marriage without consent to my cousin and in return my step-brother got engaged to her sister. And to make matters worse they are same age I was.

&amp;#x200B;

As earlier said, I'm married to my cousin from mom's side. He is not my type. We are totally different from each other and definitely not meant for each other. I was never happy or gave consent to such a marriage and my heart knows that I tried all possible way to get out of this marriage. It had reached to a point that everyone knew I wasn't ok with the marriage... even the guy himself. Even after knowing fully well I didn't want this and my ex, he didn't end it as you guessed it, it would have been an Insult to the family. But as you might have guessed, it didn't change anything. Life gave me shit I probably didn't deserve. This marriage has  made me eat up lots of things, including my pride and an ex (which is a whole another story for some other day). I'm in a married life with someone who I don't even like. Even after all that went down, he gave me permission to attend University. This is I believe a favor he has done to me which lead to the rest of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had made decision not make any friends at Uni and especially of the opposite gender. But somehow fast forward to November last year and I became friends with a classmate from University. He was so kind and helpful to me. And we started constantly talked through the day. A month and two passes by and we get to know each other better. We became best friends (Ik it's a short time but bear with me). We continue to talk and grow closer with passing days. And it was mid-March this year when we decided to go further. As he understands and loves me so much. I don't know what to name this relationship. The reason for it being my ""marriage partner"" and a past ex. But I think I feel better with him as compared to my ""partner'. And it can be further proved by him knowing more about me than the said ""partner"". Sure we have fought a few times but we genuinely care for each other. And he doesn't want to let go of things over any reason.

&amp;#x200B;

And if I try to view the situation from the other side of the coin. My ""partner"" has placed hopes in me. and has accepted me as his wife. He expects me to treat him like a husband. But I can't find love for him in my heart. And somehow I feel obligated to do so as he has provided me with shelter, food and other living needs. At times I feel grateful he isn't cruel and strict like other men you get to hear about (again this is a Muslim country so violence against women is pretty common here). And I feel a bit relived as I get to have my aunt as my mother-in-law and her daughters and son as my sisters &amp; brother in-law. 

&amp;#x200B;

The guilt I feel right now is due to partner's expectations which he has put in me. And I feel wrong for having my selfish desires met by someone else. I'm bounding two people to myself. I think I should make myself distant from him and do by with this unwanted and unconsented marriage. At times I lose trust in him. What if he, the very person I'm cheating for calls me a disgusting cheater. What if all his desires end one day and he throws me away. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you people think I should be doing? How do I end this guilt I have been feeling? Any and all suggestions will be much appreciated. : )

I haven't talked to my friends for a week, and haven't played video games with them for a month. They kicked me out of their server and left every group chat I'm in with them because they're sick of me being inactive.  
They have been annoyed with me not talking to them for a few days or so for the past 10 months now. In the past they have expressed this, I'd tell them why I was inactive or didn't want to talk to them, we'd work it out and I'd be more active for a few weeks and then do the same shit again.

I only answer to my name most times. rarely, when I feel extremely happy and comfortable with them, I open up and hang out as best friends should. I don't tell them what I do daily or what I want to do in the future because I feel like they wouldn't be interested.

Then my life got pretty bad and I just wouldn’t want to talk to anybody, so we did not talk during last summer, but reconnected in November.

Anyway, after ending it with my abusive and toxic girlfriend, we slowly started to talk more and more. It has been 5months, since I’m single, but she has had a new boyfriend for 9months now.

3 days ago she called me and we talked for 5,5 hours straight. And the best thing is that I called her only 2 days before that!

Sooo yeah, I miss her already, but I wouldn’t ruin her relationship (which is crumbling anyway). Also, I don’t want to be too clingy, nor too attached for now, it is just hard.

I really don’t know what to do, because I have little to do and I think about her a lot.

It occurred to me this last week that the addiction is one that I don’t think I can break on my own. Does anyone have advice with breaking this habit? I’m considering programs like AA because I believe I’m putting my own life and others at risk sometimes esp if I get an urge to look at it while driving. 

I was very driven in high school and college; social media had just started to become a part of my life throughout those years so I wasn’t affected as much. Upon reflection, most of my time outside of college these last 6 years has been controlled by my phone usage. 

It’s scaring me. Now that I’m looking at it in a different light it looks like how some people may treat cigarettes. I wake up, need to take a look. During breakfast. If I study (studying for LSAT), grab my phone after. After the shower. I just parked at my destination? I’ll stay on my phone real quick. The times I spend sitting in my car like a zombie just scrolling on my phone is so long that it’s starting to stress me out.

753,"About a week and a half ago, my neighbors installed a [really bright floodlight](https://imgur.com/gallery/7uZjK49) on their garage shed facing the back of my house and illuminating my whole back yard and shining through the three back windows of my house, one being my bed..  

Last Monday, I went over there to politely ask if they’d install a cover to block the light. At first he said there’s supposed to be an angle to keep the light on his side.  (his phrasing asserted the idea that it HAD been done and wasn’t just supposed to be done. Lol BULLSHIT) I could angle that light down 45° and my yard would still be a baseball field. I told him it was really bright and that I would appreciate him getting a cover. He thanked me for letting him know and I thanked him. 

That night, the light stayed on. 
The next day we are outside in the backyard and they are too. We aren’t being rude but we keep looking over at them like, *Why would you leave the light on*?
The next night there’s a plastic board campaign sign covering the light.
We felt better knowing they at least did a temporary fix. 
Next day the sign was gone and wasn’t put back on for three more days. The day they put it on the second time was also a day we were giving them *what gives* looks. We decided to give them until this Monday before we spoke with them again. At this point I don’t know what else I can say before this becomes a legal matter. I don’t want bad blood but they’re making it a bit hard for that.

Edit: punctuation

Edit2: I failed to mention. They have left their garage door open all night since they have installed the light. Security my ass.",14Apr2020,1

I’ve always been a good student, and I really thought I had a chance, or that I would at least get wait-listed. I’m really unsure about what to do now. I’m planning on reapplying next fall, but in the meantime, I have no idea how to make my application stronger.

Since I now have no plans for the next 12 months, I need to figure something out. I’d love to travel, but I know it wouldn’t make my application any stronger for next year.

761,"

Let me start with a little back story here. 
   I’m in a relationship, but my ex and my best friend have recently been hanging out and talking. When my friend mentioned it, I was honest with her about how I felt. That I would be uncomfortable with it and I wouldn’t ever want to hear any details. Which sucks, that’s what you tell your friends right? You met a new guy, gush all the juicy details! I wouldn’t want to know about or see anything about it. And that it would honestly hurt me if they dated. 
At first, she said she completely understood. She would never date him anyway because she said “I think he would only date me to get closer to you. I wouldn’t want to put my heart out there for a guy that probably still has feelings for an ex!”  “You’re more important to me that just some guy”. 
Fast forward about 2 weeks, and I wake up to a long message about how I need to get over it or she’s going to be pissed off (in short). 
We got into an argument and she called me a “fucking hoe” and also sent my boyfriend a message telling him that I still have feelings for my ex and that I plan to break up with him to get back with said ex. She went on and on to me, telling me I’ve “slept with half the town” and more remarks about how I’ve dated a lot of men and how it isn’t fair to her. 
The ex in question here is a person I’ve been sleeping with on and off for 6 years, whenever we’re both single. Not a random ex. And I simply told her I would be uncomfortable with it, not that she “couldn’t” date him. I said she’s an adult and can make whatever decisions she wants, but I wouldn’t want to be around for it. 
I’m debating on if I’m being the asshole because I’m not okay with it. I think it’s weird. She constantly brags about how many guys hit her up and that “everyone in (our town) has a crush on her “ blah blah. So why not pick one of the “tons of guys” that hit her up? 
Idk. I was honest with my friend because that’s what you’re supposed to do. And now I feel like my feelings are somehow invalid and she’s being inconsiderate. I thought it was girl code anyway?",14Apr2020,1

767,"My brother tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday and started showing symptoms (a fever of 100, chest pain) last Wednesday. Up until then, I had hung out with my brother every day and sat in the hot tub with him. It is suspected he got the virus from my dad, who had a fever and dry cough mid-march for several days but could not get tested because they were rationing tests. my dad self isolated (poorly) but continued contact with my mom as soon as he got better. 

I started having heaviness in my chest this past weekend. Feels like a weight on my chest. I got tested Sunday morning and my results came back negative today. However, since my mother (49f) assumed my dad (50m) already had it and we have both been exposed, she let my brother walk around the house, pet the dog, etc etc. She has been in extremely close contact with him. She also cooks my meals everyday. I have been staying in my room and wiping the containers of food off with hand sanitizer (idk if that’s effective). 

Now that I have tested negative, what should I do? My whole house is infected, and assumingely my mother. She cooks my meals . I’d cook myself but I’m not sure if it is safe to cook in the kitchen when we do not have lysol wipes or anything (they’re sold out) to wipe things down. We have a little bit of lysol spray left. 

I have an apartment in the next state over that I was living in during college, which I left to be quarantined with my family (such a stupid decision). Should I move back there? I could have groceries delivered. Or could my test be false negative (the doctor who did my test said this is unlikely but the internet says otherwise)? I am worried I might travel all the way there and then start showing more symptoms and be all alone. Also, my car is having problems so I would have to take it to the mechanic first (possibly infecting the mechanic?). My lease ends in 2 weeks so I have to get my stuff eventually. 

Additionally, I feel miserable. I am bombarded with schoolwork. I haven’t seen my boyfriend in 5 weeks and it’s going to be another month now that my whole house is infected. It hurts me to see him having fun with his neighbors and family everyday while I am stuck in my room miserable.  All my summer plans got cancelled so I am not looking forward to anything. I spoke to my therapist over the phone this morning but I don’t feel like it helped.

778,"I recently broke my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and I decided to buy the S20 Plus.

My biggest fear has always been breaking my screen(I went through 5 tempered glass screen protectors, and happened to break my S9 Plus screen while waiting for my new screen protector to come in).

However, I use a Sprigen phone case that has a slide-out(it slides vertically instead of horizontally, much nicer that way, harder to break) for my driver's license, bank card, health insurance card, and small paper car insurance card. It wouldnt seem like all four of those things would fit in the case, but the health insurance and car insurance cards are very slim in comparison to the license and bank card.

I don't like having a separate wallet for my cards; in fact, I haven't stored these cards in a wallet in like 7 years. It's super nice being able to have everything I need being paired up with my phone. I tried phone cases that double as wallets, and I hate having to ""flip it open"" in order to look at my phone as if it were a book cover, so those are out.

What I'm looking for is kind of the Holy Grail of all phone cases, and it probably doesn't exist, but I'll describe what I need in a phone case and why.

Durable - It's an expensive phone, and I don't plan on actually having to use the warranty unless the phone gets... I dont know, run over with a steamroller I guess(not that I'm ever around anything like that, I'm just paranoid and life is full of surprises).

Has a slide-out for my cards - Minimum card space is two.

Has a ring on it - Popsockets suck and are much too bulky when put in my pocket. They get caught on everything. I am willing to go without this, but I at least need something that has the OPTION of me being able to put an adhesive sticking ring on it or something.

A case with a built in screen protector, or is compatible with a tempered glass screen protector, or any reliable screen protecting material - I once had a Lifeproof case, and though it was durable as hell during a time when my phone was in constant danger of getting ganked up, I hated that case because it required me to press pretty hard on my screen in order to USE the phone. I just need SOMETHING to help protect the screen.

I know that it is very likely I will have to give up something here if I want that perfect balance of protection and user-friendliness. What I'm asking from you guys is advice, opinions and maybe even a suggestion that I should check out.",14Apr2020,1
779,"Last week my father got his left kidney removed due to a tumor, I obviously went to the hospital while he was there to take care of him and be there if he needed anything while taking all the precautions possible in regards with the covid-19. Since the quarantine started here almost three weeks ago I only went outside 4 times (twice for groceries and garbage and twice going to the hospital for him).

After he got discharged he went to his girlfriend's house since she is a doctor (pediatrician specialized in kidneys), everything was going great, I keep talking with him while I was with my mother (they've been divorced for almost 22 years), taking care of her during the quarantine since she is at a risky age and all. Until today where I get a call from him saying that he went back to his place ALONE and without telling me anything, I only knew he was alone at his place because I called him to check if everything is alright.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here is the thing: I of course told him that if he would go to his place I would go there and take care of him, so as soon as I heard that I told him that I would go as soon as I finished eating lunch, I was decided to go UNTIL he told me that next weekend he would go back to his girlfriend's place to spend some days there (bear in mind that the quarantine here is ongoing until almost end of April  or even more), to which I replied that if I were effectively going there to take care of him he WOULD NOT go anywhere until the quarantine was over and I of course would be there. That's when he got mad and started saying that we needed to discuss his opinions and mine and whatsoever and that he would go anyway whether or not I wanted or not. So I gave him an ultimatum: If he would go to his girlfriend's place I would not break the quarantine to go 4 days to take care of him and come back putting my mom also at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this story the advice I'm looking for is: Should I suck it up and go to take care of him even though he doesn't care about the quarantine letting him go and do whatever he pleases or leave him alone with his girlfriend keeping myself shut with my mum ?

&amp;#x200B;

I must say I AM worried about him, but it seems I can't change his mind about all this going around and I don't wanna jeopardize my nor my mum's health because of his recklessness.

I can get a place with my older brother (M23) and younger (M13). I have a friend that is also interested in moving out of her parents house. So four people, three sources of income. 

I could start applying for places but with the pandemic I don’t know how likely it is that i’ll get a job. I also have a Mindfulness based website that I’ve been trying to start up so I could maybe get some affiliate link stuff going and whatnot. 

So I guess my main point of question: does anyone have any advice for Website building? I have it currently created on Wix with a few of my articles. I don’t know if Wix is a great thing to invest into to make profit or not. Should I go somewhere else? I just feel lost in the process and I get discouraged because I’m afraid I’m going to invest and then it’ll be for nothing.

785,"I  (17M) have a friend, we'll call him ""Joe."" (17M) We've known each other  since 7th grade but ever since 8th, we've been best friends, mostly  because we were basically the school rejects. Both of us are your  typical nerdy types so many in our school ignored us and the main guy  friend group in our age range (this is a small school) gradually phased  us out (esp in 8th,9th) and kept ridiculing and ignoring us, so yeah, we  had a bit in common. We first bonded over Pokemon but soon Super Smash  Bros became our thing. We were in a play together, hung out at each  other's houses a ton, and, needless to say, our relationship was pretty  good.

Joe and I are finishing 11th  grade now but we've been growing apart. Starting in the end of 8th  grade we started our own friend group with a few of the ""rejects"" of the  school, but as people in the friend group moved to other schools, they  invited some of their newly found friends, and we incorporated more and  more of these people from other places to create a sort of hodgepodge of  guys from different places. Since we live in a kinda rural area and  none of us could drive (back then), friendships with the new guys were  formed completely online through texting or calling while playing games  in our group chat. We would have get-togethers every one or two months,  sure, but not anywhere as frequent as normal friend groups do. Still,  the arrangement worked incredibly and by a year after the group chat was  first made, there were a good 15 guys just having a fun time.

A  little over a year ago, one of our friends that used to go to our  school invited a friend from his school. We'll call him ""Ethan."" Ethan  is the kinda person that everyone likes, I really enjoy his company too,  and when he joined the server, he talked a lot: the only person who  talked more than him was Joe actually and even many of the most  established members (including me) weren't as active as he.

While  it was slow to start, Joe and Ethan really clicked, especially over  last summer. I did a lot of stuff with Joel at the time, we were still  really close friends, but, when given the choice, Joe spent time with  Ethan (the guy he's known for 5 months) instead of me, the guy he's been  bffs with for 3 years (at that time). Joe and Ethan had a ton in common  too, as they spent time on a myriad of different things. There were  many times when I'd hang out with them: one week we played a game called  Stardew Valley for 4 hrs a day and I did it with them, but Joe and  Ethan just spent so much time, time I didn't have to spend as I had a  college class and a blog to run. Things really came to a head around  Christmas last year when Joe, Ethan, and a bunch of others in the group  chat secretly made their own group chat and hung out for a week while  leaving me and a bunch of others high and dry. When they finally  returned, there was a whole conversation and debate over elitism and  being exclusionary. Joe and I had a big fight once it all went down,  completely spurred by me. In retrospect it seems really petty and high  school but I was just so hurt and so insecure that my best friend was  basically leaving me. We quickly forgave each other, but the scars that  came from that haven't faded from me and Joe's relationship (or in the  general friend group).

Fast  forward to now. Ethan and Joe are undoubtedly best friends. When Pokemon  came out, Ethan and Joe spent hours upon hours together playing it. I  learned that Ethan, Joe, and one of their friends from the breakout  group chat have been hanging out a bunch at Joe's house wo inviting me  We had a series of posts in the group chat about what we enjoy about  each person, and when describing Ethan, Joe said it felt like he knew  him all of his life and they connected on almost everything and when  describing me he said that I was a ""great friend.""

This  post is probably dragging for too long. I just wanted some advice on  how to move on: I still want to be friends with Joe, in fact we're still  great friends, but it's clear that he has other priorities and I don't  want to put myself through more pain by trying to fight a battle that's  already won, and not for me. Instead of being bitter and spiteful, I  want to move on, but, especially given recent events making it harder to  make new friends, it's been hard.

Please help me out.

So a while back I already confessed to my friend that I had a crush. She basically rejected me, but all she said was that she doesn't know if her feelings for me are love or not, and she just needs to get things figured out.

However, that surprisingly didn't kill our friendship! I was able to move on no problem. In fact, we have become even better and closer friends ever since! Since we are in quarantine, we mostly text and call. And recently we have been texting every single day! I won't lie that I still have some feelings for her, but I have learned to stash them away and love her as a friend.

Now, she's the type of person that says i love you to all her friends. She's told me ""I love you"" in the past before occasionally, but recently that frequency has been amped up. Almost every day she is saying it. She is constantly reminding me how happy she is to have me in her life. The consistency has risen a lot.

'Cause I need you now but I don't know you yet. But can you find me soon because I'm in my head? Yeah, I need you now but I don't know you yet""

787,"Hello,

I am 22 male from Poland. I remember that even when I was 13 yo I was thinking what I will be doing in the future and the problem occurs to current times. I got tired by it and I need help/advice.

**What I want sice 13yo?**

I always wanted to be rich. Not like middle class but to be a guy which can travel few times per year, have big house, two nice cars and every caprice like new games etc.

Since I was 13yo I dream about being a youtuber / influencer. I think it would be perfect to create content, have fans and earn money.

To be independent from one place. To be honest for 90% I will be in the same place all the time but I am young so there is chance that I will change country of living in the future. I don't want to work as warehouse worker but to do what interests me.

**What I was doing since 13yo?**

\-Programming. Because I think I am smart. Because I want to be rich. Because it is interesting. I know few programming languages on more than entry level so I can build scripts, create webpages etc but not as experienced dev. Just working bad code. Within previous few days I tried to learn but when I spot something hard I give up. 

\-Youtube. I did few channels in high school but my age-mates was laughing so I stopped.

\-Content writing - I earned some money writing texts in Polish / English.

\-Since 19yo I was working as a consultant in IT branch, my specialization is hostings, mailings, web creators, ftp etc.

\-Video - while working 9-5 I ran my own business. I was making wedding videos and editing it, earning 2 times more than from 9-5. But to be happy I want to earn minimum 3 times more.

To start video company I had to take a debt. Currently everything what I earn goes for live and to pay credits. About 50% of my monthly expenses are credits. I earn about $800 (in polish money) and I have $25000 debt. If I will be filming I should pay all that within 2 years.

**I am not happy.**

I know that my skills are not enough to have highly payed job and be desirable. I want companies to hire me always without any problem when I will be in trouble or changing place of living. 

As I told I want to be independent. Doing something on my own is nice but I don't think that I can get rich or be independent from one place doing videos. 

I am afraid that my future will be same like now - being in debt, not being specialised in anything and everyday will be scary because if I will be not necessary to my employer it can be hard to find something without specific skills.

I fell like I wasted my 2 years and will waste 2-3 next caused by my wrong decisions. Time is going and I want to try live. Then have kids. With situation like that I am scatterbrained and I am losing my mind.

Can you tell me what to do? Any advices?",14Apr2020,1

The next time she saw me she was relieving me (this is a 24/7 case) and yelled at me and said I was lucky we were at work when I was trying to do shift communication about the patient. She physically grabbed me and threw me out of the apartment. I reported it and they literally did nothing. 
2) I have a patient I visit and her husband makes me uncomfortable. He’s always shirtless and he’s a younger man in his 40s. So to me he is scary. He yells at his wife and has yelled at me for his personal issues. Nothing to do with my job. I’m Mexican and he called me an “illegal alien” as a “joke” and is now using me as a translator to his gardener who speaks perfect English but he insists I translate in Spanish to make sure he understands. Yesterday he was in my personal space and I texted my manager. Then he was in his underwear laughing because I was uncomfortable and got dressed in front of me. I reported this and my manager left me on read and will not do anything or get back to me.

Im now sober, started again to practice my religion which really helps me in the „dark“ times.

799,"(Tl;dr at bottom)

I'm a 19 year old in college right now. Long story short, my family is not very healthy and my therapist says they're abusive. My therapist and I have been working VERY hard on keeping me away from them, I can do long distance and still have a relatively healthy relationship with them but going back home sounds like a nightmare.

My main argument before was I don't want to travel due to COVID-19, I'm going to college in a small town and don't want to risk catching it in their much larger, tourist heavy city. But my parents really think everyone is overreacting with this whole thing and really doesn't respect when I mention anything about health or germs (I was a pretty bad germaphobe when I was younger and got a lot of shit for it, so they rarely take me seriously when I mention any fear about getting sick).

My second argument was I had a job on campus and I needed to work, but then I got fired. The campus' HR department is reassigning people who lost their on campus job from shut downs and I just got an email today saying how I'll be reassigned soon, so I could use that as an excuse, but the last time I brought up not coming home for a bit, my mom got upset and kept saying stuff along the lines of ""Wow I thought you'd want to be around family, is \[insert whatever\] more important??""

I'm not really sure what to do. Last time I went home for the summer, I was only supposed to stay for 2 weeks but it ended up being roughly 2 1/2 months (I don't have a car or my license so I had to entirely rely on them taking me back. My plan this year was to work over the summer and get my license on my own so I could at least START to get some more independence, but obviously things aren't going to plan lol). It was a nightmare and only ended after I got upset because they kept rescheduling when they'd take me back so they could go on vacations/lil trips with just the two of them.

I don't want to start any family drama, but my mental health has been slipping and sliding and if I have to go home, with no access to my regular therapy or support group (my parents don't know I receive therapy for Many Reason^(tm)) I know I will just get so much worse. But I have no idea how to set this boundary without them getting angry and either forcing me to go home or holding this over me in the future.

**Tl;dr:** How do I explain to my toxic parents that I do not want to visit them or go home right now without causing trouble? I can't use the current pandemic as an excuse because they don't believe it's that bad and I was recently fired so I cannot use my work schedule as an excuse.",14Apr2020,1

805,"Hi everybody,

This is long but I’m in some real shit here. 

So I’ve been working in a full-time job for some time now, but only took it because I met someone who became a mentor in my field. I really had no interest in the job and was just trying to follow in his footsteps. 

I moved to a different city when most of
my friends were still in high school and started working full-time in what I thought was my desired field/dropped out of school bc I thought I was going to make it big. Also, I thought working for my boss who is very well known in my field, was going to be the extra thing I needed on my school resume to get me into my dream university. 

Being a dumbass, I only applied to one college and was rejected. Everyday I go to work hating my job, everyone is telling me to go to college and leave, and on top of that my parents believe me I’m a failure because I didn’t get in. 

I was an athlete last year and was getting recruited to a lot of top schools for my sport. Looking back I feel like if I just stayed home and worked on my test scores/sport that I could’ve gotten into my dream school. 

Everything in my job was going great until I had to go to the hospital for an unexpected health emergency. Before then, I would be working 70 hour weeks, and trying to balance a full school schedule, live on my own, and apply to college at the same time. 

After the hospital, I started to lose all my motivation. Almost got fired for making a stupid decision. Also, I barely make enough to cover rent, food, transportation, school, utilities, etc. so if I don’t get promoted or come up with the next great business idea, I feel like I’ll be pinching pennies for the rest of my life. 

My parents had unrealistically high expectations for me and so I never took time to ask myself what I wanted to do. Now we are working from home due to COVID-19 concerns, and I’m crashing at my parents place to save rent money. 

I’m thinking of quitting my job when they tell us to go back to work and taking my savings to go get some job where I can do something completely different and travel around the world. I never wanted the job I have now, but only took it to get out of my parent’s house and figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

My job is very unrewarding and I never feel like I can do anything right. I’ve had opportunities to leave, but stayed because I thought if I showed my loyalty they would promote me. I’ve since been passed over for promotion three times. The only reason I’m still working there is because it’s a very prestigious place to work and supposedly a good stepping stone. 

But I can’t help feeling that I’m just a pawn. Most people I know have told me to leave and find somewhere else to work, but with my limited skills, work experience, and education I feel like I’m stuck to these people for another year or two, unless they replace me. 

My parents said I should restart and live at home and go to junior college. The coach at my dream school told me if I keep practicing and show good results that I should apply again next year and he will get me in. 

I don’t know if I should keep my job and just look at it differently, quit everything and go to junior college, leave the country and try to do something completely different, or keep my job, and grind so I can get into my dream school next year? 

I feel like I can’t trust anyone’s advice that I know so I came here.

TLDR: What the title says + I need some advice to get my shit together. I’ve read a bunch of those self-help books, watched a bunch of videos, done a lot of introspection, but nothing seems to help, at least for more than a few days.",14Apr2020,1

814,"I have a few different options for taking a job right now. Currently, I am in the process of interviewing for a full-time job (graduate program) with FDM which trains and recruits for business/technical consultants. I am also being offered an immediate contract job until end of June that is a call centre role with the Canadian Red Cross.

The thing is - I also qualify for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, which pays out those who lost their work about $500/week.

The full-time graduate opportunity seems enticing but it is also a two-year contract with penalties, and 40K-45K to start (14.5/hr for training). But I get the experience with training for being a business/technical consultant. This training usually starts at April 27th, but I am thinking maybe to negotiate a starting date for end of June if I take the contract role immediate.

The contract role is just a call centre position, taking donations for a COVID-19 campaign but I need to make a quick decision regarding that but 14/hr pay (560/week as opposed to 500/week with the benefits which I would lose if I started working). But the benefits only pay out for up to 4 months. I think I may enjoy the call centre role since it's inbound, but not sure if I'd enjoy working 40hour weeks as opposed to the current situation.

I want to get more work experience coming out as a graduate from last year, but at the same time, don't want to sell myself short but also think at the moment, these are the opportunities I have at the moment. I also am in the process of wanting to apply for a Masters in biology as well, that which I'm not sure about over working.

What do you think the best plan of action is? Try to negotiate the starting date of the other company, and get the experience in the call centre role, meanwhile considering the business/tech consultant role? Or not stay with the contract and instead keep with the benefits, and possibly consider other opportunities for now? Not sure how the employment prospects will get better soon with the virus situation.",14Apr2020,1
816,"Some background: I'm autistic (F19) and while my parents did their best for me once they got the diagnosis outside of a few screw-ups, I cannot say the same for the parents of my autistic friends, or in fact most parents of autistic children that I've seen. My immediate assumption is that they post/talk about their frustration with their children for pity, they've done little to nothing to actually accommodate their child's needs but want a pat on the back for keeping the kid alive, and that their affection is conditional, no matter how many times they tell us otherwise. I'll usually go through the person's profile and any replies they get before I'm convinced otherwise. As a result, if I attend something like a group therapy session or a mixer for autistic adults, I don't bother with the parents unless I'm introduced to one.

I have also had several neurotypical friends with shitty parents. Physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse - you name it, at least one friend's parents have put them through it. I try to do my best to help them through it with what I have and what boundaries they give me, but without any professionals you can only help so much. As a result, I assume most parents from the same generation had children not because they wanted to, but because it met people's expectations and it made them feel good to check that box. I cannot relax around newer friends' parents. I can't eat in front of them. I can't sit down. It takes months before I can determine whether or not they actually give a shit about their kid.

I don't like feeling this way. I don't like being angry and suspicious of everyone who wants to vent about their kids tiring them out on occasion, or of my friend's mom who's probably a pretty okay person.

He's sent me pictures of girls from those subs so I had a fantasy of him finding me on those subs. It turns out he's found those pictures when they've been posted elsewhere, which I found out last night. Last night we had a conversation about what he would do and if he would like it a of his gf posted on those subs (initiated by me because I was planning on telling him about it). He pretty much said he wouldn't so I chickened out of telling him and then this morning I felt so bad that I had to tell him right away. 

I love him a lot and i'm sure if our circumstances were different we might have dated. He's told me if certain things were different he thinks he would fall in love with me and I feel the same. Therefore, I understand why this would be worse than your average fwb situation. I know he's more upset that I lied rather than the fact that I posted. He was cheated on by his long term gf (I think about 7 yrs) and he told me it feels like that. I really would like to patch things up between us and I've been apologising but I'm not sure how I can make him understand that I really wasn't trying to hurt him. Honestly, when he compared it to his gf who cheated on him it broke my heart and i'm desperate to make this better. Please share if you have any advice, it would be much appreciated. 

I'm really sorry if this is all over the place and I hope this is the correct sub for it, I know we're not technically in a relationship but it's definitely not your average friendship.",14Apr2020,1

Does this happen to anyone 

This is one of the reasons why I hate going outside .
Weather I’m going out to eat ,shopping ,or running errands I’ve notice men/boys mostly when they’re in a group commenting on my looks often, too many times for it to go unnoticed ,it really gives me anxiety .
ive noticed myself avoiding or putting my head down whenever I pass a group of men/boys ,they either comment “Do you think she’s cute or “no errrwee she’s ugly” or laugh 

I literally just mind my business and this happens.  It happens so often it’s ridiculous. I notice it’s mostly men from my own race (Black )

I have very good hearing so they probably don’t think I can hear and please don’t say I’m paranoid because this is very much real (lol)


why do men feel the need to comment on women’s looks randomly ,why can’t they just be silent and keep their opinions to themselves ?


Does this happen to other women ?

If you’re a man /boy why do men do this ?",14Apr2020,2

831,"Hi there. Recently I’ve been experiencing some issues with my supervisor. In the past, before COVID-19 quarantine, she appeared to be hostile or have some negative attitude towards me. She was talking negatively about me to a coworker less than five feet away from me. Coworker confirmed it was about me. Now, I am providing my services via zoom. However, I was sick with coronavirus about three weeks ago and I texted to let her know. She completely disregarded the message and avoided the chat completely. My coworkers texted her to let her know I was sick and should not have to work. She ignored their messages too and only “liked” another text that was unrelated. She never did get back about me being sick, but did send me emails and texts asking me to do work. 

This week we are back online after having spring break (I work with a school) and I texted her yesterday asking for some guidance on something we need to complete for the company. It’s time sensitive...but it’s been two days and she hasn’t responded. My coworkers have noticed it too, but she is ignoring me and not aiding with my job in the way she should be.

836,"This a very very long story and tried to leave out most of the details and juat tell you wjat happend. 

TL:DR at the bottom 

Basicly I grew up with very stric and religious parents that dont allow me to go outside. Unless it's for school or going to the gym. Because of this I lied a lot to get out of the house and sneaked out at night to go to the city.

This behavior had a few consequences. I often got asked by friends what I was doing and how I got out or why I always was late to everything. I kept anwsering by saying that it doesn't matter or I gave vage anwser because I didn't want to seem less cool.

Anyway when I started doing some soft drugs some people saw me with dealers and the rumors spread like wildfire.

I thought I was dead amd my life was over, but people got scared of me. They started to put my irrational behavior, me associating with drug dealer, my rough looks(I just like leather jackets) and my weird disappearance and appearances together and thought I was in some shady drug gang. I jokingly went with since I literally thought it was joke. Later on one of the girls I am trying to get with is saying that she is scared of me because of my rumors. I realised the that it got pretty bad and started to say no to every rumor, but people didn't believe me. In fact it made their suspension worse about me and the rumors got worse. After a while people started framing me with shit that I didn't do witch got me arrested a couple of times, but each time the evidence was lacking so I got set free, but the suspicion and rumors gotten even worse

I am just a 19 year old who doesn't shit and has barely smoked in his life,but every else sees this guy that slept with hundreds of hookers, got locked up, fought gang fights and did all kinds of crazy and insane drugs. 


To fix this situation I kept my head low for a long while and started building new relationships and I have to life with this lie now, unless I change my identity and go to a new country. 

Here is the problem: I have to go to college next year and I am slowly getting desperate for a romantic relationship with a special someone. 

Do I just live with the lie and accept it as my life, since I can't get rid of it or do I leave after college and change my identity. Only a few family members may know about me existing.

Rumors spread about me being a scary ex gang member that has done all kinds of awful things and 
nobody believes me when I deny those rumors.

Soo my husband had admitted his porn addiction to me about 3 years ago, at first I didnt really think it was that big of a deal.. well I was pregnant with our second kid, he was always waaay too tired to have sex and I was feeling huge and gross anyways then I picked up his tablet which had his browser open, yes porn and in the search bar hes searching ""perfect body"" 

Ouch. 


So that's when the insecurities began, this was 2 years ago. Our sex life honestly wasn't the best for a long while he seriously didn't know what he was doing. He had always watched porn in his teen years which most do yeah? He was married for 12 years to a prude, sexless marriage, that's when he says it became an addiction.And I also feel like that's where he got his idea on sex. Porn which made it not so great lol. I've always had a high libido, so when he was too tired for me, but not to Jack off to some porn it did hurt. 

Noooow. He still watches porn and he does want sex from me,I've lost most the extra baby weight and dont have too much to go, but definitely have stretch Mark's and cellulite my tits aren't perky like they were from breastfeedig our 2 children, but with knowing he was watching it this weekend and the last and not sure how much in between, I'm just totally turned off. 

I feel so gross and unattractive, no matter how much he says I'm beautiful and sexy, it just doesn't feel like the truth to me... like most women in porn have perfect bodies anyways.. why search that? We've been together for 4 years and I really didn't care much until i seen that search and it just devastated me.... 

I'm 28 and he's 39... 

Sorry this is probably all over the place, but I'm just anxious and a very high strung person that over analyzes everything and I just kinda dealt with it, but it's now to the point where I feel insecure and uncomfortable around my own husband and don't want him to even touch me... I think theres been some resentment built up, but I love him so much and just don't know what to do... I'm trying to just accept it since him knowing my feelings on the matter and him not stopping..

First of all: not my first language, there may be spelling or grammatical errors

I am a 20-year-old university student who only works once a week to pay my expenses which have nothing to do with my university.

Before someone tells me, ""If you don't have money to care for a pet, don't have one."" I have to say that when my cat was brought home I was 10 years old and I don't remember asking for a cat either.

It turns out that now that my 9-year-old cat is in serious condition, my parents are neglecting veterinary expenses. I have to pay for everything myself without any minimal help.

Last Friday, my cat was very ill and I took him to the emergency room the next morning: his glucose was too high and it had affected his kidneys. My cat reacted to almost nothing, just looked at you and layed down.

All these days I have been told that the cat was analytically better every day, but clinically it was still weak, giving me hope.

I have to say that every day I spent there, I paid more and more with money that I don't have right now, resulting in a debt that I will be paying for a year.

Today, after almost 5 days in hospital, the tests have improved a lot, but my cat's mood is not excellent or good.

I have been recommended to put a feeding tube, which gives me great hope. The reality is that it is not known if my cat will be able to recover even if they put the feeding tube or continue with the treatment. Nor do they guarantee that when I take him home he will not relapse, or that he will have a very long life expectancy. Having chronic kidney disease, life expectancy is reduced to 3 years. I don't even know if he has the disease, but seeing the analytical results is among the odds.

I am in a dilemma. I feel like we have come a long way and I think that stopping now is throwing all my effort and mental stress that I have put in the trash.

On the other hand, I don't have enough money to be able to leave my cat in treatment until it is completely healthy, I don't even know how many days are left before that day arrives. Nor does anyone guarantee me anything, not the state of my cat's health after this, or if it will get well. I don't even know if I'm lengthening his suffering or if he really can be recovered.

Today I have a debt of 844 euros which I do not have right now, and that I will have to pay each month for a year. How much is too much to spend on a pet that you do not know if it will live?

I have decided to put the feeding tube in and see his condition tomorrow, if it does not improve, I think it would be best to euthanize him, but what if it improves? I get into more and more debt without any guarantee but with the possibility that it will turn out well.

Today I was preparing myself mentally to euthanize him because I did not expect good results, but the results were much better than I expected, it is a roller coaster of emotions every day. I have been living for 5 days just to attend veterinary calls several times a day, almost without eating and all day in bed.

882,"So, there’s a lot to unpack here..my wife and I have been together for about 11 years now. She’s bisexual and we’ve had our fun with other girls from time to time. It’s always just been casual, consensual, fun. Until about 4 years ago we ended up messing around with her lifelong friend and my wife caught feelings, needless to say I soon did too. We’ve never considered having a serious relationship but this friend was a definite exception, once we started messing around more and more often the Friend ended up dropping everything and hooking back up with an ex bf. Nothing was official but it was pretty much a breakup. My wife and I moved on it hurt a lot but now the friend came back and gave us all the green lights to start things up again (even though she’s still with what’s his name) This time we chose to actually communicate our feelings and explain that we want something serious. She says she feels the same, and she went home and broke up with what’s his name. But now it seems like she’s unsure about the decision. To be fair it is a huge decision and she’s be changing a big part of her life to be with us. The problem here is she obviously still cares about the ex bf and is currently still living with him. This has been the situation for the past month and We can’t help but wonder if we’re just wasting our time. Is she playing both sides? The possibility of her getting back with the ex is pretty big and personally I would feel like such a clown if things end the same way it did 4 years ago. What would Reddit do?",14Apr2020,3

884,"When I was 19 (25 now), I had a gf who was very inexperienced in bed. I always warmed her up to things by trying to initiate it and she'd either let me do it or she'd tell me she wasn't interested/it wasn't okay. I always respected her boundaries. One day we were talking and I told her that I didn't want to have the relationship be only sexual and didn't want to do anything she didn't want to do. She responded that she was ""always down for sexual things"" and we agreed that she'd just let me know if something wasn't okay - this was implemented time and time again throughout our relationship.

Up to the point we broke up, we hadn't had sex. After we broke up, she told me that she was planning on having sex with me that weekend - so being 19, I tried to ""make things work"" but was really trying to have sex. Our hookups got to a point where I was thrusting into her while she left her panties on - something she actively enjoyed and participated in. One day, I tried to take it further and moved her panties to the side and slowly entered her. I probably got the tip in plus another inch or two. I thrusted some but decided I didn't feel right doing it, so I stopped.

The next time we hooked up, I tried it again and told myself that she would tell me if something wasn't okay - and justified it that way. I knew she probably didn't want it, but just decided that she would tell me if it wasn't okay based on previous conversations/hookups. I would then get cold feet and stop thrusting inside her and would go back to being over top of her underwear. This happened four or five times more, each time going further in and justifying it by saying she'd tell me if it wasn't okay. Eventually, we ended up having sex and she asked ""does this mean I'm not a virgin anymore"" - which made me feel incredibly guilty because I had been penetrating her some before during our hookups.

Every time we hooked up, she was a VERY active participant and never expressed a desire to not do something. She had an active body, active eye contact, talked to me, etc. I just feel like either she didn't realize I was penetrating her without her underwear in the way and that I took things beyond her consent. I know she \~wanted\~ to have sex, but I don't know if she had fully committed to it in her brain and didn't know what I was doing.",14Apr2020,2
885,"I'm 16, male, and I have been having trouble with life recently. 

Basically, ever since I turned 13 I've had acne, only mild at first but it still made me incredibly antisocial and awkward and kept me from going outside much. I was incredibly socially inept for years, and I thought my life was turning around for the better in June 2019 when I finished 9th grade in my country, and I spent a lot of time trying to improve myself. I didn't commit enough, however, as I had grown super lazy from being inside all the time and having no energy, so I didn't improve on my problems, which were:

* Acne, which looking back wasn't as bad as I thought it was
* Weight, I've been skinny most of my life but I've been like borderline anorexic for the past 4 years or so, though with the quarantine I've been eating a lot more.
* Social skill, remains quite shit to this day.
* I'm really lazy and so I've fallen behind on homework a lot, and my grades are suffering because of it.

And then in August 2019 I started going to what's basically my country's version of high school. I only talked to a few people there at first, but soon made a new friend at the school and then one of my other friends from my previous school started at my high school, so it's been a lot better . However, I also got a crush on a girl in my class and I started stressing over that a bunch.

Around December I realized that I had no chance, not in my current state at least. I also realized that over the years I think I've developed some form of OCD, I had like ritualistic shit I did all the time, like I wrote down a list of life goals on the note app on my phone, and every time before I closed my phone I would open the app and read that document. I would also delude myself into thinking that the last post I saw on my reddit app would somehow influence the next day, so I would look up these super positive posts that I could relate to and shut my phone off with that post open. Those are just a few things though, I did a lot of other impulsive stuff and still do some to this day, but to a lesser extent. I also started obsessing over my crush, which I've done a lot less of after realizing it's incredibly weird, especially considering we barely know eachother and have only talked like 6-7 times.

The stress from having a crush and the stress from getting a lot of homework (my school focuses more on homework than lessons) and being too lazy to do it made my acne worse, and my acne being worse made me skip school which only made me fall further behind and get more stressed.

As it is now, I'm behind in several subjects, most of the people I know think I'm weird as hell and extremely awkward, and I feel emotionally numb kind of, like I feel like nothing matters and that no matter what I do I'll end up a miserable failure. Even my family thinks I'm weird. I alternate between either being incredibly tense, anxious, awkward and quiet or being careless and cynical.

So I don't really know why I've made this post really, or if this is the right place to post this since I'm not asking a specific question but if you've got advice or anything to help me with anything I've written about in this overly long post, please comment :)",14Apr2020,1

890,"First of all let me go ahead and state that I know what I did was wrong so I don’t need judgement, just advice. 

I (42m) met a girl on Tinder and we started talking on Snapchat. I agreed to pay her for some pics and videos and sent her money through Cash App. The problem is I have a long term girlfriend. The girl I met knows this and after I sent her the money she threatened to tell my gf if I don’t send more. She said she’s a “hacker” and she’ll find out my real identity. 

I used a fake name on Tinder and Snapchat and also my cash app has a fake name. The only real evidence she has is a picture of my face that I sent her. 

Is there a way that she’ll be able to find out my real name with any of that information?

Again, I know what I was doing was wrong and I’ve learned my lesson but I’m worried now.",14Apr2020,6
894,"So I (18M) moved four hours away from my childhood home last August for college. At first it was tough to adjust because I've always been very social and I didn't have any friends in my new town. I went from spending almost all my time around people to spending most my time on my own. I went home during winter break and sorta wanted to stay but I decided to go back to college to be with my friends. 

Once the whole corona virus stuff happened I moved up (it's a four hour drive and I hate driving if that matters). After a week I moved back to my grandma's because I missed my girlfriend. We broke up the second day I was back. It was a fairly clean break, although when it first happened I was devastated. I was gonna move back home the next day but something didn't feel right so I decided to stay till it felt right. 

It's been a little over two weeks and I haven't felt like moving home. I struggled with my family during highschool but we've moved past that. Back home I have my mom, two sisters and their husbands, my little brother, and my best friend. I wouldn't have to buy anything and there would be lots of stuff to do (tv, games, puzzles, all with people)

Down at college though all my friends have moved home. I'm not close with my grandma or other family in the town. I have to buy my own groceries. I only leave my room to work out and cook. I spend the majority of the day doing homework, practicing my instrument, playing on my phone and watching TV. I never really see anyone, but I've always been a super extroverted person

So why don't I want to move home

TLDR: Im an extremely social person who wants to stay at college almost completely alone instead of going home to friends and family",14Apr2020,1
896,"My family moved away in the summer, 2 hours from my hometown I've lived in all my life. For a few months I was going back a few times a month to see my friends. 

I was going through some shit and one of these times I was in my hometown I got black out drunk and separated from my friends, I got found outside a pub by a mate and he called this girl (gf of a semi-mate with anger issues) with a car to help get me back home.

On the 5 minute journey I touched the girls leg and called her fit and stuff and they yelled at me to stop (was specifically told it was no worse than this), and tried to fight my friend as well.
 The next day my friend told me what happened so I messaged an apology to him the girl and her boyfriend. The girl didn't reply. 
The boyfriend said he's gonna beat the shit out of me. 

The next day I messaged the girl again and she wanted a better apology so I tried my best and she accepted. 

I went back to my new home but the next few times I was in my hometown I came close to getting beaten up, missing the bf by minutes of him finding out where I was and coming to get me. 

Eventually he dropped it cos a mutual mate talked him out of it. But then her brother found out, and he messaged saying he has to beat the shit out of me for what I did to his sister and he's not gonna drop it
He called me up and I agreed to meet him the next time I'm in town for a fight. 

I put it off and then covid struck. He messaged and saying to come fight him as soon as covid is over or it'll be worse for me. 

He's been in over 10 fights, I've been in none, I have height and weight over him, he's known to go berserk, has anger issues. 

Should I fight him, or let him beat me up? 
If I leave it I'm sure I'll get jumped sometime.

906,"Before I type out the rest of this I should say my life isn’t all bad and I’m fortunate for what I have but this issue has been very heavy on me these last few years. I am currently fifteen, when I was eleven my mother sat me and my siblings down one day in a restaurant and said that she’d be living away from our dad for “a while” and that we’d see how it goes. She had just picked us up from a stay at our grandparents house, so we had all our bags with us. After that we drove to an apartment and stayed for a couple days. Since then it’s been moving back and forth from my dads house and our moms apartment for 4+ years. What tears me up is that everything seemed so perfect before the divorce. We had a nice house together, did things as a family, went on trips, spent holidays together, etc. And now everything has shattered into a dozen pieces, with holidays spent away from one parent, traveling to new places without another, having my parents new significant others introduced in my life and all their family that comes with it. I can’t begin to describe how angry and sad this has made me over the years. My parents have been a bit hesitant to tell me exactly why they got divorced. I get angry when I think about how great everything seemed before. I think about how how I have to live partially out of a bag, moving across town every week and it makes my blood boil. I’ve gotten angry at my parents before and wanted to yell and yell and yell, but never have because what good would this do and I know they don’t deserve it. I have trouble staying at my moms apartment. It feels cramped and small, so I’ll stay at my dads house a few extra days up to a week sometimes. During this time I feel better about the space issue but I’m heartbroken thinking about how my mom must feel. I’ve talked to her about it and as much as she says she doesn’t mind me staying away a few extra days I feel like theirs a knife in my chest.

907,"I’m sure there are many horror stories with HOA’s but I’m actually concerned for the health of my wife, my 2 cats, and myself. I live in south Georgia in a 12 story condo, roughly 1,200 sq ft apartment. The AC in our apartment has severe seasonal issues, it just cannot keep up in the summer. This has been on ongoing issue for 2 years. 

We have personally spent $10,000 on a brand new AC system, and countless more on various check ups and other “fixes”. We used the building guys and 3 other contractors, 4 if I count the guy who came by and said he wouldn’t touch anything and said it was the buildings problem. It only happens once we hit mid April and will be bad till October. 

I can elaborate more on the AC/temp issue but I’d like some advice on dealing with the HOA on this. I’ve called them, written them, emailed them, and had the contracts email them, all to no avail. They always have an excuse that would be a building wide issue but I’ve spoken with several other tenants and they have no such problems. Several of the contractors have told me it’s the water coming in and both pipes upon feel test are scalding. I’ve mentioned this many times and have, after all this time, received a judgment from the HOA board that “it is not their problem”.

I’m not a litigious person but the answer can’t be nothing can be done and we hope you don’t die when it becomes 97 degrees out. I don’t know what else to do. Should I get a lawyer? Is this even considered reckless endangerment or something like that? It’s 79 in here and only 82 outside.

908,"(tl;dr at bottom)  
I posted this in a few other subreddits just because I didn't realy know where to put this. I (23F) no longer live with my Mom. She kicked me out, I have been living with my boyfriend since January. In the event that I left, I packed a few bags of essential things like clothes and toiletries. I left everything that I didn't want and/or couldn't take because of her not giving me enough time, which wasn't much (a dresser, shoes/clothes I don't wear, shelves, books, lamps etc.)

Next month she is moving and asked what I wanted her to do with my stuff because she won't be packing to take to her new place due to lack of space (and honestly I don't blame her otherwise). I said I don't need any of it, she can either throw it out or sell what she can, because due to current events I can't come get anything. She didn't like that.

For background I'm an esthetician. 3 years ago she bought me an esthetician table, while I was still in school. I never used it once. I didn't have any friends to use it on (we practiced in school anyways) and the job I got already supplied one to me. So it's basically useless. I opened it once to look at it, and it sat in my closet ever since.

I told her, it's not practical for me to have because I haven't used it once and probably won't be able to use it in the future and will most likely be switching careers (due to current events). Her response:

""I bought that from my heart. Felt so damn glad that I could.My life isn't disposable, so dont treat it that way. And life isn't one big joke, not to reality anyways. You show a lack of respect towards me. I would have hoped my daughter (wherever she went) would think it meant something to her. And Would want to keep it, because afterall, it was a gift from her mother. A meaningful gift. Not some bullshit like a jewelry box (a gift from my boyfriend's mom) just because I could afford it. What ever happened to my loving, thoughtful daughter?""

What should I say to her to let her know that it's not really against her, instead I just don't have room for hoarding stuff that I don't need/use? I barely have any possessions right now and it's great. I don't want any more. I could take it and sell it but, that seems wrong to me because she bought it and it was pretty expensive. It did mean a lot to me when she bought it and still does, but it's still useless. And finally, I can't even get it because of current events. 

tl;dr: mom who kicked me out is moving, my things still at her house, wants to know what I want to do with a gift she bought me 3 years ago that I never use and never will. I told her to throw it out or sell it and she is taking it personal. What should I say to make her think otherwise.",14Apr2020,1
912,"Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language. 

So my sweet boyfriend (18M) really has trouble retaining any information when it comes to school related subjects, like he cannot concentrate on reading something for more than 2 minutes and there's always something that distracts him (that's what he says).

The thing is that he really is extremely capable of retaining information when it comes to something he is passionate about, like he would read anything about something he likes and doesn't forget it at all. But when he tries to read something school related he doesn't remember much of it later. This has been going on since the start of the school year (september) and he really tries his best and I can see that but it's just not working and I feel so bad for him and don't really know how to help. 

This year he will have like a graduation exam that determines whether he will get into the university he wants or not, it should have been in June but because of Corona it will probably get postponed until July or August, also because of the lockdown and schools closing the subjects he has to learn for that exam have been reduced to half so that definitely helps but it's still hard for him.

He just gets distracted by anything and even when he tries for hours to study it doesn't really come anything out of it. It may seem that he doesn't really care but that's not the case, it's very stressful for him and it seems that nothing is working. 

Also most of the time he cannot even try to study because his parents are home and they are really noisy and just don't understand that he needs some space and silence, but at the same time they yell at him that he's not studying and say he'll never get into that university etc.

I just want to see him succeed. 


TL;DR: My boyfriend has a really big exam in a few months that will determine whether he gets into the university he wants or not. He gets distracted easily and cannot retain any school related information. Need advice on how to help him. 

We're in Eastern Europe if that makes a difference.

Does anyone have some advice? Like easier learning techniques or anything that can help him study more efficiently?",14Apr2020,1
913,"This is something that happened to me around May time 2019, I have never ever discussed it with anyone but one person which I’ll get to later. I am a 24 year old male, 23 at the time. I would like to solicit advice and feel like the good people of reddit may be able help me. This event has traumatised me seriously, I’m disgusted in myself, upset, angry, confused, emasculated, ashamed, worried... the list goes on. To some it may seem I’m overreacting but please hear me out. 

I work behind the bar of a restaurant that my family owns, I see hundreds of people a week and of course try my best to make good relationships with the customers, it’s in my nature to be hospitable. We started to get a group of friends coming regularly, two who happened to be a gay couple (M). Well of course we tried always to make them feel welcome and build a relationship with our valued customers. One of the two gay men seemed to be particularly fond of me (a heterosexual) from the beginning, I just noticed he’d always be looking over at me and stare deeply into my eyes when we spoke, I thought nothing of it since I have plenty of gay friends with whom I share a mutual respect for who they are and their sexuality. 

The gay man in question happened to split with his partner and would come with his other friends to the restaurant and stay till close with the others drinking, occasionally myself and some colleagues would go out for drinks into town with them, no biggie since we all got along it was fun. Then one night we had been drinking, my colleagues had left with some girls and I was seemingly way more intoxicated than I usually would be on a night out (not a massive drinker anyway). The gay guy who I believed to be fond of me seemed to be looking after me and told me I’d be welcome to come to his house to sober up, stupidly I did. At this stage things are becoming a blur, he kept giving me more and more alcohol to the point I’m literally black out drunk. I remember asking if I could use the spare bed to go to sleep because I was barely a functioning human at this point. 

Next thing I know he is in bed with me, naked kissing me and had taken my clothes pretty much completely off. Everything is a blur but I remember him giving me oral, this is so difficult to write but I also remember me giving him oral and then giving him anal. I didn’t have a clue what was going on in the slightest, I have never ever been gay and I’m a more than certain about my sexuality, as I said I have gay friends and am completely pro-homosexuality; live and let live I have always said. 

The next morning I wake up and I genuinely can’t recall much, except what had happened. I was praying it was a bad dream. Maybe, just maybe, it didn’t happen and I was just really drunk and imagining it. He tells me everything, my heart drops and I am lost for words. I would NEVER ever have consented to this, I had been taken advantage of by someone who I thought I could trust, someone who knew I was straight. I don’t know how to deal with my emotions at this point I’m so confused and upset and worried. He knows my family quite well and I come from a family with quite a let’s say conservative dad who holds closely his old values, my brothers being the same. I am riddled with anxiety and panic in case they find out. 

It gets worse, I told him that whatever happened was a mistake, whatever I did I didn’t mean to and I would never engage in homosexual coitus. He starts to try and convince me I’m gay, saying he knew all along I was gay and that he’s glad I’ve finally admitted it. This was a lie, he was gaslighting me. I begged him not to tell anyone, I had to play it down and act cool as if I wasn’t bothered so that he wouldn’t use it against me. Weeks pass and he rings me telling me how good I was and how he loved my c*ck and other revolting remarks that made me sick to my stomach. I kept having flash backs, I’m riddled with anxiety, shame, guilt, disgust, panic, I was blaming myself, I considered suicide should someone find out. Of course he’d gone and told people and I have a suspicion that my family got wind. I wanted to go to the police but I felt like I couldn’t prove it and wouldn’t have a leg to stand on, not to mention the shame of having people find out about it and it become public. Still to this day he comes to the restaurant and speaks about it, I’m honestly devastated it was the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. It still haunts me to this day. 

I’m sorry for the long post, I just don’t know what to do. I can’t live with this horrific trauma that plagues me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

917,"(I’m looking for responses from people who have experience working in psych wards or have knowledge about this work who can give me perspective on a bad experience I had)

How do I get past my crazy fear of ending up in a hospital that I really don’t trust after my last experience in the psych ward?

What happened was I got put in the psych unit because I saw a nurse who had upset my friend a lot the last time I was there and I started crying and panicking thinking about my friends who were still trapped in there so of course they put me back there again lol. 

While I was there, I got stuck with a nurse practitioner who seemed to have very little training in psychiatry and her decisions made no sense to me and she kept breaking rules and the rest of the staff kept trying to get me to trust her good intentions (while also appearing to me to be possibly nervous about her behavior as well) but now I look back and I think I might have actually been right to suspect that she was keeping me locked up longer than necessary because she was afraid that if she discharged me while I was so angry with her, I could get her in trouble. It sounds so paranoid and because I know I was less stable than I thought I was at the time, I know it’s possible that my perspective on this is off but I really don’t think it is and I can’t help but feel angry and scared over it.

All this needs a little more explaining to understand all the confusing details but the main bullet points are: 

-My main complaint against her while I was there was that she broke doctor-patient confidentiality when she tried to involve my mother in her treatment plan for me (knowing that at the time I was scared of my mother) but later I saw a document in my medical records giving her permission to contact my mother that I have no memory of signing and my mother’s name is spelled wrong in handwriting that is obviously not mine

-she tried to get me committed without giving me the option of signing myself in voluntarily when she was supposed to

-this ward is supposed to be only for people who are a danger to themselves or others (I actually lied to get in the first time because I wanted to get away from my mother who was scaring me), but her reasons for keeping me there got progressively further and further from having anything to do with me being possibly dangerous as time went on

919,"I am a pretty chill guy and I usually end up as the listener and advice giver...but I'd love to somehow train my brain to have more interesting things to talk about.  I find myself not ever really having anything to say when hanging out with friends, co workers, and my girlfriend.  

No one has ever complained about it or anything, and I'm not like awkwardly shy or quiet, it's just that I'll be quiet sometimes because I feel like it wouldnt be that interesting to hear and find my self at times asking myself...what should I say next.  I litterally dont have anything to say and I am not even thinking about anything.

I have become a boring person?? I feel like I am at times.

It's like I can walk into a room and be the loud funny one for about 5 minutes...past that...I got nothing lol.

I usually allow others to yack my ear off and I just chime in here and there and everyone loves me cuz I'm so ""real and chill"" but I honestly am sick of being the quiet nice guy.  But I dont know what to say.  

But I guess I feel like I havent done anything too intense or interesting to ever talk about but I wish I had interesting stories to tell and share and be that guy who's fun to be around.  

All I can think of would be pushing myself to be more out going and force myself to go to more social situations to practice being more talkative.  It's not that I'm shy, I litterally have nothing super interesting to talk about I feel.  I want to open my mouth and have something meaningful, or funny, or exciting to say.

I feel like I have a hard time relating to some people at times cuz more people just yack about that video game, or that new netflix show, or that internet trend...all the stuff is so boring to me.  I love to engage in real talk and real life and share real things.  Idk if that has something to do with it.

How does one have more interesting things to say?? Maybe I do a bunch of interesting things but just dont know how to make it into a conversation that would be interesting for another person to listen to.

Any advice here peeps??",14Apr2020,3

923,"I’m trying to figure out whether or not I have hurt myself lifting weights or if I’m dealing with something possibly more serious 

So about two weeks ago I started lifting weights, and the first day I went pretty heavy and way over did it. Next day all of the muscles I worked were really sore, along with the side of my ribs. Some were in pain and I’m almost positive I over worked myself. 

So I took it easy for a few days and then went back into it lightly, and had been fine since a couple days ago when I started adding in some new exercises with a bow flex machine. As of yesterday I noticed a sore spot near the bottom of my right ribs, not really a pain but it’s definitely a little sore to the touch, and also a little bit of back pain. My dad caught me working out and told me I was doing one of exercises completely wrong and that I could hurt myself, so that made me feel at ease but I’m worried these could be due to something else. Particularly lung cancer. I’ve never smoked cigarettes but I used to smoke a bunch of weed and I’m worried I might be developing it. Might be far stretched. The soreness in my rib spot has started to go away and I don’t have any other symptom. 

Is it more likely that I just pulled a muscle doing something the wrong way? The exercise in particular my old man called me out on was definitely putting pressure on my abdomen / chest area but I’m just not sure and I’m kinda paranoid.",14Apr2020,2

Now one and a half years later we finally decided to talk about it. She said that she had the feeling that i wouldn't have enjoyed it. And i said that i was simply inexperienced and that's why i acted weird after [...].

However by the other things she said, she made clear that she wanted to try it again sometime [she asked me about my kinks and said that she was horny in quarantine and waited for it to be over]. I didn't wanna be a dick about and so i talked to her about my kinks and how i really found it, however it seems like she was really in for serious business again and i don't know if i am.

Hey Reddit,

I’m a 16-year-old nearly 17-year-old guy and I’ve been just noticing how unsatisfied and irritated on how my life’s been going. 

There’s a lot to say so I’ll try to sum it up but it may end up pretty long so bare with me lol as it's some feelings I had for a while and recently. 

To start I’ve really for the last 3-4 years now been having an unhealthy lifestyle. I’ve been in my room on my computer for most of my day. For the last 2 years or so it’s been really progressively worse. Especially recently from all the coronavirus things going on. I really only got out for school and now I can’t really do much. I fear for this sort of lifestyle after Senior year although I do plan on going to college so maybe I won't be too bad in that. 

I can’t really stop my addiction on the computer either as most my friends in real life are online and I feel as if I stop I sort of miss out on a lot, and I don't really even know what to do for my spare time. This isn’t to say I don’t go out much or at all. I do hang out with my friends from time to time outside actively I’d say once every 2 months or so and I do go out every once and a while on the weekend with my family. But with my friend's relation being good, I feel my family’s relationship is going down.

See, I love my parents and my older brother they take great care of me and I love them. However, I don’t know if it’s just me being a teenager, or just how anti-social I kind of become from my addiction to electronics, or both at the same time, but I feel I’ve sort of fallen out of touch with them. Sometimes I would talk to them and there would be conversation but other times being most times, it’s the same response both ways of “hows school” “how’s work” “did you eat” etc or just some awkward talking. I’d try to start conversations too at times and they would too but it just sometimes ends in silence of one-word answers. 

The thing is also they still view me as a little kid in still calling me nicknames I joked around with when I was like 12 while sort of giving me a baby/kid tone when I talk to them which makes it a bit difficult to really interact. This is also much different from me talking to my friends and a bit of my older brother where I’m much more social and much more I’d say open and more true to self. 

I don’t know if I’m like trying to hide my true self from my parents where I’m just a typical teen near-adult who is just starting to know the world and progressing my personality vs I think of them just seeing me as their 12-year-old boy. There’s just sort of a disconnect between both me and them.  I really want to establish to them that I’m growing up and being more adult and independent but I don't want to really say it in a mean way/break their spirits of who I am and not their 12-year-old boy if that makes sense. I want to just talk to them where I can be open, adultly, and true to self, while also having just conversations with them without it being just awkward or they see me as their young kid if that makes sense from what I said. 

I also though just feel bad that I’ve been for the most part cooped in my room for a couple years and have been really not been active as a teen should be. I feel I’m sort of a bad son for letting them on a bit that I am just their 12-year-old kid who responds to their silly nicknames and stays in my room not really being social or true to self to anyone except my friends online and at school. 

Along with that, most of my friends are learning how to drive and are starting to be active while I’m just sort of stuck. I’m having struggles learning to drive and I’m feeling just now irritated at how my life’s going as I'm just being left behind. 

I can’t get the hang of driving, everyone in school and my friend group are getting jobs, getting their license, being active,  while I’m sort of stuck, I feel I sort of wasted my life on my stupid computer, I have strange relations with my parents with awkward conversations and where I believe they see me as a young child when I’m a teen near-adult. 

I don’t feel depressed or anything like that but I just feel sort of trapped and irritated at how my life has been and how it’s turned up how. I love my family and friends but I just want things to get better for me and to just find a balance of everything. I plan on talking to my parents about this but I don’t really know how to approach it or what to say. I just need advice on all my different situations I kind of said of what I’ve been feeling and if anyone can help. 

Thank you for reading it all if you did and if you need any more information or clarification on things let me know as I kind of rambled on and just wanted to get all my feelings out there :)

Also if this is the wrong subreddit to post something like this I’d appreciate a redirection to where I should post this.

940,"Can someone tell me if I might have some kind of learning disability? Here is a list of things about me. I can't even put them into a coherent essay so I just have to list them. I'm almost 30 years old btw.

I was ""good"" at mathematics, in the sense that I knew how to manipulate the symbols and numbers. But I never actually understood the ideas, like if someone asked me to explain I would have no clue. But I could add and multiply and solve equations, just not know what it means. It was like I had learned/memorized the rules of a ""game"" without really understanding it.

I always thought that learning the definition of a vocabulary word is just memorizing the words of the definition in order, not actually understanding what the words mean. To this day I have a horrible vocabulary and struggle to learn new words.

I always struggled with reading comprehension. I am not illiterate, I know the alphabet and can read words on a page but I won't know or remember what I read, so I have to re-read. And repeat this process over and over. 

One time I was in my room reading a history textbook, and my mom came in really quickly and left. Then about an hour later she came back, and she noticed that I was still on the same page of the book. She thought I was goofing off and not studying, but I was literally still trying to read the same page an hour later.

I was okay-ish at science courses, like physics and chemistry. But really only because I could ""do the math"", as in using the right physics formulas and knowing how to balance chemical reactions. But I never actually understood the scientific ideas behind everything. I just blindly ""did the math.""

One aspect of English that I was good at was diagramming sentences in like 8th grade. I knew how to diagram the subject and predicate of sentences and everything. I really didn't get the meaning of it, I just knew what to do.

Now that I think about it, my parents always did my science projects and book reports for me. They wrote a graduation speech I had to give. They wrote my college application essays. I think they even wrote some of my papers in college.

The thing is that I can think of a lot of ideas for a paper. I just don't know how to coherently form them into an essay. I can come up with lots of ideas, good and bad, I just don't know how to put them together in a meaningful paper.

I am just really slow when it comes to reading. I think I could be a ""good"" reader and understand things if I had more time. But school always went at too fast of a pace for me so I always had to look up Sparknotes.

I think I just have no passion or interest or motivation. in anything. Like there is not one thing I enjoy.

I couldn't tell you how a lightbulb works. How air conditioning works. Why we need power. I don't know how anything works. I am the stupidest person on earth.

I just have no analytical capability. Like I don't know how to read poetry or understand the deeper meaning of a passage or book. I can barely remember the pure facts of what happened in the book, I could never understand the deeper meanings like themes and motifs. I still don't even know what a motif is.

I have no real intuition in appreciating art. Like a piece of art could be ""beautiful"" but I would have no idea. I just don't care.

One thing that does click with me is music/songs, specifically the instrumentals. I still might not understand the lyrics or appreciate the message behind a song but I really like the sounds of music, specifically pop/electronic music.

What might have helped me is audio books, extra tutoring, more time on tests.

I also struggle understanding speech. Like I always ask ""what"" and ask people to repeat themselves because I have no clue what they said. Eventually I can piece it together but I am just slow. I need more time. Or if someone asks me to read directions to something, if I am reading it out loud I have no clue what I am actually reading since I am putting all of my focus into just reading it out loud.

Whenever I had to give presentations I just focused on making sure I had memorized what words to say and not actually understanding what I am talking about.

I know how to handwrite and type.

I don't know anything about politics. Or history or the economy. Or things like social justice or racial justice. I'm an idiot when it comes to these things.

Like I could go on, but these are just the things I could think of first. I'm sure I'm just stupid but there is a part of me that hopes that I actually have some kind of disorder or disability.",14Apr2020,11
941,"I'm a junior in college majoring in French and enrolled in an accelerated BA/MA plan in international studies set to graduate in two years.

949,"So we have recently acquired new neighbors, probably a month or so before the country went into social isolation mode. Up until the last couple of weeks everything has been fine, we teach so we were out most of the day. Our walls are not particularly insulating when it comes to sound, and we can frequently hear our other neighbors (we're a middle terrace) playing with their small child, which doesn't really annoy us as it's often only for small amounts of time. However now that everyone has a lot more time on their hands and is being asked to remain indoors, our newest neighbors have started to make more and more noise. Unfortunately we haven't really been able to speak to them or get to know them at all as everyone is under lockdown, but from what I can gather, one of them is a violinist and I think that is their profession. So I appreciate that that requires lots of practice. However unfortunately, even though we have 3 stories in the house, you can hear it in every room. At the moment it hasn't been much of an issue as we're on holiday from work, however next week we go back to teaching, and will be video calling, recording videos etc where noise is more of an issue. To give you an idea of the level of noise, on a video chat today, I was struggling to hear someone with a quieter mic over the sound of the violin. The icing on the cake was the loud noises coming from their bedroom tonight as I'm trying to get to sleep...

954,"My mom has raised me alone since I was 6 (now 21, graduating college soon) and has provided me with everything that I needed physically to succeed. However, only after I left for college did I realize that she's been trying to control my life, whether it's from who I make friends with, to what I study, to what I do in the future. While she doesn't compare me to others (although that's only because my dad does that and they don't get along), she compares me to this ideal son that she has in her mind. No matter what I do, I am never good enough. I have never received praise for anything I do, achievements wise or emotionally. I have never received any reassurance that it's OK to make mistakes and that I am not a failure. Every single day when I am at home and not at school, I get reminded how I am a terrible son and I don't love her and I don't do anything for her, who has put forth and given up everything for me. When I try to let her know how it makes me feel, she says that I am attacking her and that all her efforts have led me to be a cold, uncaring son. I tried to propose therapy but she said she would rather kill herself than do that. On the worst cases, she threatens suicide because I don't care about her.

If she was straightforward about this and was obviously aggressive, I would have left long ago and not looked back. But this is incredibly heavy because I understand how much she sacrificed and how much shit she has gone through by being a single mother. I have always tried to reconcile and forgive her for every hurtful thing she has said to me, but it's inevitable that it will happen again. Every time, she says that she's alone in this world and I should abandon her like everyone else did in life. The thing is that it's true but I feel like neither of us are happy when we're together; she is always finding things to be disappointed in me with and I always have to repress my true feelings.

I am thinking of leaving (yes it's probably a bad idea in the middle of this pandemic), but I just really don't think my mental state can handle this any more. The problem I have is that this can lead to two paths: she either takes this into consideration and we can more easily reconcile later on, or as she has already threatened, she will sell her house and disappear from my life (she has also threatened suicide). 

Despite all that's happened, I still really love her and care for her, and that's what's making this such a hard decision. Is there any other way to go about things that will alleviate things?",14Apr2020,1
955,"Hi Reddit Fam, so as the title suggests I’m having an issue with an adjacent neighbor smoking marijuana, let me give you some details... I (F23) live with my boyfriend (M23) in Atlanta, GA where we just moved into a new apartment a few months ago. Several of our neighbors smoke marijuana and I truly don’t have a problem with it if it’s occasional use and the user is considerate of the other people in their surroundings (we don’t partake in marijuana use, but like I said were mostly very tolerant of others using around us). HOWEVER, one couple next door to us smoke everyday, every couple hours out their front door and out their back door. They smoke inside their apartment (against our lease terms) as it seeps into our space through the vents. It’s getting warmer here so I’d like to keep our windows open, and spend time in my backyard space I just spruced up without having to smell weed every other hour. I’ve reached my breaking point and I don’t want to call the police and get them in trouble, nor do I want to get them evicted from their apartment. I’m nervous in approaching them verbally and discussing it as we’re the only white/asian couple in a predominately black community. Any advice on how to proceed? Just hoping to achieve more considerate behavior so I’m more comfortable enjoying shared space and my own home, all while not making my neighbors feel like they can’t be themselves or have to stop smoking entirely. Really hoping this isn’t a catch 22...  Thanks in advance y’all!!",14Apr2020,2

959,"Asking for a friend cuz she doesn't own a reddit account but doesn't want to make one.

Some background info:

My friend is living in a townhouse with 2 other roommates. One roommate, in particular, has this helicopter mom that constantly comes over and stays during the weekend to make food and hangout with her daughter. The mom is known to wander around the townhouse and into my friend and the other roommate's room and later demand from her daughter for her roommates' various possessions she sees in their room. My friend asked me for advice about this and I told her to just tell her roommate that her mother is not allowed to go into their rooms and so far they seem to respect that request.

My friend doesn't have the heart to tell her roommate that her mother is no longer welcome in their home as she fears that it would be hypocritical to not allow the mother to come but her friends (like me) are allowed to come.

Onto the predicament that was laid out today.

I got a panicked message from my friend about how the mother is planning on dropping the roommate's sister off at their townhouse to stay for the weekend. We are located in a city with a stay at home order due to the pandemic. According to my friend, the mom wants to clean up the house but believes the sister will ""get in the way"" of her cleaning. The sister is autistic, she is able to perform basic functions but requires assistance with more advanced functions. The sister and the mother had reached the agreement by themselves and have just informed my friend and the other roommate of the sister staying over, without asking for their permission.

My friend is stressed out because she works at a well-known retail chain and has a high chance of infection and infecting others. She doesn't want to infect the sister and maybe get the sisters' entire family infected, but the roommate and the mother brush off her concerns with ""It'll be fine."" The roommate is too scared to defy her mom's wishes and is afraid if she declines her mom will ""rip her a new one.""

I already told my friend that she needs to talk with her roommate that under no circumstances should the sister be allowed to stay over for the weekend but I'm not sure what methods can be used to convince the roommate that this is a horrible idea.

What are all of your thoughts and advice?

961,"I'm(f) a really big stress eater. I've been trying to lose weight for a long time. Recently I've lost 30 pounds and I felt really good about that. I had a decent diet and I had to walk everywhere because I didn't have a car. Then I got food poisoning and after I recovered I just wasn't able to get back on it. I've been at the same weight for months now after so many failed attempts at starting again.

That being said I've recently been forced out of dorms due to COVID and have moved back into my old house with my mom. I'm aware that many people have it much worse than I do right now but I'm losing my mind. I know my mom is stressed too but it's like she's refusing to get along with me. I'm still on my college schedule of staying up late and waking up midday because of my night classes and can't adjust. My mom just thinks I don't want to spend time with her and I heard her on the phone complaining to my sisters that I'm just lazy. She mentioned once a few months ago that I've lost weight and she thought I looked good. Now it's like she can't stop making side comments about how I should eat this or that and I need to be healthy. I was perfectly fine on my own in my dorm and did all the dieting by myself and now suddenly I can't make decisions in her eyes.

That brings me to recently. We were ordering out today for dinner and we throw out suggestions of what we want to have. I say one and she just suddenly says 'I don't even want to imagine you eating that'. Looking at it now it seems small but I was hurt by it and still am. It's like no matter what I do with my diet I can't please her. I tried telling her after that if she keeps telling me about my weight it's just going to make things worse. She just rolled her eyes like she doesn't believe me or something. At this point I just want to go back to living by myself.

Right now i have been awake for 40 straight hours without a single minute of sleep or even feeling tired/sleepy at all.

I have no idea why this is happening but i am starting to get really worried. Monday i woke up around noon. Just went with my daily routine as usual. Around 11 pm i went to bed because i had to work in the morning. I tried everything i could find online to help you get to sleep but nothing helped. At 8 AM i started working and got through my day as usual. Not tired or anything. Right now it's wednesday 1am and i'm still wide awake.

The only mayor change that happened right before monday was that i stopped smoking weed. Usually i smoke about 1-3 joints on a daily basis. The reason i stopped is because i just ran out due to Covid. 

I'm not really sure if this could be the issue. I'm regular smoker and i take some weeks off. But during my ""clean"" weeks i've had no issue sleeping at all.

Anyways my ex asked me if her daughter's friend (19yo) female after trouble with her dad at home ,he's a terrible human being if I'm honest. 
So I said yes sure just as long as she pulls her weight.
 She had been there for about a month now.
She's a really cool girl we talk for hours we have more in common then her and her friend does or my ex and I.
So one night we were talking for a good 6hours , absolutely enjoying every minute of it then it happened...
She told me she had a thing for me ,tbh I've known for a long time and I do find her attractive in every single way. 
So I told her I felt the same but the way we spoke went from general conversation to quietly whispering in each other's ears it was getting hot , then she kissed me I haven't felt passion like that ever.
We both pulled away slowly with butterflies everywhere it felt good. 
My ex walked out she looked pissed off asked her what was up *nothing She said 
Which I knew was a lie she was most definitely pissed that this girl and I were getting along like a house on fire.

972,"This is mostly to save me from the embarrassment of having my sex toys on full display to two people I barely know (and to save them from the awkwardness of having to move them). So basically, I go to college about 2000 miles away from my home state. I moved back home with my parents about a month ago after campus was shut down and classes moved online, but I left most of my stuff back in my apartment. The original plan was to wait until the pandemic died down a bit before going back to pack and store all my stuff, return my textbooks, move into a new apartment, etc. 

Obviously, the pandemic hasn’t “died down” and traveling back is a pretty much out of the question right now, especially because my dad is very high-risk and I wouldn’t want to bring the virus back to him accidentally. So now I have an apartment full of stuff across the country from me that needs to be moved out before my lease ends in early May. This stuff includes an open basket with all my sex toys in it hidden underneath my bed— and yes, I am really regretting not finding a better hiding place for them right now.

My first thought was to pay one of my close friends to move my stuff for me, since most of them probably wouldn’t blink twice at a giant dildo, but all of my close friends are also from out of state and moved back home to their families. So now I am stuck with using my sister’s solution (we share an apartment so she’s in the same boat as me). She is paying two of her friends to move out her stuff, and I could easily pay them to move mine as well since I sort of know them and they are super nice. They even offered to move my things out for me. BUT we’ve barely hung out before and I’m definitely not on a “oh yeah let me show you where I hide my sex toys lmao” kind of level with them. And like, who wants to see that anyways? And should I warn them beforehand or not? To make things even worse, my dildo has the lesbian pride flag printed all over it. These girls are super chill and probably wouldn’t care, but this is not exactly how I imagined coming out, especially since they are closer with my sister and she doesn’t know I’m gay yet. She’s very Mormon and if she knew she’d probably tell my parents, who are also very Mormon.

973,"Hi there.

Currently I am sat here with my 3rd beer, I only started a hour ago. I’m getting abit concerned about where I’m heading. It’s got to the point where the only thing I’m looking forward to is when my wife goes to bed so I could enjoy a few drinks and get Merry/drunk.

Throughout the day I’m literally waiting for 10pm where I could have a drink. We are under lockdown (UK) but I imagine most of you are too, I was wondering what can I do to kick the habit? It’s difficult because of the lockdown and university is closed but I can’t bring myself to do university work at home, so I’m just lazying around all day waiting, playing on the PlayStation etc.

It’s a really difficult one though because I’ve noticed my mood is noticeably a lot better since I started drinking every night (About 6 weeks now) I cooked dinner for my wife every night, I got projects done, converted garage into a pub, did the garden up, etc.

Meanwhile alcohol has made me relaxed but if I carry on at this rate 4 beers in one night will lead to 8, 12, and so on. I feel like I can’t go a night without it, I feel agitated and restless until I have my first beer and then I start to feel relaxed.

And I was like sure I’ll be here to support you throughout whatever is going on in your head and help you through every obstacle or whatever.

But I miss her so much I’ve never felt so low I just feel so empty and hollow and even we’d always be with one another and when we weren’t wed be texting or on call. And now texts are dead and whenever I ask to call she keeps saying she’s busy or whatever and it’s always me texting or keeping convos going and whenever I ask her what’s wrong she just keeps saying it’s nothing your overthinking and this and that 

I don’t wanna lose feelings because I really genuinely love her and no other girls appeal to me I only want her, I asked her is there any chance of us getting back together and she just said we will have to see what the future holds.

I’d rather stay sad and stay up every night until 6 crying over her then move on because she’s genuinely perfect she’s everything I could’ve asked for and more, but I can’t sleep or when I do it’s on and off and my appetite is non existent.

So this friend, (let’s call him Carl), I used to think that he was a cool guy until some stuff happened 2 months back.

Yes, most of the time it’s in a joking way like friends do, but recently, it hasn’t felt like a joke.

So, 2 months ago I was streaming Minecraft and I was fighting the Ender dragon for the first time. I’ve seen videos on it, but it was my first time, so I was playing really bad. Carl decides to join the stream and starts making fun of me calling me trash, a loser, bad at video games, and other stuff, yet, I haven’t even gotten to the boss yet. Later, I get to the boss and the trash talk continues. I’m trying to focus on the boss, so I ignore him. I eventually die and Carl starts freaking out in the chat about me being bad, so I ended the stream.

The next day at school, Carl comes to school earlier than usual so he can continue his trash talking. I’m talking to another friend (not in our friend group) so I ignore Carl. A few minutes later a friend (from our friend  group) comes up, Carl then gets up and starts trash talking about me to the friend that walked up. I ignore.

984,"My grandfather (dads dad)  died when I was 6, and even though I can’t quite remember the smell of the room or what I was wearing, or exactly how I felt when it happened, I do remember crying in my room clutching his brass rattlesnake belt buckle that I still wear to this day. He was truly my favorite grandparent and it hurt, and it kept hurting throughout my teenage years. I always regretted not having him in my life, and I desperately wanted him back. 

As I got older my parent were more transparent about the man he was. I remember overhearing them reminiscing on him when I was about 16. It was an interesting conversation. They were talking about how bad ass he was and the things he’s gotten into. The next day I pried it out of my mom to tell me what they were saying about him. Basically what I learned was, my grandfather was a gangster. People in his neighborhood and beyond, his own brothers and even his own father, were afraid to cross him. He rode motorcycles, owned body shops, drag raced, and broke the law. He was gangster and he was good at it, he stole cars and out ran cops. He had never been caught and served a total of 5 years in prison for possession of a stolen firearm. In the 65 years he spent as an outlaw, id say five years in the can is a win. I thought this was the coolest thing EVER. I was obsessed with this fact. I’d brag about him to my friends, even though my father would have killed me, and I just over all ate this shit up! My grandfather was a certified bad ass. Now I always knew he looked like one, but I never knew he actually WAS. 

Some years later, when I was 21 I got my first job in an operating room. My first night shift I met a nurse who recognized my last name and asked who my dad and uncles were. She named one and, lo and behold, it was my uncle. She went on to tell me and the entire nurses station that her husband knew my family, and that everyone was afraid of my family, especially my grandfather. She also said that her husband wasn’t allowed at their house because they had a meth lab.

WHAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS A REAL WALTER WHITE FUCK YEA!!!!! I never brought this up to my dad because I have a certain uncle who might lose his mind and do something awful to this nurse and her husband but I did tell my mom.. she told me it was true.  It didn’t change my view on him. I still loved him so much. He may have been a gangster but he was always the warm, teddy-like pop pop making hand butterflies and dancing with me to “my girl”. He was a bad-ass meth making pop pop.

Truthfully nothing he could have done would make me love him less. I boasted about him to anyone that listened, everywhere I go someone recognizes my last name and asks if I knew him or my uncles. And they tell me great (and badass) stories of him. I proudly wore his belt buckle everywhere I went. He was the dead love of my life, I longed to see him again and believed he was my guardian angel (if he’s allowed to be one) and when I pray I pray to him.

I’m getting to the secret. It’s important to know my grandfather was a beast of a man. He didn’t stand very tall but he was 280 pounds of mostly muscle and a gut. He sported slicked back grey hair with a white fu Manchu and he was frightening looking. If you ever seen the movie Jackie brown, he looks uncannily like Robert dinero. Specifically, in the mall scene before he shoots the blonde girl. His hands were the biggest and beefiest I’d ever seen and he was a mean looking mother fucker. My grandmother who died a few years later was in a wheelchair since she was in her 40s due to sever rheumatoid arthritis.


A few months ago, for some reason, my aunt felt the need to vent about him. She told me he was a monster who was always full of rage and he beat my grandmother to a pulp. Sometimes for no reason. She said he’d come home, see her and start beating. He also beat my aunt, but no other of his seven children. He beat my grandmother so bad she’d often be a bloody mess on the kitchen floor, so bad he’d break bones that she would never get treated. My aunt told me she believes he altered the look of her face, and that she was in a wheelchair as a result of the beatings and not arthritis. She told me he would go missing, and then come home out of the blue and beat her. And he was only like this with her, and sometimes my aunt when she challenged him. My aunt said she hated him so bad she devised a plan to kill him while he was asleep and make it look like an accident. Obviously, that was just a pipe dream..

I don’t know how to get over this. I don’t know if the right thing to do is to continue to love him in his death, because I knew him to be a good man and a loving one. Or do I disown him. Stop praying and hide his belt buckle away. It has been on my mind since I heard and I don’t know the right way to feel about it.",14Apr2020,5

Decided living with my parents will help us financially since we both don't have a job until we pass the board exam. Now I'm starting to get nervous for my boyfriend moving in with us. 
Both my parents have fixed mindsets, and can be negative. I'm nervous my parents are going to scare my boyfriend away with their negativity and more importantly my dad being disrespectful. My father thinks I'm not helping around the house when theirs nothing really I can do. We all eat at different times and I normally keep to myself. This pandemic is mentally killing me living with my parents being so negative and I'm already stressed enough that I want to work so bad to earn money. 

My boyfriend and I have reasonable amount of money in our accounts but tbh I want to save it when I start paying back loans. How do I survive with negative parents? And fear they will ruin my relationship.

Warning: no point venting to my parents when I've don't so many times yet they never meet me in the middle.",14Apr2020,1

987,Hi all. I was wondering if anyone could guide me in sending an email to my professor. I want to ask for extra credit because I have been confused with my assignments since we switched to online so I haven’t been doing well. I’ve never done this and wanted to know what to say.

988,Today I compared myself to my friends. They always get the people they want but here I am standing alone. Its not me being jealous of my friends because no I wish them the best and I am so happy for them. Its more of me asking myself why? Why do I not deserve love? Why do I feel alone? Who do I feel like nobody wants me and my affection? Yes I went on some dates but never met someone who wants to know me for me. These people were rather going on dates for other reasons. I don’t think I am ugly and this is not about ugliness. This is about self reflection. I don’t feel ready for a relationship I guess because I feel like I don’t deserve one. Yes I am not the hottest friend and I realized I can’t flirt too. So how do I stand out? I guess I have to work on myself before I am with someone. I just have a lot of emotions and I am confused. I feel like God is punishing me. I mean I have dark thoughts here and there but I have never hurt someone but myself before. Maybe God is punishing me because I hurt myself.( I don’t cut my selfie or anything but emotionally) or is it because I am fortunate in other areas in life I can’t have it all?,14Apr2020,1
989,"I will preface by saying, this happened in an average suburban neighborhood not particularly unsafe. I went outside for an evening run, and after the run I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood. I was coming to the edge of the neighborhood where I saw a random van parked at the edge of the street next to 2 cars. For no particular reason I decided to turn around and walk back to my place. As I was about a couple hundred feet from my home, one of the cars slowly drove past me and got near me slightly. As it drove past me, the guy in the passenger stared right at me and rubbed his nose I intentionallywhile looking at me. What did this mean? Did I witness something like a drug deal? I was kind of creeped out by the whole thing especially bc it was near to where I live. Did he think I witnessed something? I had headphones on so I simply ran back home.

We're pretty close and she's told me specifically many times how she's not entirely happy in her current relationship. She's cited how she's no longer attracted to him and how they haven't had sex in months (this was even pre-rona). Why she's told me this idk. 

She's been saying she wants to hang out soon, and flirts about wanting to cuddle and shit like that. I'm a no BS type of person so I've literally said ""break up with him then"" and I don't mince words bc I'm not gonna play that game. I know I should probably steer clear from her, but it's not that easy I've always had feelings for her so it's kind of an attachment I have.

995,"So I have a friend, girl is spoiled in riches and her ever whim, wish and need is gratified instantly by her insanely rich father like a genie. She's expressed her fear of being an adult numerous times and it's clear shes clinging to the safety of being a spoiled child.

This is her issue and her business but where my issue begins is her over indulgence of fandoms. When ever she obsesses over fandoms she'll always obsess over the little boys in the series rather then the characters her age (#5 from Umbrella Academy, the little boy from Once Upon A Time, Aang from TLA, the little boy from Jojo Rabbit, the ice kid from Rise of the Guardians, Hiccup but specifically only first movie Hiccup from HTTYD) and more creepily she'll unhealthily obsess over these little kids for months and talk about how cute they are and how much she ""wants to smooch their cutie faces"". She talks about these kids like shes a 14 year old talking about her favorite band crush.

&amp;#x200B;

997,"I've been a pretty bad job hopper for the past year. I've been cleaning bathrooms at a port for almost a year. The reason I'm quiting is because they don't do it right.

I told my boss that we should buy another cleaning product, but he says we have to wait until this is all over. We cant keep doing things the way we are for that long. In the showers we use bath, and kitchen cleaner. I was instructed I spray it on the shower floor, and than spray it way. That bottle also says its suppose to sit for 5 minutes. Also, the mopjeads haven't been cleaned since I started there. We just use them until they fall apart.

1001,"
I F(20) live with my boyfriend (21), we moved to a different state then where our families live. My sister (18) moved in with us not too long after. We thought it would be nice if she could save up money for school as in this state the minimum wage is +$2 then where she lived. Everything was great for the most part of the first year. 

We moved apartments &amp; she moved with us. Now this is where the problems really started to get bad. She is the most immature person I’ve ever met. She doesn’t respect us. She disregards a lot of what we tell her. Like keeping the front bathroom clean. It’s the bathroom that guests use, and it’s right across her room so she’s the only one that uses it. She is INSANELY messy. It’s gross. Every time I’d tell her to clean it, she’d just yell at me to get out of her room and that it’s already clean. Trust me, it’s not. 

So with her not respecting us, my boyfriend has a job where he can work from home, and so he does often. There is this one scenario that comes to mind often because it bothered me so much. My bf was sitting in the living room on a work call. My sister and I had just gotten back from somewhere. We both went into the kitchen talking and being a little loud. That’s when I hear him on the call so I immediately let her know to keep it down. She turns to me and says “that not my problem” I got angry and just walked away. 

So something I should mention. We pay rent a bit differently. Instead of splitting it 3 ways. My boyfriend thought we should pay depending on how much we made the month before. So with that, my boyfriend pays for 85% of the bills. My sister and I don’t make a whole lot so we pay a lot less then he does. 

We’ve tried talking to her about getting her act together but every time we do, she just gets mad and walks away mid conversation. It’s very annoying. I’ve talked to my mother about have a chat with her, that didn’t help either. There’s just a lot more that she does that bothers us. I won’t go too much into the rest, but you get the idea.

So our lease will be over early September. My boyfriend has recently given me two choice to think about until then. 

1. Move out with my sister and get our own apartment.  

2. Kick her out. Give her some time to figure out somewhere to live, or if she wants to move back to our home state, but she would NEED to move out.

Of course I feel bad for this. My sister doesn’t have a car. So if she moves out, that would be a lot more money she spends on Lyfts. I always drop her off and pick her up from work when I can so she doesn’t spend a whole lot of Lyfts. Now on the other hand, I really want her out. I just feel like I can’t do that to my sister. I’m stuck here and really need advice.

If I did move out with her, we would have to move about 15-20 min away from our work because we both alone couldn’t afford to live this close to the city. We live 5 min away from our work right now. Also her Lyfts would be a lot more money with being further away.

I just don’t know what to do here. Anything will help. 

TLDR: I have to pick between moving out with my sister or kicking my sister out because she is a terrible roommate who doesn’t respect my boyfriend and I &amp; don’t know what to do.",14Apr2020,5
