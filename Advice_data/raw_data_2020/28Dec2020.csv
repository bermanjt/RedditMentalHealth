1,"This is going to be a long one but I'm really tired of feeling like this.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, I was a shit person. I manipulated my best friend and ultimately lost him for good. I still miss him to this day and I haven't been able to move on. I feel so so guilty and I wish I could show him how sorry I truly feel. At the moment, I've considered asking my therapist about diagnosing me with BPD because I show really strong symptoms. I blew up on him, got insanely jealous when he would play with his other friends only because it felt like I was losing him. I wish I knew what was going on with me then but now that I have a bit more insight, all I want is to be friends with him again. I feel like he's completely moved on from me but I genuinely can't move on from him no matter how hard I try. I just want him back and I need a moment to explain why I think I acted the way I acted. Of course, with that hurt, it's ultimately his choice to decide whether or not he would give me a second chance. I think the fact that he would choose not to give me a second chance is what hurts the most. I knew if I had the chance to explain, he would understand, but I also don't want it to seem like I'm guilting him into letting me have another chance. I don't know what to do. I miss him dearly and even thinking about texting him makes me feel obsessive and weird because I feel as though he doesn't feel the same way. 

Any advice would be helpful &lt;3",28Dec2020,1
3,"I'm not sure if this is the sub for this so my apologies if it's not I just don't know any sub I should post this on as well as I'm using a throwaway account.

So for the past 4 to 5 months I have been questioning my sexuality (18M). If I were to be labeled it would be bisexual. I have romantic and sexual attraction to females but I only have a romantic attraction to males nothing sexual though I have fantasized about making out with a guy but nothing more beyond that sexually and the fantasies make me feel weird in a sort of good way.

I have multiple problems with this. 1. I can't decide if these feelings are genuine or not. 2. I have a weird complex that im the only one who can be wrong in a sense that since I am religious and my family sees nothing wrong with the LGBT community including me and they have said before they would accept any family member who is gay or trans etc. and that god sees nothing wrong with it either and no-one should but to me I would be the exception that this would be a bad thing that I am the only one not allowed to feel these feelings.

So 3. Anytime any of these feelings or fantasies pop up I suppress it out of the fear of finding another weapon to use against myself due to my depression and big self-loathing.

4. I have only liked two or three guys before in romantic sense again not sexually which im not sure if you can be romantically attracted to the opposite sex but not sexually.

5. If I do come to a conclusion about this and I do conclude I am bisexual I'm nervous about peoole making assumptions.  I just don't want to be labeled as I want to keep my buisness on the down low and not go around saying I am bisexual and just bring it up if someone asks.

6. Finally me and my friends have a very dark sense of humour and we make jokes about a lot of things part of it is the homies acting gay around each other joke.
I know they don't care if I were bisexual as they have gay family members and friends. And yes I know my worry is dumb I just don't want them to think that those jokes we make amount to any secret feelings or anything. God I'm cringing at myself.

Well if you read the whole thing thank you and I hope you have a wonderful day :).",28Dec2020,1
4,"# I dont know where to start, it seems as if the past few years have gone from good to bad, worse and now its almost unlivable. I will start from when it all started to go downhill.

Just a note I have bipolar typ 2.

# 2014 my life was pretty good, I had just bought my first [pet](https://i.redd.it/ds3uszfhvf761.jpg), had a nice car and an amazing apartment, good paying job and no loans no debt. 

# 2015 my then gf cheated on me and I lost my job at about the same time, this was due to my employer, she (my mother) had made me sign a contract that was fraudulent, I had no idea about this, so when we got a new boss he just tossed me out, I was never employed for real. 

# 2016 start and I’m more depressed, no job and stuff, but I was looking for jobs and applied for financial support, living in Sweden so it should be easy, right? End of year comes and still no job and no financial support, I have used most of my savings by this time… I started to study to become a nurse. They always have jobs! Sure enough I now work for almost no pay, but hey I still work! I finally tell my dad Im bipolar and that I had tried to take my life, he told me to fuck off, we still don’t talk. Tried to take my life three more times that year. 

# 2017 I got fired and had to sell my apartment, so I could eat and live, I somehow found a girl who likes me, so it was not all bad. 

# 2018 With the money I got from my apartment I bought a tiny house far far away from any city for cheap! Not long after my heater stops working, I pay way too much for a new air and water heating system but got heat again! Just in time for winter, great! Everything seems fine for atleast a few weeks... Roof just broke, its snow outside and inside… I have to take a loan I have no money left, have to fix my roof fast! while they took down our roof we find mold so this is not a “new” damage. (My insurance doesn’t cover it, they only cover damages under the roof tiles, something like that atleast.) 

# 2019 And my roof breaks again, they took all my money to fix everything, they never did most of what they said… I file a dispute, they come back to fix it, no need to pay this time! Tax time… I get screwed got to pay a profit tax for selling my apartment, I had to sell my car to dodge taking a loan.

# 2020 starts, got a job but just for the summer, roof breaks again new loan, new firm, new roof. Now roof holds out water but it’s still not done right, covide comes and I have no money, no job, no financial support and a broken house, it’s hard to want to live, Im doing my best to see the light but I need help, please.",28Dec2020,1
5,"He’ll call me an idiot for supposing something could happen and invalidate my feelings but then crack a beer 2 minutes later. It’s weird. He has punished me in the past for misbehaving and sent me to my room and like 4 minutes later I’d sneak out and he’d be cool about it.

I’m a “What if” person so if I see my younger siblings handling fireworks and gunpowder I get worried because they’re too impulsive and I’m more rational.

Idk.

Also my sibling is annoying. He’s rejected critical thinking and reading situations. He thinks everyone is going to play with him. I get super irritated by his presence. He can’t think at all. He is 10 and can’t do basic maths and can’t read and can’t write. Being well-behaved needs a certain capacity to think logically. 

I want to like breakup forever with my dad but because his emotions are more superficial and mine are more stronger and they get retained I’m trying to keep a promise but I can’t. Then I go back to normal and suddenly the feelings I’m feeling right now just disappear. My dad just doesn’t care about long term feelings. He is more short-term and like 0 feelings I can’t feel anything. It’s just beer and partying and jokes with him. Like he offers r/thanksimcured stuff if you try to get advice.

He wants to be right. 

He thinks being right &gt; thinking about or empathizing

It gives me turmoil. idk what to feel.",28Dec2020,1
6,"Like many other students my studies have been greatly impacted by coronavirus and I will be doing live online classes for at least the next 6 months. My course is divided into many modules, I am taught a module for 2 months and then sit the exam at the end of the 2 months and then I get a new teacher for the next module for 2 months and repeat the cycle until the end of my course. Each module also has a different mix of students so it's rare that I'm with the same people for each exam.

I have spent the last 4 months doing live online classes and have sat some exams but I feel extremely isolated and its really taking a toll on me. I miss forming that bond with fellow classmates where we could share our stresses and help each other out with exam question practice. I have supportive friends and family but they can't really help or understand me when I am worried about things related to the modules. I'd like to form a group chat where I can talk to other students and we can help each other out on questions, motivate each other, share revision ideas, etc...but they are complete strangers to me and I don't know if I am being weird? I can't be the only one feeling like this right? I am doing a university level degree so I hope that means people are more mature and willing to participate right?

I'd like to email my teacher first before the next module starts in Jan 2021 but I don't know how to word it...I basically just want some revision buddies so I don't feel so alone...

Any advice is really appreciated!!",28Dec2020,1
7,"About a month and a half ago, a new girl started working with me at my job in retail stocking the shelves at night. The managers didn't really do a good job at training her, but I already knew that would happen because that's what happened with me too. She started to come to me with every little question that she had, which I didn't mind. We would usually end up working the same shifts, and the same aisles, so we got to talk a lot more. She was really shy and timid, and eventually I found out she would just take her breaks alone in her car while she ate her lunch. I encouraged her to eat and spend time with our other co-workers in the break room. I tried to make sure I wasn't pressuring her or anything, I just felt bad she was taking all of her breaks alone. 

Eventually she did start going to the break room and I was happy for her, even if it meant at first she wasn't saying anything, just enjoying watching TV there with people around. I felt like I was helping her open up a bit more, and so I guess I felt kind of proud about that. I also got to know her a bit more, and she started to ask me if we could take all of our breaks together. It was nice because I felt like I could have a friend at work. Whenever she needed help, she would come to me first and foremost, which I didn't mind at all, I like helping people. Eventually I started to start teasing her or initiating some banter between us. For example, she's 5'1"" and I'm 6'2"" so I would call her shorty, midget, or something along those lines, especially when she couldn't find the ladder to put stuff on the top shelf. This eventually evolved into *a lot* of back-and-forth satirical remarks between us, and I thought it was quite fun. 

Then, my other co-worker, let's call him Max (39M), kept pressuring me to ask her out even though I said I didn't see her that way. He would swear up and down that she was into me, but I think that's just because we were pretty much always seen together at work. It started to really irk me and make me uncomfortable because of the constant pressure from Max to ask her out. But eventually a lot of other people started to comment on how ""cute of a couple we would make,"" and it was annoying to deal with. I would try to shut down anything I heard within earshot.

And then I got sick for a little while, so I missed about a week of work (and thank God it wasn't Corona). I felt bad about having to leave her on her own. When I got back to work two days ago, Max ""asked her out"" on my behalf! Even though I strictly told him NOT to several different times! I even tried to explain that I didn't see her that way.

The worst part was that I got rejected. Rejected by someone I didn't even ask out. But here's the bad part, apparently she didn't want to date me because I tease her all the time! She apparently acted disgusted with that fact because ""that part of my personality wasn't appealing."" This whole time I thought it was a fun inside joke between us, but apparently it's not, and I wish she had just told me it made her uncomfortable, or at least didn't play along with it, then I would have known it made her uncomfortable. 

And so then she purposely avoided me on all three breaks yesterday, and is instead trying to be closer to other co-workers instead of me. I didn't even want Max to ask her out for me but he did it anyway. I shouldn't feel bad for being rejected but I do, and also because we aren't as close as I thought we were, I really did think she liked the tongue-in-cheek humor we had. I really don't know what to do now. I guess I'm just back at square one here.

**TL;DR Co-worker asked out a female co-worker for me even though I don't see her that way and she said no because I tease her too much even though she would go along with the teasing and so I didn't know she disliked it.**",28Dec2020,1
8,"My boyfriend have had it extremely tough these last couple of years. 
He’s nice, polite, funny and can be a bit sassy, but I love it!!!
I confessed to him this summer and we’ve been together for the last 6 months now and he has slowly started to open up to me more and more. 
He tells me that he feels empty, devoid of feelings. Just a black hole..
I do my utmost to make him feel loved and I constantly beg him to talk to his parents about this (we’re 15), I hug him and he does tell me that things has been getting better. 
He say’s that since I’ve been so supportive that he’s started to get more sleep, he feels more motivated to do stuff, he feels more comfortable as himself and he is more mindful about how he spends his time like playing the piano or studying or drawing instead of playing video games 7h a day. 

I’ll of course still tell him that I love him whenever he needs me to, hug him when he needs me to or just be there by his side. I’ll support him with everything I’ve got but I feel like I could be doing more!!!
So that’s what I need some help with, what is extra important when it comes to helping my depressed boyfriend and what should I think about when I’m with him so that he gets all of the support and love that’s humanly possible to come from one being!!

10,"Background info: I'm in high school, still living with my parents. I live in a pretty toxic and sheltered household where I'm not even allowed to have internet.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'll try to keep this as short as possible, because there's a lot. This started as soon as I first got my iPhone around late 2017. My brother had deactivated his phone a while ago because he was on a two-year mission trip. My family is Mormon. My parents initially gave my brother's old phone number to me when they first set up my phone so that I could stay on the same family line. I then later got the number changed so I wouldn't get calls from people trying to contact my brother.

But instead of getting rid of the old number and replacing it with the new one, it just added my new phone number to my phone along with keeping the old one. In my phone settings, when I looked up my number, two different numbers were listed as being mine. When I was added to group chats, both of those numbers would be added. Apparently somebody now owned the old number. Because when both numbers would get added to iMessage group chats, messages would be sent out from the old number telling us to shut up and stop adding them to these group chats. I explained the ordeal to this random person, asked them to block my number so they would stop getting my group chat messages. I blocked them too, and didn't get a message from them.

Until later that summer, when I was added to a group chat for my church. I can't remember why, but that old number was getting added to group chats again. Maybe I unblocked them for some reason, idk I really don't remember why. But that number got added to a church group chat I was in along with the number I actually used. Every time I sent a message, it would get sent out through both numbers, and it would say that both numbers were linked to me. 

One day a message was sent out through that old number to the church group chat. And it was very creepy. It was a stereotypical chain mail ""send this to 15 people and you'll get into heaven"". But the message contained lots of details and mormon-specific terminology that someone wouldn't know unless they had researched a lot into me, my church, or both. It was really creepy. It was made to look like it was coming from me. I eventually changed my phone service provider, and got a new apple ID. Apparently both numbers were still linked to the same apple ID, which is why both appeared to be mine. But that doesn't explain how somebody else sent out messages through it, or why they impersonated me in to send chain mail. I didn't report the incident because I was dumb and in middle school.

Fast forward a year. I get a scam email to my school google account claiming that they got all my account information and tried to blackmail me for bitcoin. It was clearly fake, but I put my accounts into the haveibeenpwned website to see if any of my accounts had been involved in a data breach. Turns out my school gmail was leaked in many data breaches. I used to sign up for a bunch of stupid shit like minecraft servers under my school account when I was in like- 5th grade. But I didn't know how to get my password changed, as students can't change it themselves. It didn't look like my gmail password had been leaked, just my gmail username and the passwords to the websites I had signed up for. And none of those accounts had sensitive information or anything I really cared about. So I just ignored the breaches. But I changed all my passwords to my other accounts to secure, unique passwords. 

But I'm starting to think my school gmail password may have been leaked as well. I used to use the same password for a lot of shit, so it's possible. It's the only thing that would explain all the weird shit that's been going on lately. About six months ago I started getting notifications on my school email that a lot of my gmail accounts linked to my school account were recovered and logged into when I never logged into them. I looked at one of those gmails and found random activity. There was a review under my name for a cabinet business that I never made. It was just really random. But I changed my passwords to every one of my accounts that I knew of, and I turned on two-factor verification for all my gmails (except my school one because it doesn't let me). 

But I stored all my passwords in the notes app of my phone, locked by the same password as my school account (not a very secure password, I know, but I really only set that password to prevent my parents from getting into it). But I was getting notifications on my school email that the password to my church account had been changed. The only way someone would be able to change it is if they either had access to my password, or my school email. I changed the password to something new. A few weeks later it got changed again. I changed it to something else again. It got changed again. At this point I started to suspect someone might have access to my notes app. So I took all my passwords off of my notes app, changed them all, and wrote them down on paper. My church account password stopped getting changed. That makes me think someone likely had access to my notes app. 

Then a few months ago I received a bunch of calls from a bunch of different numbers that had the same area code and next three digits as my phone number. I answered one of them to see what was going on, and the person on the other end said they had received a call from me and they were calling me back. I told them they probably had the wrong number or something. He seemed genuinely confused, told me to have a good day, then hung up. He seemed to be telling the truth. It didn't seem like he was aware of what was going on or orchestrating it in any way. He just seemed like a random person. So I think somehow a bunch of calls were sent out through my phone to numbers with the same area code and next three digits of my phone number. I kept getting a bunch of these calls from all these different numbers throughout the rest of the day and the next day as well. It really freaked me out and I didn't answer any more of them. But the day after that it just stopped all of a sudden. It seems like my phone maybe sent out a bunch of calls to similar numbers in my area code, and these people were calling me back. But I don't know.


I then started noticing strange activity on my school chromebook a couple months later. One day I went to reddit, and files started automatically downloading onto a plain-text editor app called Caret. The files that were downloading appeared to be my old math review guides from last year, or at least that's what they were titled. I didn't actually open the files to see for myself. I cancelled the downloads. I opened reddit again and the downloads started again. The downloads would only start when I opened reddit. I deleted Caret, and never used my chromebook again to go on reddit. A few weeks ago I found a different plain-text editor app on my chromebook that I had not installed. It was hiding in my list of downloaded apps. I deleted it as soon as I saw it. I didn't see anything downloaded onto it though. It's all freaking me out and is making me wonder if it's in any way related to my accounts getting hacked or my number having been compromised.

I've been getting a lot of phishing text messages on my phone ever since I deleted my passwords from my notes app. Just a bunch of ""Your package is on it's way, click this [sketchy link] to track it!"" and ""I'm sending money through cash app, click this [sketchy link] to claim it!"" I haven't clicked any of the links, and even if I did, since my parents completely blocked my internet access, the links wouldn't take me anywhere. I think whoever's behind all this shit likely had access to my notes app and possibly more things on my phone, and ever since I deleted my passwords off of my phone they've been trying to get me to click malicious links so that they can get more access to my information again. Today I got a FaceTime from an unfamiliar and sketchy looking email address. It really freaked me out. 

I just don't know what to do because I can't let my parents know about this. If this got investigated, my parents would find out about all of my personal shit. I've been through a lot of terrible shit, and I would post about it to forums in order to get support and advice. Strangers on the internet kept me alive throughout most of my darkest times. But the information I posted is extremely personal and sensitive. And my parents are not people I trust. They would honestly be heartbroken if they knew about the shit I've been through and it would literally break the family up. I managed to find some of those old accounts and delete them. But I couldn't find all of them. There are some accounts that I cannot find the username for at all, but I know that I posted extremely personal things on there and overall just completely overshared all my trauma. Which is one of the main reasons I'm so scared of being cyberattacker like this. If my attackers find my old forum posts, I'm worried I could potentially be doxxed.

But I will not report this shit if it could risk such information about me being revealed to my parents. Save the ""but you have to report it because x,y,z."" I know you mean well, but it isn't going to happen. Not only would they find out way too much personal information about me that would destroy my whole family, but they also would find out I've been going behind their backs and getting internet on my phone for years because I know their restrictions password. I can't do that anymore, Apple's screen time made it so that they can track just about everything I do on my phone. But I used to sneak behind my parents to get internet for years. And they would genuinely be heartbroken about it, I wish I were joking. But my parents have a very Kantian view of lying.

I just don't know why this is happening. I don't have any bank account or any money tied to my phone or my accounts, so a hacker is not going to be getting a financial benefit from doing any of this. I haven't been blackmailed or doxxed, a lot of the activity happening on my phone and accounts just seems really random. It feels like whoever's doing this is just doing this to fuck with my head and torment me. I can't think of any other reason. I think that maybe my school email password got put on a list somewhere on the dark web due to some data breach, and someone from the dark web managed to log into my school gmail and somehow managed to get access to my phone. I don't know if the person/people currently trying to cyberattack me is the same person who impersonated me with my number back in 2017. But I don't know anyone in real life who would do this, so I think it's likely a rando online. 

I think I need to 
a) Get my school gmail password changed, and

b) take my phone in to get fixed by a professional

The problem with this is, that in order to get my school gmail password changed, I need to request to do so with my school. And I would have to explain how I realized something's up, which means they would probably find out about me using reddit on my school computer, which is not something I am technically supposed to do. I know it was stupid of me to use my school chromebook to go on reddit, but my school chromebook was my only way to access the internet before I started using the family computer. And I just needed to vent and talk to people sometimes in order to feel less isolated. But if I get in trouble for using reddit on my school computer, my parents will find out, and they will likely find my reddit account which also has a ton of private and personal information about me that they should never know under any circumstances. So I don't know how to get my school account password changed without my reddit account being found.

I also do not know where to take my phone in to get fixed. I can't drive myself yet, although I will get my driver's license in January. I don't have my own bank account, my parents put all my money in an account joined to theirs that I don't have access to. I would have to pay in cash. I don't know if they would accept cash. But I need to get my phone fixed asap. 

I'm just really freaked out and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like there's anything I can do. I can't tell my parents, I can't contact the authorities as it would just get back to my parents, I can't change my school gmail password because they would probably find my reddit account, which would get back to my parents. Even if I change my school gmail password, it seems like someone already has access to my phone anyway, so I don't know if it would change anything. I just don't know what to do and I really need advice.",28Dec2020,1
11,"My grandfather has a couple of issues and the most problematic at the moment is that he can barely walk (in a wheel chair), has a catheter, and has symptoms of dementia. She works at least 10 hours a day (from home) and has my 23 year old brother help with my granddad but he’s honestly a pain in the ass to care for. He waits until the last moment to say he needs to use the restroom and he constantly goes on himself resulting in a shower that my grandma has to give to him. Today he pulled out his catheter after he used the restroom all over himself and blamed it on her. She had to take him to the ER and is still there now. How can I talk to her about putting him in a home with the correct care he needs because this is super stressful for her and for him. My brother has also left the house in over a month and he’s losing it. He can’t go to therapy because he has to constantly watch granddad while grandma is working or he will try to walk and fall. He’s also diabetic and will get into sweets when no one is looking and his sugar will spike. The other day it was the lowest it’s ever been in months but he got into some cupcakes when no one was in the kitchen (they were hidden) and his sugar spiked back up. I’m not asking for medical advice but just advice on how I should talk to her or even bring up the fact that he may need to go to a home for a while.

12,"We were friends and I tried for more. That ended our friendship. She came back to me to apologise for cutting me out. After that we exchanged seasonal pleasantries on occasions until I had to cut it off. Every time I got in touch she was happy to talk. I think she even seemed excited. She told me I never meant much but I also remember spending hours talking every day. Being told I always make her smile and that only I could do that. That she can't handle people liking her. I remember the lengths I went to visit her. I saw her say she doesn't care about her birthday and shed a tear when her friends forgot. The time invested together seems so contrary to the apparent indifference to me. I was so awkward and ott. It's been so many years. I've had to delete the photos, the chat logs, the keepsakes but the memories still linger and even as I occasionally doubt the accuracy my recollection, the same can not be said of how I feel. I have experienced unreciprocated feelings before but this has always felt different. Everything pales in comparison. I can't convince myself that if I had behaved less overbearingly it would not have been different. Every chance I've had to talk to her I have embarrassed myself. She said she doesn't understand why I feel embarrassed but she must do. It's far too late now, we're far too many miles apart, it's wrong but honestly I do miss her. I want to go back and see her again. When I was with her everything else became background noise.",28Dec2020,1

Also, I work with her. That’s important. 

I’ve tried to date other girls, but I really can’t get my coworker off my mind. No one seems to interest me the way she does. I really don’t know how much longer I can go on seeing her every day. Being around her is simultaneously the best and worst thing ever. 

It’s becoming painfully obvious that I’m not just going to get over her and that she isn’t going to break up with her boyfriend. Should I just move away? I guess there isn’t really anything else keeping me here.",28Dec2020,1

So I tried moving on, and didnt text them. Now they're planning to hangout with me next week, should I go for it? Maybe for the last time. Or should I ditch them for always leaving me on read. I can't handle more rejections I've had enough really.

From the other perspective this could also be my brain playing games with me. They're actually nice and maybe too busy? I just don't know why are they interested in hanging out with me all of a sudden and they're pretty serious about it as well.",28Dec2020,1
16,"I’m hopefully getting tested. I stupidly had unprotected sex while at university and only now I am thinking I may have contracted HIV from this encounter or a later one with a bisexual guy (who is very likely to carry HIV because he has had anal sex with other men).

20,"My (14f) family is renovating our house, a part of which involves giving my sister (12f) and I our own  bedrooms. This means that we will be getting new beds, desks, etc. However, my parents cannot really afford that on their own, so my aunt and uncle have offered to help us (my sister and I) with buying furniture for our rooms.

Just for background— my aunt and uncle are extremely wealthy and well-off (they bought a million-dollar house upfront, aka no mortgage), and have been very generous with my family in the past.

So anyway, my aunt sent me a few links to websites with furniture. One had a lot of very expensive stuff (pretty much everything was $1,000+), which my family would NEVER be able to afford. I looked at it, and sent her a few images of things that I liked (from numerous websites, only 1 or 2 were from the expensive site.)

I discussed these with her, and we looked at a few things together, including a desk I had liked from the expensive site. She then began to search the site, and found a slightly cheaper, similar one. I thought that we could find something from somewhere else that was even cheaper, but she said that there was no point in buying something that I would have for a long time if I didn’t like it.

That would have been enough (the desk was about $1,500), but THEN, she went to the bed section of the website. I had already picked out a bed that was about $300, from somewhere else, but my aunt pointed out that it was better to have furniture that matched (the desk was the same wood as my great-grandmother’s dresser, which my mom is giving me), so I agreed to look.

We found a bed that was more or less the same structure as the cheap one I had liked, except in the proper wood and $2,000. I thought we were just looking at these for references, but then my aunt said she would talk to my uncle about actually buying these exact pieces. She did, and apparently they agreed, because she called me back later to “confirm the details” so she could order them.

I gave her the specifics, and she ordered it, but I talked to my dad later and he was completely shocked at the amount my aunt had spent on me. I’m starting to feel like it was greedy of me to accept her offer, because $3,500 is A LOT of money, especially by my family’s standards (most of our furniture is hand-me-down from friends or relatives) and I have no way to pay that back.

So, should I not have accepted? Should I have tried to talk my aunt out of buying me these? Should I ask her to cancel the order? I’m just really not sure.

TLDR, my aunt bought me a very expensive bed and desk, and I’m not sure I should have let her do that/wondering if it was greedy of me not to talk her out of it.",28Dec2020,1
21,"For context, I am new to the states and my bf and I met through tinder. In the beginning his brother’s gf and his mom disliked me and talked about me behind my back, I found out when my bf told me that his brother’s gf told him to dump me and that we were a terrible match(she had heard us arguing and fighting) in the beginning of the relationship. I completely take fault and I know my first impressions weren’t great but because me and my bf are from such different cultures it took us time to understand each other. After my bf moved out of the house that he, his brother and his brother’s gf were renting, she  completely ignored me and made me feel very uncomfortable during family dinners and holidays. His mother eventually understood me and we have a cordial relationship (we spent time even if my bf is not present) so long story shot this year thanksgiving and Christmas were great(at least I thought so) we had fun, played games and she even came to my apartment for the first time to tell me and my bf that his brother had proposed her and showed us the ring. I invited them the next day to lunch and they agreed. 

So next day is today... they came and had lunch and we played some oculus and talked. So, today when she was in our home she was talking about having a New Year party (just the girls) and so later when she left I texted her and asked her if it would be okay if I came over (cause I have no friends and my bf is the only one I hang around with) and she denied me saying it’s just her and her 3 best friends. She did say she would hang out with me some other time in a very passive way. 

I am very confused about how I feel. Idk if I am embarrassed about the rejection or I am lonely or it is a cultural difference I cannot understand. Cause back in my country if we see that someone is new we include them in our group especially if it’s a party. And I am having a hard time because sometimes she is so nice to me and sometimes she is very awkward and avoids me. Should I only maintain a cordial relationship with her or genuinely try to be friendly and family like with her ( cause me and my bf are getting married next year and she is engaged so we are gonna be family)",28Dec2020,1
22,"Hey guys, i need some suggestions.

So, Lets go all the way back... I changed schools during 8th grade and ended up in a school that was outside of the town i lived in, and i loved every moment of it, didnt talk much and mostly stayed for myself (remember that). 

There was also a dude that i had the biggest crush on in my class, and me being the akward and quiet kid i never really got the courage to talk to this guy, And i didnt have the best self esteem back then which made me think that i was just lucky to be able to see him everyday cause it made my day a little better. 

Now, four years later i get added by this guy. And ofcourse i add him back wanting to know whatsup! 

We have a casual talk, which then turns to him sending a dick pick which weirded me out, so i chose to not respond or message at all. 

  
The next day i decided to grow some balls and be the bigger person, but me having a hard time saying no, and speaking on how i feel just let it go, and we decided to meet up at his house. Me being starstruck and still absolutely in love with this man agreed on it. Ignored ALL the red flags and met up with him. I had so much butterflies, and watched every little move he did starstruck that he wanted to TALK with me.  

So, we hooked up that day and the other one, and right after before i left, he made sure i knew that he didnt want any strings attached. I agreed and went along with it ignoring everything, just because i wanted to be with him so much. 

I know how fucking selfish i am, but i cant help it, i have so much feelings towards this person

35,"Hello,

got to explain how everything built up first, please stay with me:

i'm a 27M from a very well-situated family with successfull self-employed parents that always cared for me, gave me my freedom, supported &amp; loved me to great extents. Especially my mom, that i have a very strong bond with. Finished my country's high school equivalent 2011 with ok-ish grades but never managed to get away from getting distracted by hanging in front of my computer/gaming instead of getting something done right away or stick with for a longer time.

After a year of free time and one year of mechanical enigneering i dropped out of it because exams were really hard. It made me feel miserable, tried to work on myself by going to a psychologist but i got anxious and like many other things in my life couldn't hang on and aborted after the first session.

Switched to another study subject but dropped out of uni again after 2 semesters because i didn't manage to change myself.

**At that point i started living a lie by not telling my parents or anyone that i failed AGAIN because i just couldnt bear the possible reactions.**

I made up my everyday life, what subjects i'd chosen for the next semester, faked the exams time (gaming instead of learning at my desk) with dates and grades all made up by myself, even that i supposedly wrote a bachelors thesis and finished that degree \~2yrs ago &amp; now doing my masters while actually hiding behind my computer as long as im not spending time with my current GF.

Year by year passing by, i settled with being a liar and completely blanked out that i had a possible happy future in any way. I tried to always push away the thoughts what whould happen when the lie would end, when the thoughts got close to me i started to sweat nervously and distracted myself asap.

Parallel i still had a few friends from school and on someones birthday i met my GF 3yrs ago. I also never told her about my lie and we had awesome times, travelled alot etc - being super happy and feeling lots of positive emotions/love from her i at some point even forgot that my life actually is a mess. first relationship for both, big in love and were already talking about our future together, career/family goals etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

I  think it is a mixed thing but in the last months my GF noticed how i have bad moods, she feels and complains about my negative vibes frome me that i have sometimes(but still believes in me and tries to have my back and motivate me/point me in a good direction). guess im stressed because we moved in together (she found a job).

At the same time she has a really strong outgoing/extrovert personality (alot of opposites in our personalities that we thought were complementing each other) and tries to take alot of ""room"" and get all my attention but at some point in the last months she started to not acknowledge/respect my opinion on some things, manipulate me a little bit (not sure about the situations) and made me/my family look bad even in front of her mom while we were staying at her parents' house (i think her mom is a very difficult person and GF shares some of her behaviours). GF accuses MY mom (not to her directly) of some pretty heavy stuff with weak argumentation and tells me how negative she feels towards her.

Of course i talked about it with my mom and i realized what my GF is doing and maybe it went that way harder than it should because i subordinated myself to my GF because i feel worthless and shitty instead of showing resistance and forcing respect. I also talked with my dad separately and called a kind of psychological emergency hotline for an hour or so and described the rough circumstances.

All 3 of them tell me she crossed some lines and i should consider breaking up.

Also i got a contact to another psychologist that i was searching for for months to also work on myself but i can only start with the first sessions in the new year maybe first, maybe second week.

This happened a week ago and in the days before we left for our family homes for christmas we had a few arguments. I texted her i need some 2-4 weeks for myself because of the situations that happened i need to think about stuff and i want to go to the psychologist to answer him specific questions and for advice before we talk to each other to figure it out. GF is super pissed at me because i don't communicate with her or dont talk to her first before pulling such a move.

My plan rn and the last straw im holding onto, is that it will be the first time to actually tell the lie im living (to psychologist) and ask him what to do and how i could possibly handle my current situation.

**I can't stop thinking there must be some way where i can get my GF to have some understanding and talk about everything because i dont think i can handle a breakup with the love of my life and at the same time ending my life how it was so far by maybe telling everyone in the end and i really dont know what will happen after that.**

It's ripping me apart just sitting here overwhelmed with everything and having to wait for one long week to even just be able to call the psych. I'm crying everyday, im super tense and stressed and even started to lose some hair on my head. I dont know if there is any good ending for me in this....

Thanks for reading so far;

What would your advice be, how would you handle the current situation?

I know it may be completely unrealistic that my GF will stay because i dont have any degree and lied to her but i just cant accept it ... also no idea how severe my parents would react.

Thank you for listening.",28Dec2020,1

I'm in the middle of the 4th year of my 5 year  mechanical engineering degree program (I still have 3 semesters left to graduate). I've had no professional experience whatsoever until now, but I've been very active within the university environment: student associations and the student board, various volunteering and social aid programs, leadership symposiums and so on.

Due to a dual degree program offered by my university, I'll be starting my master's degree next August, which will last for 3 semesters. The plan is to work on both my major and master's for 2 semesters, graduate as an engineer and take the extra term to get my master's.

As a result, that leaves the following months (January-July 2021) as the only available time to get an internship or some real world experience. As the period is set or limited, I fear most companies will pass on me and that not having experience will somehow affect t my future offers.

No. * You bet* I'm fixated on the 3 comments that said *""simps calling this chick an 8 or a 9 smh""* and a *""cute face, shame you look a little masculine when you smile from a distance""*. Im telling myself *""the other 100 people lied to be nice, those 2 or 3 are telling the truth""*. Heck my BF has called me cute/sexy/beautiful for over 2 years and you bet I'm fixated on the nose comment. I hate this. Why do I need to ignore any positive feedback?",28Dec2020,1
49,"My mom seems to hate my confidence

Since I was young my mother has always seemed to be resentful of me to an extent. As a child people would constantly compliment my looks and my mom was quite prideful of it. My dream was to act and model as a child and my mother said no. She said I would become and arrogant brat and that I was cocky enough. As I grew older, I could see her concern with the industry, but that was until the same behavior began manifesting in other parts of my life. For instance, if I’m getting ready in the morning with makeup she gets strangely irked by it. “You’re always primping you think your so cute” she says, sometimes getting downright angry at my attempts to feel a bit more confident. Sometimes screaming at me. Another example is when I take selfie’s in the car or infront of her. “Your always taking photos” she always points out and may even go on a rant about how full of myself I am.  In my opinion, I take no more selfies than your average teen maybe even less. Even if I did take a lot, who is it harming? It seems her narrative of me being cocky is brought up whenever we argue as well. I could simply leave a dish in the sink and she will say something like “you had time to primp but not clean”. In her opinion, primping is anything even as basic as combing my hair in the morning. It really gets exhausting. Am I not allowed to feel beautiful? I don’t get it. She also always points a out when she thinks I’m wearing a lot of makeup (even if it’s really just mascara or a layer of foundation) she acts like it’s not serious but it sounds super passive aggressive. She then may even add how she couldn’t imagine wearing so much makeup. She also points out to people constantly that I wear wigs as if it’s not my personal business to tell.  When I get upset and discuss it with her she acts as if she didn’t know even though I’ve told her before. I’m not sure why she acts like I’m so conceded. She even lies at times to add on to this. Various times in my childhood she would claim that she received calls from parents at school that I’m a “mean girl”. I was very confused as I’ve never received this complaint from anyone before and all of my report cards have said quite the opposite. In fact, I was a rather steady victim for bullying at my school. Eventually, I started sneaking and checking her call list whenever she would say this to me. Nothing from anyone in my school, she flat out lied. No email, text, call, nothing every time. I don’t understand why she wants to paint me as a Disney Channel queen bee type character. I’ve never heard this from anyone before except her and my sister at times who has been very influenced by my mother since childhood and has very damaged self image, and unhealthy relationship with food.  Eventually I started to question if I truly was a conceded awful person. After almost a year of reflection I couldn’t think of anything that would bring me to that conclusion. It really seems like it’s almost a narrative that’s been drilled into me as soon as my looks became inconvenient for my mother. Her and my sister will dogpile on me as if I’m this cocky princess who treats them like peasants, even though I really don’t see it as hard as I’ve tried too. I’ve tried to empathize for both of them have not had the the same success socially or with society as me but it gets exhausting being convinced your the bad guy for so long. Im not sure if this behavior has been seen by anyone else or anyone who could identify the root of it all. Please help.",28Dec2020,1
50,"I had a rough time growing up and I've never understood what love was/is..for humans anyways. It was just something you said but it never held and meaning or feeling behind it. I struggle with a relationship with my younger brother, I know we're related, I care for him a lot *but* I feel like he's more of a kid friend than a sibling. I don't know if it's because he didn't really have a childhood either that he acts older than he is (19) or.. what. But I don't feel this unconditional love for him..and I feel terrible for it. 

My feelings for my two close friends feels the same way, deep care but I don't know if that means love or not.

The only thing that I can truly say that I *love* is my cat. He's the only thing that's really been here for  *me* especially after a shit year like this. All I can describe it is joy and it also hurts, I tell him I love him all the time and the words really have meaning behind it. I just hold him, pet him and give him kisses and tell him he's the best and I love him so much. I can't imagine doing that with my brother. 

I feel terrible that I feel that way towards a pet than my own blood. 

My family is broken and I try to fill in the gaps with him for his sake as well as mine but it's such a struggle and I wonder if it's because I can't love humans because the ones that were supposed to never showed me how.",28Dec2020,1
51,"Eary in 2020, I met a guy on a language app, he and I kind of hit it off fairly well. Just to let you know I was not looking for anything it was just a language exchange. So over the time knowing him, early on he professed his love for me and I did not feel the same way as he claimed to have felt for me. So after a while, we would talk back and forth and early on he would say I love you and all of that, and then he kind of guilt trip me into saying I love you back to him. He would tell me about his situation that he was in and how much he needed help but he would not ask for money directly so I felt the need to give him money and that's what happened before. He would come to me with his problems but sometimes he goes a considerable amount of time without any contact and then one day poof he appears and then he's talking about his problems. At some point, I actually felt like I did love him especially when I gave him the money. Around this time I started feeling very sexual and started getting attached to him very strongly. Even though it was all online, I would feel very horny thinking about him and sometimes I would even imagine us having sex and stuff like that. He told me a lot of things and over time they stopped making sense and his stories would be in conflict with one another. They would be like contradictions when you think about it.

Fast forward a little while after when he starts talking to me after not messaging me for a considerable amount of time when I read his message he started talking to me about his problems again and instantly I fell into the trap again and I started feeling immense emotions for him and it would just cloud my judgment. He needed something and then I gave it to him despite his insist I don't give it to him and would refuse multiple times I still did it because I felt very sorry for him. So after that, I remember telling him about my problems f how I felt suicidal, and my mental health problems because of things going on in my life I even told him before how I don't like saying I love you because of my past and how those words affect me but he still insists that he loves me. When I told him about my problems, he would dismiss them and act like it was nothing and would bring up his problems. When I mentioned the stuff I have to go through that are hard for me, he would bring up his problems that are much worse because of the country he is living in (3rd world). So I hope you get where this s going. And then sometimes he would prefer that we don't talk about certain things (like when I would try to tell him how he does not understand my problems sometimes he would advise that for us to stop talking about it). At some point we started talking about his problems again and how much he wants to leave his country. I feel so stupid but he needed like 3 thousand or something like that and when I come to think of it at some point he said it was like 5000 or something but I know it was not the same figure. But anyway, he needed a certain amount of money and I was ready to get it and at this point, I wanted to do almost anything for him. So I went online under another account and asked people for help and all that until someone DM'd me and that person was from the same country as him. So when I told him about the guy, he basically knows his family or knows someone who knows his family and pretty much told me that he was lying. I instantly blocked the guy and stopped talking to him for months until today. And I did not continue with this mission.

Now today I decided to talk to him just to get some closure since I was still pretty upset about the whole situation. It resulted in him explaining himself and he was telling me how he was not lying and all that stuff. He gave me a lot more information and details apparently and I'm starting to think he was not lying. He continued saying his whole I love you spiel and I tried to not get sucked in by the emotions thing. So we were talking back and forth and I don't think I can trust him. When I mention to him that I cannot trust him and how I think it's better we find other people, he tells me that I will be the one to blame for the break-up of our relationship. I felt really guilty about it and did not say anything to confirm whether I'm leaving him or not but I don't know anymore. It's hard for me to trust him when he used to love me so much even knowing how much that affects me. There are still some things that don't make any sense to me. He even confessed his love for me again today and when I brought up everything that he did and how much it has hurt me he started telling me that I'm oppressing him and then saying how much I made him cry and all that.

I don't know what to really do anymore, I don't trust him and this all just seems too fishy. Even when I asked one of my acquaintances/friends about the situation right when I told her about the I love you part she said it's a scam. I don't know what to do anymore. On one hand, the background details he revealed to me today to give some kind of context to the stuff that was a complete contradiction makes sense and on another hand, I don't think I can actually act like it's all okay. I'm fine for giving him so I can get this bitterness out of my heart but I don't think I should pursue anything with him. He tells me that he promises we would see each other in person but that fire I used to have for him has since been extinguished. I don't know everyone. I feel sorry for him and I'm starting to kind of feel some kind of love or infatuation for him but I think this will just hurt me in the end.

On one hand, he claims he was not lying but on the other hand, the person who DM'd me who knows his family claimed he is. I don't know I feel mixed up.

Can someone help with this situation please give me some advice, anything really. I have abandonment issues in the past because my dad left me during my childhood and he would do those pop-up things where sometimes he was there and many times he was not so I tend to get very attached to men very quickly and I guess this is where my lack of judgment in men comes from.

Any advice?

Thank you to everyone in advance.",28Dec2020,1
53,"Long story short. I did dumb things in the past. I made stupid mistakes. I treated people badly. I ruined many good friendships in the past and potential relationships. I really want to change. I don’t want to be like this and I don’t want to keep having this problem. I think the main issue is my anger problem. It’s the biggest thing that drives people away. I’m 25 years old 

I’ve been in therapy and on medication for years. It has helped me a lot but *occasionally* I might get mad at someone. I think my biggest problem is my behaviors (anger) that drives people away. I’m trying my best to fix it and just be a normal person. That’s really all I want. I don’t want to disturb anyone or do anything bad. I really just want to be loved and accepted is all.

54,"This is going to be a lil of a story, but bear with me(Also its 2am so don't expect me to talk without mistakes, sorry in advance).
I have a pretty big problem. I just turned 18, and i have a lot of self related problems to go through. 1 problem i wanna resolve is about my mind. People expect me to be good at something, when i think i completely suck at it. Take this as an example, which is true actually: Ive been playing videogames for over 17 years, yes since i was 1! Videogames are my passion and something i love to do, anytime. In future i'd like to work with them, either programming, testing or anything related tbh. After 17 years of experience, and such willingness to play, you expect someone to be good right? Well, not me. You see, I fucking SUCK. And by that, I mean the most incosistent shit, you could ever imagine. For 4 straight months, my kd hasnt gone higher than 1 whatsoever. I recently changed the mb, ram and cpu which gave a huge performance boost, but that just made it worse! I have tried everything, sensitivity, frames, audio, but nothing. At such an age, my best reaction time, after 17 years of experience, is 200-220 ms, which is slow af, you can take the test by yourself as well at humanbenchmark.com . I was on the verge of tears a couple times already, playing 3 of 4 times in a row, doing 0/8, 0 kills and 8 deaths (in rainbow six). Sometimes, when i try to hold an angle on somebody, and i aim at their head level, they crouch, so that their head is below my crosshair, right? I see them crouching, and i start shooting, although while looking with my eyes that the enemy is crouched, i still keep shooting on the same fucking spot, like my brain shuts itself off or something, without registering what my eyes see. I feel dumb, retarded, autistic and everything in between. Theres also more of a personal issue. Im bad with girls, like, bad very bad. So bad in fact, that at such an age, most people lost their virginity. Guess who didn't? Yeah its yo failure ass homie right here. I dont know, what to do anymore. I dont know if my mindset is wrong, if yes how do i change it? And also, i am hyper nervous, about anything, can you tell me why or what to do perhaps?

My brothers are in relationships and have great relationships with their nephew but neither are really interested in having kids of their own so I really just feel like my son would be alone.

I have never confronted my family about this but I honestly want nothing to do with them or at least I feel as though the love was never unconditional and that I was either a burden or just an investment for their retirement. They sent me off to California to live with my uncle so that I could go to school there even though I had objected they at least promised they would do their best to move there but it never worked and then the year after I begged to move back with them but they refused and cared more about the school I would get in to. I was failing and all my grades were plummeting but they insisted because California=good for future.

My brother is 10 years older than me so I moved out with him when highschool finished and I tried to open up to him about this and he had noticed I was becoming reclusive and my grades were failing. I had told him my feelings and that I suspected I was depressed. He is a licensed psychologist so I had assumed he would understand but he said it wasnt true and that I shouldn't mention this to the family. When I went to visit my parents and returned, I found that all the stuff from my room was moved into a pile in the corner and my brother had a new girlfriend so he wanted the living room free of all my stuff. I quit college and went back to my parents because I felt unwanted.

Fast forward and I have a decent job now and I am financially self reliant. Went to the doctors and they confirmed I had severe depression and anxiety (daily thoughts of suicide, reclusive and inactive). This opened my eyes and now I dont know how to feel about my family because I assumed this was all normal and I just had to grow into it. 

They assume everything is just normal but fair enough because I never confronted them but now they want me to buy a house for them to live in but how can I? Financially of course I can but just for them to live in seems like they are finally able to cash in their check so to speak.

How can I tell them this is not what I want to do and not only that but is it normal that this is expected of me?

68,"I'm a 1st year uni student (in the UK) and I had such a shit first term that I'm now in the state where I spend the entire day lying down in my bed not wanting to do anything. I have to go back in 2 weeks and im absolutely dreading it, not to mention that I have exams then too and I've barely revised.

I'm so close to completely letting myself go because I've never felt this hopeless in my life. I asked so many people at my uni for help and I've appreciated their reassurance that it's normal to feel the way I do but I've not been able to sort myself out regardless. I also don't want to constantly bother them with my problems when they've probably got their own too.

so here's a breakdown of my main issues

- bad sleep schedule: 
oversleeping during the day, sleeping late at night, waking up late in the day and feeling like I've wasted it all so doing nothing anyway. I want to mention though I was oversleeping before my sleep schedule was ruined

- bad eating habits: 
I haven't cooked for myself since I got home and only did it once at uni, I only eat what's easiest to grab and I've been ordering a lot more frequently. I also constantly crave sweets and give in a lot easier to myself

- barely exercising: 
I have always rarely exercised but since I don't go anywhere (like I used to go to school) it's probably a lot more serious

- rarely going outside:
again this has always been a thing, I would only go outside if I had to go somewhere. this stems mostly from social anxiety and worrying about other people looking at me, I just feel uncomfortable in public in general

- too reliant on passing thoughts:
this is a bit of an abstract one so I hope it makes sense but I hope it still makes sense. I could start the day off imagining all the things I want to do then suddenly I get the thought 'i actually can't be bothered to do anything' and I follow it like that. another example is with food, usually people are able to dismiss temptations a little more easily but for me, I kept giving in to my thoughts and now it's become a habit. if I suddenly thought about sweets I wouldn't be able to take my mind off of it, even if I tried to distract myself, I'd just procrastinate until I got the sweets.


theres probably more but I suppose those are the main things. I think my struggles with my uni work are an effect of those problems. 

please don't just tell me 'eat more vegetables, go to the gym' etc that is not the advice I need. I don't want someone to solve all these problems because I know what I need to do (except the last one). what I'm asking for is how I can approach this generally, what kind of system can I use so my life isn't so much of a mess? how do I shift my mindset? hopefully that makes sense.



tl;dr I can't bring myself to do anything e.g exercising or eating well. what should I do to strengthen myself mentally in order to tackle this? may videos around meditation would be useful?",28Dec2020,1

My state has has 1% of the state diagnosed with Covid alone the past two weeks. I made it clear to my sister (who is hosting) I lived with someone  that’s high risk (who also doubles as my landlord) and our mother, who is driving in (and a former smoker of 40+ years) told me she would be left on her own if she got sick but didn’t make that clear to my sister. 

Weeks ago, my sister said “I wouldn’t do anything to put you both at risk”. To do my part I hardcore quarantined two weeks before we all got together. I got pissed off but didn’t say anything when in tandem my sister was sending us pictures from breweries she was going to not long before we all got together.

Since we’ve all gotten together, she’s gone to the gym, had a guest over that frequents the gym and went to the movies right before coming over along with going to the gym herself. Not only this, she just popped having 2+ people over tomorrow that she was out at breweries with. I reached a breaking point at this so I popped and brought up how she said she wouldn’t put us at risk. I offered to go home early and she said not everything is about me and accepted me going home early because I don’t control what goes on in her household. 

I feel like our mother tried to play a balancing act between our two approaches to the pandemic as she just went upstairs and hasn’t come down yet. I feel terrible that she’s upset and I overstepped my place as I’m not hosting, but also as a guest/ family member I feel like I made my intentions clear ahead of coming over even if our mother told me how screwed she’d be if she got sick and didn’t make it clear to my sister.

A few years ago I started high school in a place that is sort of far from my home. I met this girl (lets call her ""C"") from a group of friends who are very close with me. The first time we met, she was timid, shy, and was reserved. The second time we met was the complete opposite. She was very forward and aggressive. She ended up pushing me away from my close friend group and it sucked cause I had to deal with that for a year. I tried to see what was wrong and why I had been excluded and apparently C just did not like me so I had to be booted out. I tried to speak with her about this but I do not know how to properly approach her. I have reconnected with my friend group again but that was only because covid messed up everyone's timetable and I got to meet my friends more often.

I don't know if this is a genuine problem or if I am just a jerk but some advice would be appreciated.",28Dec2020,1
75,"I am a person who suffered to depression from 14 up to this point. 18 years old in my life. I began to start medications from psychiatrist and become more aware in mental health only on 2019. That is where I learned that Depression is a disorder. Started medication in June of 2019 and by the time I turned 18 it was the happiest moments of my life ever again. I am ready to move on with my depressed life.  


However pandemic happened. As an extroverted person it haunts me that I can no longer go to school nor visits my friends. Sadly my medications has limited amount of stock during the pandemic which means that I have to survive for months with the harsh effects of medication withrawal symptoms. I started to hate my self and so on and until just this november, I was able to finally by medications.  


I am so happy that I will grow again. That I will learned again. I might be dependent for the medications for now since it was not meant to be stopped without doctor permission, but I am ready.  
I want to get back to my old self, to the person who was me before I got depressed and misereble. I am ready to be the child that I was once were, my personality and my good traits and what I used to be before I got depressed because of a truma.  


The only problem is I do not know yet where and how to start. Hope that someone was able to help. Any advise will be helpful for me.",28Dec2020,1
76,"Before reading: it can be possible that I’m overthinking this but I’m not too experienced with this so I want to know.

There is this girl (23F) and I (22M) were we started to hang out over the last month and a half. We texted each other, flirting and FaceTime with each other but halfway through she said she didn’t have romantic feelings for me and we should just be friends with benefits.

So we continued to hang out and flirt. Last week we both were busy so we talked less than usual. We FaceTimed once before Christmas Eve where we were flirting before going to bed.

Next day: texted her in the morning around 10 if she wanted to do something together in the evening since I probably won’t be able to do anything until New Year’s Eve. I had proceeded with my day and then the evening I texted her as well as other friends merry Christmas Eve (she hasn’t responded to either).

Recently she took longer to answer because she was busy with Christmas things with her mom, when she texted me she did seem interested in what I was doing.

Part of me is telling me that since my last text was merry Christmas Eve that responding would be weird since it’s no longer Christmas (still Christmas weekend) but I’m disappointed that she just didn’t send me anything over the last days when she usually would a day maximum.

I want to give her some space to hang out with her family and not be needy. But I’m slightly worried that she didn’t respond. I want to text her at some point to check in about her Christmas weekend as well as update her what I have been up to but I can’t tell if that’s the good approach or not.

PS: I made sure that I wasn’t rude to her and that i was positive. In the morning I had sent her connect 4 game (because it was my turn and we usually play together)

78,"This is one of those situations that I’ve been in before, that many others have too, where someone says or does something at or to you or at or to a loved one, and when you express your anger and call them out on it in front of others, like a boss or an authority figure, that authority figure tells you you’re overreacting. Suddenly, because of unsolicited behavior from someone else that feels to you like an attempt to escalate and instigate a situation of conflict that you didn’t start, you are the bad guy for being upset or worried about it. You’re the one whose job is called into question. Meanwhile, you’re unsure if you’re being fucked with, genuinely threatened, you’re wondering how much this person knows about you, whether they know where you live, whether they know what your family members looks like and where they go and what they do.
My partner works with a guy who has drunk the QAnon koolaid and makes no effort to keep it quiet, in fact he broadcasts it at every opportunity. He writes slogans and draws Q’s on company property, he talks to clients about it on company time. And this evening, after not exchanging a text with my partner since early last year, he sends her “WWG1WGA”. No idea why. To fuck with her? Is it a threat? Whatever the intent you cannot argue that it is innocuous in any sense. My partner has been outspoken with the guy about the inappropriateness of putting Q slogans on company property, etc. But getting a random text late at night out of the blue... I feel riled, angry, confrontational. How dare he fuck with my family. And the bosses were sent a screen grab of this exchange and they continually don’t seem to grasp how deeply inappropriate, and how potentially dangerous this is. The worst part is not knowing the intent, or maybe worse than that my partner now feels like she’s done something wrong and might be in trouble at her job.

80,"Lets call the girl: Jane (19,f)

I am 19(m) and never been in a relationship so I need some advice. All started this summer when I started to go out partying. During the first night out I met Jane  from my class, whom  I never really talked to.  During the night as we talked i started catching feelings for her. On the same night we kinda  drank too much and we nearly got back to Jane's place, but our friends told us that we shouldn't really do that  so in the end  we just slept with eachother(Nothing extra happened, like kissing. We just hugged)I never had an experience like that before, so  I started falling for her very qiuckly.
The next night we met again, but this time we went to a club and we made an agreement about staying friends(of coures it was her idea). After this I started going to loads of parties(Not because i loved them, but because I wanted to see her). Now here comes the part that hurts the must. During these nights out Jane kissed at least 3 guys, but I still couldnt forget her, because we regulary walked while holding hands and hugged a lot too.
One night when Jane didn't come I drank too much and told her best friend everything about my fellings towards Jane, beacuse she genuinely seemed curious . Obviously she told everything to Jane. I was nervous about the fact that this would make things weird, but luckily  it didn't. After this the country gets put under a  lockdown so the time of partying is over. 1,5 month passes and we meet again at the house of my friend.Jane came because I invited her(so that means something, isn't it?). We got high. We laughed a lot, but we didn't really talk about serious topics and she avoided eyecontact during the whole night, so nothing really happens. After everyone goes to sleep, I get actually destroyed by my thoughts(I never really felt anything like this before. I  actually felt like my heart has broken into pieces).
After this night I thought a lot about the whole situation and realized I just need to man up and ask her out. Is this a good idea or am I just living in a dreamworld?",28Dec2020,1
81,"I ran into the dad of my ex from high school who I dated for 3 1/2 years today while I was riding my bike. He was walking a dog, so I stopped politely to say hello since I hadn’t seen him in ~5 years. The dog was young and every excited to meet me so I bent down to say hello. I asked “Awh who is this??” And he said “This is Scooter! He’s 5 months old.” 

My dog for 10 years (who passed away in August) was named Scooter. Not only did they share a name, but this dog was also a shi tzu poodle with the same coloring like my dog was. I’d understand if my dog’s name was something like Max or Spot, but Scooter isn’t as common and seems so intentional as a name. I laughed because I thought he was joking that their dog looked just like my dog, but he wasn’t. 

I just can’t believe that this is a coincidence. While his son and I were dating our families were very close, they knew my dog. My ex is also dating a girl who has the same name as me (we even look similar and share several interests). I’ve never been creeped out by him before this, but it’s just too specific to ignore.

Okay little backstory first. My grandparents are pretty wealthy having a nice apartment in Rotterdam and a sort of vacation home near the coast. Every year for christmas they give all six grandkids 50 euros, which we are all grateful for ofcourse. 
 
But this year the gave us way more, 500 euros. I think they did this because covid brought the thought of death all around us, especially for elders. 
 
Here is my dilemma. I am a student who likes to dabble with all kinds of drugs and I but them from dealers. The money my grandparents gave me is nice cash I can use to buy the them. But even though the money is mine to spent it doesn’t feel right to spend it on something my grandparents are against.

At my job, I recently found out that I’m paid the same hourly rate as one of my coworkers. She started working a month after me, therefore having the same level of seniority, so the similar pay would make sense. Except, I also make the schedules and is asked to do extra tasks, such as making signs, etc., and believe I should be paid more for that. I thought I was until I found out this information. I don’t want to sound like i’m comparing myself with other coworkers too much, but I don’t know any other way to go about it.

88,"TL;DR: I promised my parents to finish a programming course during my gap year. Something came up that broke my momentum in studying and it absolutely devastated my motivation to study. Can't seem to focus on getting back to the course. Any tips? 

Hey all, usually I give advice here but this time I'm in need of a few wise words.

So I am currently taking a gap year (got pretty lucky considering with covid I doubt it would have been much fun to be at school). I graduated in a field that I ended up not liking very much at all. So back at the end of summer my parents wanted me to get a full-time job in that field for my gap year. But I really don't want to work full-time in that sector, I swear I couldn't have handled it mentally.

So I came to my parents with a plan, I got a part time job and would deliver the paper in the morning and besides that I would study programming (which is what I intend to actually study at college starting next year) via an official 'self study course'. My parents agreed to it. 

At first I had a really rough time getting into it, but eventually I got a schedule going and really powered through a lot of the course. Eventually something came up, due to which I couldn't study for a week or so. And boom, my motivation and structure was absolutely gone. 

It's been a week or 2 since then and I really struggle to pick it back up again. I feel like I don't remember anything I learned and feel super unmotivated. Despite actually really liking programming. It didn't help that the course itself isn't that good and actually requires me to go out on my own and find stuff on youtube to study, which I found ridiculous considering the amount of money the course costs. 

So that's the long version of it. I can't seem to get back into the groove at all. I can't focus on it for more than 2 minutes. Any tips?",28Dec2020,1

93,"So this story begins in the summer of 2017. I was working with someone that I had feelings for, just a part time job, I was only 20. I also had a female friend that I told everything to. Along the way of me grasping the courage to ask this female I worked with our, I leaned on my female friend and told her what was going on, as I normally would. Well the day came when I was going to ask and my female friend posed a hypothetical that lives in my mind to this day. She claimed to have a “friend” who was in this situation where they had feelings for someone, but that someone had just disclosed to them that they had feelings for someone else and wanted to know if her “friend” should tell the person or not. Well, obviously, that friend was her, and she made the choice to tell me. I was young and dumb and I went with the girl I worked with and ruined the friendship I had. That relationship didn’t last forever, and her being the good friend she was welcomed me back into her life, albeit more carefully than previously. I had moved away and we remained friends. After about 3-4 years, I finally came back home and planned to meet with my old friend. She was as wonderful as ever doing incredible for herself and I saw her in a new light. I wanted to meet because deep down I thought I may have felt something for her, and after that day I knew I was in trouble. I had fallen head over heels for her and that day only further drive that feeling into my heart. But oh, how mother karma loves to play, my friend had been in a relationship for the past year or so, placing me in a similar situation that she was in just a few years prior. To tell her how I feel or not. 

Seeing how happy she was, I made the decision not to tell her. (Here’s where the advice comes)

Do yourself a favor and tell your friend or whoever, no matter the situation, how you feel. 

She took that risk with me, was hurt, and recovered to be better than she was. I took the option of not hurting her or her relationship and not hurting the friendship we have, and it kills me daily. The day I knew I loved her, I can recall every single detail of that day, every single thing we did, and the exact moment that I looked into her eyes and knew I was fucked. I will live the rest of my life wondering what would’ve happened if I had spoken up. I’ll bear that weight on my shoulders of every time I see her or hear her voice, my heart screams inside of me to tell her, but I won’t. 

The moral of the story is, if there’s anybody that is in a similar situation, do yourself a favor and take that risk. It may end beautifully, or it may not. But no matter what happens, you will come out on the other side refreshed and renewed with a clear mind, and it will ultimately be better for your own mental and emotional health, as well as the other party’s.

94,"I’m going to make this brief cause this post could be upwards of 10k words long if I were going into the backstory of everything. 
So my dad recently moved to a different part of the country to his hometown so he could live full time with his girlfriend who also has a daughter who lives there but isn’t with her full time (as she also has split parents). My dad has me to my mum and another two kids (my half brother and sister) to another woman who he was with for many years after my mum. It’s a bit messy but we have always lived in the city and my brother, sister and I live not far from each other. My mum and their mum get along now and we make the effort to see each other. My dad however decided to completely drop everything in the city and move away from us all and now he lives in a little small town with his now 1-2 year girlfriend and the rest of his family. No one favours this decision because he decided to move away from his kids and blames us and our mums for not coming with him even though he knew that couldn’t happen with our lives and homes being in the city. I visit around 2 times a year and sometimes with or without my siblings. Occasionally the girlfriends daughter is also with them too. This time, I decided (since my siblings are quite young), I would plan to go down without them and then maybe the holiday could be fun in a not so childish way. I flew down 2 days ago now and boy do I regret it. I forgot to mention that my dad and his girlfriend just have no filter at all. At least all of the times I’ve stayed with them it’s been with other people so I usually never notice it but staying with them alone is something else. Here’s a few examples of what I mean: 
1. We were in the car going to the supermarket talking about stress and she turns around to me and says “your dad and I just have s*x when we’re stressed”
2. we went to this campground yesterday and we were putting sunscreen on to go to the local beach and she says “me and your dad might stay behind- we could do it in the caravan or the cubicle??” and they both started laughing and my dad adds “the things you can’t unhear.” (why would anyone say that?!! wtf?) 
3. today I went to wash my hair and I came out and noticed they were both in their en-suite shower together and took SO long in the room with the door shut. it’s midday. seriously?!! 

I thought I would just add that I’m a teenager and have such bad paranoia and anxiety with this type of thing that every night for the past 4 years I have had to have rain sounds while I sleep to drown out that idea in any household that I live in. I understand that it would amplify this for me but I’ve been texting my mum and we are both trying to think of a way for me to say I feel really disregarded, uncomfortable and most importantly disrespected. New years is coming up and I still have a week left here and there is no way I am keen on staying any more days. I really want to fly home for the new year now but I’m not due to fly home until Jan 4th. How should I do this? Next time they do something like this my plan is to pack my bags, walk out of the door and walk to their airport or get a taxi and change my flight. 
Any advice on how to deal with this situation? I’ve never felt so uncomfortable and conflicted at the end of such a shitty year. It’s also sad to think this may be the last time I’m ever here but part of me is so glad to be saying that too. 

tl;dr: I’m staying with my ignorant dad and his no filter girlfriend and want to fly home before new years because they have been incredibly inappropriate around me. What should I do??",28Dec2020,1
95,"Hi all,

A bit of background;

I met my partner 12 years ago and she already had a child that was a year old. The father has never been a part of her life for the 13 years she's been alive, no communication, no birthday cards, nothing. Together we have raised her and have gone on to have 2 further children together. I love all of them equally and always treat them the same because, despite not biologically being my daughter, I view her as one.

A few years ago we told her that I wasn't her real dad. Not as bluntly as that though. It became apparent that, either, she'd forgotten or had not been old enough to comprehend the gravity of what we'd told her and everything it meant. 

This year (a few months ago) we sat her down and told her again. I told her that it didn't change anything between us and I still loved her the same as her siblings. Again there wasn't much response from her but I think this time the questions started forming in her mind.

It lead to her questioning her mother about who her father was which in turn led to her reaching out to contact him for more answers. This concerned my partner and I as the guy has never bothered to even ask how she is over the years so we were afraid he would continue along his path of ignorance and we'd have to deal with that fallout. Much to our suprise, he responded.

I'll admit, it has shocked me. Our daughter is happy about it all and is messaging him constantly. That I'm all fine with and I know that's what she needs. I'm not for one second going to assume she'll ask him the real hard hitting questions yet though.

What I'm not fine with is l, well, I don't really know what it is. I don't know if what I feel is even important, if it's normal or not? I know my partner is not handling it too well as she has her own feelings regarding him but she is willing to just let it be and let what is happening happen. I on the other hand, I'm struggling.

I absolutely cannot fathom how someone can abandon a child. To act like they don't exist for 13 years and then just waltz into her life like he's a saint. It's her birthday next month and he's bought her a digital camera...I'll be honest, it's pissed me off as that's what we wanted to get her.

My partner and I spoke about him getting her one but agreed we'd get it for her but then, today, she told him it was okay to buy it for her without asking me and going against what we'd spoken about not 2 nights ago.

I've tried talking to my partner but she's telling me to suck it up and put it all in a box. I don't know if that's helpful personally.

I don't know if how I feel is normal. I guess it's a combination of things, fear, jealousy, anger...the usual. I am afraid that I will lose her, that I mean less now but at the same time I'm angry that he hasn't even bothered with her and seems to have avoided answering any serious questions about why. I also think that I am jealous. I've always loved buying my kids presents, so for him to swan in and get her what she really wanted for her a birthday feels like an absolute gut punch.

I don't know if my partner is right and I just have to suck it up yet, at the same time, I'm not great at swallowing my feelings.

So here I am, asking for advice in the hopes that I can make some sense of what the hell is going on!

If I'm being an idiot then also please tell me, I know this isn't all about me and our daughter is the most important part of this story but that's exactly why I need to try to make sense of what I'm feeling so I can deal with it and be more supportive to her in this.

Thanks in advance and thank you for reading all of that.

TL:DR: Helped raise partners daughter since she was a year old. Bio Dad never involved, no contact at all, ever. Partner and I told her this year, she contacted him, he contacted her.

98,About a year and a half ago my mom took a friend of hers in as a caretaker due to an accident that happened to him. After about 6 months he was ready enough to be able to work again and started paying my mom rent so he could help around the house. He has a history of drug abuse but until what we've found out recently he has been clean. I don't live with my mother anymore so it's just her and him. I'm not sure what's happened recently since he seemed like such a good roommate even looking out for my mom  up until now but he goes out and sees people he knows has been exposed to covid and doesn't wear masks. He says he must be immune to it and recently some of the others in their social group say he's been using drugs again. He's been bringing homeless people home with him to stay in his room against my mom's wishes and they have been causing issues with neighbors who have called the police on them. They've been stealing things from my mom and trashing her place and when she confronts him about it nothing ever changes.

I want to help her but like I said I don't live there anymore.,28Dec2020,1
99,"I made a very big mistake, and am unsure what to do from here, emotionally and practically. I've never been a manipulative person, because whenever I inflict negative emotions on people the guilt is too much to bear. I can't recall in my life ever doing something like this...because it went against my morals too much, but here I am. I started talking to a girl, a little over a week ago who I connected with on a very very deep level. It was a sort of compatibility that is rare and precious, and within a couple days I told her how I felt and we decided to be boos. She didn't really like the word girlfriend, because it was a long distance relationship, but I think it's safe to say that we are together. About a week before I met this girl who we'll call E, I had been talking to another girl who we'll call L. L had a very similar sense of humor to me, and the nature of our conversations was somewhat flirtatious. I had told her when I met E that I wasn't interested in a relationship...but against my best judgement I decided to continue talking to her, and being flirtatious. Every time I would do this, I felt something very bad emotionally, a feeling that I was doing both her and my boo wrong. That I was being a manipulator. I couldn't shake off this feeling, and I on multiple occasions set boundaries with her because I didn't want this to continue. But it felt like my monkey brain was in control, because I was putting my relationship in danger just because it felt good to get romantic attention from a girl. After about a week of dating E I found myself being VERY flirtatious with L, and so I told her that I had a boo. She apologized, and we were mostly just friendly for the next bit of time. Then I lost control again, and starting being quite flirtatious again. I felt that by doing this I was leading her on, and playing with her feelings. It kept coming to my mind throughout the day, I hated what i was doing to both of them, but for some stupid reason I continued being flirty. This is not really a justification, because theres no excuse for what I did...but I am 16 so this sort of emotionally unintellegent way of acting might be related to that. Today we were flirting more, and she asked how my mind was today? I told her that it was overall good, but that I was feeling very conflicted about something. I told her that I felt that by flirting with her I was being unloyal to my boo, and that I hated the thought of being unfaithful. She said, ""wait, you're in a relationship?"". Apparently when I told her that I had a boo, she didn't really process that as meaning a relationship, so this very much caught her off guard. I told her that we had only been together for about a week, and she told me that it was okay but that she was gonna block me. Then on her story she posted ""there's nothing that I hate more than liars"" she expressed to me that she really hates having her emotions played with, and I absolutely see the way in which I played with her feelings. I feel like a despicable person, because as I said I had never understood why people would be unloyal to their partner. I apologized profusely, and then we blocked eachother. I'm glad that this is over, but I feel like I have to tell my boo what happened. I know that I could keep it to myself, and have things be easier...but it feels wrong to keep this from her. Because I've never been in this situation before, I need some advice from someone who has more life experience. Is it important that I tell her what happened? For a bit I thought I should just break up with her, because I had done her wrong this early on, but I'd rather not have things play out that way.",28Dec2020,1
100,"So I(M17) have been in a relationship for almost a year now. Needless to say I really like my partner(F16), like really really like her, I'd go as far as to say I love her but maybe I'm too young to fully understand that yet . Anyways, I wanna tell my dad so that things can be easier between us but I don't know how. My dad's really religious and old-fashioned (might need to add Indian too) so he's always on about sorting a girl for me, arranged marriage and stuff. Now in my household dads the boss(no mum, passed away 2 years ago) so anything he says goes no questions or objections so I'm terrified of telling him about anything that makes me happy incase he doesn't approve. It sounds kinda dumb but I'm really just talking about the trivial things videogames, certain genre of books, other stuff that interest me. I have mentioned the idea of me being in a relationship and that too with someone of a different religion(she is) and he's completely shut down the idea, bluntly said no and now I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with her.",28Dec2020,1
101,"This year I have experienced the loss of every friendship I had been relying on for companionship, reprieve from my toxic household, and connection. My best friend of 10+ years ended our friendship in October over a fight about making plans that I had nothing to do with. This drama happened so many times this year that I no longer feel like I am able to fix the relationship. My other two girl friends ghosted me after I followed one of their boyfriends on instagram (and they attacked me for it and cut me off). My only guy friend (my coworker) blocked me on all social media accounts on my 21st birthday, which was very painful for me. I had recently rejected him romantically but I had invested years into our friendship. I think he chose to cut me off on my birthday to hurt me on purpose, and that felt even worse because I would never do anything like that to him. A guy I was seeing told me ""I can't make you happy I would only hurt you"" after going on dates for a few months. And lastly, a girl I had met through work a few years back with whom I used to hangout with weekly slowly faded me this fall, until I never heard from her again. Clearly, the common denominator is me, and I desperately want to find out what I am doing wrong and where I've gone wrong. I know my depression has impacted a lot, but I've made concerted efforts not to burden my friendships with my depression and always focused on being in a positive mindset around others. I thought I was turning a new leaf connection wise this year, but I have lost everyone I ever cared about outside of my family. I am truly at a loss of how to make new friends / connections now that I have been rejected so many times. I feel like a shell of myself in the wake of these losses, and on top of more losses I have had to recover from within the past 2 years (ex boyfriend moving on, realizing I have never had an emotionally available mother, etc).

I feel like I never have anything funny to say, I am too bland as a person inside and out and not in tune to cultural norms. My interests are simple, my life is simple and I don’t do anything out of the ordinary, noteworthy, or particularly fun. I feel like my friendships have always reflected this about me, I clung on to superficial relationships and I have no close connections. I feel like every time I get close with people they realize how boring/awkward/bland/not fun I am and don’t find me worth keeping around, or they use me for my belongings, energy, or advice with no reciprocation from their end. That has been my experience for as long as I can remember. I feel like I have been rejected by life, by everyone I have ever felt connected with- even my own family. It is one thing to have no friends or significant other and be able to come home to loving parents or lean into your connections with your siblings, but I don’t even have that. I feel so empty and void of connection that I am worried I will not even be able to maintain a healthy long term relationship because I never felt this or saw it emulated as a child. I have toxic family enmeshment, no deep connection to my family, and nobody my age (in college) to reach out to or even grab a coffee with. I was never the most popular kid in school and often felt lonely but nothing I have ever experienced has compared to the last 2 years I have felt with isolation, lack of peer connections, and detachment from life. i was living this loneliness pandemic before the pandemic began. I have begun attending therapy again and my therapist is very nice but I feel like I can’t identify the root of what’s happened to me and what I am doing wrong even in therapy. My question is, how do I make new friends when everything in the world is on pause? Where can I go to put myself in the position of connecting with likeminded people? For reference, I am a 21 year old college student and I am very academically driven and passionate about many things, but I'm not super talented in anything. I've always felt older than my cohort and it's feeling even more so now. I am terribly lonely, but I have gotten used to being with myself. Looking for any advice, even words that may be hard to hear, to help get out of this rut.

Any response is much appreciated.",28Dec2020,1
102,"I am 19 years old and a sophomore in college, but I have absolutely no idea about what my future holds after undergrad. And that scares the shit out of me.

I am a public policy/administration major and history minor. I was a political science major, but so many people told me that was a ""dead end"" major, so I ended up switching to PPA. I am very passionate about politics/law, but getting into the political sphere is practically impossible without strong connections (which I don't have), so I gave up my dream of being a politician quite a while ago. I considered going to law school, but that is very expensive and I don't have the money (or time) to do that.

My sister is a senior in college. Ever since she was a little girl, she knew she wanted to be a nurse, and has had a career path her entire life. She has a well-paying job lined up for her after graduation. I would never admit it (sister rivalry, of course), but that is the one thing I have always felt incredibly envious of her for. She has known her ""purpose"" since she was 13. I simply can't say the same. 

I enjoy my major, and I do well enough in school. I have a 3.7 cumulative GPA (I've completed 3 semesters so far). I am not a dumb person. But rather, I am just incredibly lost. Is this a quarter life crisis? lol. 

Whenever friends/family ask me about my post-college plans, I begin to panic and quickly change the subject. I honestly just can not picture my future at all. I do not have a dream job. My major is not a beeline to a certain job (the way teaching, nursing, or business would be), but I do enjoy it.

Did anyone else feel this way at 19? I shouldn't feel like a failure with no future before it has even started, but I do.",28Dec2020,1

106,"Please don't skip past this

I am a 15f. My father has been my biggest cause of all my hurt in my life. He used to beat me when I was younger, but it stopped when I was 9 because the police got involved. When I was 12, he started to tell me vicious things. He would tell me that I was worthless, to straight-up kill myself, that he hated me to death, that he wished I were dead, not to call him my father and he will not call me his daughter, that I am a burden to him, that I am the failure out of all my 5 sisters. Just overall things that would absolutely crush a growing teen's spirit. I wrote numerous suicide notes because he really did convince me that I did not deserve to live and I had even attempted once. I felt bad for him because I thought that I made his life a living hell, so I had to make it fair and give up mine. 

I did not realize that all of these sayings were destroying me below the surface. I got no love from my father, and I instead looked for guys at my school to fill the gaps caused by feeling so unlovable. I went on to engage in sexual activities with them so I could feel like I was worth something and so that I could get some attention. This always ended up with me getting even more hurt. I lost lots of friends due to people thinking that I was an evil slut that only wanted to use and play boys when I really just wanted to feel loved. 

I expressed all my feelings towards my father to my mother and she always dismissed me by telling me that he loves and cares about me. She told me that because he buys me everything I want and gets worried about me when I am not home, there is no possible way he could hate me. She told me to record whenever he was saying hurtful things and show her. I believe that is just because they want to get a divorce and she needs evidence against why he is an abusive father. Anyway, after 3 years of complaining about him to her, she told my father how I felt about him. 

We had a talk on Christmas about everything he did. He told me that he didn't mean any of it, that he forgot about it, that he cared about and loved me, and that he was sorry for everything. This is all I have wanted to hear for so long, but I don't feel the liberation that I thought I would feel. I have been so used to the world of believing that my father will hate me forever, and because I lived like this for so long, it just doesn't feel true.

I need help on how to accept that my father does not hate me and how to truly heal from all the toxic beliefs he made me believe about myself (being unlovable, thinking that I need to kill myself).",28Dec2020,1
108,"I am 28F. This past summer I met the best man I have ever met and I love him so so much. Let’s just call him Jake. He’s a great fit for me and I’m confident we will be married eventually. He loves me like crazy and treats me like a goddess and I am very good to him too. There is nothing I feel is “missing” from this relationship. 

Two years ago, when I was single I had a very brief romantic relationship with a different man we will call Frank. That relationship was a very emotional experience for me. I had never had an experience before like I had with Frank and it left me extremely heartbroken. 

I let enough time pass and I also had another boyfriend in between Frank and Jake. I don’t feel “in love” with Frank anymore but it bothers me that I am still thinking about him. I sometimes still feel sad about it. I have little memories/flashbacks in my mind about the time we spent together and I miss him. That makes me feel guilty because I truly love my boyfriend Jake and he is so much better than Frank.  Frank wasn’t even always kind to me or honest. Why won’t my brain seem to let him go/move past him when I feel like I have?

It feels silly that this memory is even pestering me. I’m not just saying that Jake is better than Frank either just to say it. Like he’s truly nicer, younger, better looking, funnier, less selfish. So what the hell? Why would I even be thinking about Frank whatsoever?",28Dec2020,1

112," 

On 02/11/20 I started working in my dream job for a two week trial. At the end of the two weeks I got the job and started the process of signing off of Universal Credit. On 25/11/20 I got told that I was still on trial as the DWP will not allow me to sign off as my start date has not been approved in terms of The Scottish Kickstart Scheme for the 16 to 24 demographic. I have been working 40 hour weeks since the second of November with nothing more than my Universal Credit payments as compensation.

As of today 23/12/20 I still have no legal start date nor am I allowed to sign off of UC or be paid by my employers without them getting charged for tax fraud despite working full time hours for 7 weeks. I was promised a start date this month but found out this morning that I will not be given one until at least January 5th.

I am fortunate that my employers are willing to keep me on until this is resolved whereas I know plenty of other employers would not. I find it shocking that this scheme that is supposed to help people in my demographic find employment is essentially making it harder for us to find a job or expecting us to work for free until the paperwork is processed. Especially now with COVID19 making jobs more scarce. I unlike others am fortunate that I live with my parents with no kids or expensive bills and live rent free but I dread to think how many others could be made homeless or are starving over Christmas because of this sheer incompetence of the DWP.",28Dec2020,1

122,"Last year around this time me and my buddies threw a big new years party at our frat house. There was almost 150 guests. Friends from high school, friends since I knew when I was little, cousins, etc. Chicks tits were bouncing everywhere, NSYNC's christmas album was blasting, the vibes were good.

Earlier on in the day I jokingly told my friend Jake that there's no way he doesn't end up blacked out by midnight. This guy was a big alcoholic. (Still probably is, haven't seen him since the beginning of this year. I'm sure quarantine only made things worse tbh.) Anyway, he immediately responded with ""no way"" and so we made an extreme bet that whoever wins gets to hook up with the other's girlfriend. We were not in the best mindset in the first place since we were drinking the night before too and we were a little hungover.

It was around 11:25 ish and Jake hadn't taken a single sip of alcohol. I wasn't with him 24/7 but I didn't smell any alcohol on him and he looked perfectly sober to me. This was kind of blowing my mind because I was sure he wasn't gonna last past 9 PM. I realized I made a big mistake and panicked. The main reason is because of my girlfriend. I didn't want him banging her because word spreads around quickly on college campuses and I've heard nothing but good things about his penis size. I don't have that great of a penis so I didn't want her to hook up with him because I would be self conscious for a long time. I was semi-drunk at that point so again I wasn't thinking right and poured a whole bottle of Jack Daniels Honey Whiskey into the punch bowl. These bowls are pretty big so nobody really noticed since the whiskey was sweet anyway. I told Jake to have some punch then I walked away quickly. I didn't want to be staring him down while he takes a sip so he doesn't get suspicious.

As I was walking away I prayed to God he didn't sense anything in the punch bowl. Sure enough, about 15 minutes later he was piss drunk. It was unbelievable. I thought this was too good to be true and he was just mocking me by pretending to be drunk. But that f\*cker was WASTED.

I ended up hooking up with his girlfriend as part of our deal. My girlfriend never found out since she was back home with her family for the holidays. But man, I just had to get this off my chest somewhere.

124,"Hey guys. I'm going through a situation where I gave advice to a younger relative , and I really just need confirmation that I said and did the right thing.

I had a female relative who is visiting family overseas tell me that our mutual male cousin who is her age has been **(NOT sexually) touching her, pinching her, grabbing her arm, pinning her down, and saying it's all in the name of fun and being roughhousey.** They are both in a different country than me so I can't be there to help in person nor am I very good at speaking the language that my male cousin speaks in a way that would allow me to confront him myself. 

Anyways, she tells him to stop and he never does. He thinks it's ""funny"" and ""not a big deal"". **She also told me that he has asked her questions that are extremely inappropriate and can be interpreted as sexual and lewd**. Please ignore the fact that I am talking about two cousins here, I know it's gross to be discussing this in this context. I was completely disturbed and disgusted by what she said and even terrified that she started blaming herself for allowing it to continue. In my opinion this is assault.  She's scared to bring it up to anyone because she thinks our family will look at her sideways. I told her they wouldn't, and that HE is completely in the wrong and that she needs to cut all ties with him and tell him that if he ever touches her without her consent that she would tell her father , which would be terrifying to hear since it's her mother that is the male cousin's aunt. The possibility of her father finding out would be enough to make him stop in my opinion.  I told her to never stay in a room with him alone and to not blame herself or allow him to rationalize what is clearly wrong and making her unconformable. 

The reason I feel like I have messed up is because everything in me wants to tell her parents what she told me, but she begged me not to tell anyone. I don't want to become someone that she is scared to open up to because she thinks I will tell people. I told her that if it ever gets to a point where he touches her sexually or says something so extremely inappropriate that I in good conscience can't not tell someone.

127,"About two months ago, my boyfriend told me he wanted me to initiate sex more. I agreed. I did some research and came up with some creative ways to do so: 
- Telling him to “fuck me”
- Cuddling and sneaking my hands down his pants 
- Randomly grabbing his crotch with a wink and a smirk 
- Random Dirty Talk 
- Surprise Nudes 
- New Lingerie that I would jump on him with 
- Wearing his favourite sexy knee-high anime socks and short plaid skirt and teasing the hell out of him (usually ends up with me riding him) 
- Planned a hotel night where we could go wild
- Purchased sex toys for us and surprised him with it 

(Note that if these actions are in person, a consent phrase is always spoken to solidify the intent of sex)

And that’s essentially what I’ve been doing these two months. 

Now just today, I pulled the socks and skirt combo (with a new skirt he got me for Christmas!!!), danced a little, made out with him, said the consent phrase, and rode the hell out of him. A while after we got cleaned up, he makes a comment of “and I initiated once again”. I look at him dumbfounded and held myself back in order to think of what I was going to say. 

After a couple of hours, I bring the topic back up again. He avoided responding to his comment, and so I asked him “how would you like me to initiate?” 
He replied with “just do anything”. When I asked him to elaborate, he kept repeating “just do anything”. I asked what he thought about the long sock and skirts and he replied with “oh that’s just to tease me”. I tried to continue to conversation, but he shut it down. 

At this point, I’m a little lost as to what he wants from me. I believe I’ve done a decent job at initiating sex (and the thought of it), both in person and online. 
Hell, I’ve changed my workout routine in order to build muscle in certain areas that he finds attractive. 

What makes this frustrating is that there is no clear communication from him, due to reasons I don’t understand. I’ve learned from previous experiences that when asking questions to your boyfriend that it should never be “interrogative”, but more “curious”, and I think I’ve followed that style of questioning. 

Is there a certain insecurity that I’m missing? Have any of you gone through anything similar and maybe have more insight on the situation? Please let me know! 

Thanks guys!",28Dec2020,1
128,"Beforehand: I don't have much experience on this site, but I am hoping to find advice here.

I know it may be rather imposing but I do need some words of advice. I will explain the situation as best as I can, and will happily accept anything people have to say to me. 

So to put the long story short, I'm getting kicked out of my home in approximately six months. If I don't get kicked out, then I'm willingly leaving. The epicenter for both situations is my father. He owns a store along with my mother and works 14 hour days except for Sunday, which he comes home early. That being said, I am grateful for the effort he put into providing a good lifestyle for me, my mother, and my brother. However, that is about all the credit I can give to him. 

To give a little backstory, he comes from a traditional Korean family. He has two brothers, his mother, and a late father who passed away when he was at an early age. Though I don't know how close he is to his other family members, I know that in his bloodline he has some sort of mental problem making it easy for him to become angry. I believe that it has passed down to me as well since it seems to be present everywhere in my father's side of the family. 

I am forever grateful for my mother who has raised my brother and me in a caring enough environment where my temper is able to be controlled everywhere except for when I am in a conversation with my father, which will be explained later on. My father however relies on medication to help calm his anger, even though he actively makes sure the medication doesn't do what it's meant to do. The medication clearly states to not take with alcohol, yet my mother has told me countless times how he ignores it and continues to do so. I could go on and on about how he verbally abuses everyone in the family, though that really isn't what this post is about. After countless days spent crying and even waking up one night to find him beating me, it took me almost eighteen years of my life to realize that I hate him. 

I know there are going to be people who tell me that I'm right, wrong, or simply need to give him a second chance. I respect your opinion, but please know that you don't know what I've been through. I will admit that some situations were escalated because of my inability to hold my temper, but most of the time, it was his doing alone. 

Today, two days after Christmas, I had a 'talk' with my father. By talk, I mean it was me trying to explain to him how he wouldn't take the time to understand what I was trying to say, and him spouting random nonsense about life in Korea and Korean tradition. Knowing that we live in America in an area where I don't know any other Korean families, I'm not sure what he was trying to say. Regardless, the conversation took the same course it always has. Me trying to talk to deaf ears, being forced to listen to a drunk mouth talking out of its ass, and then me losing my temper. Usually, it stopped there, where I would storm off to my room and stay up until the early morning drowning in tears of frustration. However this time, the conversation ended with him simply saying to get out once I turned 18. While the idea of being kicked out would have terrified me as recently as a year ago, I was expecting to be told that now. Even so, I don't really know what to do when I do leave the house. 

When it comes to college, I'm debating on whether or not I should even go. I don't have a professional career in mind other than writing, so I'm wondering if spending hundreds of thousands for a degree would be worth it when I can simply write to my heart's content outside of school. Though I'm unsure of my family's financial situation, I can safely say that we aren't making enough for money to be spent carelessly. 

For those wanting to say to wait it out and see if he changes his mind about kicking you out, please do note that I am planning to leave if I'm not removed. The house I've lived in for all my life has become a source of my depression, anxiety, and fear. The room I've barricaded myself in will surely become my tomb if I don't leave as soon as I can. No matter how grateful I am for the lifestyle I've been given, I would have happily given away all of my materialistic possessions to live a life where I didn't have to be put in this kind of situation. 

Though I won't disclose my exact location, I would like advice on what to do and will list possible attributes about my life that could open up some opportunities. I'm currently 17 years old and fully Korean. I live on the east coast of the United States, in a fairly populated area that could be described as semi-urban. I have fairly good grades that have never dropped below 3.00 on the GPA scale. I've been a Boy Scout ever since middle school and a Cub Scout before that. I've written (and currently am still writing) novels, and even self-published on Amazon. Interacting and working with others has never been a problem, and I can complete work and tasks in a fairly efficient time and manner. I've had no history of drinking, smoking, or drugs. Though it's my opinion, after seeing what drugs do to others and knowing that my father drinks, I've decided to abstain from all of them entirely. 

My only plan right now is to try and land a job, stay at a friend's place for a brief period of time (as I don't want to be a burden on them), and find some sense of stability. Though I'd like to consider myself fairly independent, having to provide for myself isn't my forte, unfortunately. I know this post is rather scrambled, but so is my mind. I've taken a couple of hours to calm down, but I'm still quite scrambled when it comes to the reality of the situation. Even so, the day I do have to leave the house will come eventually, and I do want to be prepared. 

To recap the mess of a post I had just typed, basically, I'm being kicked out of my home by my abusive stonewaller of a father, because we can't see eye to eye no matter how hard I try to explain things to him. He uses the excuse of not being able to understand because English isn't his first language, but even an idiot can understand that no normal person takes out their anger on their family then wonders why that anger is being directed back towards them. My stance is biased, but I try to show as much of the truth as I can without showing too much. 

I'm currently looking around with the time I have left to try and find opportunities so that I can provide for myself when I leave the house. I don't have a car, a job, and almost none of the things I own right now were bought with my own money. In reality, I'm basically a nobody and I understand that. I know that I probably won't ever be able to have a lifestyle like the one I have now, where I can happily play games with my friends or write stories, without having to worry about bills, rent, or taxes. Even so, I do want to live. I want to be able to experience a life where I don't have to stay up every night until my father gets home from work, just to make sure he doesn't barge into my room to hit me. I want to be able to experience a life where I won't be ridiculed for enjoying things I believe every child or teenager should be able to enjoy. 

For those who might be in a similar situation, please note that revenge won't work out. I had contemplated the idea of beating him up with every ounce of anger I had built up inside me. I really was going to, but I had stumbled across a loosely translated quote from a comedian whose name I never knew. It went something like, ""Don't stand close to those you hate, as when lightning strikes them, you don't want to be anywhere close."" 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",28Dec2020,1

131,"I have been dating my girlfriend for nearly 8 months and I really enjoy her personality and genuinely value our friendship and relationship as a romantic couple.  Previously I have taken my virginity very seriously, and wanted to give it to someone who I felt gave me what I wanted from a relationship and friendship.  This past summer I chose to have sex with her and share that experience with her.  Before we had sex she had told me about her previous sexual partners, one who she had dated and had intercourse with and two others who she questionably gave oral sex to after a couple days of knowing them.  I formed a very small anxiety about her past choices, but it really never bothered me to a large extent.  Recently, after months of maintaining a healthy relationship, and a steady sexual relationship she had told me she had given oral sex in the past (before we met each other) to two more people, again only within one day of being around them.  After learning about this, I started to form strong  feelings about her previous choices and experiences, and began to experience retroactive jealously.  I brought it up to her a couple of times and we had very healthy discussions about these feelings, but they only gave me temporary relief.  I have found what makes me the most uncomfortable was that I had taken my virginity so seriously, and I chose to give it to someone who had been so reckless with it, and had not seen it as something that came with love.  She says it was because she needed attention and that she has learned that her choices were wrong, but I still feel strong anxieties about this information about my girlfriend.  Keep in mind we are both very young. What do I do next, what could help me overcome these emotions? I do not feel that these anxieties should end our relationship, because I think our friendship/relationship is worth more than that.",28Dec2020,1
132,"I have a somewhat friend who is a psychopath and he did some horrible stuff. He was narcissistic, manipulative and also suffered from multiple personality disorder. He was a different person completely every time he met someone. However he finds it satisfying to see others suffer however he did not like it in the physical way. He is 6”2 and stocky but never puts up a fight yet everybody who knows him is terrified of him as he is constantly monitoring everything they do irl or online to try and ruin them. He is very intelligent and gets very good grades but is about average in terms of looks with a round face and always styles blonde hair with glasses. He is constantly manipulative and has dedicated days and weeks of his time just for a payoff.

One of the worst cases was with a new girl we both knew. Us 3 and a few others were all very good friends and even though he had done horrible shit in the past he somehow was still our friend, however everyone almost despised his presence. Anyway, this girl was super kind and generous and had a great sense of humour and we had knew each other for about 9 months. Overtime we began growing closer and I began having feelings for her but my friend had feeling for her in a different way. He never hit anyone ever and would always abuse them mentally, constantly knocking self esteem, being self aware in order to hide his flaws while exposing others and bragging his superior intelligence and wealth to others to make them feel worthless was stuff he did daily to strangers for “cheap thrills” in his words. However this was different. 

Overtime he was acting more normal (in comparison to him) and respectful, taking other’s emotions into consideration and being kind. When we confronted him about this he said that he wanted to redeem himself and was seeing a therapist in order to help him and this is what her first piece of advice was. We believed him and were accepting of him and proud that he was owning up to mistakes and being a more considerate person. He kept this up for 3 months and eventually me, him and the girl I liked grew closer. We met and talked about problems we have been having. Apparently she was psychologically abused by her father and mother and she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression then later actually started having nervous tics similar to those in Tourette’s. 

I was supporting and tried to help her however I couldn’t relate as my upbringing was good and my family were close but she made my friend open up and tell about his family and how he had anger issues which were compressed under strict rules in his family which then led to him developing multi personality disorder. He comforted her and supported her better than I ever could. 

Overtime she began confessing secrets about her life to us as a way to vent and both of us acted supportive. However she told us one time that she and her brother have been having suicidal thoughts and that she has been feeling scared and alone as well as the fact that recently she had relapsed into her depression when her therapist said she had been improving. This was a very sad thing to hear and I tried to comfort her and make her feel better overtime. She told us about how her dad is always drunk, yells and breaks her stuff all the time and when she was younger she tried to run away.

After this my friend began to change. He would stop hanging out with us and over the next week so the girl would too. It wasn’t because of them hooking up or anything but quite the opposite. He had taken all her information of what she had said including screen shotted dms and recordings of phone calls and sent them to her relatives. Her parents, grandparents, friends and more all knew about what she wanted to keep private and work out in private. Some were supportive however her family were critical of her and she had a mental break down which lasted about 2 weeks. She cut all contact with my friend and kept limited contact with me except for simple response dms such as;
“Are you ok?”
“Yes”
Which were obviously lies

She apparently attempted suicide which caused her parents to move out of the UK and go to the US where she is originally from. She then kept limited contact with me and would never instigate messages with me but only responded whereas before we would keep active and make jokes all the time. She would never call and now has trust issues. He kept this act up for 6 months only to take her down and I lost a friendship and potential relationship because of that monster.

Recently he has gone insane. During a lecture he cut open the back of his hand because he found it funny and forced somebody to lick his blood as well as he began scratching the skin on the side of his face until it started bleeding leaving permanent scaring and showing it to people just to disgust them. He would bully people based on their status, ethnicity, backgrounds and disabilities both physical and mental as jokes but people can tell he is slowly bending before he snaps. Nobody comes or wants to help him however and his parents are unintentionally ignorant to this as his personality portrayed to his mother and father is a charismatic charming smart boy unknowing about his darker side. People despise him and the few who have remained friends with him are leaving him as he ruins more and more peoples lives overtime (including his friends). Another friend gained depression from his abuse yet that friends mother doesn’t believe her son as he has given her the impression that he is caring, polite and considerate. 

He loves being hated and despises being liked by friends or family but sees people as pawns for his own benefit, but I think he is going to do something bad to himself or others and everyone has abandoned him. Do you think I should help him or allow him to slowly self destruct as a punishment not only for the girl but for me as well? I usually always help but this person has ruined multiple lives for what he finds pleasure so I need desperate advice on this one. Thank you.",28Dec2020,1
134,So last year I made the decision that I would never get married and be in a relationship because it just doesn’t fit the way I want to live life. However the more I think about it do I really not want to be in a relationship because of the lifestyle I chose or is it just that I’m bitter because I’ve never been in one because of my low self esteem and self hatred.

136,"We're both 17, I live with my parents and so does (did?) She. 

I'll refer to her mum as ""M"" and my girlfriend as ""S"". Her dad isn't in the picture.

M is an alcoholic. She has emotionally abused S for her whole life, and has another child (now grown up and lives another part of the country) who was taken off her by social services. When I say emotionally abused, I mean yelling at her over minor things, forced her to do the house cleaning (granted, she is a single parent but she relies on S way too much, and doesn't react well when she doesn't do the cleaning). She gets drunk and yells at S for things that aren't her fault. 
The texts I've seen M send to S are shocking, r/insaneparents worthy. 
She's been ""kicked out"" before (not properly) but this time S wants to get out and have any kind of stability elsewhere. S is staying at mine after an argument on Christmas day when they were vising some of m's friends. We picked S up on Christmas night and she's been here since. She self harmed because M yelled at her that bad, S thought it was her fault because that's what M tried to make her think. After my family helped talked to S about it she realised that it wasn't her fault and M is being extremely unreasonable. 
My parents are going to phone social services as soon as they're open to get advice, and get S' things, instead of going to their house and have to deal with M, we'll have someone from social services to help. My parents could get legal guardianship of S, if it means she can move out and stay with us, somewhere safe for her, which is a nice change of pace.
My parents have spoken to S' granny and she is very willing to support S, and If she needs to, take her in. However her whole life is here, and shes starting a new 2 year college course after we finish our current college, so that would mess things up as her granny lives far away.

There are countless other things that have happened that I can't remember now, it's almost 3am and I can't sleep, if I remember anything else that's important I can update the post.

137,"I (20F) have been in college for about 2 years now. My major currently is sonography. I was my high school's valedictorian (it's not as impressive as it sounds, I went to a small private school with only 15 people in my graduating class), so I thought even though college would be hard, I could push through it.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I never wanted to go into the medical field to begin with. My best subject is English and basically anything like it (Literature, Speech, Philosophy, you name it), so I had hoped to find something sustainable I could do with that. But once I got that big ""valedictorian"" stamp on me, there was a lot of pressure that came with it. My parents insisted ""You're smart, you can handle it,"" when they pressured me into medical school.

&amp;#x200B;

I caved into it, and now, I'm doing horrifically. My first year, I failed both Anatomy &amp; Physiology and Algebra, while (big shock) I was best in class in my English Comp class. I ended up retaking both classes (I passed), and I was able to barely keep my head above water with my other classes involving any kind of medical subject and/or math. That is, until this past semester, when I took Pathophysiology. I ended up with a D in that class, and for the field I'm studying for, I need at least a C. But my parents have outright said for every course I repeat, I have to pay them back.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all the above, I've been absolutely miserable for the last two years. I get so anxious whenever there is a test I outright vomit out of fear. Even when I think I can do it, when I'm in the middle of a test, the only thing I can think of is how disappointed my parents must be, how I'm not living up to my Valedictorian status, how I'm not cut out for this. My gift in English, which I was extremely proud of in high school, has now become something I despise. I've lost track of how many times I've pleaded for me to suddenly be horrible at it, if it'll mean I can suddenly be amazing at my other courses. I've gone from relatively thick-skinned to prone to sobbing at the slightest things. I hate with this has done to me. I don't really see an out because I've already put in two years here, but I know I'll just be miserable if I stay.

138,"~~i'm sorry i can't be specific because i'm scared my parents will find this..~~

hi! so my married lesbian parents have broken up (not legally, semi-separated). something is completely wrong with my military step-mom. i don't want to be specific but she has moved out and had no reason too. she's been making up false excuses and when they're real excuses, it's *horrible*.

my bio (biological) mom cries most days because she didn't do anything wrong and she tries to help but my step-mom is an imbecile and doesn't want help. my bio mom wants to let go of the situation but wants to save her marriage and no one is doing the fighting except her. she vents to **all** of her friends and they tell her the same thing. “leave, leave, leave!”

but my mom does not believe in divorce and continues to fight. my step-mom is not helping and their marriage therapist has even said that my bio mom is in more pain and in more heartbreak even though my step-mom has ptsd, suicidal thoughts, etc. i know that is serious, but the things i've heard does not sound like suicidal thoughts, just manipulation. ironically, my step-mom accuses my bio mom of being a manipulator.

139,"Okay, so, for context, my mother and I are very close and we talk pretty regularly about sex and sexual health. We don't go into specifics but she's fine with me masturbating and aware that I do it, exploring my sexual preferences, etc. as long as it's not dangerous to me. I got quite a lot of money for Christmas this year (almost $1k) and decided I'd put most of it in my savings for a car and save about $200-300 for whatever I want throughout the year. Clothes, books, gifts for friends, whatever, because I'm not currently employed. I decided recently that I'd like to buy a vibrator just for my personal time and because I think I deserve something nice. But to make any purchase I'll have to use my mom's credit card because I don't have my own and the money I was given was in cash, so either way she will see what I buy. Plus even if that wasn't the case she'd still eventually see what I was getting in the mail and ask. I'd like to just tell her beforehand so she doesn't get upset with me, I don't think she'll be upset about it as I'm buying it solely for myself and not for sex with another person. I'd just like to know what other people think would be the best way to do it. 

My idea was pretty much just to tell her what I want to get, tell her I'm buying it with my own money, follow up with the reinforcement that many health professionals say sex toys are a good way to improve your sexual health and familiarity with your body, and just see where it goes from there. My best friend thinks I should be more cautious about it because she'll probably be upset, but I think I'll be alright as long as I keep it straight to the point.

145,"Basically what the title says. My friend posted a meme on instagram and captioned it saying that she ""doesn't know why she's still here."" I messaged her casually asking what's up, not mentioning her post, but is there something else I should be doing?",28Dec2020,1
146,"I really don’t know how to write this so here’s some information:

-I’m 20 and my SO is 19 turning 20 soon

-My mom (40) lost her house Oct.1st and that was when I brought up how my SO and I were thinking about moving out. She feels safer with me staying with family so I’ve been staying with my grandparents ever since. 

-My mother is also very protective. When she was 19 she got pregnant and had me. Due to that she couldn’t finish college and fears that’ll happen to me. This last February she forced me to take a pregnancy test because I was “acting weird.” All because I had a UTI (and it’s the only time I’ve ever as my SO and I are each other’s first sexual partners) back in spring 2019 she’s been uneasy about me being sexually active.

-My grandparents and uncle (the family I live with) are super protective. There was one night, I went to an area filled with bars and pubs to have dinner with some friends. I was told I had no business there. I’ve never come home drunk and have always revealed when I’ve tried any drug. I’m very open and honest. However I fear their scorn and judgement. I’m afraid of them yelling or being upset so I always feel like I’m walking on thin ice. If I do anything outside of school and work, I feel as though I’m pissing them off. If I’m not at home they get upset.

-I’m also very shy, anxious, and skittish. I hate getting in their way or being a burden. I don’t cook for myself because if I were to clean anything, I’d be scoffed at for “doing it wrong.” If I make myself food- usually vegetarian depending on the time of day- I’m told I’m anorexic and need to eat real food. If I use the microwave, my grandfather gets really hyper about if anything makes a mess. I also have drawn back from cleaning clothes as whenever I find the chance someone gets upset because they suddenly need to shower or do clothes as well. Which is understandable as there’s only one washer and dryer, we all have to share. However, my needs are put to the side anyway. Whatever anyone else needs, I put first. I also have a way I like doing my clothes but my grandfather will get excited and start on about how he does it and tries to monitor me.  Even throwing out the trash is a battle as he’s very particular about how everything is done. I’ve kind of given up on myself from living here. I feel constantly questioned, judged, and scoffed at. I recently cleaned my room and he got pushy that I didn’t allow him to pull out furniture to sweep the floor and scrub my walls- which are clean btw.

-I pay rent to my family but have withdrawn as when it comes to my personal space, they are invasive. Like coming in without knocking and monitoring how many clothes and things I have and where to put stuff etc. I still give rent when absolutely necessary

-I feel that when I move out, they’ll freak out because they won’t know my whereabouts. They even track my 40 year old mother to see what she’s doing. I’m sure they’re not able to track me as they used to have to ask me when I was home or leaving work. I feel certain they can’t track me and that’s why they get finicky when I leave the house and have me text my location or when I go somewhere. Since I currently live with them, they know when I’m home so they don’t have to ask.

-My grandparents used to also visit my mom’s house to check in as they had a spare key for emergencies. When they would, my grandfather would start cleaning and they try to tell us what they felt wrong with anything.

-I currently hate coming out of my room as I fear them saying something negative or scoffing at me over my personal life. I just don’t feel comfortable at home.

-I even get judged for how I dress and am compared to literal strangers. I’m told to take pride in my appearance and to wear a little makeup or perfume or to straighten my hair or wear nicer clothes etc. I work at a Panera and always wear tshirts, jeans, or sneakers. On off days I wear fishnets, tights, sneakers, jeans, dresses, skirts, graphic teeS etc. I wear a lot of dark colors and the ocasional neutral tones. It’s not well received by my grandmother. I do have nice clothes for nicer occasions but if I’m not going to something that requires a nicer dress code or for me to do my face and hair nicely, I just dress very casually. I dress for the occasion per se.

-My SO and I found an apartment close to my grandparents in case of emergencies. It’s also walking distance from my work and the community college we attend. His family is very relaxed and ok with it. I just don’t know how to tell my family. My mother lives with her boyfriend and my sister. I rarely see her and don’t know how to tell her. I’ve been living separate from her for almost two years as I used to live alone in her house with my sister (senior in high-school) as that’s when she started living with her boyfriend. However, so long as I’m with family, she feels safe as I’m watched over. They’re all protective and I know the news will be I’ll received. I sign the lease with my SO tomorrow evening and plan on telling them after as they won’t be able to do anything to prevent me after that. How should I tell them? My SO wants to move in on Jan.6th and I’m just afraid of how my family will react. I plan on telling my mother first sometime soon. I just can’t figure out how to break it to them.",28Dec2020,1

149,"My friend keeps jumping into relationships after knowing someone for about a week, dates them for a month or two, breaks down, and blocks them. It's seriously starting to worry me. At one point, it got really bad and I was seriously considering changing our plans to move in together. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she said to give it a little time and listen to my heart.

It got better for a few months but I just found out that my friend is dating another person. Apparently they've been dating for about a month, and now my friend is starting to freak out. They said that their partner is ""emotionally cheating"" by talking to a friend about stuff that their partner should talk to them about. Which doesn't make any sense to me cause my friend does the same shit with me.

My friend is now comparing their partner to a guy I was previously pursuing a relationship with a couple months ago. This guy was actively ""love bombing"" me (ie being super clingy and saying I love you when we weren't even dating yet). Apparently saying I love you after the second date is the same thing to my friend. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just dense but I know for a fact that this fast relationship pattern isn't healthy. I've tried telling my friend to take a break from dating and focus on themself, which they did for a bit. But now their back on it and I don't know what to do. I honestly don't even want to talk to them about their relationships anymore cause I know its just gonna go up in flames sooner or later.

What should I do? Should I just ignore it? Should I give the same advice again? And should we move in together in the summer? I have no issues with them except for this. They're a great friend and we've been close for 5-6 years now. I don't want to lose them but I also don't want to watch them ruin another relationship by rushing into something.",28Dec2020,1

To be honest, I have always been chubby and not tin like she was. I have a small weight big hips and calfs results from all the swiming, dancing, aetobics and long walks/runs. I do admit I am still a chuby and self concess about it.

The comments started to get more and more presuring to lose weight when it spiked up to 73 kg to the point she said she will take me to the nutrition by force and beat me if I didnt respect the diet. In her defense this is her humor style but she said it in front of my boyfriend.

I told her to stop multiple times as I dont like them but she didnt stop. So Reddit is there any way of stoping the presure my mother is putting on me to lose weight?

151,"It was a wonderful Christmas, there's no arguing that. It was going very well until I made such a bid mistake and I am not yet even sure what the consequences are.

Me and my buddies were all having drinks, per usual. I was running with it and eventually decided to completely ignore my limit and late in the night things got bad and the worst part is, I don't even remember what I said.

My two best friends, who have been by my side for years are the two people that my dumbass drunk self decided to yell at, criticize them, make them feel terrible. I even got my money's worth with my friends sister who is basically my sister. 

Upon waking up the next day, I was told that I was taking shots at their families, their lifestyles, and even the rough times they had been through in the past that I knew about somewhere in the back of my head.

I drink to have fun, and it usually always is, but I just do not know why I would treat these people who mean so much to me in a terrible manner as I did.

They told me although still friends, they need space and do not want me to be talking to them right now. Obviously since I barely even remember the nights events it's even harder for me not to talk about it.

My question to the community is, we are only 19. You do not get a second chance to make new old friends... What can I do to fix this? What can I do to assure them that this will not happen again, and although drunkness is not an excuse, how do I assure them that was not the real me and I did not mean the things that I said?

During the later part of November, I managed to obtain a worker's permit from my high school. And Now currently work as a seasonal team member at target. However, the season has passed, and I'm about to be laid off. Which means I won't be receiving a stable income.

My mother's birthday is the day before Christmas eve, And for my mother, my father wanted to buy her a new laptop, since she's been using the same one for around 6 years. And it's just really struggling right now, Not wanting to boot up, bad battery, blown out speakers... the whole works. So, I was asked to lend him some money to purchase some used laptop from best-buy. I don't remember the exact model but it was a Lenovo.

Well, it turns out the laptop's memory is just, utter dogshit according to my dad. And it was too late to cancel the order. Now we have the laptop, haven't opened the box, and only have less than a week to return it now. Yet when I beg him to return it, he just complains to me about this or that.

163,"First of all, I apologize if I post in the wrong thread.

There is somebody, who drives me absolutely crazy and mad to the point where I just want to punch a wall.

Him (32) and me (26F) are colleagues - due to the nature of our jobs we don't see the same person often. Last time I worked with him was Feb 2019. Before that, a couple of months earlier and that's about it. I don't have much memory of what happened.

We got in touch roughly around April/May this year (2020), he added me on FB and we started talking, generally about work and how 'rona messed up everything. I do admit, I am more of a flirty person (bit pervert too) and we toyed with the thought of ""what if..."". He showed me a website - similar to FB but for fetists and kinks - I've signed up and left it at that. Kinda started to fancy him, despite the age difference.

Because of rona, we were unable to work, so he went back to his home (both of us are from neighbouring countries outside of the UK), while I stayed in the UK as I was unable to go home. We didn't really talk then, and I got on with my life. Tried to date and shit - by the time he was able to come back, I was talking to someone. He got mad, blocked me from everywhere.

Fast forward a few weeks, the dating thing didn't work out, I was pretty upset about it - he unblocked me and messaged me again. I was confused but alright, left it at that. He was mad that I didn't wait for him, why did I started seeing someone, we agreed we will see each other, we do ""stuff"", yadda yadda. 

Then I did something upsetting out of anger and frustration which upset him, and yet another run to block me everywhere. Understandable.

Then a few weeks later I got unblocked yet again. I apologized for what I did, to which he accepted, even tho it hurt him quite a lot. I was unblocked for a while, and he kept messaging me. I made it clear that I will NOT do anything with him if he cannot guarantee that we will stay at least friends, I need that security at least. He wasn't very... Agreeing. Then again few days later he blocked me.

He blocked me total of 4 times. I had enough of his bullshit, so when he messaged me again, we had yet another argument, telling him he only messages me when he wants something and I ended up blocking everywhere - FB, that website, blacklisted his phone number, literally gave him no way to contact me.

In the mean time I was trying to find someone, to which I did. 2 great dates, but that's another story (genuinely don't understand guys). To this guy's advice ""have other options too"" I unblocked this crazy dude. He messaged me from a foreign number. In my head I was like *""Jesus Christ not again.........""*

He was actually nice, but then again I thought he wants something from me. THEN, to my surprise, he told me everything, literally everything.
He is attracted to me, he wants me, he wants to enjoy *the deed* with me. I was so surprised I ended up crying in frustration 😂
We agreed to meet, to talk everything out because I want to hear it in person. I thought I might actually give him a chance, like a proper chance, maybe it could work out.

Now I am not doing much work until end of next month, he worked 1 day, and free for 3 months. Messaged him if work was alright, if everything was good, he said it was exhausting, so I didn't bother him much. Today I messaged him again, no reply for the whole bloody day, so I deleted WhatsApp from my phone (not even the other dude gives a shit either). He suspended his FB account... Guess I never going to find out what the FUCK is going on.

So, people of Reddit. Any comments? Any advice? Anything that maybe I could've done better or worse? Literally don't know what to do at this point. Most of you may say why the fuck did I unblock him, yeah, you are right, but I am too nice.",28Dec2020,1

Naturally, everyone's been talking about what they're going to do after high school, what college they're going to go to, if they're taking a gap year, etc. At the beginning I was super pumped to think about it and figure it all out, but recently I've begun to hate thinking about it. I get really exhausted and unmotivated when I start looking at colleges and think about what I should/ am going to do. 

When I first started thinking about it, I really wanted to go abroad and study in Germany. I agree with a lot of Germany's politically and economic decisions/laws and the tuition is some 500 euros, which is absolutely insane. I've always really loved the German language and the culture, so it was pretty natural to want to study there. Recently I started to talk to a new friend group and I'm the happiest I've been in a while. Most of my friends have been talking about how they want to move out of America eventually, but they still want to study in the U.S. I really want to stay in contact with this group, or at least a couple of people from the friend group, so it kind of eliminates studying abroad. I know you can totally be in contact and keep connections whilst in different places, that's the whole point of social media, but it's not the same. 

I know that I'll be able to find friends where ever I end up, but I really like this specific friend group. Am I just being a short sighted teenager or is this somewhat justified? Should I take the chance to study abroad anyways because it's a once in a lifetime chance? Or should I just find a college in America to study in that's got a exchange program? I don't know what I should do and the pressure to have some sort of plan is baring down from everyone. Any help would be great.

So far I've only got 1 B during my high school career, the rest have been A's. I've taken 2 AP's, 1 being AP Euro with an A and the other AP Lang with a B. I also have a part time job currently and have a couple grand saved up for college, but it's not a lot.

Yet, medication can’t fix any problems it can only help you get through them. Which brings me to this, I been struggling with low self esteem and anxiety a lot lately.

He might even play with my other cousin too (10M) because he mentioned seeing him online earlier and I’m thinking he might play with other students because he mentioned names (I don’t know who these kids are/if they’re kids) 


I have no problem with video games or cursing etc but it just feels weird when he’s a teacher/tutor to her and facetiming her while they’re playing. Should I tell my uncle and aunt? I don’t know if they know or not but they’ve been uncomfortable with it in the past so I don’t understand why he’d want her to play video games with him. I’m not trying to be overbearing I just want to make sure nothing happens to her.",28Dec2020,1
173,"Made a new friend, been talking for a while and met up a few times. She expressed that she's always horny for me and she'll somehow turn every conversation into something sexual. I try to dismiss it and told her upfront that I've got a boyfriend and I'm not keen to do anything sexual with her.

Fast forward to last week, I was intoxicated at home and she asked if she could come over. I allowed it. During the entire stay, she kept implying how horny she was for me and how she wanted me to fuck her. FYI, I'm a girl too and though I'm bisexual, I'm just not attracted to her in that way. I was intoxicated, she wasn't. So clearly, I'm not supposed to be making any decisions.

I texted my bf about what was going on and asked him if he was alright with me making out with her. Apparently he's okay that I made out with a girl, so that's fine.

I was very hesitant to, I tried to change the topic, I tried to ignore her request. I honestly didn't feel like it but she was really persistent. She kept telling me to make the first move, she came close to me, she kept giving obvious signs that she wants me to do things to her.

I gave in, and just ended up making out with her.

I didn't feel anything. I wasn't turned on, I wasn't attracted, I wasn't feeling anything. I did it just to shut her up and get this out of the way. I thought I was okay with it, turns out im not. I'm not okay now. I can't touch myself and not feel disgusted, I can't get the image of us making out, I keep having intrusive thoughts about what happened.

Please don't hurt me in the comments or tell me that I made a bad choice. I know I did, I really just need help to figure out what is it I'm feeling and what is it I'm going through.

TLDR; reluctantly made out with someone, I made the move cause she insisted. Now I'm feeling suicidal, disgusted, detached. Was this a form of sexual coercion?",28Dec2020,1
174,"I’m 20, and I have two older sisters who are 27 and 30. I have extremely strict parents and I have a curfew of 10pm. I’ve tried very hard to push the limits but I’ve hit a wall.

One time, I came home at 11pm and my parents locked me outside the house and told me to sleep in the garage. They told me I have a strict curfew of 10 from then on

About a month later, it was 9:30 and I called them saying that I’ll be 10 minutes late. My dad hangs up on me after I say this. I come home at 10:10 and my dad locked me out the house.

My parents said that I’m only allowed to go on holidays with non-family people once I am married and that I cannot move out until I am married. 

When my sister was 27, she was engaged to her now husband. We went on a family trip overseas without my other sister. When she asked her parents if she could take me shopping, (1 minute walk away) they yelled at her saying it’s too dangerous and that she can’t go. I thought it was ridiculous back then but now it made me realise that if I’m NOT married, I will end up like that too at who knows what age. 

Whenever me or my sisters have ever disobeyed them, they often say they’ll throw us out and disown us. So, clearly if I move out against their wishes I’ll be disowned. I want to leave in the middle of the night and leave a note. 

However, now that my sisters are married and have gained freedom, they tell me that they’re extremely thankful for my parents and that because of them, people respect them and know they’re not “Wild, and have no dignity, honour and respect for themselves.” I told my boyfriend this and he said that they’re brainwashed and have Stockholm’s syndrome. 

I don’t know if I want to spend the next 10 years of my youth like this. I don’t want to miss out on memories of travelling with friends, or not feeling suffocated by all these rules that I know I’ll have to endure for the next 10 years, or until I’m married. But... I look at my sisters and they seem so happy and I’m scared that if I disown myself and leave for the sake of freedom in my 20’s, I would have ruined the rest of my life. My children will have no grandparents and with my sisters loyalty to my parents, they will disown me too. I’ll have no family. 

I’m currently saving up for if/when I move out but I’m so scared. I want to move out ASAP because since I’m gonna move out, might as well do it as soon as possible so I don’t miss out on more of life. 

What should I do?",28Dec2020,1

178,"It’s been 2 years since me (25f) and my ex (27m) broke up. I haven’t stopped thinking about them. Certain things reminds me of him and I wish it would stop.
For example:

Sex toys: those gel-like squishy sex toy that guys use to jack off? Well that reminds me of when he sent me a video of himself jacking off, which I later found out that he originally filmed that for another girl.

Snapchat: multiple girls on Snapchat that he used to talk to.. also I remember when I found out when he “posted” me, the setting was only set for me to see and no one else so he kept me a secret.

Sex videos: I went through his phone and saw multiple sex tapes with him and other females and some of the dates would match up to a time when I was in the hospital or my moms bday or a time when I happened to be on a trip. 

Certain words and phrases stick with me that he said to me. Situations play over and over again in my head at times. Like there were multiple times when I wanted to have sex and he didn’t want to. Or a time when they got me a sandwich from somewhere after coming back from cheating on me and when I wanted to have sex with him, he refused and pushed me away from his crotch. 

Sometimes I’m good, but then I start to break down and then I get angry at the fact that he’s moving on without me (even tho he did ME wrong)

I feel crazy and I know my friends are getting tired of hearing his name being brought up every time... but idk what to do. 
It was the only relationship I was ever in and I don’t know if I’m good enough to be in another relationship. 


I know the relationship needed to end after he cheated on me throughout our entire relationship, lied to me countless number of times, .. so why am I still thinking about him? 
He was my first (and so far only) relationship I’ve ever had and he took my virginity.

179,"I need some advice, and quite desperately, about college. If you don't want a bit of back story, skip to the bold sentence below. I do apologize for the occasional swear words, I tried to speak as honest from the heart as I can! :)

Hello! My name is Ethan, I am a sixteen year old (seventeen essentially in three months) who is a junior at a high school that helps me get my AA Degree by the time I graduate my senior year! Originally, I went to this school to stay with my friends from middle school and not for the degree; that was more of a perk for me at the beginning. You see, the thing I didn't think about is how it was a college prep school essentially, which meant they would bother the absolute hell out of me. While I attended this one, I wanted to be a musician (a rapper specifically) and teachers did not approve of that AT ALL. They were more focused on getting me to college and shoving that idea down my throat, which was forced on me so much that it repelled me away from the thought of even stepping foot on a college campus. This also made me  work religiously on my passion of music daily to get better, in hopes it would boost my chances of ""making it"". I was also doing theatre pre COVID quite regularly too which helped my vocabulary. 

My junior year (this year), my family moved away and thus made me had to restart practically everything I built in my old town; friendships, love, school, etc. My parents had transferred me to another branch of college prep schools where we decided to live. But being alone and with teachers not able to force the idea of college on me in person let me actually humor  the idea by myself for a while. One thing my family and I found out was after working on music and writing poems/short stories almost daily for three years, it had actually paid off. I recently had to take several sets of tests over the course of this year to test my knowledge, and found out that I was wayyy smarter than I thought I was; especially being ranked as the highest scored english student in my school and ranked quite high in the general district on both tests! This shocked my teachers because I am a very social person, and not usually the type to be a teachers pet. I am usually the kid doodling in your classroom, or making smart ass comments. Luckily though, I was funny enough to make the teachers laugh, so i rarely get in trouble which is a blessing in disguise. 

**My Question...**

So the thing that I need help with is knowing what the hell to do about going to college. It's been made apparent over the years (specifically this year) that I have quite the skill in english, and as I've matured, I have considered going to college to become an English teacher. My reasoning is because I've never had a good english teacher which I'd hope to change for kids in the future. I still want to pursue music quite a lot but after knowing about Ezra Koenig's (of Vampire Weekend) story about going to college for being an english teacher and still working his ass off on his music, it has been made clear that while it's a lot to handle, it is in fact possible to do both. I just don't want to end up thirty and lonely with a music career that's gone nowhere. I'd rather have an option I would be happy with. I also know I want a family, and I feel like I know enough about raising a family that nobody wants a grown man who works at a shitty job and makes music at 37 going nowhere in life who cannot support his family financially. 

The con for me is basically just debt honestly, that is really the only drawback I have of going. My dad has told me if the requirements is you NEED to go to college to get the job, then it shouldn't matter Can somebody please give me some advice to me what the hell to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Ethan :)",28Dec2020,1
180,"She (28f) broke up with me (28f) saying she can’t take that my job requires me to work a lot of hours, I also work an hour away from my store. I run a car dealership. She has a two year old that calls me dada on her teaching. We moved in very quickly, like 40 days quickly. Which I asked repeatedly if she thought for any reason it wouldn’t work out. She always said no. So I provided for the family financially, and she felt I lacked around the house. So I stepped it up, she noticed and it seemed well. Then Christmas came she barely kissed me all morning. We opened presents with little man then headed to her parents. She looked amazing, I complemented her left and right. She ignored them. Literally. Then when we got home she went in our room to talk with her friend. So I played with little man and changed him, and then put him to bed. Next morning she was very nasty towards me, normal because she sleeps later then me as I take care of him in the morning when I get up with the puppy so she can sleep. I went to work, which when she texted me that I annoy her and we should figure out the living Situation.

Anybody who has gotten out of long-term relationships probably knows that one of the hardest readjustments is not having “your person” to share your day with, do things with, and just hang with. At least, that part has been most difficult for me. I’ve been out of a relationship for sometime and found myself relying on my friends. Then, in this past year, I had a thing with someone who I really wanted to be with and she became “my person.” Well, now she’s not around anymore and I’m afraid things are fading away from that. I’m almost terrified to be on my own. I don’t want to be lonely. But I’m moving, and amidst a pandemic, meeting new people is pretty difficult.

185,"My friend is coming out as trans. I love that, love her, support that. I was the first and only person she came out to. I was so honored to be the first person she trusted and I very much know the weight of that trust. I thought I was really happy to be that for her.

But due to personal circumstances and mental state, I've fallen pretty quickly into a dark place that I have never remotely experienced before. Not related to that, just personal mental downfall. I know that's not unique to me and I don't own that distress this year. But this is pushing me into a desperation and bleakness I am terrified of. Also I've had a bouquet of medical problems I haven't really disclosed to any one close to me. But the manifestation of my pain means lashing out on my last remaining friends. I'm pushing them away pretty hurtfully. Like verbally shoving them away as hard as I can.

I owe my friend a better support and coming out story. I have lost that, and so has she, through the manifestation of my mental state. I know there's no getting that back. My plan is to stop talking to her, let her hate me, and hopefully she can start over with someone more stable and supportive.

I've been shutting down my social media accounts one by one. I am trying to shut them out so I stop hurting them. I'm in emergency therapy. I need something else. Unique suggestions, ideas, stories, anecdotes? I ruined someone's coming out. I destroyed their support at an incredibly vulnerable time. I know I'll never make that right. I have apologized.

186,"Hi, i’m a man in my early twenties. i’ve been losing hair lately, my hair is generally getting thinner. I've been experiencing a lot of itchiness past couple of months. I literally find like 10-20 hairs on my pillow when I wake up, and a hair has to fall off anytime I run my hands through them. It's happening throughout my whole head, very visible when my hair is wet. I’ve started using a shampoo which reduces the itching about a month ago, but i don’t know if that’s the underlying factor. My hair was very thick and held its style about a year ago, there’s a visible difference since then.

187,"This is gonna be a long one because there is so much pact into this but I will try to make it as a shot as possible.

In February one of my really good friends, well call him Craig. He set me up with my current ex boyfriend. Me and my ex dated for about a month and half and I liked him a lot, but it turned out he only liked me because he thought I was pretty and had a nice body. He was the first guy I had ever said I love you to so this kinda hurt me a bit....actually more like a lot.

After me and my ex had broken up I had tried to talk to Craig about it he kinda just brushed me off. He would sit there and let me vent but, since I was talking about his best friend he kept defending his actions. This really made me feel like I was making a bigger deal out of the break out of this then It was.

Because Craig was good friends with my ex boyfriend, he was around a lot. I felt like I couldn’t get away from my ex boyfriend and at one point Craig even invited my ex to love with him. 

In the time we broke up my ex would repeatedly tell me about the girls he was fucking. About how they would buy him dinner and then take him back to their place. He would then wonder why I would get mad at him about it. When he talked about it gave me massive panic attacks. I will admit we were both being petty towards each other. He would also take it too far though, at times calling me a fat slut and telling me it was like throwing a sausage down a hallway.

This is where my girl best friend comes in, well call her Jane. So I met Jane through Craig in may. She had just broken up with her husband and we got really close really fast. She had a lot of stuff going in with her because she had begun divorcing her husband and she was pregnant (she didn’t know who the dad was) I felt like she was finally the friend that I could vent to about my ex. 

We got really close and then I noticed that she was getting close to my ex boyfriend. I didn’t think much of it becise we all kinda hung around together, until one day Craig reviled that my ex had a crush on Jane. Not long after that Jane came up to me and asked if she could date my ex, at first I said no, but then I saw how they were getting along and I felt like I should be the reason two people who like each other shouldn’t get together.

They got together three months after I had broken up with my ex, and I still wasnt over him. I asked nicely for them not to do a bunch of lovey dovy stuff around me because I didn’t know if I could take it. I had just started going to therapy so that maybe I could help myself be okay with the situation.

They Kept pushing the boundaries of what they could do around me. First is started with holding hand, then it was them cuddling in front of me until it got to the point the were basically making out in front of me. All of this happens within a month. It got to the point where they would always be touching In Some way around me. I kept trying to tell myself that I was over reacting and to get over it, but I couldn’t.

Along with this they kept making rules about what I could and could not talk about to anyone. I was not aloud to talk shut about my ex, and I was not aloud to talk about there relationship. I was startling to feel like they care more about their damn relationship then they did about my depression. 

Along with all of this they were borrowing money from me all of the time and not paying it back. They kept telling me that my college wasn’t that hard when I mentioned it was like my second job. My ex boyfriend kept making rude comments towards me. And when I complained to them about being single they told me to “go fuck someone then”

When my friend had her baby in October I started becoming friends with one of my coe workers, and we got really close. I started hanging out with her more often then my other friends. It started out with her helping me because I couldn’t leave work to go and get tired on my car, she got off before me so she offered to do it.

We started hanging out more often and I finally felt like I was appreciated. Instead of telling me that my college wasn’t that hard, she was helping with my college homework. She allowed me to vent about my ex boyfriend for the first time since we broke up I finally felt like someone understood where I was coming from. I felt love and cared for. When I gave something to her, she gave it right back. for the first time was giving my all to a friends and I felt like she was  giving her all right back. She introduced me to tiger frinds and I started a new friend group that finally made me happy. 

Now my old friend are asking why I dont hang out with them anymore. I don’t know how to have that conversation with them because I don’t want to out right abandon them, because they were my best friends. In this list I only stated the bad, I haven’t stated all the good they have done for me. I don’t know what to do because i don’t want to leave them but then again I don’t want to go back. I gave Jane a small explanation but they want to have a big talk about it.

188,"I [M20] grew up in the city for my childhood. 1-13. My parents moved me to the suburbs for high school where we lived in a basement. The living conditions weren’t good but I was grateful for life and everything my parents did. I fell into a negative thought loop, depression, loneliness and anxiety. I had no friends, I couldn’t invite anyone to my home and my relationship with my parents had deteriorated. 

In school I was bullied and made fun of. To the point where I stayed to myself yet got bullied. I cried when I would get home. Whenever I tried to open up to my parents my dad would just mock me for opening up. We didn’t have a lot of money and it’s okay. I felt the stress too. 

We moved back to the city and I saw my health go in a positive direction. However I had to move back. This October and I have been nauseous. Although we don’t live in the same town we live really close to it. Everyone kind of knows everyone. I’m scared someone will find me and harass me. I have been nauseous and crying what if they make fun of me or bully me in front of my parents. 

I haven’t gone outside with my parents at all. They all go outside but I don’t. 

Is it normal for my dad to invalidate everything I do by trying to make it sarcastic? I have never told me parents anything about myself since the age of 16. I don’t care about them anymore.

I've only been there since July, but I consider myself to be a little more tech savvy and feel like I understand technology though I have no experience with programming or web development. But I know what it takes to make those, I just haven't taken the time to learn. Like I understand that code is a thing.

This guy has been coming into our store for the past 4-5 weeks, and has been sharing every detail with us. He's in a really tough situation, and my coworkers are trying to get rid of him because they think he's full of shit, and that if he is telling the truth none of them want to get involved, but I actually think he's telling the truth and because of how crazy it sounds, nobody believes him.

He has shown me pictures of what he is talking about. He's gotten 2 new phones within the last month, and keeps needing to change his number because every time he does he starts getting harassed again. They've sent him pictures of his wife with another man(Photoshopped), have stolen $25k from him, and are obviously targeting him. He took a picture of his computer screen for me, of which on it shows his cmd open on his computer, and a string of code that is a message. It basically said, ""(his name) you have no life no friends no job now and that will never be enough""

They've been harassing him. This guy claims to have just gotten started trying to start up a few businesses. He claims to have been a CTO of a company, and that they were all getting ready to release some apps to the app store for phones. 

He claims to have gotten in touch with Apple, and now is in touch with the FBI. He's going through a divorce but keeps in touch with his wife, and at first thought she was doing it but has come to realize it can't be her. 

Me and my coworkers have tried to be very understanding, but he seems to have taken a liking to all of us, especially me and my manager, and keeps coming back for solutions. At times he will not take ""There's not much we can do"" for an answer. He tends to speak in riddles as well, and when you listen carefully sometimes contradicts himself. 

Everybody thinks he is crazy, but I kind of think he's telling the truth and that he's just under a lot of stress, and since we're not in his situation it's a lot harder to understand. 

BUT, he keeps coming back. How do we deal with him? He doesn't do anything to get banned, and he tries to stay out of the way of other customers. But he was telling us if we helped him out he'd be willing to put in a really good word for us or something. I feel like maybe that's BS. 

But, it's obvious something isn't right there. We've been waiting it out, but what if he doesn't ever stop coming in? The other day he was in our store for 4 hours on the phone with care, because he was trying to get up to higher levels of management and he DID. That's what makes me believe he's for real, because why would they give him the time of day if they thought he was crazy? 

He's very articulate, well-spoken, and claims to have graduated from Harvard. THis entire situation is so WTF to me i can't help but poke my nose in.",28Dec2020,1

When I was kid my parents transferred me to five different middle schools trying to find the right one for me. I got to leave school's anytime I wanted if I had a problem. I finally ended up staying in one school for my last three years of middle school. When I was at this school I was a very immature kid who didn't really have any social skills at the time and really was still just trying to figure out life. When I was a 11, 12 and 13 year old kid though everybody I was around acted much older than their age. They had way more life experience than I did and when I was younger I did immature things and people that were around me would get pissed that I would do these things and at the time I really didn't understand what I was doing. When it came time to choose a high school I was dead set on leaving this school because of my horrible middle school experience. The thing though was that my parents were really considering me going to this school for high school. Eventually we went to different orientations for school's and when I was a kid I use to be an actor and my mom found this arts high school for us to look at. As soon as I was there I got this gut instinct that I didn't wanna go to this school at all. I had been cut from the basketball team two years in a row in middle school but I still wanted to play in high school and NEVER really wanted to give up my opportunity to play sports. My mom still had me audition for this school (since it is a arts school you have to get accepted into it) I audition and got accepted. My mom was telling me that she thinks this is a good opportunity for acting but I stuck to my gut instincts because I knew I wanted to play sports. My parents decided to send me back to middle school I went to and I honestly was just determined to get out. I got cut from the basketball team 7th and 8th grade and I didn't think I had any shot in high school at that school. I went back on my instincts and reauditon for the school and got accepted again. Going back on my instincts was the worst decision ever not only did I wanna play sports and put myself in a position where I couldn't but also the school had a lot of open homosexuality. Their were gay kids that were coming on to me and I literally couldn't sit down or look anywhere without seeing something homosexual in a day. Homosexuality was being forced down my throat in a way I could never imagine and the next three years of high school were a nightmare. People were trying to tell me I was gay and this was crazy to me because before then I had never had to deal with people constantly trying to question my sexuality on a daily basis. This still haunts me today because I never was able to get a fair shot to play sports after high school and my gut instincts were right.",28Dec2020,1
194,"My (F16) parents have a history of being a bit iffy when it comes to issues like blackface and cultural appropriation. Fortunately they are open minded people and after some education they came around and even joined anti-racist groups. My problem happened after we were discussing the movie the Danish Girl and my sister mentioned she thought the movie was good but the role of a transgender person should have been played by a transgender person. The adults then proceeded to argue with this and although we love a good debate, it ended with them saying that regardless of role (POC/transgender/disabled) it should be played by the best actor regardless of if they fall into those categories. I have a bit of an issue with this as it just seems to be the erasure of marginalized people in the film industry but I can’t tell if this is an overreaction. So can anyone tell me if what they said was okay/ unproblematic and if not, what resources should I look at to learn more?",28Dec2020,1
195,"So I was banned from RWBYA why? Because they assumed I was someone I was not and instead of investigating or looking into it they banned me. So I just backed off. However, something didn't sit right so I decided to look into it further and discovered some disturbing stuff. For one the leaders are all involved with extortion of amino coins and selling them for real cash (which is against the terms of services). They ban victims of harrassment and attack instead of the bullies or harrassers. I also discovered that they bullied a autistic person behind closed doors and than banned her for quote on quote being weird, as well as banning on assumption rather than investigating, and after a couple months of info gathering I have a good deal of information. If I used the information to get the leadership to step down and put someone new in, would that make me an jerk, or should I take it to the app creators where they would ban the amino and punish everyone?

196,"Quick catch up on our relationship. There is a 5 year difference. Me 22 and Sister 26. I have always been the more outgoing, outspoken while she is more soft spoken trying to please everyone. She has always told me shes jealous of how easy things come to me and I make life seem simple. But we have always been there for each other no matter what. 

Our lives were on pretty much the same track as she is married and bought a house and I got engaged and am pregnant and buying soon.  The only difference is my relationship is ""perfect"" compared to hers (her words) so I feel like I'm not completely qualified to judge on a broken relationship. 

Her marriage has been slowly falling apart and about a month ago she told her husband she needed some time apart and they needed to figure out what they wanted from each other. I was there for her and ran to her immediately when she told me.  The next day she tells me that she hooked up with an ex of hers and starts going on this fantasy ridden rant about how her and ex are reconnecting and they're different people from when they broke up and they might work out. I gave her grief because WTF!!! she went from needing space from her husband to trying to start a new life.  Shes ready to get rid of her dogs and move out all while leaving her husband high and dry with this info.  I try to support her through this while ex is now apart of her life and popping up all the damn time.  I let her know that I don't support this new relationship and she's being dumb but she sees nothing wrong. 

Jump to the present and shes now posting cutesy pictures of her and ex on Facebook like they're this adorable couple (not even divorced yet) and flips out when my family doesnt immediately accept this guy to our family Christmas and because we're aren't accepting this guy as her new boyfriend but ""not boyfriend"". 

As part of her rant she tells us that when she starts bringing this guy around the family if we can't support them then we aren't supportive of her happiness and we can eff off. So per her request I politely told her that I would indeed be effing off. 

Part of me feels like an ass for doing so but the other part of me is irritated that she feels that we all need to get over everything that happened and accept this new guy. 

Yes I know, it's her life she can do what she wants. But as I said before we have always been close.  Would drop everything for the other so I am irritated and hurt that she could careless about literally everyone else.

Am I wrong for just dropping her or should I try to keep being there for her?

203,"There was a kid on AMA who posted about being a teenager and depressed bc he's single 

I wrote this to him and he's deleted the post, so I thought I'd share in case someone needs to hear it : you are enough and you are awesome

And I'm gonna say this bc I wish someone actually said it to me when I was suffering from depression in my teens for being single: I didn't find love until I hit 30. Honestly that was my first real relationship. B4 that is was shitty Internet dates and abusive manipulative dudes who used me (grew up in an abusive home and repeated cycles). It was me refusing to admit I was bi and igorning a woman who loved me deeply because I grew up w homophobic parents and couldn't not admit to myself I was in love with my best friend. 

Ppl always told me ""why aren't u dating?"" and ""you're so great you'll find someone"" but it took me until 30 to belive that too. My point is, don't fixate on a relationship. Yes it's easier said than done, but It just makes u miserable. I was miserable sitting around comparing myself to all my friends who were dating like crazy since 14 and I didn't kiss until I went to college. 

We are all on our own timelines. My partner is my soul mate and I am happy every single day I waited. It took him until 33 to meet me. He had only 2 or 3 women before me and all his experiences were shitty too. 

It truly doesn't matter anymore and I wish I'd been more OK being alone. Alone and lonely are 2 different things, and I see now in retrospect I could have been enjoying being alone and making my own schedule instead of being worried about dressing up a certain way to attract dudes for self validation. 

Please try and focus on all the awesome stuff u can do as a single person. You get to be in charge of ur own schedule and not answer to anyone. You get to know yourself, really take time to learn what DO I WANT and WHO AM I. That way when the right person comes along they get the real you, not just some version you created when u were 16 to attract the 'right person' based on what worked for everyone around you. 

I'm saying this bc no one told any of it to me. You are a perfect person who deserves love, and we have to love ourselves first so that when we do get into a relationship it's the real us not a projection of who we think we want to be. I know it's easier said  than done. But it is possible.

207,"I visit my partner every other weekend and occasionally park in this little gravel lot that’s next to their building. I try not to park there often because I prefer not to and recognize that I should leave some spots for the people who live in the building as a courtesy, even though they don’t pay for parking (it strictly says it’s not provided by their lease) and there are no private parking signs anywhere. Basically, it seems like a first come first served kind of deal. The other day I parked in the lot since I didn’t feel comfortable parking in the street and walking as there was a carjacking nearby that I had heard about on my way there. The next day, one of their neighbors left a note on my car saying that it wasn’t public parking and that I was taking “their” parking spots. I left a note explaining that I try not parking there often to be courteous but that before parking there, I made sure I wasn’t breaking any parking rules and double-checked the building’s lease and looking for private parking signs. I suggested that if they had an issue with the parking situation, they should address their landlord or get a city sticker that would allow them to park in the streets of the lot gets full (they should have had one on their car anyway since that’s a law in our city, but I didn’t mention this part there to not come across as aggressive. They’ve gotten away with not having one since technically, the lot of private property within a fence). 

I tried sounding as respectful as possible while not backing down as I found it ridiculous that they’re claiming those spots as their own when I know for a fact parking isn’t provided and they don’t pay for it. They then wrote back on the note which included something along the lines of “Someone come get their friend!” and posted it on the building, which I found really disrespectful. They even denied it was them on the note despite my partner being close with the only other tenants with a car in the lot who would’ve definitely asked politely if I could avoid parking there. Also, we heard them complaining about it upstairs 😂. Anyway, I’m not going to park there out of spite, but I want to know how to move forward from here. I might have to park there this weekend since my own city sticker is expiring soon and I don’t want to risk a ticket while I wait for it in the mail. I’m leaning towards parking there. But should I park there? Am I in the wrong? If I do and they make another stink about it, how can I best handle it in a mature manner?",28Dec2020,1

211,"I'm fourteen years old, and I was a pretty normal kid up until 4th Grade.  In 4th Grade, it was 2016/2017.  I had been using YouTube for a while and it seemed to have no real negative effects on me until 4th Grade.  Previously, I would just do innocent stuff, like watch Minecraft YouTubers, Five Nights At Freddie's, etc.  But because I've always been a head developmentally by a few years, I hit puberty very early, around 10 or 11, when I was in Fourth Grade.  I ended falling down the 2016 Anti-SJW Alt-Right pipeline that a lot of teenagers at that time fell down.  Except, I was a very small child.  A ten year old.  I watched Idubbbz, FilthyFrank, H3H3, and Ben Shapiro was my go to source of information.  I said the n-word and f-slur all the time, and I would make extremely racist, sexist, and transphobic remarks but then label them as dark humor.  Pretty much what every other kid who went through that phase was like, except I was a lot younger.  My best friend at the time went through the exact same thing. 

Then, in 5th Grade, I met J and C (initials for anonymity).  J was introverted, very smart, and watched a lot of anime.  I, at the time, was a big fan of the anime ""Tokyo Ghoul.""  We would talk about YouTube, and anime at lunch.  Then, in library class, I met C.  We had almost identical taste in YouTubers, and became immediate friends.  Over time, J and C became friends as with each other and the three of us formed a close friend group.  We ended up developing a sense of humor that was very unique and ahead of its time.  It was a mix of surreal, strange, and unusual bits, and dark humor.  If you browse the internet now, you've probably seen memes from subs like r/196, r/comedyepilepsy, or r/okbuddyretard.  We did all of that stuff before anyone else did.  We'd make up elaborate bits and characters, that we'd play in class as a joke.  We'd do prank calls as these characters, make YouTube videos with them.  It was honestly really fun.  But there was a difference between me and J, and C.  J and C had personalities that were separated from the friend group, and this sense of humor.  They had real personalities, and the bits and jokes we'd do were a collective thing we all did together.  When we weren't around each other, we didn't act like that.  At least that was true for J and C.  I guess you could say that, they could ""turn it off.""  I on the other hand, couldn't.  I continued doing the bits in class, acting as sort of a class clown.  But all that this did was make me look like a freak.  When I was with C or J or both of them, we could feed of each other and everyone thought it was really funny.

But when I was alone, I just looked like an idiot.  Doing stupid voices and playing characters by myself, saying random things that didn't really make sense.  No one thought it was funny if it was just me.  They all just thought I was a weirdo.  Because of this, J, C, and my best friend, who I'll call T, were my only friends.  This trend continued through 6th and 7th Grade.  I grew into more and more of an outcast with every year.  

And now, in 8th Grade, I don't really know who I am anymore.  When quarantine started in 7th Grade, I wanted to kill myself.  C is a ghost on social media.  You only get to talk to him at school.  J and T are very easy to get a hold of, and J and T and I talked lots during quarantine, meanwhile C drifted from J and I.  Because of this, the friend group basically died.  And without that group, the sense of humor died.  Since C could turn it off, he ended developing a completely new life with completely new people and a great reputation.  Jordan grew into his own shoes, as a smart, well liked kid.  T became a quiet stoner/skater kid.

But because my personality was based off of the group personality of 5-7th Grade, I was left with no real direction.  So I just kept up the weird bits persona, even though it's not really me.  Because my friendship with C died off, I couldn't come up with anything interesting anymore.  IT became harder for me to be funny, and I became even more of an outcast.  This year, 8th Grade, I finally got to go back to real school.  I decided to stop all the stupid buts, and weird crap, and now I guess I'm considered a quiet kid.  Not because it's who I am, but because I don't know who I am.

I feel extremely isolated, and alone.  Everyone still sees me as an absolute weirdo.  Popular kids bully me and call me a school shooter, girls make fake gagging noises when my names mentioned, etc.  

They still see me as what I made myself out to be over the past years, and I don't know what to do.  I have no idea who I want to be, or who I am.  I've talked about this with multiple people, but they always say ""Just be yourself!""  or ""Be whoever you want!""

But, I don't think they understand.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what's happening:

The old ""me"" died off, and now I don't know who I am or who I want to become.  Everyone still thinks of me as the old me.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what they think is happening:

I still am that weirdo I was in 5th, 6th, and 7th Grade, and I am scared to express it.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't get, that, thats ***~~NOT~~***   me, and I don't want it to ever be me again.  ""Being myself"" or ""being who I want to be"" doesn't work.  Because I don't know either of those things.

I've never felt more alone, scared, and lost.  J and T are my only friends.  I am an empty husk of a human being, and everyone at my school hates me, and think I'm a school shooter freak.  They talk to me like I'm a dog or an animal, like I'm some retarded kid or something.

I want to find myself.  But it's so hard.  There's so many places I could go.  Paths I could take.

212,"I have this friend. Me and her fell out a few years ago due to her being sus with one of my crushes (we were 16 or so). With that situation, she knew I was interested with him, he rejected me and she continued to pursue him despite me letting her know I was uncomfortable ( yes the situation was messy as hell and unfair on both parts). After that situation I felt like I could never trust her especially when it came to dating, men, relationships, etc. We rekindled last year in 2019 but I’ve been wary of our friendship just due to the history. On Christmas I was telling her about how my boyfriend’s sister doesn’t like me and today she calls me and we’re chatting about random stuff.

220,"My sister who is 21 seems to be making choices that can or will put her in potential danger.

Since she was 12 or 13, she's had a cell phone. My parents have never monitored her activity so she basically had free reign of the cell phone's full capabilities. She's always had social media accounts and when I found out she was befriending people she didn't know and talking to people in other parts of the world she didn't know, I told my parents. They did nothing. 

Fast forward to now, she only talks to people and meets people online. She is on her phone 24/7 and is very secretive about it. She has had boyfriends in different countries. She will meet people through reddit or dating sites and within days or weeks go meet them in person. (The ones that are more local). She will be talking to multiple men at a time. It's like a revolving door. These men almost always have some type of mental illness and are super unstable. They seems to become obsessed with her. My dad got concerned enough that after she broke with a boyfriend from Canada, he changed the locks on his house. She doesn't think about the dangers or how unsafe this can be. She's too trusting. She drove to other states without telling my parents to meet these men. One was married. She's just totally reckless and when I try to talk to her about it she's super defensive and shuts down. She doesn't listen to me. Its been happening for so long that I'm sure she won't think anything bad will happen to her. She obviously needs a lot of help and has problems but won't get into therapy.

So I (23F) met these two guys roughly around the same time. Let's name guy 1 ***TOMATO*** (20M) and guy 2 ***POTATO*** (28M). (I met both tomato and potato at place I used to work at.)

Keep this in mind: Potato and I started dating before tomato and I got close.

Tomato and I started out as friends. We would go places together and doing things I enjoyed a lot. I felt so free whenever I hang out with him. His mother was the sweetest thing on earth, just like how her son was. After a couple months, he confessed he liked me but he didn't know I was dating potato. I wanted to remain friends because I didn't want to ruin what we had together. However, when he found out I was with potato, he asked me to choose between him or potato. I ultimately chose potato.

Though Potato and I had a lot of things in common (his birthday was a week before mine, same taste in music, both equally very unemotionally attached at times), I felt like we were two different people despite the similarities. Back then, I made a bunch of excuses as to why I thought I made the right decision. I would tell myself that it was because tomato was too young, or because tomato was just not the right guy. 

I ultimately chose potato because I was so desperate to leave my toxic household behind. Both of my parents are very toxic, and I spent years finding ways to get out of the household. No matter how much I worked and no matter how much money I saved, after paying for my college tuition (I don't get any financial aid or have any scholarships), I never have enough money to pay rent so I just stayed in my parents house. However, when I met potato I felt like that it could be an opportunity for me to finally leave my toxic family. Don't get me wrong, when I first met potato, I did have feelings for him and I did feel like we could make a future together. He talked about wanting to finally settling down and he knew about my family issues. He was willing to let me move in with him and he was willing to pay for all the utilities until I save up enough money to pay everything back to him. As time went by (especially since this pandemic), I started to realize things about potato that I really didn't like. In a way he was starting to turn into my toxic parents. He would have this image of women that he wanted me to live up to. At the end, we never moved in together and we both mutually end things.

So now, I'm all alone, thinking about how I made the wrong choice. Maybe I should've chose tomato instead of potato. I haven't spoken to tomato since the day I chose potato over tomato. I always knew dee down that I made the wrong choice but I was so desperate to leave my parents behind and I felt like dating potato was my only way out. Now, I just thinking about how much fun I had with tomato but gave all that up just for a personal gain. I know I fucked up and I don't know what to do. Should I just give up and move on? Am I being too greedy, hoping that tomato would magically speak to me again? I've never had many friends growing up and with tomato, it felt like I finally had a person who truly understood me and was willing to deal with my bullshit at times. 

TLDR: I fucked up. I chose the wrong guy for a personal gain. But now, I am regretting my decision. What should I do?",28Dec2020,1
227,"This post is referring to my grandfather. I just learned of his death a few minutes ago. My grandmother passed a year ago, I know that she loved me and we were on excellent terms. My paternal grandmother passed, I honestly wasn't as close to her so I wasn't really too upset by that one. But my grandfather, he hated me. I know this for a fact. We have similar personalities so we clashed a lot. Honestly he was just an angry man and didn't like many of his grandchildren, but I feel there was a special hatred for me. We got into a pretty big fight a few months ago where it ended in him leaving. Neither of us ever apologized to each other. But we never really fought again after that. We were civil about it. But the tension was still there. He suddenly went into a coma and just didn't come out of it. It's still fresh so I'm kind of numb to it at the moment but I'm not sure how to handle this.  TIA",28Dec2020,1

229,"I wish I could be friends with more people, but it seems like people don't like me no matter what I do. And I'll admit, I used to be an idiot until I realized it and tried to change. I no longer yell at people and try to help my classmates when I can. My school is small so I always have the same classmates every year, and even though it's been five years, most people still think the same about me. I was able to make two friends along the way, but one of them has moved to another country and the other one is planning to move as well.

A few months ago, me and my friend tried getting along with some people outside of school. They seem to like her a lot but two of them refuse to talk to me and I don't know why. They are also being mean to me, telling me to leave call and refuse to talk if I don't leave, which forces me to because other people are waiting. They are also calling me names and sometimes comparing me to someone they don't like whenever I disagree with something they say.

I try to get along with them but they refuse to. And it would be really hard for me to leave them, because my friend is really close to them and calls with them a lot. My other friend isn't online often. I feel so lonely and don't know what to do. I can't get along with my classmates or anyone else that I meet. How can I be more likable to people? I share some interests with a few people I know but I don't know how to reach out to them. It always feels so awkward.",28Dec2020,1
230,My sister is a habitual liar. It's been okay the past few months so I've  been able to overlook things but a situation just happened (not going to go into detail because that's not relevant) where she blatantly just lied to my face. I was very irritated and disappointed with her but I chose to not call her out in order to not cause a fight. Right now I'm  just... enraged. Insulted too. I'm so sick and tired of having her lie to my face as if I'm some type of idiot. What can I do in the future to not get so mad when I'm lied to like this?,28Dec2020,1
231,"**In the past we both had issues where we donated money to female twitch streamers to try to get them to like us.**

I donated 10-20s mostly and very rarely, over 100. He would donated hundreds often and sometimes thousands.

We both got f'ed over in different ways. But he got scammed out of several thousand by a specific streamer.

**After some counseling and learning, we both agreed not to spend much more on female streamers in desperate attempts to win their affection.**

We unfollowed a ton of streamers and tried to focus on ourselves. And to the streamers we kept following we agreed that our donations would not surpass 5$ and also kept in our minds that we shouldn't donate to try to win their affection.

Fast forward to xmas. I haven't donated any money to any streamers. I've continued to sub to my favourite 3 streamers but that is it. **And he claimed that he basically did the same.**

3 days before Xmas Eve I decided to check in on him and put his username into a site that tracks who the person follows. 

**He was following countless female streamers again. And I went through his follows and caught him in a live stream donating hundreds and gifting massive numbers of subs to a girl streamer again.**

He would be donating a ton and complimenting her, gifting her subs and offering her almost anything she wanted. Within 10 minutes his spendings had surpassed 1000$ by my estimates, it was insane. He was back to his old ways.

I confronted him about it in person after work the day after and he got extremely angry at me for ""stalking him"" and that he made enough money anyways.

**He insisted that he wasn't trying to buy love and that he had it under control, but after reading his donation messages it was basically flirting**

I'm not sure what to do anymore. He refuses to respond to my texts or calls. When I told his family he blew up at me for barging into his business and told us to leave him alone (he lives separately from them). Neither us or the therapist can reach him anymore and according to his family, any time they tried to meet him in person he would straight up ignore them and shut the door on them.

232,So a few months ago I started a part time job at a local hospital and I truly love it.

The point I’m getting at is sometimes I just don’t wanna fucking talk, I don’t wanna tell people what I’m doing unless it concerns them. I don’t like letting people know my business, my parents included. Unless I’m going out, but even then get bombarded with “who are you going with? What are you gonna do?” Etc etc

 I live in a small town in India. About one and half years ago my father started to feel numbness in his right limb. When our local doctors failed to treat him we took him to a big hospital in Delhi where he was diagnosed with ALS.
Doctors gave him 2-3 years of life expectancy based on the progression speed of the disease.

My parents are not very educated and don't know English so all the test and medical reports made no sense to them. When they asked me what the doctors told me, I lied to my father and I told him that he is going to be okay. 

But now somehow my father has realized that I was not telling the truth. He told me that he knows that he won't be around me after a while, that he knows that his time has come and he wants to know the truth.

- mucinex
- Hot shower (did help with nasal blockage)
- Humidifier
- Sleeping sitting up
- Tons of liquid
- Tons of hot liquid

243,"Hi. I’m sorry if this is not the right subreddit to talk about these things but I was just wondering about something. 

About a year ago, I was in something that I would consider manipulative or maybe even abusive with someone. I was only about 19 at the time and this person was at in there late 30s-early 40s. I met them at my job. I feel like I should have known it wouldn’t do me good from the jump with him being so much older then me but I was in a tough place at that time. 

They he wanted to take me out once and I agreed but I canceled at the last minute because something came up. They didn’t talk to me for a month or two, then ended up texting me again. Thinking back on it, I think it’s a pattern. 

I ended up somehow agreeing to help them pay some bills that they had and even help with their car. I thought I was helping, until it got to the point of where they were monitoring my checks and the balance on my card. It got so bad that I couldn’t afford to pay for my own car and it got taken and I had to rely on them since things with my mom wasn’t the best. I should have known something wasn’t right when they wouldn’t let me have control over my own money, but I guess I just didn’t think much of it. They would always get mad at me when I spent money, claiming I was “wasting it” on buying food for myself, or getting a Lyft/Uber to and from school and work. One time they left me stranded at school because they “couldn’t keep traveling back and forth” and I had to sneak and get a Lyft home. 

I’m thinking back on it now, but they recently popped up in my again. They were gone for a year before they popped up a few months back and they left again after I wouldn’t meet up with them and now they are back. They keep saying how they miss me and want to be in my life again but I’m no idiot. I’m not falling for it. They keep suggesting I leave the past in the past and “move forward” with them but I’m not doing that. They always talk about what I did wrong and only vaguely apologize for what they did before saying I should “move on from it” and “leave the past in past”

247,"Long post alert :

Okay, I'm a 25 Yr old Indian guy. I met my girl while I was prepping for an entrance exam for higher studies and we used to spend the entire day together, reading for almost 6 to 7 months and things developed between us. Then I got into a college and she didn't. Though we were far from each other, we grew close. Lot of night calls, video calls everything. We were together till this September. I had plans to marry her, I had told my mother. She has exams on Jan 2021 so she decided to not tell her family until her exams are over and I was okay with that.

Let me say, I have done a lot of mistakes, I used to be like very physical on phone, sometimes talk dirty, though initially she wasn't into it, she was okay with it and didn't say NO. I never pressured her into anything, I was not able to control the feelings I had for her. A few weeks before we broke up in September, she used to say stuff like I cannot see anybody else in your place and shit like that. Due to many reasons we broke up, one of the main reasons being that she is Christian and I'm not. I was somewhat okay with that because I understand that some relationships won't work. Anyway we decided to stay good friends and I used to help her with studies, console her when she had a bad day, she would listen to all hardships I face here in college. Everything was fine.
Fast forward to  a month back she decided to marry this another dude who is also someone involved in the film industry. They are marrying today and I really can't take it.
I feel heartbroken on the fact that I'm still not able to even look at another girl and she is already marrying this dude and that too whole heartedly, not due to any familial pressure or shit like that. I am sad at the fact that she didnt even tell her parents about me while I turned down all arranged marriage proposals I received and waited for her. I'm sad at the fact that I am not able to block her contact and move on because she told me that I'm her best friend and she told me she doesn't want to lose me. I don't want to hurt her by not talking to her but I'm hurting her by saying hurtful things when I talk to her. And I'm hurting myself everything I see her pictures with this other guy.

I was with her when she was at her worst, frustrated about her studies, when she needed a shoulder to lean on, I was there and ofcourse she was there for me. She is also somewhat my bestfriend and she knows more about me than anybody else.

I don't want to lose her friendship, I don't want to hurt her, but I also don't want to get hurt myself. What do I do now? Anybody had any experience like this? Any advice is welcome. I'm devastated here. I wish her a happy married life though with a lot of tears in my eyes.",28Dec2020,1

251," TLDR at bottom.

I'm about to graduate university with a first class honours in digital forensics (a branch of Computer Science with less coding).
In the long term I love to help people, and have rather strong ideals about the fact that we should be working together as humans to solve major issues (pollution, starvation, space travel, corruption, etc).

I've recently started applying for things to do immediately after uni and have started running into a consistent problem: everyone is shit.

First I started looking at charities - but every one I looked into had major issues with funneling money to their upper management or had accusations of doing things that went directly against their mission statement.

Then I looked at government agencies - being in digital forensics I naturally gravitated towards international crime prevention, but it turns out that government agencies and militaries have a very strong tenancy to bomb civilians and spy on their own citizens.

Naturally private companies didn't tend to fair much better than the previous 2.

Academia has been the only field where I can see a potential impact, although that's based on being able to fund and steer my own research - plus digital forensics research doesn't lend itself to solving global issues.

Of course my last option would be to take up personal self-funded projects, though I don't think I have the skills to do many of these alone. I'm currently falling very fast towards my backup plan of becoming a teacher, with the hopes of raising a better generation.

Pay won't be an issue as long as I can survive off it. There's got to be something bigger I can do with my life - I'm not expecting anyone to list an unproblematic company who's morals line up perfectly with mine, although someone pointing me in a positive direction might go a long way.

TLDR; I have a digital forensics degree, I want to change the word, but every organisation I look into working for has bad practices.",28Dec2020,1

TDLR: ive been with my boyfriend for 3 years and it has always been toxic and abusive. at this point i can’t go on any longer having no happiness and constantly crying. i want to leave but do not want to leave my cat in his hands as im afraid he is very unfit to care for her without me. my grandparents got us the home we currently live in and they will feel betrayed and have a damaged reputation if him and his roommate do not take care of and clean the home if im no longer there.",28Dec2020,1
255,"When I was four years old, (now 16F) my parents recently got divorced. And my father hadn't yet lost custody.  During this point in time, I was, for whatever reason, staying at his house with his new wife and her adult children. I remember one day my father had left for work for the day. So my step mother, loaded me and a random baby into a car. (She was a baby sitter) When I had asked her where we were going, she only stated ""the doctor"". And being only a small child, I was okay with it. When we arrived, it didn't look like a doctors office, it was an old brick building. we walked up a few flights of stairs, and into a random room. In the room was a young to middle aged man, he was tan with black hair, and was wearing a lab coat. But I found it strange, the room didn't look like a doctors office, it was an old, brick room, with a metal table near the door, and a few plastic trolleys. I remember my stepmother and this man having a few words about something. Then this random man picked me up and placed me on the table. I was confused but didn't do anything about it. Then I was made to lay flat on the table and held down by my step mother. Then this man pulls a syringe out, but it didn't have a needle or anything. Then, he puts it on my leg, and starts sucking. Now, to a four year old with no pain tolerance, this hurt quite a lot. He did this a few time on my legs and then on my arms. After, I was sobbing and in hysterics. That day when my father came home, I tried to tell him, but my stepmother convinced him I was making this all up. When I went back to my mother I had given up trying to tell anyone about this. Shortly after he lost all rights and we moved. 

So, my question is, what the hecc happened? I know this is a rather obscure question, but if any one knows what this is, please tell me. I've been racking my brain for years now. Please and thank you.",28Dec2020,1
256,"i know the obvious question to my post is “okay, well if you hate him, why don’t you leave?” but it’s so much more complex than that. my boyfriend and i have been together for 3 years and it has literally always been shitty. as im typing this i realize what an idiot i am for even staying for this long. but, basically. at this point now, i live with him and his roommate. and we have a cat together. our relationship is extremely toxic and emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive. i hate him. 

he forces me to have sex with him which last week actually made me have to go to the ER bc he had such force that a cyst ruptured in my ovary and i had such bad abdominal pain so i drove myself to the ER. he doesn’t respect me and my wishes or boundaries in the relationship. he never cooks or cleans. all his social media is filled with explicit pictures and nude women. he cares more about video games and porn than our relationship. he has made millions of empty promises to change and i have yet to see improvement. 

he continues to smoke weed when we made a “promise” to quit, in which ive been clean over 9 months and he “secretly” continues to smoke. he pisses me off everyday. we constantly scream at each other. i cry myself to sleep almost every day because of him. and ive completely lost myself by being overcome by anger and depression because of him. 

the complex part of this is that the home he is renting was made through connections with my grandparents and that i do not want to leave my cat, she is the only thing that brings me joy in this world. and if you too have pets you understand they are like your children/family. if i were to leave, i would be unable to bring her with me as i currently live with my grandparents while i finish up nursing school and they hate pets. im afraid he will not take care of her, clean her litter box, notice if she is sick, feed and water her, and she will be home alone all day while works 12 hour shifts. also, him and his roommate would let the house turn to absolute shit because they never clean up after themselves and im afraid they would damage something and it would come back on my grandparents. 

i truly cannot stand him or this relationship any longer but i just can’t seem to leave for those reasons. my cat and my family: 1. being that it was just Christmas and they gave him several gifts 2. my parents have purchased stuff for our home and would want those things back as I’m no longer living in it and 3. if they turn that place into a pig stye it will come back on me for pulling them to help us get the place. i am truly lost at what to do and just need help. please no hate as i understand how simple this situation may sound: leave and forget the cat. but it’s so much more difficult than that. 

TDLR: ive been with my boyfriend for 3 years and it has always been toxic and abusive. at this point i can’t go on any longer having no happiness and constantly crying. i want to leave but do not want to leave my cat in his hands as im afraid he is very unfit to care for her without me. my grandparents got us the home we currently live in and they will feel betrayed and have a damaged reputation if him and his roommate do not take care of and clean the home if im no longer there.",28Dec2020,1
258,"I met this guy on a dating app. Due to the pandemic as well as distance (he lives two states away) our “dates” have been strictly virtual. He’s nice, and we share similar opinions on things like religion and politics. Right away though, I noticed I didn’t really feel any connection with him. The problem is, I’m not overly experienced with dating, and I know that I sometimes have a tendency to get overwhelmed and panic easily in situations that are new or somewhat unfamiliar. Because of that, I’m not sure if the reason I’m not into this guy is because I have psyched myself out, or if I’m just genuinely not interested. There are a couple of small things he’s done that have kind of been red flags, but I don’t know if they’re enough to necessarily write him off already. At this point, I’m just trying to decide if it’s worth investing time into a third date or if I should move on.",28Dec2020,1
259,"New on Reddit, so bear with me! 

Bit of a backstory, but I (22M) grew up in a single-parent home as an only child. My mother and I were very close, and had an incredible relationship. She even flew to Europe to visit me while I was studying abroad, and we had a blast!

That was in April 2019. Fast forward to July 2019, and she passes away very suddenly and unexpectedly. My world was obviously shattered that day, and I haven’t really been the same since. I never knew my father, though relatives have now told me who he is. I don’t plan to reach out. I have other family, who all love me dearly, and it’s mutual! But my question is for anyone who has been in, or known someone in similar circumstances.

261,"I got a 2013 Subaru Impreza in the 160k miles on it. It sounds like an airplane when it drives it’s so loud. It rattles like crazy and doesn’t seem safe 

However when I did car shopping I was thoroughly unimpressed with every car that was on the market. My requirements are pretty simple: cheap, reliable, can drive in heavy snow, small, and (if I can get it) either electric or plug-in hybrid. 

The only ones that seemed even remotely close were the Subaru cross trek, which kinda sucks because it’s waaaaay too big for my tastes (I really don’t like the way it looks), or the Tesla, which is very expensive for all wheel drive (roughly 40k). Things like Toyota Camry and Honda civics are unlikely to handle well in snow, but if they did have decent awd, would be more than good enough. I didn’t really see awd on any of the hybrid models 

I’ve looked at used inventory but haven’t seen a lot of promising stuff. Everything’s been low in stock due to covid

262,"A few days ago, I learned that my (ex) best friend is dating my ex boyfriend.
The reason why she’s no longer my best friend was because I found out that she was simping over my Ex boyfriend (while knowing that I still loved him) and talking shit about me in his dms to gain a leverage. And I really didn’t appreciate it bc while I was still with him, whenever something happens between us, and even after we broke up. I told her everything. Only bc she said I shouldn’t keep shit inside (I was that type of person who would never open up about my personal life to anyone) and that she would always be there for me. Welp, it was a lie, she only the used everything that I told her as a way to get to my ex. Ever since I confronted her about that, she has been spreading lies about me to all my friends. But fortunately I was able to expose her lies and ultimately made her look bad, all her friends hate her now, etc etc etc, idc. 

A few weeks later I learned that they started dating. I feel like I know what to do. I feel like I should just turn the corner and try not to even care one bit about this, since clearly those two never don’t love or care about me. But I’m scared I’m gonna do something terrible. Like some home wrecker type shit. And I don’t wanna do that, and I know I shouldn’t do that, but I just know what to do anymore.

264,"First of all I want to change. I live in a normal part of Sweden although its the tightest drug populated city. We in Sweden take in a lot of immigrants from the middle east and imo they're one of the trickiest type of people to integrate into a new country or culture. Their culture is very close to their heart and they're very stubborn to change their ways. For example honor culture. It has no purpose here yet they bring it anyways. Since the huge waves of immigration began during my life there has been one terrorist attack in our capital which was planned to go a lot further. . One near my home town with a car and a bomb, thankfully was stopped. They have taken priority over our old people in terms of money and they seem to think they're entitled to it. They dislike Swedish culture and think they are superior. I can't help but generalise every middle eastern person to dislikable people unless they show me otherwise. I've been jumped by a whole group of dudes and mugged for no reason. They were Albanian.
I want them out if they're not contributing to our society and just being a pest to our country.

265,"So I'm avery driven 16 year old. I graduated high school two years early and just completed my first semester as a full time pre-nursing student. My goal is to get my doctorate in nursing.

Here's me problem: I love studying, but I also don't want future me to be pissed that I didn't take a break when I could. I especially love studying now though because of covid. I can just go into a study hole and enjoy learning and working towards my goals. If I take a break, I'll have time to relax, but it's not like I can really do much both because I'm under 18 and because of covid. I wouldn't want to waste my break away by doing nothing at all. I could finish my book and devote more time to my puppy I suppose.

People think I should take a break because I struggle with depression. School doesn't make depression worse, but it does tend to be more difficult with it, if that makes sense. I explain it like this: doing school with depression is like pushing a car through a beautiful area; more exhausting than it should be, but still beautiful and worth it.

266,"I've gotten into making doodling around two years back. I may not be skilled, but it's something that I genuinely enjoy.

Considering the part that I'm not very skilled yet, I'm very hesitant to show to others, unless it's to my friends who I look up to. I'm very happy whenever I receive feedback advice on how to do a certain part like coloring and lineworking.

My mom occasionally looks at my works, which gives me a mild chill whenever she does. She takes a look, and then gives me supportive comments. Part of me wanted to thank her, but a larger part of me was still really uncomfortable, so I just smile.

A couple months back, mom found one of my paper sketches while cleaning my room. She then takes her phone and tries to take a photo of them. I jumped outta bed to get that piece of paper. She wanted to post it because ""it was good"".

Now this turned into me repeatedly saying ""No"" over and over and explaining how it's not something I'm proud of, and I'd get embarrassed since that would mean everybody would know I'm into art. Eventually she gave up and left the papers alone.

Fast forward a few months and she wanted to see what I've been making digitally. I didn't want to, but I still showed her my proud works. She then asked to send her the photos so she can share them to my aunt, an artist I looked up to. The repeated no's started again, and the same thing happened, I was left alone.

Now yesterday, Mom decided to walk into my room while I was drawing fanart. My heart palpitated, and I close the reference image I was using.

She then asks me who I'm drawing, I refuse to answer. Another set of repeated no's. I even asked why.

She started getting mad and was taking what I was holding by force. I listened to screams of ""Because I'm still your mother, I still have the rights to know what you're into! You can be interested in whatever you like, but this is a boundary I'm setting."" and ""Are you hiding something from me?""

I started to think that what she said was right. Then she started counting to 10 and threatened to get my devices. I open up the reference photo for the character I was drawing, show it for 10 seconds, and close.

Not being satisfied, mom grabs the tablet again, but instead of the reference photo, she instead checks on my Reddit page and the chats I've been having with my friends.

It was over, and she leaves. It left me in confusion.

Was I in the wrong, being overprotective of my art and my interests? Should I have just shown it in the beginning so all of that was avoided?",28Dec2020,1

268,"So I guess I have to preface this. I’m a sophomore in college. And like many people in college this past semester I struggled a lot with school, my grades, and mental health in general. So for my degree path sophomore year is when you declare and apply for your major and there is a minimum technical gpa requirement for each major. With how my semester went I don’t meet that requirement. As most students are I’m taking on a substantial amount of debt to be at my dream school studying my dream major. I moved halfway across the country completely away from any of my family and friends. At college my freshmen year I was taking 18 credits  and struggled to find the balance between being social and studying so I never really got out to meet anyone and make friends. I also left my girl friend of 3 years at the time behind when I went off to school. The first year away we were really able to stay close and doing the distance thing looked promising. We had little squabbles here and there but never anything that seemed like we couldn’t over come. During this time we really began to consider a serious life together after college. We started talking about marriage and kids and family and we wanted to live. We were very serious about each other and young but neither of us had felt this way about anyone before. I’m not really close to my immediate family and I’m not really close with my parents. Not to say our relationship isn’t good but I’m not really comfortable telling them anything about my life and vice versa. So I guess going into this semester, before I had left to go back across the country and start school we sat down and talked decided that an open relationship would put less stress on our relationship. We wouldn’t have the constant pressures of feeling like we had to be with each other every moment and we could go out and find people. Very quickly we both realized this was a mistake and half back tracked on that plan. We both still had tinder downloaded trying to meet other people but neither of us could ever follow through. We began to talk about marriage again how after this year we were halfway done with college and could start our lives. Her school went online at one point and we seriously considered moving her across the country to live with me. I even asked my roommates if they would be okay with it and we had a date and everything but decided against it last minute because she didn’t want to be away from her family during Covid. She began struggling a lot with her mental health during the semester. Started drinking away her problems and I’d get phone calls late at night with her crying and balling her eyes out completely drunk and on the floor saying how she wanted to drop out of college and it wasn’t for her and how she just needed me there with her and she couldn’t do it alone. It got so bad she went home for a whole week and didn’t attend any of her classes. I was worried sick. She stopped taking her depression medicine and anxiety medicine and would lay in bed all day and I would call her worried sick. Right around this time too my mental health started going down hill too. I started pushing all my friends away. I stopped talking to my parents and family. I started pushing my girl friend away. She never let me fully push her away though. She would always demand I call her and text her and check in on her. I never really shared my full mental health with her but she was the only person I told that wasn’t doing well in school and I never told her the full extent of it all. I really started to become over whelmed with everything. I started lying to her about things. She’d ask why wouldn’t text her until 4 in the afternoon and I’d just say I was just busy with classes. I told her I was still going to class and everything and I really wasn’t. I began cheating on all my hw assignments and blowing them off. She really just thought i very busy with school not knowing anything about what was going on with me. So it starts getting closer to Christmas and she starts asking if I’m coming home and I didn’t want to go home and see my family and I wasn’t comfortable flying home to see my family because my mom is taking care of my dying grandmother in our house and I would never forgive myself if I brought something into the house that would harm her further. I’d ask her to fly out to me almost everyday to see me over break but she felt she couldn’t without having an anxiety attack. So we were preparing to not see eachother until my spring break in April. Finals started rolling around and my anxiety and depression just got worse. It’s started setting in that there was no way I was going to be able to pass some of my classes so I started distancing myself further and she would ask what was wrong and I’d tell her just swamped with school. And I’d get mad that she was being “clingy” and started really being not a good boyfriend or a friendly guy to her. I guess a week ago after my first final I called her mid anxiety attack at 5 am and asked like hey are we still planning on having a life together and she was like of course what are you talking about you need to go to bed and did this for like 3 nights straight just stressing myself about school and life and her and then calling her at 5 am. I guess on the 19th I had my second to last final and I didn’t feel like I did all that well and right after I got right back to studying and she called just trying to do anything to cheer me up. It was the happiest id seen her in awhile. I blew her off to study because I had my next final in two days. I feel so stupid for that. This is what really kills me the most. I just really took it for granted. Um a day later I guess the day before my last final my dad said he was able to come drive out and get me and move my grandmother in with my aunt for the holidays so I could come home and I was so happy that I could come back and see her. I texted her immediately and she seemed at the time but looking back on it she wasn’t as thrilled as I was. That night she went out with two of her guy coworkers and they bought her alcohol and got her drunk and the one started taking advantage of her. Trying to get her to kiss him and started like putting his hand around her neck. And she said the other one actually gave her butterflies and treated her so nice. So I had the worst anxiety attack up to that point in my life and I told her to fuck off. I had only ever cursed at her once before in my life and she says that’s the one thing she can’t really handle. So she went to bed drunk and upset and stayed awake all night over thinking everything. She woke up the next morning and I’m still awake and pissed off and not really in a good place mentally and we started arguing about how she shouldn’t be drinking with her medication and then she already knew this guy was bad news why’d she go out with him and drink. And I was really supportive at all. I went to bed that morning in the middle of that fight at 8 am with my final being at 5pm woke up at 4pm to a text saying that she needs space we need to stop everything sexual and all the i love you’d and she needs time to think. And that’s really just when everything I’ve done these past two months hit me and hit me hard. Immediately I called her and started apologizing for everything I was in full panic attack mode and have been since. I took my final an hour later and I swear it was a miracle I was even able to half focus on it. But so I made the drive back to her and it’s now Christmas Eve and I text her hey I know you’ve been thinking a lot do you haven’t anything you have to say or any questions and she basically said she just wants to be friends now. I’ve been crying everyday since. I’m someone who hasn’t cried in 6 years I’ve cried multiple times a day now for almost a week. I can’t eat right. I can’t sleep right. I have no one. I feel was able to come to terms with my mental. The terms are they aren’t good. And over the past two days I’ve just started telling her in how terrible of a place I am and apologizing and telling her I know I’m not the guy she fell in love with. Now I just feel bad telling her anything about my mental health because I feel she just takes it as me trying to guilt her back into a relationship. But I have no one else to talk to. I pushed everyone in my life. I’m not really in a stable place. And the only person I feel comfortable with is telling her. And it’s basically me saying I need help and idk what to do. I’m crying for help with her and it’s not fair to put her in that position. So now I’m here. Asking where do I even start. I lose my health insurance at the end of the year and don’t have money for therapy out of pocket.  I’m 100,000 dollars in debt because of college. Everything I’ve been planning my life to be for the last two years disappeared over the course of two weeks. I lost my best friend and lover. All my other friends are at an arms length. I have no idea what to do about anything. All advice is welcome about any aspect of anything I said above. Whether it be school, mental health, or my relationships.",28Dec2020,1
269,"It's been a year since I got broken up with by the woman I loved more than any woman I had ever loved in my whole life. She broke it off last January. I'm not young either (32M) so this isn't just some university whining post.

I literally had to stop listening to some of my favourite music artists, watching some of my favourite shows and movies, and even had to stop liking my favourite video game series that I liked before I met her because we started seeing eachother because of our similar interests. 

We never had a single argument. We didn't disagree on anything major I could tell. Neither of us wanted kids and we both had a similar idea for what we wanted out of a humble future some day. Which is when it came out of the blue that she was done I was literally not able to make heads or tails of it. The explanation she gave was that she wanted to explore her sexuality with lots of partners. So for clarification I asked if she was a lesbian. She said no she just wanted to go explore with other partners in general.

Now I have mostly good days and occasional bad ones. But I've had a lot of time to reflect and think on what I want since it happened. The truth is that I never want to feel the same way I have felt for the past year again. It's not worth it. I had a hard enough time convincing myself to date even before her because I just never liked the whole process. Then this shit happened. I regret ever having met her. Fuck personal growth. Fuck ""getting stronger."" Fuck ""everything happens for a reason."" I don't care about other fish in the sea. I would rather go on a seaweed diet thanks.

So I want advice on how to become apathetic, cold, distant, and unapproachable in the romantic sense. I never want to allow myself to feel that way again about anyone. Please no do-gooder posts. I'm not going to therapy. I don't want to become a ""better person"" after this. I want the darkness to win. I want to become a bitter misanthropic curmudgeon and make myself repulsive to anyone who would ever be interested in anything beyond a platonic friendship with me. How can I do this?",28Dec2020,1
270,"So, me and my friend have been pretty close for 2 years or so. We used to talk everyday and never fight, but he’s been acting..odd? 

For example, he will only text me when he wants something from me or when he’s excited about something. I always respond to him and match his energy. The second he loses interest, he leaves me on open. 

When I asked him why he keeps doing that, he just said, “I had nothing to add, so I didn’t respond. Isn’t that how conversations work?” Imagine someone coming up to you and talking about something, and as soon as you give them your input, they walk away. Wtf? 

Idk maybe I’m overreacting and I’m letting my anxiety get the best of me. 

Another thing is any time I message him about something that **I’m** excited about, he will either respond with “ok” or not even respond at all. It’s like he only wants to talk about himself, or nothing at all. 

Whenever I get mad and decide to do the same thing he does, he gets super pissed at me and yells at me. Like dude, you’re doing the same exact thing. I am a super patient person and I have never yelled at him, nor do I think I ever will, but after months of this, I am starting to get a little pissed off. 

Whenever we are in PlayStation parties together, he is fun and normal one minute, and the next minute he mutes me and doesn’t talk to me for a week. 

I just don’t know what to do, non of my other good friends are like this. He calls me annoying and regularly makes fun of me. I don’t wanna be that person that gets upset over jokes like that, but it really hurts. 

I know I’m obviously overreacting, and everytime he says “Stop. You’re being annoying. I’m muting you.” It actually makes me cry. I feel like a sensitive bitch. 

He doesn’t act this way towards anyone else in my friend group either, it’s just me. Should I stop talking to him? I’m feeling really lost",28Dec2020,1
272,"This is kind of long, so here’s a tldr: 

I tell a lot of white lies, and because of that, I’m starting to think of bigger lies to help make it easier for me to justify my decisions and make them without people being able to argue with me about them. For whatever reason, I never feel as if my rational for decisions is good enough. How can I start to fix that behavior and grow to be more self assured in making decisions and telling others about them?

Long version:

I think everyone who knows me will say I’m a bad liar, since I end up giggling like a maniac and can’t hold a straight face after bluntly telling a lie. Nobody wants to play bluffing games with me, that’s for sure.
What I find interesting though, is that nobody catches all the tiny white lies I seem to pathologically roll off my tongue.

I’ve stopped noticing it, honestly. I’m almost certain that I tell a white lie every day. Little exaggerations of how my day went to make my friends laugh, small falsities to justify why I didn’t do my schoolwork, and stuff like that. 

For whatever reason, I feel like I always need to justify what I say. As if I need a “valid” reason to have any complaint or ask for anything. So I turn to these little lies. 

If I’m losing you, I don’t blame you, so maybe an example will get my point across. I recently did some introspective work and came to the conclusion that the current sports location in which I ride horses with my teammates is no longer suitable for me. I feel as if I’m regressing, and I no longer want to work with that trainer. Lucky for me, I found another place that already seems more promising. The next step for me to take is let my trainer and teammates know that I will be leaving the location only. I will still be a part of the team, just riding elsewhere. It should be so simple. All I need to say is “I feel as if I’d be better suited elsewhere, see you at competitions” and call it there. 

But, my head keeps telling me that I need a better reason than “I don’t feel right here”. That I need an “actual” reason to leave. I’m so awful I even thought up a whole scenario involving lying about a traumatic incident to justify me leaving. After all, none of my teammates would be mad at me for leaving if I said I was afraid to ride there due to trauma. It’s just so scary because that seems like the easier way out for some reason: to lie about something that should never be taken lightly just because no one would argue with it. I’ve, of course, resolved myself to not using that idea, but I hate that it ever crossed my mind. 

So, in my desperate attempts to stop this thought process I turn anonymously to the internet. I beg of someone to help me: how do I stop this behavior? How do I convince myself that my rational for my decisions are enough of a reason, and that I don’t need to exaggerate or lie in order to get other people to understand? 

Is it truly okay for me to make a decision and back it up with “because I said so”?",28Dec2020,1
273,"I have a partner that I’ve been with for almost two years now. Ultimately, it’s not that long a time to be with someone, so I’d expect there to be some level of growth to be done as a whole and individually as we’re both still young. 

That said, earlier this year they split up with me. It was sudden and painfully indifferent, they came back after about a month or so and I accepted to revisit our relationship but I’m worried that my body won’t allow it. 

I identify as a demisexual, especially sex is painful and nearly impossible for me whenever I am unable to connect emotionally. When we got back together I wanted us to go back to normal so desperately that I forced myself pretty often, to my physical limit. 

Now that the reality of it has set in I realize that his affection, or rather, lack thereof tenderness in it has created a resentment. The breakup and in deference have sown a seed of distrust and my body has physically shut down. Even to the point of being adverse to their kisses or sexual advances. 

I’ve decided to leave once I can afford to but I’m having a hard time heading from what feels like a defensive numbness. I have a hard time even arousing myself now, an issue I’ve never had in the past. In fact, I’ve always been very in tune with my body in a healthy way.

I’m more worried about answering technical questions since I have zero work experience in this field besides my schooling and the description says preferred 2 years with automated conveyors... do you think it’s a waste to try for this career without experience or not?

275,"I (19F) started reading fanfics when I was 11 or 12. I used to read the really sweet boyfriend one shots but then I moved to angst-type fanfics. 

I read so many fanfics of the characters being traumatized— whether it was sexual assault, emotional abuse, physical abuse, etc. I read it all. These were my favorite type of stories to read. 

Flash forward to now, I am in a relationship with a guy (18M) for 6 months. I am unable to kiss him without getting nauseous. I cannot be physically intimate for long without getting anxious that he wants more than cuddling. 

He has never pressured me, he knows that I have had one traumatic experience with another guy. He allows me to call the shots, he has never gotten angry when I say no. He is really sweet, and I trust him in this aspect. 

I think I may have a fear of intimacy. My counselor could not explicitly ’diagnose’ this. However, a i plan to go to therapy soon. I do take antidepressants for social anxiety. 

I fear that I have a warped sense of intimacy due to the content I read growing up. Has anyone experienced this? Or does anyone have an idea on how to navigate the anxiety I have with being intimate?",28Dec2020,1

I’ve always been bi and up until
Recently I started feeling stronger feelings for men. I tried to push them aside and they only got stronger. I talked with her about it. She was supportive and told me she only wanted what’s beat for me so to think about it and decide what I really want. 
Tonight I told her as we were driving back from our family vacation that I wanted to be with a man more than a women. 
She was relieved. She admitted she thought she was doing something wrong and desperately trying to change something about her self that wasn’t even the issue. 
We have come up with a plan to get our bills paid off and move to Dallas or Austin. Well me anyway. She is 100% supportive of it tho. But she was a little upset in the beginning asking why I strung her on if I knew this whole time. But I’m reality I didn’t know. I wanted as much as she did to start a family and settle down. But over time what I jd wasn’t what my dream as a boy growing up was. I wanted to be Adam and Steve not Adam and Eve. And tonight I owned that. It ended great. She was happy for me and happy there wasn’t anything wrong with her. Still have a long road to go I feel like to being fully accepted. Just wanted to share my good news.",28Dec2020,1

278,"So when i was 17M (I'm 19 now)i entered a serious relationship with someone i had met online (we video called daily and really grew quite fond of each other) we did alot together and as someone who was quite scared when it came to trusting people i found comfort in this person, let's call him J.

J and i had a big fight once, mental issues pushed us apart and he ended up leaving me which was ubderstandable, i wasn't doing good mentally as depression was kicking my ass, about a month later he entered a relationship with a new guy lets call that guy A , they dated for about 2 months before splitting off, me and A became really good friends after they broke up and J became really good friend's with my other ex lets call him L , so then J and L were flirting with the idea of dating and A suddenly became really good friends with L , it stayed like this for a while but then one day A asks me out out of nowhere, i tell him i need a day to think and not even 12 hours later he enters a relationship with L which felt like i was some kind of backup? So then J and i start talking again and things go back to us dating and i felt really happy for the first time in a long time, we start building the relationship again but fully avoiding mistakes we made in the past, but then J drops a bit of a bombshell on me, hes going to go visit L in a month, they already arranged a ticket and all that and not wanting to come across as clingy or jealous i allow it but message A telling him I really don't feel comfortable about this situation, they all assure me nothing will happen, so i let it go and J assures me if anything happened he'd fly back (keep in mind he'd never once come to visit me in these two years but is about to go spend a week with a dude he barely knew a year). So that whole week I can't sleep, i don't wanna message him too much because i didn't wanna seem clingy , but didn't want to show disinterest, but knew i was in a relationship with J and A was in one with L . So the week passes and J comes back , we video call and we have a good time , we call for like 8 hours and i Even invite my best friend into the FaceTime, so I write it off as overthinking but 4 days later, i ask J if he had anything to put on the table now would be the time to do it, after that he explodes telling me they hooked up alot and he was so sorry and at that moment my heart broke, i relive that day in my worst nightmares, so i end up calling J with my closest two friends and we ask him what happened, my sadness turns into anger when he acts all humourous on call acting like it wasn't anything trying to gaslight me into believing it wasn't. I end up telling A what happened and have a call with L aswell to hear his side of the story, i end up breaking thing's off with J and he ends up blocking me on everything later telling my friends he didn't want to hurt me anymore, i end up drifting away from A and L feeling like the reason they split.


It's been six months since the day my heart broke into pieces and I can't stop thinking of J , he's all my mind really thinks of and i feel like i genuinely can't love anymore , i just can't get over him , i can't get over how much I loved him, i genuinely don't know if I'll ever feel ""in love"" again much less trust someone.",28Dec2020,1
279,"I am 16, gay, and proud. I came out around age 11 and 12, and have been through my fair share of bullying and such, but that has largely subsided as I have entered high school. But this is not what this post is about. I am a tall, big curly headed, feminine twink. However I am skinny-fat, I have a little bit of a tummy, no noticeable muscle. I have lost a decent bit of weight in the past few months, which I am proud of. However, I do need advice on something. During the start of quarantine, when everything was shutting down, I got on Grindr. Now, I was 15, never been kissed, never had a boyfriend. Earlier that November, I had been pressured by an upperclassman to send nudes, so I had already been desensitized to sex and such. Looking back, I have been the loneliest I had ever been, except for right now. I needed to know I was valid. Now that being said, I definitely grew as a person and certainly became more attractive. I have big curly hair with blonde highlights now, instead of neglected dark hair thrown back into a gross ponytail lol. I met up with one guy in March, and he stuck his tongue down my throat, and we fucked. Losing my virginity was not the big thing for me, so I really did not care. Sex, especially for bottoms, is always painful at first. As Covid started to die down a little bit, over the summer I had ended up meeting with many guys, some of which were triple my age. Some of them knew I was 15, some did not. I ended up talking with many many guys on Grindr as I had it on and off between May-August. I feel absolutely horrible about lying about my age, although most of the guys really just needed to hear me say it. Some of the guys knew I was 15, and liked it. In September, this guy and I started talking, ended up planning a date, he canceled the night before. He said the wrong date in doing so, after he gradually ghosted me, using dumb excuses I knew were bull, I spiraled into this 2 month or so spell of absolutely hating my body. Again, I am skinny fat, always called skinny, but was never that skinny. He was quite skinny, but had some muscle as he was athletic. He later told me around Halloween, after almost 2 months of hating myself, and romanticizing him everyday, that he was never interested in me in the first place. As of now, according to other anecdotes of people, he's a total ass anyways. What I need advice on is, what the fuck should I do now. I have spiraled further into this deep and grave hatred for my body once again, I am not muscular, and seeing all of these mean twinks around me be muscular and hot, is killing me on the inside. I am alos way too nice for this world, and have resulted to forcing my brain to only liking certain body types that society deems 'undesirable' or 'fat.' I am not going to change the fact that I am feminine, the masc4masc guys hurt, but it's more of a what can you do type of thing. I just want to be valid, happy, and hot. I simply cannot be that for some reason",28Dec2020,1
280,"As it stands, my job, which I found to be amazing and cool before has become a drag for me. I used to love my job and the weird hours and the crazy schedule. I got to do some crazy cool stuff. But since Covid all I’ve gotten to do have been the stuff that doesn’t fill me with passion and excitement. I’m stuck cleaning or filing most of the time. And I’m just not feeling the joy anymore. 
Many of my friends and coworkers have left since the pandemic and it’s had several impacts. One was simply that I miss my friends, and the second is that it’s put a strain on the work because we can’t hire new people. So it’s stressing me out and I’m losing the social aspect. I picked up the slack because I was leaving town for quite a while. 
However as I’m poised to return, I’m finding myself feeling how I did when I left. Exhausted. Not excited. I don’t want to go back. My supervisor really pushed me before leaving and I put in a lot of hours. For context that’s 40 hours in 2 week pay periods. And it was exhausting. I was picking up the slack for the coworkers that were out and then even more for those that had to quarantine because of Covid. For more context, I am a sophomore in college. 
I am sick of this and want to quit, but I don’t want to screw over my remaining coworkers.

284,"I just got married in April.  I'm 49 and my husband is 59.  Since September my husband has been saying he wants to leave, that he's happier when he's not around me.  He actually did leave for 3 weeks in September and for 11 days in October, and several times for one or two nights.  He also threatens me with making me sign a separation agreement, and has threatened to put our house up for sale (he owns it).  I have kids from a previous marriage and they live with us so this is their house too.  But he also says he wants us to go to counselling so I'm really confused.  He acts like he can't stand me - doesn't greet me, barely looks at me when I talk, walks away when I'm talking.  Leaves rooms I come into.  Makes food for himself and doesn't ask if I want any.  Takes food down to our room if I'm in the dining area.  Never acknowledges anything I do and never thanks me.  Never pays me a compliment.  Ignores me if I make a general comment.  Never asks me anything or takes any interest in my life.  Told his family not to give me and my kids anything for Christmas.  

I don't know what to do.  I feel sad so much of the time but I'm trying not to let it show.  I tried to talk to him about this for a couple months and despite him saying he wants us to stay married it just got worse so now I'm trying to ignore it and just do my own thing.  But his energy is so negative and hateful.  Sometimes I cry, and sometimes I start crying in public.  I told my 15 year-old son I think I may have made a mistake marrying this guy and that I was so sorry, and my son started crying because he felt so bad for me.  My kids had to move from their neighbourhood and switch schools.  I want stability for them - I told them this was permanent.  

When he's home my husband spends most of the day lying on his bed reading or just lying there.  I don't think he's depressed because he acts normal around his family and co-workers.  

How should I handle this?  If this is how it's going to be I don't want the rest of my life to be like this.  My 13 year-old daughter just told me she thought I was happier when I was single.  I was so happy when I met him and when we were dating.  He has completely changed and is nothing at all like he was when we were dating.  Please I need some advice.  Thank you.",28Dec2020,1

289,"I'm looking for advice on what I can do to move on from a breakup with my ex who is a \[20M\] Latino. It's a very long story but basically, I was in a long-distance relationship with him for almost a year now. During the time, my mom was super toxic and she kept insulting our relationship, saying that I shouldn't be dating Hispanic people because they are bad and they don't have a life. She also criticized how my ex was in the army and he could never have a real future with me. The problem was, my mom put me on such a high pedestal ever since I earned a full-ride scholarship to an Ivy League university in the U.S and she thought it would be best if I would be with someone who is on my level. I understand that she wants me to have a good, prosperous life with someone who can fully support me financially and emotionally, but my mom took it too far when she started to insult my character. At one point, she suggested I was a prostitute. Anyway, my ex knew everything she was saying and he didn't like that my mom hated him so much. He tried his best to support me despite the fact that I could never see him until the next year. And so, I spent the last year being emotionally abused because I truly loved him and I believed he was worth fighting for. However, a couple of weeks ago, my mom sabotaged me into thinking that I could see him again during Christmas week. After spending a couple of hours with him (my mom only allowed me a very short amount of time for me to see him), I went back home and my mom did a whole 180 on me and said that she didn't like the way I ""lived my life."" She kept saying that we are Nigerians and so I needed to act like a Nigerian. You can probably guess that we had a fight after that. A couple of days later, I decided that enough was enough and I needed to go to spend the rest of my Christmas break back in college because my mom would never leave me alone. Emotions were running high but I texted my ex and told him that maybe it was best if we broke up. I think it's important to note that during the time that we were dating, we broke up many times but we always came back together. I kinda thought this was going to happen but instead he agreed and said it was for the best. When I finally to my dorm, I kept thinking about our relationship. I decided that my last resort was to try again one last time with him. I did this because I believed in us having a chance together. A future where we can truly be happy. I gave him my all and so I wanted so badly to be in his arms again. Even not talking to him for an entire day was so painful and I couldn't bear the thought of never talking to him again. And so, I texted him and I told him how I felt. I said that if you don't want us to be back together, I don't want to be friends with you because the pain would be too much knowing that you aren't really mine anymore. He again said no that he doesn't want us to be together because he didn't like the fact that we were in a long-distance relationship. I got so angry at him because before he left for a different country for the year, he told me that he was fine with being in a long-distance relationship for some time because he loved me. I thought we had a serious discussion about this and even I said I was fine with long distance too. I knew the challenges ahead of us but I was still willing to try. Now, he decided that he didn't even like the long distance relationship. I asked him why the hell he is now telling me this and not in the beginning. If he truly cared about me, then he wouldn't have NEVER started dating me knowing that he can't commit to me. I feel betrayed, angry, and hurt because I invested so much into this person that I love and this entire time he didn't feel the same way based on his actions. My mind started to go into overdrive as I thought about the red flags and how I ignored them because I was okay with his flaws. I knew that he wasn't perfect but I still loved him wholly. What makes me even angrier was the fact that my mental health was in jeopardy for at least a year because of him. I feel used. Disgusted that he didn't even bother fighting for me. After the breakup, I decided to begin the journey of self love because I know I need time to heal. I'm trying to do activities that will help me take my mind off of things but my mind still ventures to him and it's making me so miserable. I'm honestly tired and I want to stop thinking about him already. Do you guys have any advice that I can do moving forward? I would really appreciate it, thank you! &lt;3",28Dec2020,1

I always feel shitty when I get cards without reciprocating. Last year, my brother who I don’t have much of a relationship with (he’s 14 years older than me and moved to the west coast after college, so he essentially moved out when I was like 6) sent me a Christmas card with a Starbucks gift card. It was really sweet and I hadn’t even considered to send him a gift and felt terrible because I know his finances are pretty bad. I swore that the next year I would do something for him (along with several others).

294,"Bear with me a bit please,

 My spiral started in August of 2019 with the unexpected death of my uncle Roger. It was so out of the blue, he was healthy and so full of life and aced his physical recently. 
But his respirator failed while he was painting a car in his home shop causing his heart to stop.


 Then My best friend(only friend really), died. Massive heart attack in his sleep. He was only a year older than me. Again, no warning, no indicators, just here one day and then gone.


 Then less than two months later, my father died from complications from liver cancer. This hollowed me, killed a part of me deep down that I cant even name yet. 

And then to add to it, my Godmother and Aunt died the same day my father was buried, barely 7 hours later. She had an aneurysm and died within hours of reaching Grady memorial.
 She was the closest figure to a mother I had in my life. 

 In a matter of months, all but one of the people in my life that really knew me and understood me, were gone forever.


The one constant I had through all this was my SO. I leaned on heavily, increasing so with each loss. Maybe I shouldn't have, but I did.

Well, a week after the day my father was buried and my GM died. She left me as well. Suddenly, without warning. Telling me only after she was gone (through a fb message before blocking me) that she ""didn't want to have to save anyone.""


 Then I found that she had been cheating with the guy she left me for, for 2 weeks BEFORE my father passed.

All this before Christmas of '19.


I spiraled, I fell into a deep depression, I drank heavily, abused numerous substances throughout this year, fell into a purely physical (and very emotional and verbally abusive) relationship/arrangement (if you can call it that) with a guy (I'm bi) for the last 9 months. Which is really just being available to him in exchange for room and board. As my addictions consumed almost all of my income..
 
I stopped taking care of myself, I went from 210 lbs to my current 250 at 6' 1"" tall.


I have finally stopped all illegal substance use and drink very very little. Cigarettes are my only crutch at this point. 
 But I just can't bring myself to leave my situation. Even though I have started paying rent and saving a little also.
 But I don't turn him down when he wants what he wants. Its not that I'm afraid to say no, but I think I don't want to even though I want out at the same time.

Now after half a year pasted we are still there for each other and stick close together cause we know each other really well and that we have each others backs at our lowest points.

She started seeing other guys, which made me grind my teeth at first, but now I'm actually alright with it. It's just how things go.

I really like being there for her when she is sad and not alright. I don't want to push her away just because she is my Ex, that would be dumb in my eyes. If she needs me for emotional support, I'm totally fine with that and she does the same for me.

I’m pretty quiet and just do my job and go home, which is unlike a lot of the employees. They are kinda ghetto (I don’t mean this disrespectfully at all, I just have no other way to describe it). They hurt my feelings a lot and step all over me. A lot of it is that they indirectly call me dumb and treat me that way.. I came home crying at least 3 times because of the employees. I got told I can’t do anything right, I get laughed at, I get told I should be blonde.. everyone here is super close and I feel like an outsider. I can’t even confide in anyone there. I started working here because I left my retail job and just wanted to start working right away. I gave it a chance (been here for almost 3 months), but I don’t think I can stand it there much longer. I want to get a new job so bad, but I’m scared of what others may think... I have this irrational fear of not being successful. I grew up very, very lower middle class because my dad couldn’t keep a job because he always thought he could find “better”. I fear I’m being like him.. I want to rough it out and just stay where I’m at but I’m so unhappy. I get really anxious/depressed at times comparing myself to my dad..

I feel like now that I’m 20 things are more serious. I know 20 is still so young but now I’m not a teenager anymore. I know we’re in a pandemic and some are unemployed and struggling, so I feel guilty for feeling this way. Like why can’t I just be grateful... My mental health has gone downhill since I started working here.. I just don’t want to job hop.. I feel like people don’t understand the mental health reasons and would look at me like “wow you can’t keep a job”. I specifically think of my boyfriends family. They’re so nice and nonjudgmental, but I don’t want to seem like I’m not good for their son due to these reasons. My boyfriend (who comes from a successful family) has gotten 2 promotions working at his job (he’s been there a little over a year) and I don’t want to bring him down with my situation...

Im M/17 
I’ve been sick for 12 days as per the title. At first it seemed like a cold then it got worse and I had all the symptoms of bronchitis, no more no less. Went to the doctor and she told me it was probably a cold and to rest (and a covid test - came back negative). 

So I rested and it seemed to be getting better and as of Boxing Day I felt like I had finally kicked it until last night when I started to feel aches all over and then since waking up it’s gotten progressively worse.

Sometimes, she’ll cancel minutes before the time we planned on and just straight up said like I want to re-watch this movie instead of calling. I replied like hey, that’s okay - we could call later.’ And she was like ‘sounds good!’. So, I was like okay cool. 

Waited for a whole two hours and then she says ‘yeah, tonight’s no good, sorry’.

307,"Hello, would appreciate any input on this!

I \[F24\] have been in a relationship with my boyfriend \[M25\] for almost two years and everything is fine except that I have anxiety and concern at the fact that he has never had a job/ seems to be in arrested development. For context, he is a musician (graduated last year with a bachelor's in music) who throughout college was almost entirely supported by his parents (rent, some spending money, etc.), only doing gigs when he wanted to rather than necessity, doesn't have his own bank account (shared with parents for them to deposit money into), and also doesn't have his own credit card (joint with his parents). This has not changed 1 year post graduation. After graduating, he wasn't in search for a job, nor did he seem to be gigging or doing anything to convince me he was pursuing his music career. I initially didn't think much of it, nor did I press him about it because I was uncomfortable about the situation. It came to a head when we were trying to move in together and, perhaps due to covid, landlords were dubious about renting to a couple with only one source of income. It was then that i realized he hasn't really entered society and become independent from his parents financially. Moreover, he has anxiety/depression (he takes meds) which is a hurdle in him pursing things/ becoming independent. During the apartment hunt I realized I was quite fed up and told him that he needs to find a job, become financially independent, or really do something to show me that he is maturing by the end of 2021 or I am going to break up. I want to add that I work full time. His plan was to get a job so that he can then make a bank account and open his own credit card. However, because of his anxiety/depression he is very wary of getting a job that's not remote due to COVID and he's unlikely to get remote jobs due to his inexperience. Part of me wants me to grow up and show me that he is capable but I also feel bad forcing him to do something that is not good for him mentally. I guess I'm asking if my ultimatum is too harsh, especially considering circumstances? Should he get a job? Should he open bank account/ get credit card without getting a job? 

Any advice is welcome!",28Dec2020,1

I'm on overweight person, I am 6ft tall that floats between 210-216lbs (95-98kg's) and according to BMI calculators, I am overweight and my weight should be at 80kg's max according to the information the internet gives me but I really want to get valid and proper information. I didn't want to go onto the Fitness reddit because I really only get egostistical/cuntish vibes from there, I've read some posts about people asking help for one generic thing and there were comments that just sounded condescending for no reason at all so I really rather not get my information off of there.

I've always wanted to lose weight but I end up spending my money on food extremely quickly and it really, really puts me down and makes me feel like shit and I'm starting to reach the point where I've had enough.

310,"Don't worry, I already have another job lined up. It's just that I don't really know how to really tell my manager this news...

For context, I have been working for four weeks at a pizza shop. I started working there because I was desperate for a job and wanted some money in my bank account. I applied to several different places but the Pizza shop was the only place that responded really quick so I took the job. Around two weeks later, I got a job offer from a pharmacy to work as a tech. I was so happy and took the offer. However, I never told my manager at the pizza place about this since I really don't know how to tell him about this. I'm contemplating if I should just quit and never show up again. I mean, it's not like I'll ever work in the food industry again or something. This bridge is small enough to burn, right? 

My parents advised me that I should try to do both since I don't know how much the pharmacy is going to schedule me. I personally think they're going to schedule me as much as the pizza place but I also have to consider college. I need time to go to school. Having two jobs and college seems like a huge responsibility for a college student and I just don't know if I need it right now. I think my parents love my employee discount at the pizza place too much. But anyways, back on topic. How should I go about this whole situation? I'm still doing some onboarding paperwork for the pharmacy job so I don't have a schedule for that place yet. I work on Wednesday at the Pizza place...

I work and go to school so naturally last minute doesn't work. I've told her multiple times that it's extremely inconsiderate but she kept doing it. On Thursday, I finally had enough after she left her baby on top of my sleeping body and got ready for work. Not only was that tacky af, I could've easily rolled over and hurt him. I told her I was done and refunded her money. On Saturday, she comes to me expecting me to watch my nephew...30 minutes before she goes into work. I reminded her that I sent her money back and that she needs to find someone else to watch her son. She flipped out, and called my mom cussing and causing commotion.

319,"I apologize of this ends up being a little longer than intended, but there are a lot of moving parts. 

I’ve never liked this particular cousin whom I will refer to as Janey (19f). Janey dated my cousin (they aren’t related to each other, just both related to me) and she destroyed his life to say the least. She tried to get him to give up his college plans for her and she would make threats saying she’d kill herself without him; he eventually felt pressured to stay in our small town for her. She’s not very pretty, or very smart, or nice, so I’m still wondering how they ended up together since he’s out of her league. 

Janey has this friend (19f) who saw my dad’s Facebook profile and decided that she was in love with him. She begged Janey to give her my dad’s number, that she was in love, etc. Mind you my dad is Janey’s uncle and she knows my parents are married, but she told her and I quote, “you guys would make the better couple you deserve to be together.” 

Janey then started getting in contact with my dad about random stuff and I’m not one hundred percent sure what her entire involvement was in the situation but my dad did end up cheating on my mom with Janey’s friend. (Not a physical affair since they were in different countries when this happened, but still went on for a couple months and he was even making sudden plans to visit said country; My mom did end up forgiving him but she ended up getting revenge in her own way so my focus is on Janey at the moment.) 

When all this was exposed to certain family members, one of them confronted Janey. My mom had plans to speak to Janey’s dad about her behavior and the entire situation, as well as find out the identity of Janey’s friend—to this day we do not know who she is, just that she’s Janey’s friend—but Janey decided she was a victim. Janey went on a tangent saying that if my mom spoke to her dad she was going to “fuck her up.” 

Janey’s dad is an alcoholic who has low blood pressure so she argues that if her dad finds out, he’s going to have a heart attack and die. Personally, that’s none of my business, you have to be held responsible for your actions, and she’s just scared of the consequences. I might have let my mom handle this on her own, but Janey talked so much shit about my mom and her and her slut sister (story for another time) have hurt so many people that I think it’s time they are held accountable or they pay because they’ve done really bad things in the past and clearly talking to them has been of no use. 

My grandma basically refuses to let us cut of those two parasites because they’re family, but my contact with them is very limited. 

I just need ways of getting revenge that isn’t talking to her dad (my mom is already planning to do that) in my opinion that’s her getting off easy. Or should I not even bother? Although I would hate this idea, I just want to know what I should do.

On the last night of the trip my friend had the drugs so we took them. While we were waiting for it to kick in my friend tony started to act strange. An hour after we ate the gummy bears I went to take a piss in the woods a few feet behind our tents. Now I know this sounds crazy but when I got done , my friend tony was walking away from me. But the distance he covered in the little time it took me to use the bathroom is the scary part. The sun had just started to go down and when I turned around, tony was easily 50 yards away and he was naked.. the drugs didn’t hit me the way they did for him at that time. 
I decided to leave him alone. I didn’t want to ruin his trip so I sat down on the icebox full of beer and waited for tony to come back, which he never did. I fell asleep while sitting on that cooler and when I woke up, the tents were gone, tony was gone and the fire was out.

There I experienced a lot of things I shouldn't have... my dad only played movies with sex scenes in them and graphic images, which I had to watch in order to ACTUALLY spend time with him, once he claimed I was old enough to watch a scene wherein they showed a dead man's penis. He had piles of ""adult movies"" stacked next to the bed I slept in (which was his, it was the only bed and he slept on the couch), and once a LITERAL used condom lying next to it. 

I stopped staying overnight at his place a year ago after I told my mom and brother how he rented every room to strangers, he and his girlfriend slept in their room, and I slept on the couch.

I want to say it's because of the online aspect and my lack of extra curriculars. I stopped talking piano lessons after everything went digital because of covid. What bothers me most is that I actively chose to quit. I could of just kept taking them through video chat but I was too busy with regular school and didn't want to spend the same money for a lesser quality lesson (i attended one and realised its very hard not only to understand the feedback but also just lag and lack of angles for the teacher to see). A few months without practice later I can't even play basic scales. This realisation a few days ago really affected me as music (and the piano) were one of the few things I was good at. At school I was on the swim team and in the musical, while I wasn't very good at either it made me feel like I was doing something with my life. It used to be something I would fall back to when I don't do as well as I wanted in school. Now all I'm doing is school work. What's worse is that I'm doing worse without extra-curriculars taking up a portion of my time. Our school running a quarter system in which we only ever do two subjects at a time is really hard on this mindset too. If I'm not doing well in either of the subjects I have absolutely nothing to fall back on. So in response I have taken up hobbies that I can do from home. I started to write and draw. Both of these things are hobbies I used to have even before quarantine started and I always wanted more time for them. Now that I do however, I can't seem to enjoy it at all. I don't ask that I'm amazing at what I do but it sure helps. I'm usually pretty decent at what ever I pick up but never good. I guess its been a fear of mine that I stretch myself too thin and in the end I never really accomplish anything. I genuinely love the idea of everything from video games to biology, but I can never focus on one thing enough to improve past the basics. I just don't enjoy anything I want to do. I guess what I'm asking is either what is wrong with me or what do I do to fix the anger and sadness I feel about everything.

Let me explain: when I obsess over somebody I can't stop thinking about them, all I want to do is talk about them, or talk with them. I get possessive or become overbearing, I even idolize them sometimes. Sometimes I'll even put their needs and feelings above my own and others. When I obsess over somebody I know irl I can't even imagine a future without them, they have to be there idk what I would do if they weren't.

still try and remove myself from them when I find myself like this, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable if I accidentally over step.

339,"I (21F) was molested by my brother while I was asleep a few years ago. I just froze and couldn’t do anything. I’ve been going to therapy to deal with my trauma and no one in my family knows. I’ve only ever told 2 of my friends.

I still live with him and my parents. And everyday I just try to block it out and pretend I’m ok when it’s like rubbing salt on my wounds. He acts like nothing happened. So to protect myself, I just ignore him as much as possible. I don’t talk to him nor acknowledge his presence. I refuse to be in a room when he’s the only one there.

To make matters worse, my mom is now telling me that I’m being really mean to my brother— avoiding him like the plague, not being nice to him etc. But she doesn’t know what happened. If she keeps pushing and saying I’m being mean, should I just tell her what happened?

My main reason for not telling my family is that I’m scared it will cause too much disruption and it will be so messy. I’m also scared I won’t be believed and I’m worried my mental health can take that. I know my truth and I know what happened.

340,"     I'm a 12th grader and it's the middle of university application season. ive already applied to a major i genuinely like, but the job prospects for my major really took a toll on me. I want to do communication studies but I'm scared I'm not gonna work hard enough and end up in a minimum wage job my whole life or realize later on that it really is a useless degree as many people say. And if it is useless, what can I do? What if I'm not financially stable to go back to school? It would be easier to do a major with more security but none of them interest me.

     I tried reaching out to graduates on reddit from the universities I'm interested in, my guidance counselor at school, my parents a bit, and I keep getting mixed responses. I'm already an indecisive person so this really messed me up and I don't know what to do anymore.

     I just want ways to cope with this stress. I'm tired of it and for me it's almost impossible to truly enjoy things now. I'll be playing video games and just get super sad.

But one of them just doesn’t seem to care about being on the team. Let’s call her Becky. Anyway Becky is really smart and kind, but she doesn’t seem committed to the team. Part of our job is to meet in our own time and it has been a struggle to meet just once in the last month alone. I never press sure her or guilt trip her into meeting because I know if I do it will lead to bad results. I’m always kind towards her but for whatever reason she seems distance from me and whenever I text or call her and ask her to meet to work with me on our assignment she just texts “Maybe” or “Hmm” and leave it for days. I do follow up after I have given her sufficient time to respond but she is just not really caring about the team. She has done this with me when we were in middle school but I never had to work on an assignment together just we presented together.( Sorry if the academic team sounds confusing) I want to the talk to the coach about it but the main coach is her father and the other coach has a daughter on the team and I don’t want to run anything the wrong way.

I am 26 years old and I have been unemployed for 1 year and a half, the first six months I spend them working on personal projects that I couldn't realize due to the pandemic. However since 9 months ago I have been looking for a job and this has been the hardest time of my life, I have been dealing with anxiety, OCD and depression during 10 years, and they have become worst since the pandemic started and ""job search"" topic is a major trigger for me, I always force myself to look for jobs and spend quite a lot of time on it but it is detrimental to my mental health since I have to always fight against suicidal ideation caused by the thoughts that I will never get a job plus the anxiety.

346,"On the 24th, my (20s) neighbour died. He was a very close family friend, he would call us often and I’d see him everytime I went to clean. (He lives in the (like 10 apartments public housing unit. very small village, and i’m the concierge there). He was very sick from cancer so we knew he didn’t have long but it hit very suddenly when his kidneys failed on the morning of 21st. 

A few weeks ago he had adopted a little kitten. He wasn’t even 3 months old (30th december). He asked me if I would adopt the cat when he died because he didn’t want him to go just to anybody, and I already have cats and dogs so he knows I love animals. (i do, all of my pets are my babies). I didn’t have the heart to say no, so I promised I would, hoping it wouldn’t be soon...

I took the kitten on the 23rd since he was still in the hospital. He adapted perfectly, he’s cuddly, he’s crazy with the other cats and he’s already clean. So that transition went well. 

But god, the kitten smells like my neighbour. 

He’s sleeping next to my next, on a pillow I set for him. He spends every nights with me. And I went to give him a kiss and I caught the smell and just bursted into tears as memories filled my head. When he got into the hospital i cried for 40 minutes, sitting in his apartment. When my mom and I went to get the cat, we just stood in silence knowing it was the last time we’d walk in here. I was on a phonecall with him before he died, his voice raspy and sick and I couldn’t bring myself to talk because I knew it was the last time. 

I realize I’m ranting at this point but I’m having a hard time typing this without crying. I’m watching the kitten sleep as I type all of this and everything just hurt. 

I’m mot unfamiliar to death. Last year on the 26th december I lost my grandfather. Over the years I’ve lost many friends even as recently as last new year’s eve. 

But having his kitten makes it so hard. I won’t get rid of him at all. He’s my baby now and I’m deadset on keeping my promise on honouring his last wishes. 

I’ve never had such a hard time dealing with death. Being autistic I never really... reacted properly with death. When my grandfather died, I must have cried about two times. I just cannot process it correctly even thought it hurts really badly. I was busy helping my mother through the pain as I just ignored mine. 

Because of that, I have no idea how to deal with grief. I don’t know what to do to ease the pain, to stop crying at every thoughts and mentions of him, or seeing the kitten. It’s hard and I feel so useless. All of my friends are having a rough time (breakups, family issues, ect) and I don’t want to bother them with it. 

What are some things that could help? How do you deal with grief/death?

P.S. sorry if there’s any typos I’ve missed, I’ve been crying typing this and I can’t see very well because of that.",28Dec2020,1

Unfortunately, my dog was hit by a car when we went out shopping. I understand that this was an accident under my parents responsibility. However, how the situation was handled was not ok. When the vets called me to tell me the news that my dog had passed away after being hit by a car, my partner and I went back to my parents to collect our items and our other dog (we had to go home as we live 3hrs away and wanted our dog home to say goodbyes and cremate her). When we did, I was crying so much holding my dead dog in the car whilst my partner grabbed our stuff. I said nothing besides ""how did this happen? How did she get out?"" And instead of my parents answering my question, they said it was my fault for leaving my dogs there with them. They kept screaming at me and carrying on blaming me. My partner was so upset by their reaction that she said ""what if this was a baby, would you carry on like this?"" My mum didn't like that and went to throw a drink at the both of us. We left. Later in that week, I had a few phone calls with my parents because I wanted to know what truley happened before she was hit by a car. They changed their story 3 times. I just wanted some sort of closure. I was so angry that my dog is dead (she means the world to me) and I was angry because they couldn't tell me the truth. Because of my anger, they said my anger was invalid. They proceeded to call me a ""druggie"" (never been one), a ""psychopath"" , that I will never be successful in the career I'm pursuing, and that my partner is also a ""psychopath"" and my ex is better than my current partner (my ex is abusive and I've had to see a counsellor due to the abuse. They also welcomed my current partner with open arms) although she never said anything to them besides that comment on the day it occured but nothing bad. I haven't spoken to them in over a month. They never apologised to begin with for their behaviour towards me and my partner, even when I asked for an apology. I have been really upset by the treatment towards myself and my partner. Regardless, I'm aware my relationship with my parents will never be the same again. My dad has tried reaching out to me in several ways and I know he misses me and I do miss him but I'm still upset about it all.

The relationship starts off fine but then I start to feel very insecure and almost jealous. Well, I'm assuming it's jealousy. Not that I don't want people to succeed. If someone else enters the picture I feel like giving up and just letting my friend be happier with their new friend or whatever is going on in my head. I see everything as a threat for the friend to leave. Silly, I know. But it's very real in my head and I realize that it's unfair because I can't speak for them. I also get mean and say things that can hurt. I feel terrible right away and apologize but then I do it again. Eventually the friend leaves because while being patient with me they can not handle it anymore. I don't blame them. I would leave me too. After the new year I'd like to start seeing a therapist(waiting for diffrent insurance to take place) and hopefully get to the bottom of why I treat the people I love like garbage.

I’ll start out with the fact that I started realizing I have a really toxic relationship with my best friend of 6-7 years i’ll call him Jacob. Jacob has always been a controlling person but he’s started to make me feel like i had to walk on eggshells around him. Every time there was an argument he always blamed me and made me feel like a terrible friend, and he always put me down. I’ll give an example of this, he wanted me to be friends with his girlfriend and when they broke up he tried to make me stop being friends with her, and called me “the worst friend ever” and that i’m “fake” and that he’s the “better friend” in our friendship. He just recently told me happy birthday, so naturally i said thanks, and he starting going on about how i could show a little more appreciation when someone says happy birthday to me, none of my other friends had a problem when I said thanks. There’s so many other examples of this, i’m not gonna pretend like some of our fights weren’t my fault but i get blamed no matter what. i feel like i’m sinking into a depression and i’m scared and lonely. I also lost another friend who just showing complete disinterest in our relationship, I later found out her boyfriend made her stop talking to me. i only have one friend left that i can talk to, i’m having a hard time even finding the motivation to get out of bed anymore. if anyone has gone through something like this i would really appreciate some advice. thank you for reading this.",28Dec2020,1

360,"Hi, please don’t mind this new account and also the fact that I’m on mobile but I really need help with this. I have no one else to turn to. there is a TLDR at the bottom :)

I (19F) have been battling undiagnosed mental health issues for as long as I remember as a direct result of a very toxic and emotionally unavailable family. I never understood myself and lashed out in so many ways and I still do and i’m struggling so much with it. About a year ago I went to college and if that wasn’t rock bottom, i don’t want to find out what is. That was the lowest point of my life and I don’t even like talking about it. But i managed to save myself and finally see a therapist for the first time and very slowly but surely he understood me, listened to me, explained things to me and for the first time in my life i didn’t feel like a lunatic. We had plans for the near future and I was going to be connected to a psychiatrist for medication. It felt like all my cries for help were finally being answered. Then quarantining began and it was all stopped in it’s tracks and i was no longer on campus, could no longer see my therapist, could no longer see a doctor, and I was back at square one until we were able to figure out weekly zoom appointments. They helped tremendously. I felt like I was doing so well with him, and then the idea that one day I will finally get the medication i need really lifted my spirits. I NEVER had hope until I met him. You’re telling me i’m gonna be able to function like a normal human being? 

Anyway, because of COVID and money I took a gap year and did NOT realize that i wouldn’t have access to my universities self help services during my break. It’s been four months since I’ve spoken to my therapist and gotten any real life advice or guidance and I can slowly feel myself start to slip away again. The one little light i found i lost. I was doing so well and i’m starting to feel exactly how i felt in college and i want it to stop. I want it to stop right now and i don’t want to let it get that bad, but I don’t even know where to start. I don’t know how to find a therapist on my own, theyre very expensive and I have no help. I was thinking of picking up a single class next semester just so i could talk to him, but financial aid won’t care about one class so I’ll have to pay for it myself which is something I can’t afford to do right now at all. 

The real kicker is I’m terrified of having a new therapist. I know how hard it is for some people to find the right therapist and I feel like i struck gold by clicking with mine instantly. I’m also very afraid of a new therapist contradicting my old one and giving me different advice and just making my brain a huge scrambled mess. I don’t know but it just sounds unhealthy and i’m scared. I just want to be better.
If anyone has any advice please let me know. Even self help PDFs or youtube channels or resources that have worked for you. I don’t know if I should stick it out and hang by a thread until next fall but i don’t think i’m stable enough for that. I’ve already started relapsing my horrible old bad habits and i know what’s going to happen. i just know

361,"So my parents are absolutely paranoid about the ""addiction"" aspect of videos games as they are constantly reading articles from various sources, even from some sources that I believe are from tabloids, hence they have decided on not allowing me or my siblings to play games altogether. This meant to consoles, PC games or even mobile games. This has led to an extremely boring lockdown period as I am staying at home doing literally nothing other than attending online classes. Even so, my parents are constantly complaining about me spending a lot of time facing screens (6 hours of online classes, approximately 1-2 hours of TV , 2 hours on my laptop and about 30mins on my phone) I have recently tried convincing my parents to let me buy a Nintendo Switch for Christmas so that the lockdown period will be more enjoyable since I am on holidays at the moment (means no classes) but they started nagging me about ""addiction"" and unproductive time. This made me feel really angry because all my friends are playing games together during the lockdown and I couldn't do anything that I like to make time pass faster. Aside from not allowing me to buy a console, they also keep deleting mobile games that I download on my iPad (that I play secretly) which leaves me pretty much stuck at home with absolutely nothing to do other than scrolling through reddit, watch some YouTube videos and scroll though social media because I have hours and hours of free time and I have nothing to spend them on. I personally find this sort of control really unhealthy for me since I also deserve to have the liberty to do whatever I like, even for short periods of time. Now my time at home feels almost like prison since I don't have direct access to all devices at home (all my devices, laptop, iPad, phone are all password protected and my parents have them) I really think that this sort of thinking that my parents have is due to the generation difference and I really want to live my life like my friends and enjoy my youth while I still can. Other than not allowing me to play games at all, they also don't allow me to watch game-related content on YouTube,  which is another blow for me since I love watching esports and some Call of Duty gameplay on YouTube (since I cant play them, watching them is my only option) Please help me out",28Dec2020,1

365,"Ensuite toilet is very blocked, most likely with kitchen paper towels which I used to finish off cleaning the shower and, like an idiot, flushed 2 or 3 at a time. Water does drain and I think can hear it trickling which tells me the blockage is close? Toilet is prone to blocking but that always seemed more about me than the plumbing, ifyaknowwhatImean but it always clears with minimal plunger use and often on it's own. After that it flushes quickly and easily. I was wondering if the blockage is further along than I can reach with the snake, but the blocked toilet is the en-suite which is nearer the road and the main bathroom toilet, which flushes fine, is towards the back of the house. I'm assuming that they share a drain so wouldn't they both block up? 

Have tried - standard rubber cup plunger, bellows plunger, dish soap, hot water, a drain snake (bought the wrong one but tried it anyway) and a toilet snake. Nothing seems to make a difference. Best I've done is a few small bits of paper and debris to bubble up. When the water does drain, it empties the bowl and then bubbles and gurgles until the water level rights itself. House is on a slab. 

It's a rental, so I really want to avoid a call out in case it's a problem with the main pipe and not just a simple toilet blockage. Also, money.

i am absolutely frightened to tell my parents, just today they told me that they were proud of me and how many expectations they had of me, and while i feel like they’d support me i can’t help but feel like a total failure and that i’d get kicked out or something.

I know it is normal for such things to take time but every time i am about to go to bed or take a break I feel like such a failure that I couldn't complete everything and  i know how stupid this sounds but i dont know why i cant get this thought out of my head no matter how much work i do. It is simply never enough and i always feel like i could have done more. I see people around me working fast and producing quality work and being satisfied with it and also taking breaks and getting proper asleep and i want that for myself too. I can barely multitask several things because it is just so difficult to stop one thing without either completing it or burning myself out completely. 

It is a senseless comparison but i see people in t.v shows juggling multiple things and succeeding and i know those are fictional characters but i cant help comparing myself with them.  Doesn't help that they also motivate me to work harder and do better. I'm experiencing such a dilemma i dont even know whether ri am making sense at this point.

I have ADHD, BPD, bulimia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, experience hallucinations on the regular and i'm also on the spectrum. I know this is a mouthful but it is what it is. I was on meds for several years but they always did more harm than good so now i only self-medicate or abuse drugs to function and keep me afloat. I know i shouldn't but survival is my only option at the moment. And yes, i was properly diagnosed for all of these. I take nictoine, ritalin, alp, xanax, pregabalin and other meds to manage with really high doses of caffeine and sugar. I dont drink alcohol or do hardcore drugs if it counts for anything. I live in an extremely toxic environment, grew up in the most abusive household and unfortunately still live there. Dealt with all sorts of trauma in different environments i.e. physical, sexual, emotional so my mental health is fucked up and the fact that i live in a third world country doesn't allow me to get proper help either. I want to make my life better but i am really struggling right now. I have one very loving, supporting and amazing person in my life who is the only reason i have made it this far but i want to become independent cause i feel like i am draining them with my burdens. 

I know this was very long and thank you to whoever made it till this point. My question is that how can i do more in a day and be satisfied with my work and produce great quality work and juggle everything without having a breakdown every day. I just want some tips to manage my situation is hard to change overnight and i know it but any baby steps that could be effective to some extent? 

Also, i dont know whether this is relevant but I am a 23 year old female.",28Dec2020,1

Well Jill has been calling out a lot claiming to be so called sick with no doctors excuses and she shows up to work when she feels like it and leaves before her shift is over between and hour to 30 minutes without notifying the store manager or the store supervisor. Her cash register has also been short a few times and she has been given chance after chance but recently she called me and said she wasn’t coming in because she “didn’t feel” and of course when an employee calls out I have to report that to the manager to let him know that someone didn’t come in an whatever the reason is. She was hanging by a thread and was even told one more mess up and she would be terminated.  So when she called in I called the manager and told him and of course we both was already fed up with her calling out all the time that he terminated her. Now we live in what’s called an at will employment state meaning you can be terminated at anytime for any reason at long as it isn’t illegal. Well this being said she is claiming she is going to get a lawyer to file charges. I don’t believe that cause 1) she never comes to work to even afford a lawyer she doesn’t even have reliable transportation to work so she possibly wouldn’t even have the funds to afford a lawyer and 2) being in an at will state you can be fired for any reason as long as it’s legal and her constantly not  showing up to work and calling out proves unreliability in the work place making it where someone else has to be called in or I have to go in and work those shifts on my off day which isn’t fair to me or any other employee.

375,"Hello forum,

I'm a 25 year old who recently suffered a major depressive episode after a period of personal difficulty during the past 3 years, beginning with the divorce of my parents and culminating in the death of a friend. My episode led me to walk out of my workplace and place myself in near-complete isolation. My appetite has severely decreased and I'm not sleeping well. I've experienced suicidal thoughts. It feels like I've lost the will to live. I strongly suspect that I am beginning to experience bipolar disorder.

Thankfully, although they're divorced, I have amazing parents. My dad and I don't talk much anymore but he's given enough money to live on for a couple of months. My mom has been taking care of me, making sure I take meds, and spending time with me.

My current job as an administrator has been very kind to me and I've already been on leave for several weeks. I feel awful saying that I don't think I can do the work because of my depression after everything they've done for me. The truth is I don't fit in an administrative role at all; I'm used to working on my feet, not sitting at a desk. I get anxious when I think about going back to work there. I think I need to find a different job.

I want to eventually go back to either work or school. But I just need some time. I want to start with therapy and build from there.

I suppose all I'm looking for is some encouragement and advice from anyone who's experienced something similar. I don't know how to talk about this and I don't know how to ask for what I need.",28Dec2020,1
377,"I'm not really sure where to post this, but I could really use some advice.


My mother has always struggled with her health (physical and mental). She has been seeing a therapist and is on so many pills. 

This month in particular has been the very worst I've ever seen her. At least once a week, she'll tell me that she wants to kill herself. Then she'll ask 'do you love me?' After, she'll complain about a new thing that's hurting her. (Tonight, it was her tongue. Yesterday was her foot).

A little background about my mom: 

She comes from an abusive home where she never got a lot of attention. She had cancer. She had her gallbladder and appendix removed. She recently had a hysterectomy. She also struggles with an eating disorder.

Lately, she's been acting like a child and it's taking a toll on my entire family. We all want her to get better and be happy. But I just don't know the proper way to act or what to say around her. 

If there isn't any attention on her, she immediately complains of a new pain or pretends to fall over. She also recently went on an online shopping spree and spent $2000. She was diagnosed with ADHD last month. 

Her therapist hasn't been that much of a help with giving us advice.

I really would appreciate any sort of advice. I don't sleep much these days and stay up all night watching her out of fear. I really just want her to be happy and healthy.",28Dec2020,1

Am I just being a crazy stalker fan or is this something I should try to pursue? And if so, is emailing their manager the best way to go about it? I was just gonna write a short message and ask if they could pass my info and pictures along to the celebrity, but I don’t know how to even phrase that without sounding like I’m totally immature and wasting their time.

I just turned 18, and i have a lot of self related problems to go through. 1 problem i wanna resolve is about my mind. People expect me to be good at something, when i think i completely suck at it. Take this as an example, which is true actually: Ive been playing videogames for over 17 years, yes since i was 1! Videogames are my passion and something i love to do, anytime. In future i'd like to work with them, either programming, testing or anything related tbh. After 17 years of experience, and such willingness to play, you expect someone to be good right? Well, not me. You see, I fucking SUCK. And by that, I mean the most incosistent shit, you could ever imagine. For 4 straight months, my kd hasnt gone higher than 1 whatsoever. I recently changed the mb, ram and cpu which gave a huge performance boost, but that just made it worse! I have tried everything, sensitivity, frames, audio, but nothing. At such an age, my best reaction time, after 17 years of experience, is 200-220 ms, which is slow af, you can take the test by yourself as well at humanbenchmark.com . I was on the verge of tears a couple times already, playing 3 of 4 times in a row, doing 0/8, 0 kills and 8 deaths (in rainbow six). Sometimes, when i try to hold an angle on somebody, and i aim at their head level, they crouch, so that their head is below my crosshair, right? I see them crouching, and i start shooting, although while looking with my eyes that the enemy is crouched, i still keep shooting on the same fucking spot, like my brain shuts itself off or something, without registering what my eyes see. I feel dumb, retarded, autistic and everything in between. Theres also more of a personal issue. Im bad with girls, like, bad very bad. So bad in fact, that at such an age, most people lost their virginity. Guess who didn't? Yeah its yo failure ass homie right here. I dont know, what to do anymore.

I am writing this because I've been noticing this trend in my behavior for more than 2 years now and was wondering if anyone has advice other than just to go to a doctor (I'm 15 and working up the courage to tell my parents about this). Basically, I feel like pure shit for at least a week before my period, and I 100% know that I can't be making this up as my mom takes notes of my period, not me. I know, I probably should start putting down the dates and stuff, but I hate it, I wish I was born male so I wouldn't have to deal with this bullshittery. A dick and a flat chest sound heavenly, not a uterus. No offense to women that want one. I wish I would just die so that I can't even bring life into this world anymore, it sounds terrifying to actually bring a human into this world. What was my mom thinking when she wanted to have me??? why would you want to even live?

see? this is what I'm talking about, if I was posting this somewhere else I would have immediately deleted that. That is what I think on a constant basis at least 7 days before my period. I hate it, I have a vague plan about how I might kill myself, but I'm still looking for a better way that won't traumatize my parents that much.

I don't know why I have these thoughts, but ever since my period started at 12, I hated it. Eventually I was like ""well, I just bleed so nothing else really bothers me, right? It can't be that bad, right?"", well haha what a nice joke, bloating, fatigue, no appetite, and headaches, and most importantly the want to kill yourself are coming soon!

So yeah, I don't know what to do anymore, I'm not myself anymore. I feel like I'm wasting my life away, but better wasted than none, right?

My niece said she didn’t do it. She said “that’s nasty why would i do that!!” She cried hysterically begging her mom to believe her. My sister told me she thought my daughter made it up. 

Eventually, my sister told my niece “well theres cameras in the playroom so we can watch those to show you didnt do it” (This isn’t true, there are no cameras) After that my niece finally admitted that she did it but wouldn’t say why or where she learned it from

At the time, I didn’t think anything more of the situation. We moved on

Tonight I had a friend over who my daughter loves. My daughter pulled her aside and said she needs to tell her something.

She told my friend that her cousin told her sometimes her vagina bleeds and she has to put toilet paper in her panties. She told her that she can never, eve tell anyone. My daughter was in absolute distress telling my friend this. My daughter said she didn’t want to keep this secret but she didn’t want to tell me because she promised her cousin. 

And last, me niece has told me that she sleeps with her dad. Her mom and baby  brother sleep in another room.

With that being said, i don’t know what to do. My instinct says call CPS but I’m having an internal battle because what if I’m wrong? Calling cps on my sister?! I love my sister with all my heart i would hate to put her through that.

Next morning he got up and seemed to be in no rush about getting changed, walking to the window to pull the curtains, making coffee and switching on the TV.

It bothers me a lot that I don’t live in the world I created, sometimes I wonder if I didn’t create the world but maybe it created me.

I can change our cats’ litter boxes and smell NOTHING. And we have 6 cats that use 3 of them (we’ve tried more, they don’t use them, just the 3) regularly. 

I don’t have health insurance. I do have a place I go to for my medication, but it’s pay per visit, $25 every time. Its location is a nightmare as well, never any parking, hard to access... pretty much just difficult, so I’d rather not do that unless I really need to. 

Could that little bit of blockage way back in my sinuses be the cause? I’ve had colds before, even the flu (that was 5 years ago, and it would’ve been worse if I hadn’t gotten the shot that year). It’s not COVID, I haven’t been around anyone with it... I’ve rarely been going out, and when I do, I take preventive measures (per the CDC’s guidelines) every time.

408,"Someone I (F23) call my best friend (F22) and somewhere still has a place in my heart did somethings which resulted in a huge gap between us. She is constantly trying to make things better in my opinion but people around me cannot trust her and I might potentially destroy my relationship with my boyfriend (M22) if I mend things with her. 
We have been friends since 3 years now. Around 1.5 years ago my best friend because of her then boyfriend started becoming super distant from me which left me all alone. She started lying to me saying they broke up and she is super depressed but turned out it was all for him  to protect his image and then hiding things from me which made me worried about her because she tends to trust boys easily in the name of love and that can be super damaging for her this resulted in me becoming super suicidal and super depressed. Due to this I then became friends with my now boyfriend. He became friends with both of us at the same time as he is in the same university as us but he got more close to me due to the fact that my best friend was super distant from everyone and was always on her phone. He kinda became super close to me when he positively responded to the message I sent 3 people in which I said I'm tired and i need help coz I'm scared I'll kill myself. Those three were my best friend, a guy friend who was best friend once and my now boyfriend. My now boyfriend called me instantly and convinced me to talk with him while she said ""everyone cannot be always there for me so I have to learn how to survive alone"" those words have since haunted me. The other guy friend just said same. 
She has done a lot of things which almost resulted in my breakup among which the worst one was to tell my boyfriend that I don't love him and he is just someone to fill a void while I wait for this other guy to realize he has feelings for me. Which is BS as I'm in love with my boyfriend and we've been talking about making things official soon. She has tried to replicate my relationship with her boyfriend like anything I say we (my bf and i did) she says they did it too. Which is annoying so I started avoiding conversations with her as they always resulted in her trying to guilt trip me.

412,"Hello! I’m currently a PSEO student and about to start my college life with debts and loans so I really need some advice! 

To start off with everything, I would like to give you guys an overview about my opinion or relationship with my parents. Personally, I feel like I have pretty average and supportive parents BUT there are times where they can be a little strict and a little on the traditional side. My parents believe that women’s who can cook and clean does better in life than women’s who can’t cook/clean but has a very high education. So they push my sisters and I to cook, clean, AND do well on our education. My sisters obeys these opinion and does what my parents say. Me on the other hand, I believe that it is a women’s choice to stay at the kitchen. So when I’m not busy with my school work, I would often cook and clean but when I’m busy with school work I would refuse to cook or clean. In result, I would get heavy lectures due to my opinions and belief about a women’s role...and of course I would stand strong to my belief and argue back. I’m not proud of my actions but at those time I just couldn’t hold in my temper.

Besides the cooking and cleaning, we are also required to stay home. That is, we aren’t allowed to hangout with friends or if we have a boyfriend we are definitely not allowed to go out with him. (Surprisingly my parents allowed us to have a boyfriend) An example to explain what I mean is when my sister was called unreasonable names and was given a lecture for just walking across the the street to accept a gift. It was unbelievable. Anyways, I’ve always obeyed this rule but I just always have something to say about it. I don’t sneak out or just run off, I often just talk back. Ive always felt the need to know why couldn’t I hangout with friends or my boyfriend. I just feel like I’m in a cage, and be honest... I don’t know much about the world. I mean I know pretty simple things like how money buys needs, but the bigger things, I don’t know. So I would often to argue my way out of “cage.” 

Hopefully now you can see that my parents and my relationship isn’t that perfect but it’s durable. 

Anyways, I’m about to go off to college and I just want to be alone through this process. Additionally, I just want to be able to connect or at least have dinner with my friends and my boyfriend. (I’m not trying to say that I don’t like connecting or spend time with my family. I love spending time with them but I would also prefer to hangout with my boyfriend and friends too.) One of my sister has always said that I’ll have more privileges after I have my driver license but I don’t believe it. As I still see her stuck at home and cook and clean for us. I want to learn more about the world, and I want to go to one of my dream colleges. Instead of being forced to go to a college that I don’t really want to go. 

Despite feeling this way, I still want to stay to help my older sister and also try to understand my parents. Furthermore, I don’t want to be in huge debts because college isn’t something that I should play with. Not only that, but living alone requires me to pay bills. I know for sure that I am be able to handle the chores because I’ve always been taught to do many indoor things, such as cooking. However, my only problem is earning incomes. I don’t even have a job yet. I’m planning to take a CNA course this summer and later find a job for that position. However, I don’t know what to do...

Should I go off immediately after high school and work as a CNA while building my way up as I continue college? Should I risk being in debt? 
OR 
Should I stay with my family and not work while studying to get a bachelors in nursing before moving out? (Which is less debt.)",28Dec2020,1

414,"Before you say “you need therapy ASAP,” I have personal circumstances that hinder my ability to do so, so I am reaching out to r/Advice to really push me into therapy ASAP or not.

Quotations I use are to express how I actually think to myself.

For most of my life, I believed that prioritizing myself and my interests would bring me to my ultimate goal: my own definition of success. Doing so means that I am free to put little to no regard to other things such as people, who should generally be useful to me and not consistently displease me if I were to interact with them — and the world/community, which is something I won’t be interacting too much with relative to time. I know I’ve developed some twisted way of perceiving and interacting with my environment so that it would ultimately benefit me, but I’m not really “active” on it — as in I don’t (like to) lie, be manipulative, or deliberately hurt anyone because they aren’t very easy things for me to do (due to dissonance). Lately, I’ve been more concerned about my future career, which has me drowning in stress. I don’t handle stress well. I don’t handle my own mistakes or criticism well. I have very high expectations for myself. When I can’t meet any of these, I start to crumble and berate myself and I cannot be consoled. I end up hurting people who try to help me because I stubbornly refuse to fix my issues I already know about. When my little episode is over, I act as if nothing happened not because I forget about it, but it’s as if it’s left my “area of concern,” so I don’t really think about it or address it because it’s over. I have a partner that tries their best to help me, but it just doesn’t work because I “don’t want to seem happy-go-lucky all of a sudden when I was just fuming” — as it feels “wrong” in my head to just stop being angry at myself and others. I’m sure the way I was raised has much to do with my inability to act rationally, even though I KNOW I’m in the wrong. Every. Single. Time. The small angel in my head tells me that I am overreacting and sends warning pings that I’m going to do/say something I’ll regret, but my anger always buries that 6ft under the deepest ocean trench. “No way man I’m NEVER listening to your nice little angelic advice.” Anyway, I was raised with “you are not allowed to have emotions you aren’t allowed to get angry or cry or have a chance to explain yourself.” I got angry anyway, they got angrier and I cried, always lamenting in self-pity and rage. All these years of just not wanting to turn into them sure worked it’s wonders. I feel like I’m an abuser — to myself and to others. I’ve considered therapy for a long time. I used psychedelics and weed to keep me happy for a while. It seems to make me feel more aware of how little I care about the things I should be caring about, which has caused me to use less.

415,"Okay, so like six years ago I got a LEGO Star Wars Death Star set for my birthday, and at the time I was really excited, until I actually started building it.

I gave up a little over half way through, and for quite some time I let it it just sit there on my desk. Fast forward a few months and I finally felt like I wanted to get started building it again, only to find out that our cat had.. marked his territory on it.. if you know what I mean. So then I just thought, screw it, cleaned it as best as I could, and put it on top of a bookcase.

And from there I just let it gather dust for a few.. years..
I have a really bad procrastination problem, don't worry about it.

Now, six years later, I have since forgotten where I put the rest of the pieces for the set, and the set itself is covered with dust. I still occasionally build LEGO, but I doubt that I'll n

420,"My S/O and I have a 3year old boy and a 5 month old girl. Recently
my SIL made a false claim to Children's Aid Services.(Ontario) The case worker investigated but didn't find any issues and closed the file. However there's now a permanent report against my S/O and I that plagues me with anger and sadness.

Even her husband begged her not to do it. 
She saw us days before she filed the report and smiled and laughed with us knowing what she was about to do. She had been planning this for months, calling up family asking them about the state of our house after visiting. (Nothing came up)

Last week she sent us a Christmas card saying she doesn't regret her actions, she didn't want our children taken away but instead wanted to offer us respite and counselling services (our children aren't disabled)
However we received the report she made with CAS and the picture of neglect she painted told a very different story.
 
Next year I was set to open an at home daycare, desired to have another child and foster others in the future. I'm concerned that the CAS file would prevent me from doing so or we will be investigated again which was quite traumatic the first time.  

I contacted a layer about the possibility of suing for libel/defamation  but was told it would be a difficult case as I haven't been prevented from doing so yet. 

She had every opportunity to address her ""claims"" with us and chose not to. She failed to confirm the information with my S/O or I as everything on the report was something she had apparently been told, not had seen.

Looking back on our relationship with her there were a lot of red flags. 
My S/O was married before me and the SIL remained best friends with his ex. They would follow him around in her car, which we both witnessed repeatedly, she would share personal information of us with her and was always cold to me when no one was looking. 
She helped his ex file a report to small claims court against my S/O and even got into our apartment when we went on vacation for a week telling our landlord and police she though we were dead, even though we mentioned we were going beforehand, then opened all our mail. 
She's always had an unhealthy obsession with our son, favouring him over her own children. Commenting that she hated them and takes depression medication and runs every morning just to deal with and get away from them.

The only reason I think she would do this is to hurt me or in hopes that she would get custody of our children.

My S/O's family doesn't agree with what she did or said but they're pressuring us to forgive her and move on. But we are unable and unwilling to do so. 
I feel there have to be consequences to her actions in order for the pattern of escalation to stop. I can't eat or sleep as the stress is tying my stomach in knots. 

Despite the constant pressure from his family (even calling us Christmas morning to guilt us) We have firmly said we no longer wish to see or hear from her nor will she ever have access to our children again.

I want to know if there's anything I can do legally with the fact that she never attempted to talk to us about these ""problems"", was ""wilfully blind"" to the truth or just plainly made it up. 
 Can I get the report removed somehow and clear my name ? Is there anything at all I can do so that she thinks twice about doing something like this again?

I feel like I live a weight on my chest and am now branded for life as terrible parents.

Any advice on this would be appreciated.

So, my Opa lives in Canada, and my family lives in Australia. Relatively recently, his partner had passed away, which really affected him, since he had lived alone with her for multiple years. He doesn't have kidneys, so he has to go to dialysis. He's been really lonely recently, and also has terrible eyesight, so he finds it hard to deal with things.

This hasn't been particularly helped by his step-son, who is not good with technology, and apparently a bit of an alcoholic. This makes dealing with tech issues extremely hard, since neither one of them knows what we're talking about, and we can't really give much assistance.

Recently, he has also been having some hallucinations, apparently due to the fact that he does not drink very often. I've thought about finding something, or if that's not possible, make something to remind him of things every so often, but. something simple, so that he can understand it.

He got better each day until the day he got fired from his job and his mental health started spiralling into what I would consider depression.

During this time, its expected you get a doctors form filled every month with checkups in regards to your condition (which isn't covered by our work health insurance mind you) $70 a pop. There was a month I was unable to afford the fees, and I communicated this to the third party insurance agent handling my leave case.

Fast forward to early Dec, I finally come off sick leave. After a week of work, I notice that I haven't been paid. Apparently, the insurance company has rejected my last two months of sick leave due to the lack of form, and because of that I get nothing now. In my desperation, I spend what little remains in my savings for the forms in order to appeal that decision, comforted by the fact that I would be getting paid later this month with my second paycheck.....and I don't. Nothing at all. Check pay stub-$0 net pay, despite everything else looking fine, no other fees.  
I emailed the insurance agent to see if the appeal was accepted yet, and I escalated the absence of the second paycheck to HR at my work. Nothing back yet. 

Maybe I'm overreacting, its Christmas and people have time to spend with families, but I can't help but worry if I might get evicted next month...

439,"Hi,

So I (25M) am going through supposedly the roughest times of my life until now. 

I left my (19F) girlfriend when I got accepted in my master's degree in nuclear physics. I right now feel super sick about it, but at least it will allow me to work, leave my parents' place and if I get a part time job in nuclear engineering I will be able to go through a master's degree in math (a domain that I like alot). 

I know it doesn't sound as bad as it is, but I really have a hard time going on with all these life decisions, and even writing it helps me understand it better and go through it.

441,"Since birth I've had terrible skin issues, I've had vitiligo and eczema my whole life. When I was a teenager I started to have terrible acne, even years after (I am 25 now) acne still pop up whenever they want, the last time my skin was clear was when I was 12 years old.

So basically, 20% of my skin is super pale compare to my normal skin tone and I look weird as fuck and look like a fucking cow, I have red eczema breakouts all over my face and body until things got somewhat in control earlier this year, and my forehead and cheeks are covered with acne and acne marks.

Everything is my parents fault, sometimes I just wish they die of a heart attack or something so I can feel better, they deserved it anyway for giving me this, for making my life miserable. 

Not one moment in my life do I feel physically comfortable, it's either the pain from my acne or it is the extremely itchiness from my eczema, my life is a living hell. And it's my parent's fault.

My parents are selfish, they are selfish pricks that gave birth to me knowing that have these fucked up genes. They knowingly give their child they shitty genes. I hate them.

On top of all that they give me the pathetic 5'3"" height, so other men make fun of me, and women are not attracted to me. Another thing these 2 pricks are responsible for.

443,"My friend who I’ve known a long time is pretty rudderless right now. He lives at home, has been out of work for a year and has lately been pretty vocal about not knowing if there’s more to life. He refuses to look for stable employment and works casual shifts at an amusement park where he claims to like working with younger people (early 20s) because they “keep him young.” He had plans to travel this year but obviously that’s not happening. When we meet up he tends to get very heated venting about the state of political/economic current events and how hopeless things are for our generation. He’s not super depressed or suicidal, just very jaded.

What he wants most of all is a girlfriend - he got out of a serious relationship almost 3 years ago but it’s really done a number on him and taken him some time to heal. My female friend and I even helped him set up OLD profiles only for him to go against our advice and then get discouraged because he gets few matches. Lately he’s been more withdrawn, barely responding to messages and seems unenthusiastic about plans (it’s summer here and usually he would suggesting all kinds of outdoor activities and road trips). He’s putting all his energy into this casual job and partying with his younger coworkers. While I’m glad he’s got a distraction from being cooped up at home, all of our friends think it’s a strange step backwards and don’t understand why he is obsessively chasing his early 20s again. Honestly, it seems a little desperate and sad.

We want to help him find his feet but I know he would not react well to being told his choices are unhealthy in any way. When I’ve dug deeper in the past he gets defensive. What should I do? Let him carry on and figure things out for himself?",28Dec2020,1

This will be very rant-y, don't be surprised, I'm very salty right now if you couldn't tell.

452,"  

I am a 28 year old woman from a culturally conservative country. It took a lot of courage to finally write or talk about this. I don’t want pity or sympathy. I just want to make sure that I am not insane. An incident happened during my childhood. When I was around 12 years old, I was sleeping in a room with my father and kid brother. My dad and kid brother shared a big bed and I used to sleep on a single bed in the opposite corner. One day, I suddenly woke up because I felt a presence. I saw no one around me but my top was rolled up and my belly was exposed. I brushed it off as nothing. But then a few days later, I felt a presence and I suddenly woke up from my sleep and switched on the light above my head. I saw my father jumping away from near me on to the other bed. I felt numb. But then again, I just felt a presence and I thought I will talk about it the next day to my parents. Because I love my grandparents and they taught me at a young age to talk about anything that made me uncomfortable. I was a bit terrified to be honest. My first thought was “What if my mom commits suicide if I tell her dad was being weird?” But I gathered courage and when both my parents were present in the room, I jokingly asked “what were you doing yesterday around my bed dad? I switched on the light and I saw you. Did you hear someone at night or something?” He acted as if he didn’t hear me and my mom suddenly said something along the lines of “What are you trying to say…?!” with a serious face. I felt so terrified that I didn’t say anything after that. After that incident, nothing happened for years. Nothing inappropriate. Nothing uncomfortable. For years and years nothing happened. That was the first and last incident and I even thought maybe I dreamt it. But deep down I knew that it was not a dream. Then after many years, when I was in college, one more weird incident happened. I started reading a lot of erotica and started watching porn. Like any other normal college kid, I masturbated a lot. My parents never ever gave me any sort of sex education. But I am a good reader and all the books I read as well as the internet taught me everything (as in from reliable sources like NHS website and books by doctors). I learned online that countries like the UK actually encourage masturbation among teenage kids to avoid unwanted pregnancies. So, I knew that what I am doing is not wrong. That day only me and my dad was home. I forgot to properly lock my door. He caught me reading something but I was completely covered by my blanket. I froze when he barged in and he asked me “What are you doing?” and I said “reading”. He gave me this weird smile and came near me and kneeled beside my bed and asked me again “What are you reading?” I kept saying “Nothing!! Dad, get out” “Nothing!! Dad, get out” “GET OUT” I kept repeating that loudly and what I thought was in a strong voice. But he made me show him the phone screen. It was nothing explicit but it was mildly erotic. Remember, my body was completely under the blanket and only my head and left hand holding the phone were outside. So….to my horror, he started fumbling his hands OVER the blanket as if he is searching for the position of my right hand. So, I said even more loudly “Get out” and he listened. As soon as he got out, I locked the door. After that night I have never slept in any rooms without making sure that my door is locked/barricaded. I spent the entire night thinking that he will tell my mom or embarrass me. But nothing happened. He acted as if nothing happened. So even I started forgetting. But once in a while, I remember these two incidents. My dad never physically touched me and I don’t know whether two incidents count as harassment.  Two incidents in the course of twenty-eight years. One when I was 12 and one when I was 21 or 22. I decided to write about this because not a single soul knows about this and I cry every time I remember them. I keep wondering whether he is a bad person. After that incident, I have travelled alone with him and even lived alone with him for a few years. Nothing inappropriate happened. So, were these two incidents just freaky anomalies? Freaky accidents or not, it left me with some PTSD. I have a hard time opening up to people and trust men. I have anxiety, confidence issues and I feel constantly afraid and unsafe. Even today when the memories popped up, my first thought was “Both my mom and dad will commit suicide if I ever talk about this in front of them.” I realized that the same frightened child is still alive inside me. I know almost all people go through something like this and some even worse. People get raped by their own parents and my experience is nothing compared to that. But today was not a good day and I started crying. So, I thought I will write about it. Am I crazy? Am I making a big deal out of a small issue? Should I try to forget about this?",28Dec2020,1
453,"I just started work as an apprentice electrician for a company in a nearby state. It's a bit of a far drive, butvthey were advertising that they had lots of jobs in my city, and told me that I wouldn't have to travel far off work.

454,"TL;DR: My brother is very depressed but whatever we try to do to help him doesn't seem to work. He won't see a therapist and continues to see his toxic wife, who blames him for everything and puts him down constantly rather than trying to help him get help. This has all driven my mom away to stay in a hotel.

Sorry for the long post, but I feel some of this may be necessary or at least helpful information.

About six months ago at this point, my brother (28M) moved back home with us. He was a naval officer with an aerospace engineering degree, but was medically discharged after being diagnosed as bipolar. After that he worked at PetSmart until his and his ATM girlfriend's (now wife) lease expired. At this point they both moved back home before chasing some outlandish dream of moving to Ireland with no jobs lined up for either of them. After that fell through, they went to Denver with a job lined up for her, but none for him. He does have a Navy pension but it's not enough to survive on on its own. This happened about a year and a half ago, and in that time he has had one job, which he worked two days for before it was shut down due to covid. He has been married a little over a year now.

His wife is also a bit crazy, she claims to have asperger's, which may be true, but her parents tell us their doctor never diagnosed her. She is extremely self-centered, any conversation is hijacked to relate back to her in some way, and any problem she and my brother experience becomes his fault and his alone. A couple months before they moved back here, in about June, he spent some time in a veteran's mental institution because he was feeling suicidal. After being discharged, he was still very clearly depressed and unmotivated. As an example, he spent $500 on a 3D printer, printed a couple things, then just let it collect dust because a small piece that is cheap to order and easy to replace broke. He apparently was having trouble getting dressed in anything that's not pajamas, showering, and cleaning up the house, which came to a head and drove him and his wife both to move back to our hometown, him moving in with our family, and her moving in with hers.

Since moving back, he's made very little progress. He is very depressed and has no direction. All he does is wake up, shower, and scroll Facebook, which he is hopelessly addicted to, for hours at a time until someone tells him to do something. He also continues to go visit his wife, who plays innocent in the entire ordeal, it's his problem to fix, not hers, and because he has issues, the burden of fixing their relationship is all on him. My dad (60M) works full time from home, but that leaves him busy during the day. I work full time in retail, with a fluid schedule, so sometimes I open, sometimes I close, sometimes I do both, basically I'm just not around too often either, and to be honest, I don't like to be home anymore, and look for any excuse to stay out after work, which I know doesn't help. I try to reach out to him, get him to take even a short break from facebook to play video games or card games with me, or even get him involved in some of my zoom card game groups, but he has absolutely no interest, and every time I ask him to play with me, he says something along the lines of ""No, not today."" I offered him to join my D&amp;D game, but that's only one day every other week, and he will only join if his wife can play too, which not only just makes for too many players, but also enables what to me seems like a toxic relationship.

This has put most of the burden of trying to help my brother on my mom, who works around two to three days a week as a church musician, not counting time outside to practice and arrange services. She tries to get him to go outside, go to the gym, look for jobs, but it always seems to be in vain, because if she doesn't personally go with him, he'll just stay on his phone, or if she leaves the house, hell just get back on his phone. She loves my brother very much, but it always comes out as tough love unleashed after her efforts to get him to do anything fail. She has a tendency to keep her feelings inside until it all comes out at once, which results in an hour long scolding of my brother and how she wants him to be better but really she's just spewing out all the bad things about him, or rather the problems that need to be addressed, but in a very spiteful way.

I woke up at 4:30 am today to an email from my mom saying she doesn't like what this is all doing to her so she's taking a vacation, going to stay in a hotel and letting my dad deal with my brother. 

This all honestly all makes me want to move out as well, but I can't afford it on my current job, and haven't had luck with any of the jobs I've applied to. I've never had a great relationship with my family. I love them and they love me but we're not very close and don't spend much time together, and the few times I've opened up to my parents, such as coming out to them, it's been met with bad reactions, backlash, and disrespect. That has always been on the back of my mind and makes moving out an even more appealing option, but they're my family and I'd feel very guilty, as if I abandoned my brother and my parents, but maybe I need to put my own mental health into consideration too.

I just don't know what to do. I want my parents to be happy, I want my brother to get help, I want my family to be okay, but I don't know what to do.

SO I myself identify as Pan and trans. Came out to my mom as bi when I was ~15 and a few years later as trans. She is beyond supportive of me. 

My little brother is now 13 and she has heard him a few times on Xbox talking to his friends and has admitted he thinks he is bi, and a few days later said he thinks he is gay and is afraid our mother will be mad at him. She is perfectly fine with it, but worries about backlash because statistically - guys get bullied a lot more for being gay rather than the other way around. 

Here’s the thing - she is worried that it is a phase brought on by being stuck in the house and left to his own devices. She says she’s known since I was little that “something was up” with me. 

The crowd he has outed himself to are kids he goes to school with (currently only schooling though) but these guys have threatened to kick his ass on multiple occasions. She has asked me to speak to him and basically tell him to watch who he is outing himself to and what he’s saying on the net, and, while it is perfectly fine with it, she wants him to be careful and it’s also normal to question and explore sexuality when going through puberty. She is genuinely afraid of retaliation on him, and since we’re in way south Texas, it’s very common down here. 

My mom has also expressed her concern that he is starting to hang out with younger boys (probably 8-10/our neighbors) and is worried that he’ll act out on his feelings. 

I’m not so good at sitting down and having deep convos with people, let alone my brother. Hoping someone can provide some advice as to how to approach this? I don’t mind talking to him at all and think it would probably be easier on him coming from me rather than our mom. 

Thank you.

TLDR: I (trans FTM/pansexual) have been asked by my mom to discuss sexuality with my 13 y/o brother, who has told “friends” on Xbox (also school “friends”) that he is either bi or gay. My mom is very supportive, but is concerned about retaliation because these kids have threatened to beat him up before. He has also started to hang around younger boys and is afraid that this might be influencing his thought process - she’s afraid he’s going to act out on it with these younger boys and get himself in trouble. She wants him to be wary of who he is telling at this stage because statistically boys are more likely to be bullied because of their sexuality. I don’t know how to approach it with him.",28Dec2020,1

He stopped taking those 5 months ago, and things have been getting worse. Especially the last 2 months, things have just been bad. He seems distant and off, some days are better than others but he’s not how he used to be. 

He went to the doctors Christmas Eve. Got new stronger medication and actually took it which I was proud of. However it made him feel really tired and I don’t think he’s taken it since.

In my teens I borrowed (stole, with the intention of putting back) a piece of jewelry that I found in my moms belongings. 

Now, 13 years later, I am helping my grandmother clean out her cabinet of old heirlooms and she tells the story of this important piece that she was given by her mother-in-law (as a sign of acceptance, since she(European) married in-to an African family( let’s keep it somewhat vague)) and which she had then given my mother when she gave birth to me. 
In other words it has been passed down through generations between mother-in laws.

465,"I live in a third world country disguised as a first world country. I tried getting help and was put in a psyche ward for depression, getting help was the worst thing possible that anyone can ever do. The only people who can say it otherwise are people who were never in a position to get help. Nothing about a mental health facility helps people. The nurses never made me feel safe and the absolute psychopathic people in there really doesn't help. I experienced worse ptsd while I was in there and people threaten to kill me for minding my own business and having nurses laugh at it like its nothing. Then they place me in the same room with the person that ended up threatening my life as my roommate. All I heard all night was banging on the walls beds flipped upside down and the roommate ended up saying repeatedly he was going to kill me and everyone there. I had to witness people breaking glass and disrupting everyone's sleep constantly. during the day time we were only aloud to walk in a circle until we ended up being to tired and go to sleep or we ended up sleeping all day. A person that was in there said prison was more enjoyable than this as you actually had stuff to do in prison. It was a huge waste of time and the nurses just didnt care they just said the people will either be back or they will end up hurting themselves and others. They didnt seem to care that most people that left the facility ended up the same as when they got there or they ended up worse. Mental health care in the third world USA is non existent and to make things worse after suffering 4 days of sleepless nights with food that tastes worse than elementary school lunches i was billed with 1,200$ without insurance but when I got my insurance to cover it the bill went from 1,200$ to 15,000$ and the insurance paid 14,000$ to which I'm only a college student without income. this country is a joke and everyone running it is As well. My advice is to never get help if you cant afford it and if you can afford it see a physiatrist or a physician Never go to a mental health facility and never tell anyone if you are suicidal as it breaks you more mentally and especially financially. It'd be cheaper if I was dead. This country failed me and every ingle person in my position.",28Dec2020,1

470,"I (F17) have a great online friend (M18) whom I met a couple months back as a penpal. We have the same birthdates and we instantly clicked and became friends. A few months later we moved to texting and we usually texted for hours on end. We celebrated our birthday together and I have so many awesome memories with him. I always considered him funny, talented, and an amazing friend.

But I am now doubting that last bit.  
You see.. there are times when he doesn't text me for days, doesn't come online, or either leaves me hanging in the middle of conversations. No good byes, nothing. He goes back offline before I get a chance to respond. And I've never had an issue with this, because I know no one can be able 24/7 and everyone needs some space. I've never questioned him either because I don't wish to come off as clingy. And each time he does this, he always redeems himself by sending me a music piece he worked on, or a meme, or something that basically wins me over again.

Today, after leaving me hanging for three days without notice, he told me he's gonna be rarely online from now on, because he deleted all socials on his phone (to focus better on his musical journey, he has been talking about this for months). He will use his computer to talk, but that would be very rare too.

Which really upsets me. I feel that online friendships.. they don't have physical connections to depend on. I am connected to him by merely one way, and it's almost like he's cutting it off. 

Am I just overthinking this too much? Is it alright of him to prioritise something so much? I don't have much experience with boys as I belong to a rather conservative family, so in that case, is this just some detached-boyish mentality?

Let me explain, my sister behaves in many bizarre ways which i understand is a symptom of her illness but her psychotic episodes have left me traumatized in 2017. She would break stuff, threaten us, burn things, kick and punch us, she threw a shoe at me, destroyed my phone completely, told lies about me to my parents, ruined my room and threw my clothes down a pool all in 2017. I would also wake up to her jumping into my bed and screaming. I was only 16 here so this obviously impacted me. She has gotten better But i noticed sometimes when she displays symptoms i find myself mentally attacking her, i never show it with my actions or words but i do judge her in my head a lot and i hold a lot of resentment for her. I often dont stand up for myself unless in extreme cases bc my family advises me to not go back and forth with her since shes “not aware”, but i noticed she loves to lash out on me and my mom when shes angry or hears voices and its taking everything in me to not lash out back. I dont wanna take disrespect just because she is schizophrenic. I dont wanna make her get used to disrespecting me and me giving her a chance. I read the symptoms about schizophrenia again and i cant help but feel bad for resenting her so much. What do i do?

476," Looking for advice about a University drop out/stay situation. Anyone here ever faced this dilemma and what did you end up doing? There are advantages and disadvantages on both sides for me, also opportunities on both sides of the coin, and thus it's a very difficult call to make. I'm looking for some inspiration, ultimately will talk to a counselor about it, but hearing some personal stories or different perspectives can be helpful. 

Just for reference, I'm about to start my second semester. Pulling out now would give me a chance to get some of the amount invested refunded and my overall debt would be low to a point I can begin to invest on personal projects almost right out the gate, things I've had to sideline for school and the reality of having the next four years mapped out. I'm at a point in my life where I'm still getting to know myself, and so having ''wiggle room'' to explore, or start in on my more outside the box passions, feels crucial and essential, though I feel like dropping out is a huge deal and I don't want to be impulsive about it.

I know there are different solutions for different people, but hearing about how it went for you, and what helped guide your decisions, sounds like positive inspiration to me. I don't normally post on Reddit about this type of stuff but figured I'd give it a shot. :)

Not because I don’t enjoy the job but because I am tired of employers tacking on more responsibilities to us that we do not get paid for, which has happened everywhere I have been so far.

483,"There's a lot but I'm going to try my best to be concise but include all the relevant details. I'm bolding the different sections so you can skip what doesn't interest you.

**Friendships**

I live at home with my parents while I study at the local university. It's about 45 minutes away and while classes were still in person I commuted every day. This made it really hard to be active on campus since it took forever to get home, and I had a hard time making friends my freshman year. Eventually I met 3 other guys that I hung out with 3 or 4 times, and although we're definitely not close, I was starting to think maybe I could create solid friendships with them. I left almost all of my highschool friends behind because they were not good friendships and so I was looking to start fresh.

After Covid, I have barely interacted with those guys. One of those guys reached out this week to us to try and get on Discord or something soon to catch up, and I'm really glad he did, but I still don't know how to advance these friendships, especially with the next semester being online as well. My best friend from highschool transferred to my university this semester, but he has grown in a completely different direction than me and our friendship is truly starting to feel forced. He's actively partying and going out during the pandemic and coupled with some of his other behaviours I'm starting to think maybe we're growing apart. I'm a VERY introverted person so I oftentimes have trouble making close friends or being social, and being so far from campus hurts that but it makes the most financial sense. I also deleted all social media my senior year of high school since I felt it was better for my mental health and happiness but I also feel a bit disconnected now. 

**School**

I'm  studying Computer Science and almost everyone I interact with is just focused on CS. I'm fairly good at school, but these people are constantly focused on internships and learning algorithms and personal projects and all this other professional stuff and it makes me anxious. I just want to get a solid job when I graduate but the opportunities they're getting and some of the skills that a couple of my friends have make me feel worn out and tired of CS. I'm a TA for one of the best professors in our department. I have an internship lined up for this upcoming summer as I finish my sophomore year. I feel I could definitely be good or at least decent at programming, but I barely learned anything this past semester at all. My GPA is still excellent but almost all I care about is that number and I'm not getting much learning out of university right now. I'm not switching out of my major because I do feel like it's right for me but I feel so burned out and it almost makes me want to roll my eyes whenever I hear about programming or CS.

**Fiance's Parents**

My fiance (I'll explain this in a second) attended the same university as me the first semester of freshman year, but her family moved and forced her to come along with them the next semester and we've been long distance for the past year. Her parents and I have a HORRIBLE relationship since they are very manipulative and mentally abusive and I don't put up with that sort of stuff. My fiance will start seeing a therapist soon to help her deal with this situation but she's living at home with them and she always tells me about how miserable and lonely she is. She is my best friend and I'm hers and she doesn't know anyone in her new state. Her parents are honestly insane and controlling and she has a hard time with them. They were initially supportive of our relationship but as things got more serious they started to turn against us. Now I have her dad blocked on my phone because he's taken things too far. My bad relationship with them really weighs on our relationship because they control her ability to see me among other things. I tried for over 2 years to be good to them and make them happy but they've always just looked for things to criticise me for and I don't know how to move forward with them.

**Fiance**

We've been dating for over two years. Before you ask, we plan to get married at least 2 years from now, after I graduate from college and get a job. We decided to get engaged because initially we were going to try and get married next year to help her leave her parents, but she decided against it. We decided to still get engaged because we felt that these two years of long distance would be easier if we were engaged and our relationship was more concrete in the eyes of her parents. We are also very committed to each other. I love her more than anyone in the world. This is the first relationship for both of us but it's been so pure and happy and we are compatible in so many ways. We talk through disagreements and we've been through so much together. 

The only worries that I have are really regarding her family and her own growth. Her entire family has taken the news of our engagement extremely badly and they've been extremely tough on her for it. We come from a very christian background so planning for marriage at our age is fairly normal in our community, but they have still tried to make our relationship fail in so many ways. I'm also concerned because I don't really know who I am right now. I wanted to get engaged to her and she really really really wanted me to propose, but I'm not sure if I want to get married when I graduate anymore. My heart hurts thinking about being attached to her family for the rest of my life. Sometimes I wish that her and I had more interests in common or agreed on a couple of things we disagree on, but I feel like I'm nitpicking. I KNOW every relationship isn't completely perfect and I'm 100% sure ours is better than most. I am so deeply in love with her and I don't want to leave her at all, but at the same time I'm sort of scared. What would be the point of waiting longer to get married if I know I won't leave her unless she cheats on me or something extreme like that? 

It also doesn't help that we've started having sex. We have been sexually active in some capacity for a while now but recently we've started having PIV sex and although we both love it, sometimes I think about how much it would hurt her if we ever did break up and she was left with the perception of being ""damaged goods"" in the Christian community for not being a virgin anymore (for the record I VEHEMENTLY disagree with this point of view). Again I don't want to leave her so I'm not sure why I think about these things but it's been weighing on me more recently.

I've felt so lonely since she moved away. She's really my only close friend. She's been in her home country for the past few weeks and yesterday a storm knocked down the wifi there. I exchanged only a few words with her on Christmas and I get that she's busy and surrounded by family and that it's hard for her to talk to me but it made me feel so...lonely, and it's the reason why I made this post.

**Hobbies**

I've tried to get into some hobbies to alleviate these anxieties and get rid of some of the boredom. I'm a pretty big gamer, but lately video games have just driven me to feeling more lonely and bored. I bought a couple of plants about a month ago to try and brighten up my life but I don't really feel like they're a hobby. I used to play guitar but I don't know where to go with it anymore or how to keep improving beyond learning most of the basic chords I know. I struggle with hobbies because I always feel like they're not worth pursuing since I'll never be AMAZING at them, and those thoughts tend to suck some of the joy out of them. I wanted to get into volleyball but school is online for the next semester so it seems like it won't be a possibility for another while.

I've started drawing again and that's been nice, although again I oftentimes have a hard time enjoying it since in my mind it needs to be perfect. I was learning my fiance's native language but the recent stuff with her parents has really soured it for me so I think I'm going to start learning French instead.  I also sort of let go of my body this year so I'm going to try to get back into weightlifting this upcoming year and tighten up my diet. There's a couple other things I'm looking at but I still feel so empty. Every day flies by and I feel empty. My fiance used to fill that gap but now that she's gone it's wide open, and even when I am with her now I still feel it.

485,"I study away from home, in a city that's 650 km away and I'm staying back with my mum over Christmas. 

And my stepdad is acting weird. He's taken the saying ""kill 'em with kindness"" way too seriously. He always wants to do something good for us. He cooks, cleans, then cooks again, goes grocery shopping for everyone and then asks everyone if we are fine and if there's something we can do for him.If he could actually kill us with kindness than RIP me and my mum, because both of us would have been killed like 3 million times.

And I sound ungrateful as fuck right now, I know. But when I try to help him, he always dismisses it. When I try to do something good, he comes up with something better. Today I decided to surprise my mum with our favourite food and bring home a big load of the town's best sushi. I told him, and now he's in the kitchen to bake cinnamon rolls. 

I don't know if he's planned it beforehand, but now I know for sure that everyone will be too full from eating cinnamon rolls to eat sushi.

And it didn't happen for the first time. Last time I wanted to go grocery shopping for them and he went with me to ""get cigarettes"" for himself. Then he paid the whole groceries before I could do anything and I'm too socially awkward to protest stuff like that.

Worst thing is that he - just like my mum - doesn't do it because he wants to. Everytime I do something wrong or I argue with them he's like ""I always cook and clean and do everything and..."" (You know the drill).

I don't know what to do. I don't trust him, and I don't want him to do nice things. And I want to do nice things as well. But it would sound stupid to go to him and tell him ""hey man, you're being too nice"". To be honest, I tried once or twice, and very very carefully. But he says that he just likes us and simply wants to be nice.

And to limit the amount of times my step dad comes over? 

Anyway my mum has now become ill over the past few days- sore throat, runny nose and loss of taste. She thought it was just a cold until my baby brother developed a cough and now she suspects it could possibly be covid. She ordered the test and sent it away this morning. Afterwards she went to the shops. When I called her out on this she just got defensive and said she didn’t have any choice because she needed to get cat food and then tried to justify it by saying people shouldn’t be standing close to her in shops anyway! 

A few hours later my step dad turns up at the door. She warned him she suspected she had covid yet he didn’t care and she still invited him in. If the test comes back positive, its likely she has already spread it to a lot of people, and now my step dad will catch it and spread it too. They both don’t seem to understand how selfish this is. Yet she loves complaining about other people doing similar things!

488,"I've tried everywhere for help but I've gotten nowhere, and hoping you can help. I play Animal Crossing, and got a wheelchair. I posted to a FB group for ideas because I wanted to be respectful and not use it in any way that was demeaning or offensive. Someone suggested Professor X from X-Men, and I'm like, great! A guy in a wheelchair gets to be a superhero. Perfect! The only X-Men movie I'd ever seen was X-Men Wolverine, and I know for a fact from the Deadpool community that is a terrible movie. So I asked my friends, my Facebook group, the person who suggested it, heck even the X-Men sub-Reddit for ideas for the best way to represent him and things I can research. I was hoping for some kind of action scene, but willing to put something small of him next to something more recognizable from the franchise so people would know it's him versus some wheelchair behind a desk representing Cerebro. The few responses I got said to put him in front of a desk or next to a chess board for playing against Magneto, and both of those sound boring. Patrick Stuart would not play a main character if there was not depth and interest to a character. I'm willing to do research and learn, but when I posted to the X-Men Reddit community, the one real response I got said to not do anything I didn't know about, there was enough garbage out there and to not add to it. Fair enough. However, I don't physically have the time to watch all 11 movies and the cartoon series. I come from a SciFi background. And I know for a fact you don't have to like ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING to be considered a fan and get the main part of the story. For Star Wars, it's okay to not have watched any of the the TV series and all of the movies. Just episodes 4-6 gets you the core of the series. For Star Trek, the top two series to watch are The Original and Next Generation. For the Marvel Universe, it's okay to have only watched the big group movies and not watch all of the character movies etc. Is there a way to get the core of the series to learn about him but not dive deep into the franchise? Am I wrong for wanting good representation but not wanting to be a hardcore fan? I'm willing to listen to all suggestions thoughtfully and respectfully because I don't want on disrespect from what I understand is a very good franchise. Thank you for your time",28Dec2020,1

However, I get really insecure really easily, and I don’t know how to not be so insecure. I’ve caught him looking at other women (porn actors, his ex, and a couple of other girls he had met prior). I’ve asked him to please respect me and our relationship and to not engage in anything. I’m ok with him watching porn, but when I caught him looking at his ex girlfriends Instagram page, it sent me into a dark mindset. I wondered if I was good enough, if he was truly happy with me, and all sorts of stuff. I’ve tried to explain to him that his actions like this puts me in an awful mindset and my confidence has gone down drastically. At the beginning of our relationship he use to make me feel like the only girl in the world. Now I feel like the only unnoticed girl.

For whatever reason though, I am really unproductive and I keep thinking about them.

I guess I am asking for encouragement and reassurance that I did the right thing by prioritising myself and getting temporarily rid of this person who was making me doubt myself and (perhaps unintentionally) hurting me (emotionally).

He showed me pictures of his kids and told me they were his sisters, one of them is severely disabled , these details have really fucked me up. The police involved in this incident didn’t believe that I thought he was 17 and treated me like a whore, they shoved his kids passports in my face to show me he was lying about his age, told me why I didn’t need to date an older man and a bunch of other stuff that has really affected me, I don’t know what they told my parents but I don’t think they really understand what happened (based on some of the remarks I’ve received from my mother). I know how stupid this sounds, but At the time I was insecure and hadn’t really had much interaction with older kids, I partly blame the media tbh - casting 30yr olds as kids, but looking back now I was clearly groomed.

I have everything I could ask for. By standards that I would've made when I was coming up, I'm wealthy. I won't play that down. I can purchase items I previously couldn't afford on a whim. Fair I work every day of the week for 8-16 hours, but I'm making more than enough. 

I'm married to the most amazing wife everyone agrees. I can finally finish my educational ambitions without debt. 

And I have just enough free time to go pursue 2 hobbies almost regularly.

When I picked up fighting again which I used to do a lot and thus reminds me of simpler days it was a phenomenal high which now feels almost like I only go out of routine. Trying to catch that original high again. 

It's pathetic I know. That's partially also why it's an alt account cause I'd be ashamed to say this out loud to anyone. It is a fact that it takes 75' tall building to kill a man my building I work at is 9-10 stories (depending on how you count where you jump)

511,"Hi all, This will be sent through a throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much as the title says, I had an extremely drug-fueled lifestyle for the most part of this year, the backstory isnt necessary but all the drugs I could ever want were on this popular social media sever In my city, I never became addicted to any particular substance because I'm too young to be spending 100s of dollars every week on drugs. but the money I (somewhat) rarely got would mostly go into that. 

I tried anything, at first, it was mostly weed and psychedelics I would \*spend\* my money on but if i had the opportunity to get high on any pill that was around me, i would never hesitate. 

Then it moved to me buying drugs harder drugs (Xanax, cocaine, etc) I however only ever bought them two listed once, but i have bought a lot more stuff and for a 16 year old to be doing cocaine, let alone by himself is really shitty in my opinion, but I wasnt thinking at the time. It was just something I wanted to experience, It felt really good too. Just too short lived for $300 worth. 

My family and girlfriend are amazing to me, My family is completely against drugs and my girlfriend has only tried weed (and is against it now until its legal and shes old enough) 

But recently, I ended up trading something in the servers ""trading"" channel for a particularly bad substance and I seriously can't believe myself for using it, I said I would never again. Then something else I was trading got a response asking if i'd trade that substance for a piece of technology I had. I dont know why but I said yes, I got it and a $100. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like my first time trying the substance was too unexplored, I was on the floor after I used it all til morning, Just looking for more of it. I wanted to do it again. I needed to experience it better. 

This led me onto a 4-day binge of getting more dopamine than i ever had felt in my entire life. I wasn't high for every minute unlike some people are on a binge of this drug, I knew that i had to eat and sleep still even though I pretty much didn't sleep the first two days - slept the second day - and didn't sleep the third day. Well, today is the aftermath of the crash of yesterday, I had the biggest breakdown ever. I was worried my teeth were going to get fucked, I was mentally so worried of my health.

I left all them servers, I said to myself I would work on my self-care, because i have had extremely bad experiences with depression and suicide attempts but everyone in my life thinks its fixed, which I intend to keep that way, Ive built up too much trust to lose, not only that, i have learnt to deal with hiding stuff like this.

That drug was the worst and best thing for me, it let me realize how fucked i was for doing it- then realizing how fucked i was for doing any drug, even weed. I am only 16 years old.

I havent had the easiest life, but its sure been a life where I shouldn't feel the need to indulge in these vices.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's what I need advice for, please if anyone has been through this or can help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel like my life is boring and full of nothing now, I don't know what to do, drugs were my way of dealing with the monotony and pain life brings. 

\- I don't feel like I'm myself, I've built a life around this and now its all gone and I just dont know how to cope.

\- What can i do to make myself feel like I'll be okay? 

\- How do i prevent this from happening again, not that it could because ive left the servers permanently with no form of way to get back in, but if the situation arises where it might happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please if anyone is able to help me or willing to give me more advice that would help. I would be so grateful. I have absolutely no one to talk to other than my own thoughts right now. 

Apologies for any grammar/spelling mistakes, I am not the best at spelling and punctuation. I hope that I made everything clear, If anyone has any questions or clarify do not hesitate to ask, I won't judge or get mad, I know i was too young to be doing this and so this is my fault in the end, even though a lot had led me to even TRY drugs to begin with but i 100% take full responsibility. 

TLDR: Fucked my brain up on drugs, left that lifestyle, I feel shit and i need advice which is all written above or any other advice people can give, please i am so messed up right now :(",28Dec2020,1

**I'm looking for advice on how to help a friend with depression.**

She's  (F25) been going through a rough time these past two years, trying to  get a job and move out of her parents' house, but she's not finding  anything. She says she wants to work in her field and have a steady  income (pretty ok standards), but with covid everything has gotten even  harder and she's very frustrated.

She  was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years back, and has  been medicating and going to a psychologist on and off ever since. But  she seems to be in a very dark place right now. Whenever we talk she  can't seem to stop herself from crying, telling me she doesn't know what  to do anymore, that she's tired of nothing working out. She tells me  she cries almost everyday, that she's exhausted of feeling this way.  Even her parents have made a few commments on how they are getting a bit  tired of her being this sad all the time. They love her, and her mom  supports her a lot. But I guess it's very draining to have someone in  her state around all day.

Lately I  don't know what to say to her. At the beggining I tried reassuring her  that covid was a bad time to be looking for work, that something would  come up when everything came back to normal. That she needed to hold on  for a bit. But she doesn't believe me. She says she's already tried for  so long and has gotten her nowhere, she doesn't believe it's ever gonna  happen. I tried telling her that she can't be putting all this pressure  on herself, that she should do other things other than looking for work  (hobbies and other stuff to keep her mind off things). But she says she  doesn't feel like doing anything, nothing brings her joy anymore. So she  just does nothing all day.

I'm so  worried. When she calls me crying asking me what she should do, I don't  know what to say. I try telling her stuff about my day, distracting her  a little, but she gets even sadder when she hears about my life and my  job. So I'm asking here for advice.

We gather at my friends house Ally's (not real name for obvious reasons), around 8-9 people, no parents, just 17 year olds.
We get on getting some drinks, most of us were a little drunk or high, still having fun tho.
A little backstory: Ally, the girl whose house we went to, has been having several panic attacks and weird mood changes the past year, we don't know exactly why, neither does she, we just assumed it's the regular high school/exams whatever anxiety type of thing. Keep in mind that she has admitted to some of us about selfharming, getting tattoos ""to prevent her from cutting"" and things like that. 

Another girl in the group is Mary, she has depression, definitely not going well, she is seeing a psychiatrist and is on meds, is self harming too and suicidal for some months now, never has tried to go further tho (as far as we know)

So both of the girls were drunk, at some point they left us and went somewhere alone, we didnt really think anything about it, we are a big group and this happens a lot. 

After a while I entered the room they were in for some reason and Mary was crying, pretty regular, i stayed a little with them, trying to comfort her etc, but then left again.

Some time later, the girls still alone, Ally's boyfriend who went to check on them comes to us shocked, just tell us someone go stay with Mary. I go, find her in the bathroom sitting on the toilet, crying as if she was dying, she started hitting me, screaming, as if she went crazy. Later on she told she was in the bathroom with Ally, both crying, they found razors, and they were ready to cut their veins and then Ally's boyfriend found them and stopped it. 

I don't know how far true this is, but Ally's boyfriend DID find them in the bathroom with razors in their hands, and Mary is a really honest person, she would never lie about a situation this serious.

There isn't much more to the story, we just spent the rest of the night shocked, everyone is trying to calm down the girls and asking ourselves what we now have to do.

And that's what im asking, what are we supposed to do as their friends? Their parents are literally in their own worlds, and their mental health is going from bad to worse. We don't know how to handle situations like this and nobody teaches these things at school. How are we supposed to help our firends? They are in danger 
Also it seems as if they are having bad influence to each other, the have told us themselves that they relate on things others can't relate to, some time ago they were even working on some ""Anorexia Project"" type of shit and were congratulating themselves on not eating for days or i don't know what.
Do i have to tell our other friends that weren't there that night what happened, or is it just gonna make things worse?

524,"First a bit of backstory: I (19M) have suffered heavily with my mental health for most of my life. It got to the point where last year I developed full blown pyschosis and went into crisis treatment. I should have been hospitalised but my parents didn't want that for me and me at the time trusted them. Somehow it got to september where I started uni and for a few weeks things were decent but then due to a few bad ""friends"" I had another pyschotic episode directed at them and lost everyone. Last November I tried to take my own life twice once I was found and brought to hospital. The next I didn't take enough meds and woke up. After that I stopped attending uni and instead went out every other night and drank alone the days in between.

Cut forward to today I spent 6 months at home for Corona where I drank every night. My parents made me call up an alcoholic helpline who essentially said to me you not addicted you just need mental help. It's a coping strategy but keep going and mabye it will become a problem. I felt crazy but I got to second year (only passing first mind you outta sheer luck and the all the leanience marks with a 45% average) and around Halloween i learnt the truth. I tried to kill myself again and I called random numbers in my phone the first person I got through to was a childhood friend who understood. I was confused but she said that my parents where emotionally abusive to me and it made so much sense. I cried for the first time in years and I truly believe it saved my life. Third time was always the charm as they say.  I've come home for Christmas. I'm still really Ill. I'm killing myself drinking. But I'm at the house where I grew up and with that information in my head everything just feels foreign like I'm living with strangers. I also know for a fact that being here is causing me PTSD from the panic attacks and the feeling of always being on edge this past week. I usually feel unwell but not in this way. I've got it said in my head that I need to move away.

Now for me asking advice from you. Im in London I can't stay in London. I need to go somewhere and start afresh where my parents can't reach me or control me or manipulate me anymore. I'm dropping out of uni it's already in the works but I'm lost. In this climate I need to find a place where I can get serious potentially inpatient care for my mental health. Find a job so I can live and don't rely on there money. And learn where to get a set of new friends in this current climate. I have 6 months to sort things before the money I get as a uni student expires. There won't be one solid plan but anything people know would be appreciated. Any similar stories. I really hope this makes sense. I do stem because essay writing is not my strong suit will answer questions and DMS are open. Thank you.",28Dec2020,1
525,"For starters im a truck helper meaning i ride with truck drivers an help load an unload. I pretty much get along with all the drivers except one. Now this driver is the type the he expects the helper to just sit there an be quite an dont speak less spoken to. Truth be told im fine with this cause i have my headphones on so know big deal.

Now on this day i look at the paper an see im working with him. Im annoyed but it is wat it is so i just figure ill just get the day over with. So he comes in an sees im working with him an stright tells me im not bringing my headphones. Im like why not you have yours an we have 13 stops so its gonna be a long day so wats the problem. He tells me because im the fucking driver an i fucking say so an walked back to the truck yard.

It happened by coincidence that I was not working when the pandemic hit. I had gone on leave from my job at a grocery store (as a bagger/cashier) to deal with some personal mental health issues in January 2020. Of course, by March the pandemic came but I still held out hope that it wouldn't last too long and I could get back to work. That didn't happen. It only got worse, and I didn't feel comfortable working again. I'm still technically on leave, but I don't see myself going back till the virus is totally gone. 


Both of my parents are in the high-risk category for COVID-19. If they were infected they would almost certainly become seriously ill, and could even die. So it would be pretty dangerous for me to go back to my old job where I'm working with the public every day, as I could easily pick up the virus and give it to my parents. I do not feel comfortable putting my parents' lives on the line, as they run their own graphic design business that just barely pays for all the bills around here. So, really, I can't work in any job where I'm interacting with others I don't think. 


What other options do I have? I typically earn money over the summer by playing music for farmer's markets, but I couldn't this year as they were all either canceled or weren't doing live music. Besides my musical skills, I don't really have anything that makes me particularly desirable. Additionally, my father keeps track of all my finances, so I can't make any money in an ""underhanded"" way (i.e., i can't, say, start an OnlyFans). I tried to start a YouTube channel in August, but that's not really growing much and it isn't even monetized yet. 


So, what advice do you have? I need to make money somehow, I'm not qualified for unemployment or even the stimulus checks, so since January I've only been spending money and not gaining anything. I need some way to make money soon, but it seems like I have no options that would be safe for myself and my family.",28Dec2020,1
527,"So a little backstory before my problem. My last relationship ended because of him cheating and acting single, lying and hiding things from me. We broke up and I was really heart-broken for half a year but then I continued my life and met my current boyfriend. He is really good to me and treats me wonderfully. But the problem is that because of my last relationship, I just can't trust him even thought I know he is honest and only wants me. I always accuse him of cheating when he's talking to other girls and I end up crying hysterically because I'm scared. We have only been together for 2 months and It's already a complete disaster... Tonight he came home from work and told me that he thought about us and decided to broke up with me. I really don't want it and I begged for one more chance. I promised to go to therapy and change myself. I really wanna try. I know that I'm not like this and I'm like another person during these crying sessions. 
Does anyone have any tips and tricks to make that relationship work. And also some advice for me to not accuse him. I'm also a huge overthinker so that plays a big part of all of that.

528,"I was brought on as a contract programmer for a very large finance company. I went through their HR on-boarding then waited for further instructions. After a week of no communication, I reached out to the manager who I'm supposed to report to. He said they were busy with year-end and that he'd reach out when things calm down. After another week, I emailed him. He sent a rather rude reply saying ""I know you're eager to impress us with your years of experience, but we are in the middle of a very busy year-end close process. As I said before, I will reach out when the time is right.""  This was 3 weeks ago.  I'm not sure if he's confused and thinks I'm a vendor soliciting work.

I replied that it depends on the total package including holidays, bonuses etc and not just the monthly salary. It also depends on what ppl with my experience are getting in the market. I would like to continue with them but let's discuss in detail. I told them to discuss around mid January. That's when my holidays end.

534,"I’ve had issues with food my whole life. I’ve always been a picky eater (although I have made a lot of improvements with it since I was a kid) and always ate very small amounts. Dad used to make me sit at the table for hours just to finish my one plate of food and I’d usually end up disposing of it discretely when he wasn’t in the room. I wouldn’t really eat the lunches he’d pack for me while I was in school. Nowadays I typically run on coffee, nicotine, and the occasional snack. 

I’m 23f, 5’2, and 96 pounds. I barely eat once a day and even then it’s not really what would be considered a proper meal. I work a pretty physical job, I’m on my feet all day, running around and lifting things I consider to be pretty heavy. Max I can lift is 50 pounds and it’s a struggle. I feel like shit all the time because I’m literally starving. But the thing is, I can tell that I feel hungry. I know I’m cranky and irritatble because I’m so hungry. But I have no appetite, like at all, pretty much all the time. I’ll make myself something to eat and I rarely finish even a third of it. I just have zero motivation to eat.  I smoke pot and it used to help me a LOT with my appetite and actually being able to eat at least one full meal, but not so much anymore. 

I know it’s not healthy to live this way, and I’m tired of feeling crappy and hangry all the time. But it’s so hard to make myself eat just about anything, on top of just not having time between work, taking care of the house, and general apathy for self care due to depression. Food is just entirely unappealing to me. The act of making and eating food is like a turn off if that makes sense. If I could survive without ever having to eat I’d be ecstatic. 

Definitely less major of an issue, but I’ve always been super self conscious about my appearance. I’ve always hated my face and my body. I’ve been wondering if I was a healthy weight would I feel different about myself? I feel like I can’t even really complain about that given that a lot of people make comments about how my body type is ideal and I know people on the heavier side feel what I feel but so much worse, on top of the general shame society imposes for being heavier set. 

How can I fix my eating habits? How do I make myself enjoy food, which is the stupidest problem to have?",28Dec2020,1

536,"long story short. my one friend hermione was best friends w harry for like 7 years but was lying to him ab dating ron for months bc harry refused to be in hermiones life while she was dating ron. after hearing both sides multiple times, witnessing the lying and how it was tearing them apart/creating a divide, after hermione had options to stop lying i told harry ab the lying. he’d been suspicious for soo long and basically already knew but after a lot of deliberation i decided to tell him bc i thought it would help both hermione and harry and that they could finally work things out and everything would be out there. i genuinely thought i would be helping hermione bc i had been in a similar situation w myself and sometimes wished someone would just tell my lie so i wouldn’t have to. i now see that i crossed a line and betrayed trust and now harry refuses to talk to hermione about anything and is being stubborn and kinda petty. now hermione blames me for ruining her friendship w one of her closest friends harry. i talk to her about the situation whenever she wants, i out effort into our friendship, when she asked me to stop being good friends with harry i chose her over him and stopped talking/hanging out with him even tho i didn’t rly want to. when she asked me to talk to harry and convince him to talk to her, i did many many times and was constantly in the middle of it. she’s currently very mad at me ab it lol ! but when she first found out (from a friend that i told harry which i will also admit was a mistake bc i should’ve been straightforward w her initially but just let the situation be and decided that when she finds out i’ll be honest w her and talk to her about it) she was upset but after a little time, got over it bc we are best friends and she doesn’t hold grudges for long but i agreed that what i did was wrong but had good intent and that i was/am sorry for what i did and the pain i caused her. then everything was pretty much normal (she was still upset about the situation but we were still friends and it moved on to harry being petty and stubborn) and now all of a sudden she’s extremely peeved at me. calling me names and saying it’s all my fault, that i did it for attention, because i’m jealous of her relationship with harry, and that i care so so much about what other people which are all just flat out false. i used to care more which is why i can confidently say now that i don’t care. was i really being that bad of a friend for doing that? am i just oblivious to my horrible actions? i’m not that upset about her being mad at me bc it’s also just kind of how she is but i’m annoyed bc i’ve put so much effort in the past 3 years i’ve been friends with her and i feel unappreciated sometimes but i don’t want to make things ab me. and that i understand now that what i did was wrong and that i hurt her but it’s not like shes never hurt me or others and it’s not like we haven’t been through a lot together even after the situation happened. but of course it’s my fault and of course i brought this upon myself and of course i was me who told harry bc everythings also my responsibility and it’s always my fault and i’m just a loser at life i guess. and that’s just how it is :/",28Dec2020,1

543,"Hi all,

I'll try and keep this as succinct as possible and only provide relevant details. If anybody has been in a similar situation or knows of any good resources for help and advice I would love your input.

So, some years back my parents ran into a bit of financial trouble which essentially meant they were going to lose the house. Me, being the oldest and most ""sucessful"" sibling was asked if I could help them out. I ended up buying the house off them for considerably less than market value and the equity I was getting would partly cover what I suppose would be their ""rent"".  Note that I am not receving any money from them in lieu of rent or payments towards the mortgage. Not an ideal situation, but they are my folks and I dont want them going into retirement witout a roof over their heads. So far, so good.

Meanwhile one of my younger siblings breaks up with his girlfriend (he was living in her house) and ""temporarily"" moves back in with parents. Said sibling is not particularly responsible and to make matters worse my mother is a total enabler.

4 years later the sibling is still there living rent free, being treated like he was still a teenager by mum (cooking, cleaning, looking after his dog when he's at work, etc) and payng in keep barely enough to cover food and bills to my parents.

Now my financial situation has changed slightly and paying 2 mortgages is not quite as easy as it was before. Sibling is running his own business but becuase of mum's enabling bascially has no idea about the real world cost of living and likely unaware that he's indirectly now become dependant on me financially as I am bascially paying his rent. Its probably worth noting that if he wasnt living at my parents I would probably have stayed there for a while myself until I sorted myself out again and avoiding the double dip mortage situation I am in.

So I need to do two things, first is to get mum to stop enabling him to live like he is a teenager and pay his fair share (she is well aware she is an enabler btw and doesnt seem to want to curb it). Second is to have a talk with my sibling to make him realise he is bascially mooching off me right now and things need to change. He has a habit of acting out and throwing a strop when confronted with anything that doesnt go his way (yeah, thanks for that mum).

So... any ideas?",28Dec2020,1

I was eligible for crb, but had to quite because my moms works at a nursing home and her work requested for her household to keep within their household; my job started getting harder as a cleaner (I worked at a clinic and every room needed sanitizing afterwords), my boss initially I’d have lots of free time to do school but I didn’t and she added told me about
more tasks to do after a couple days, I told her that work was getting in the way of schooling, and said she wouldn’t hire anyone else part time; I got 2 months worth of CRB because the government worker on the phone said I was eligible, I call to make sure again and they say no ($900/biweekly). I said my boss was overworking me, my other reasons and I have a grandmother at home, and my disability (depression/anxiety were getting worse). They said having someone old at home doesn’t make a difference and it’s your boss’s job to help you find a safer place to work: I CAN’T IM A CLEANER I CANT WORK FROM HOME. So now I have to pay that back. 

I’ve been living off of my savings for the past couple of months now I have hardly any saved. I’ve been living couch-to-couch for 2 months and have been in my new apartment for 1. After high school my parents wanted me to pay $300 a month (June-December= $2,100) and they let me have the option of paying it by the end of the yr, so I’ve been putting money aside. 

By expecting $900/biweekly I’ve finally been buying healthy food like spinach and more vegetables than just can-goods, getting a bed frame, winter jacket, boots, a dresser, toiletries etc, decorations to feel comfortable (I didn’t worry about $$ as much because I was counting on that check. Now I have to pay what I got from the government back. I have $10 in my my account, my phone bill is on the 30th.

My minutes are all up and I can’t call my provincial feed phone line and I found out they’re close until Jan 4th. My anxiety makes it so hard to just go outside and go to a foodbank myself. But I know I’ll have to eventually.

Many people could say I could just get a job–I wish I could. I’m at my breaking point. I’ve been abused all my life by my parents and it’s caused so much trauma. I’m finally out and it took so much out of me just doing that (worked so hard to find an affordable/clean place with good roommates in a safe spot of the city). School is hard enough and it’s hard to focus and do work at the same time. 
I’m getting help applying for welfare (Income Assistance) with a nonprofit organization (I emailed my caseworker 3 weeks ago never heard back yet), I also mentioned in my email that I was in need of their foodbank services. 

Trying to apply for welfare is a long process and I’m scared I won’t get it because they have to look at my bank statement and wonder why I had a decent amount of money that I just took out before I applied. 

I don’t know how long this process will take. But it takes awhile. My landlord is really nice, so hopefully I can talk to her about this. But if she kicks me out then I understand and I’ll have to move back home again. 

I think about my situation and know I have it better than other people but all I want to do is cry. I wish I was around family this Christmas. It’s so hard to see people my age having things given to them. I know people in my situation have survived and were able to push through but my sensitivity and depression get the best of me. A friend invited me to spend it with her but I just didn’t want to be a burden and I’d probably be too emotional. I never thought I’d be in a situation like this and my mental health is so much worse. And all the present I got I have regifted other other friends because now I can’t afford to give them anything. Except for 1 chocolate bar which I ate for breakfast and lunch.

551,"I grew up poor. Not going to get into specifics or anything. No, I am not looking for pity. Just stating a unfortunate fact. 

Anyway, I didn't get to buy many new things growing up. I was the youngest of 5 so that means I had to share most stuff and got all of the hand-me-downs from my siblings. 

Growing up I was jealous and resentful of many kids from my school because most of them were spoiled entitled trust fund/rich kids. (I went to snooty, middle-class public schools in middle/highschool.) 

Example of what I mean:
I remember one instance in middle school where a girl 2 years younger than me started a conversation about going to the Spa and getting the ""full treatment"" every.... single...... week on Sundays ever since she was 8yrs old. She casually asked what treatments I like getting, as if going to the Spa every week was a normal/common thing to do. I told her that I've never been to the Spa but I have sometimes did some of the ""at home spa"" stuff before. She literally gasped in shock and looked at me like I was crazy. She asked why not and I answered that we never had the time or money to spend on something like that. She told me that I was crazy and that it wasn't too expensive. We got into an argument and she walked off and said that I was ridiculous for never have been to the Spa. I have many more stories like this of many different people.

The point is I grew up poor and jealous of others that had money to spend on trivial and material things when I did not. 

Now that I have my own money, I have slowly noticed that I have begun to spend too much money on things I don't really need but want. Also that I seem to like to collect groups of things I don't need as well.  

Example: A while ago, I got into the hobby of Crafting and Scrapbooking so I bought tons of paper, stickers, tape, markers, pens, etc.... After a while I stopped doing it but found that I had an entire ROOM full of crafting and scrapbooking supplies that I had bought and collected. I pack them up in boxes and kept them in one room. Next hobby was Journaling and Planning. Same thing happened. Now my current hobby is Reading. I have bought and collected tons of books on multiple subjects. 

And it's not just hobbies but with average things as well like clothes, shoes, cleaning supplies, food, ect...

I have realized that I am becoming a shop-aholic and potential horder. What do I do to stop this? How do I stop? 

I can't help it. It's like I subconsciously want to make up for my childhood of not getting to buy/have new things.",28Dec2020,1

553,"English is not my first language so i apologize in advance for any mistakes. I’m also pretty new to reddit so i hope i’m not doing anything wrong. 

So pretty much the title, I (17F) made an appointment with a therapist about a month ago because i thought i needed help. Now, I’m kind of ashamed to say this but i don’t remember why I did it. I was really convinced that i needed help, so it wasn’t like an impulsive action and i know that i was really feeling like shit but now that i think about it i don’t know why and i’m not sure if that brief feeling is valid enough to ask for professional help. 
I also never had “bad thoughts” or experiences that could have traumatized me. 
The only things that seem remarkable to me are that i don’t have a great relationship with food (even though nothing bad ever happened) and sometimes i get really anxious for nothing. i’m also pretty sure that i have a maladaptive daydreaming disorder but it’s not considered a real disorder and i feel like the therapist which i’ll go to probably won’t even know about it and will think i’m crazy or something like that.

A little context about these things: 
During the first lockdown i had bad anxiety attacks and a few little ones in the months after but they might’ve been episodes that will not happen again; I have always found myself binge eating out of boredom or anxiety and always felt guilty about it, only recently, from september to the end of november i’ve been counting my calories and even though i helped me lose weight and stop binge eating, it made me feel really bad, and i don’t think it’s good practice for anybody’s mental health, especially for someone like me that doesn’t like her body and is really insecure. Regarding maladaptive i’ve had it since i can remember, and even though it takes a lot of my time, it doesn’t really harm nobody and actually kind of helps me get out of a life that I’m never satisfied with.

I feel like this things are just bad things that happen to everyone (beside maladaptive but i feel like i can live with it) and that i’m making a big of a deal of something that it’s really not worth it.

555,"Hello everyone

Im sorry if this is weird or whatever but I'm desperate now. Never thought I would have to do this but I'm also grateful that I can do this in the first place. Sorry if Im all over the place but I cant string my thoughts into one straight line.. Im currently staying at someones house with their friends and Im stuck. To give you context, Im still in high school and my father recently kicked me out of his home. Ever since mom died in 2014 he really started to drink a lot more and he wasn't a good person. Most of the time his drug addict brothers stayed with us and it wasn't good. The plan was to stay with him till I graduate so that I can either (most likely wont happen..) get a scholarship or find an other way to go to college or leave the city and just go away as fast as possible. I know some might think why did I stay, but mom loved him and told me to take care of him. She never knew what he did when she was still alive, she was battling breast cancer and I didn't want to burden her even more.. Either way, in early November  I was out with a friend of mine. I usually hang out with her at night to try and avoid father and his siblings. She is a really good friend of mine and we both wanted to be in a relationship but we didn't want to come out yet (live in a very intolerant place) so we were keeping it on the low during that time. Back to that night.. I was out with her and when I came home my father wasn't too drunk and he started to interrogate me where I was and what I was doing. Im a really shitty liar so of course he freaking saw though my lies and long story short, I really fucked up and he found out about my sexuality. When I'm terrified I tend to forget the basics and that really screwed me up. I hate myself for that. I don't want to go into what happened later but because of my stupity he threw me out. I contacted my friend and told her what happened, she wasn't supportive and said that we should have never done what we did.. long story short we ""broke up"" and she hasn't talked to me since. luckily I knew a guy whom I knew from my job before tudoring and he was friendly to me (kept in contact cause I thought he was a decent guy and all) and told him the situation and begged him to let me stay at his place. I do make money tudoring people in math/physics/biology and chemistry so I am able to pay for food and a little for the rent. Sorry if this is long.. either way, I mentioned earlier he lives in a house with his friends. I didn't realize what was going on there until a few days after I settled in when he came to me and told me that id have to pay him back for what he did and that id have to work for him. He wouldn't accept my money and now Ive had to do things to strangers in orderfor me to stay at his house. If I don't do it then he will get mad and I'm scared to see what might happen.. 

IM sorry for this but I don't know what to do anymore. I want to finish high school and go to college. if not that then just have a stable (thanks covid..) job and leave this city but I cant put my education in jeopardy or my father. As much as I hate my father I cant fuck it up for him so that he gets into big trouble. Mom would hate me and I cant let her down. Im scared and I don't know what to do anymore.. this really is messed up.

 Im so sorry if this was all over the place but my mind is very fogged up and I just need advice. Im so sorry if this was the wrong place to do this and im sorry if this is inapropriarw. I do wish everyone here nice holidays and that everyone stays as healthy as possible. Have a good day and thank you very much :)",28Dec2020,1

558,"ok I (F15) need some serious help. There is this guy that I am legitimately infatuated with, he is in the grade above me and nearly every time we pass eachother we make eye contact. The issue lies in the fact that he is really popular and hangs out with all the popular kids in his year and while I do understand that I am quite beautiful, I have ultimately no people skills and play minecraft with my girlfriends all day. I also found out that a year ago while he was drunk and high he slept with one of his friends in front of his (now ex) gf then denied it was cheating because he ""didn't nut"" LMAOOOOOO :/ haven't talked to him but judging from what people have told me and his social media he only got over her about 5 months ago and has had a complete personality switch (apparently). He sounds like a really horrible person (which he might be) but I cannot stop thinking about what it would be like to date him. Should I try and get over him (how)? Should I try and shoot my shot at being his gf (how)? I would probably even be satisfied hooking up with him and never talking again but I wouldn't even know how to go about doing that.",28Dec2020,1
559,"I've (F26) been living with my roommate Rob (M27) for about three years and when he was sober, we used to be close friends.

During quarantine, his depression worsened and he started drinking and getting high again.

Last year, we had a conversation about what I should do if he went off the rails and he told me back then that I should call his parents. But back then, neither of us thought that would actually happen because he'd been sober and happy for so long.

His parents are putting him through grad school, paying his rent, and paying for his therapy, but I'm guessing they don't know that he's usually drinking/high while working from home, doing homework, in class, and in therapy. Rob is moving out soon because I can't deal with his addiction anymore. His parents increased his allowance so he can live alone in his next place.

I'm torn about telling his parents. On one hand, they absolutely love and support him. (They flew cross country last year to be with him after he had surgery). On the other hand, I think Rob would be deeply humiliated if his parents found out how dependent he is on substances.

Rob hasn't gotten fired and as far as I know he's passing his classes. He still does zoom therapy twice a week. He leaves the oven on, leaves the front door unlocked, leaves candles burning all night, and garbage piles up to the point where most surfaces are covered in dirty plates and empty beer cans.

I'm worried that when he moves out, all of this will get much worse without another person around to remind him to take care of himself, but also not sure if his behavior is truly to the point where it's warranted for me to stick my nose into his family business.

Do I call his parents? Do I just let him move out and forget about him?",28Dec2020,1
560,"So I’m only 19, but I can’t help but feel guilty about my life outside of high school so far. For the longest time I was so sure I would go to college in some big city for filmmaking, I truly believe that it is still my one true career love. My plans changed when I started to realize how hard it was to get a real good paying consistent job in that industry. I graduated, then planned on going to a community college for Physical Therapy instead, which I had no real drive to do as I’ve never been interested in any type of medical field (Idk why I applied for that course? What was I thinking??) .

I dropped out before school even started and began working at a local shoe store, where I make $8.58 an hour. I live on my own and work basically full time (part time at the shoe store, and part time at my family’s farm that pays $12 an hour). I tried to get into tattooing, as I’ve always been heavy into art and drawing. I was decent at it, but I was going about getting an apprenticeship wrong. I got in trouble with the health department for doing them at my house (which I know was dumb), then got into it with a crackhead from a local shop. I began to fall out of it, not being as interested anymore, turned off by how the situation was going. 

Now, as the new year begins, I hope to quit my job at the shoe store (after about a year and a half) and get job/internship at a local custom car painting shop. Still a very art driven job, and something else I like. 

So basically my problem is: all the things I’m genuinely interested in, the industry is very hard to get a good paying, consistent job in, and I don’t know how to get into them. I love writing, I would love to do screenwriting. I love film, I would love to direct, I love drawing and painting, so anything with murals, custom drawing, etc I would love to do. 

I’m feeling really down about where my life is going, I feel like it’s going nowhere and it’s getting late to do anything (which I know it’s not). Any encouragement or advice would be nice.",28Dec2020,1
561,"Hey everyone I am not really sure why but my roommates puppy has been distancing from me and doesnt seem open to me.

I know its his dog but the issue is when he goes to work I need to let her out to pee in the mornings and when I'm back from work. She would let me take her out up until about a month ago and would have no problem approaching me. 

But now the only way she will leave is if I pick her up. I dont know if this is what she doesnt like. 

The only reason I can think of her maybe being scared to approach me is shes picking up on my anxiety. I started having some family problems that are clearing up and it was when these problems started that she started acting distanced.

Before I start telling you my life, I will precise several things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. My main language is not English.      I once talked about it on a forum in my language, but it did not help me      much. Sorry for the mistakes. Ask if you don't understand something, tell      me if there's something I can change.
2. I am asking for your advices,      for money eventually if you think it could help me, or maybe you could      tell me how your own life is going on.
3. I will first introduce you my      father then I will present myself, and then the story of my life.
4. Thank you.

\-----------------

My father

\----------------

I won't talk too much about details. Simply he married once before marrying my mother. He has a son with that woman, who more or less went through the same thing as me and tried to suicide multiple time. The woman left him one day. She asked him to go buy a washing machine. When he came back, there was only one letter. She had asked friends to help her take everything away. The first time I heard this story, I felt sad for him.

He married my mother later. It was for Christmas. It happened like this. First, he left my mother and tried to stick the pieces back with his ex-wife. When he saw that it was impossible, he came back to my mother and proposed to her. 

   
 

   
 

I was born in 1997. The first years of my life were happy, well it is what I thought at that time. My mother cried often. But I did not understand much what was going on. When I arrived in primary school, I started getting unhappy. I got bullied regularly at school. I don't know why. At home things seemed ok for me. It wasn't.

When I arrived in college, I started to get bullied for real. I had difficulties making friends. Then we moved to another city. We stayed one year in the city. That was the happiest year in my childhood. Because of the crisis of 2008, my parents were forced to go back in the city where we once were.

I had to go back in the city where I got bullied, but I was lucky as I managed to get in a private college. There I got bullied once again, but it was only mockery. 

I was slowly growing both physically and mentally. And I started to perceive things differently. When I was 7 years old, I tried to suicide myself. I don’t exactly remember why. I noticed only when I was in my 20, that I had always been a shell with nothing inside. I did not realize what was happening around myself.

When I was in Secondary School, I had a dream. One day I would be 18 (majority in my country) and I would be able to leave home. It would be a rebirth. 

I spent all of my time in Secondary School and Highschool without friends. At the time I took this well, because I knew that my time of happiness would come.

Slowly I was realizing the incoherence that were present in my home. My mother cried often. Each Christmas. Each one. My mother would cry, and it was the saddest moment of the year. It has not changed, as at the time I’m writing this we are the 12/28/2020. Also I was not allowed to leave my house. I don’t know my neighbors. That interdiction lasted until I was 18. I was also not allowed to have a cellphone. I did not go to parties, etc… 

Alright. For now it’s a classic story, and I would say it’s not even interesting to read.

When I turned 18, I instantly chose to go to a faculty, at 600km from my house. There were other faculties a lot closer. But I wanted to escape. It was the time where I would realize my dreams. Things did not go well. There is so much to say. I will try to say the least possible. The first difficult thing I had was the sensation of freedom. I had difficulties walking on the street, I had difficulty walking. I was scared the night when sleeping in this unknown location. But I think it’s common for every student. I failed my first year at the faculty. I still didn’t know what was going on at that time. I asked myself why I had failed. Of course it was my bad. When I came back home, my father did not want to pay another year of studies for me. It was my fault, I had not studied enough. And it was true. I had not studied enough. But why.

And I realize why. Because my sister was still in the same hell than me. Because my childhood was affecting me. I couldn’t socialize. I couldn’t work. I now knew that I had never met anyone with the same difficulties in their life than me. Never. Of course, I know there are people who lived worse things than this. And I didn’t meet a lot of people at that time, I often stayed at home, in my nest. But it’s not the end of this story.

So, I came back home. My father proposed me to work with him. He is an artisan. He promised me that he would help me, form me. The first year already, things were difficult for me. You have to know he treat very well his employees. Of course. All the blame always fall on me. My mother once tried to help him in his business, but she abandoned as he was impossible.

I didn’t know at that time that I was already trapped.

Of course. With my father, everything has always been a trap. My mother is trapped. He forced her to stop working. Now she has no revenue. She had no friends as no one in the family goes out. But I don’t pity much my mother. Of course I pity her. But she has chosen what is happening to her. She chose to marry that man. She chose to have children with him. Me? I did not choose to be born. I did not choose for things to go like this.

But I will say the truth. If it was only me, I would have left all of this. Even if I was poor, it would suffice to me. That’s what I tried to do when I left home, once I was 18.

Here’s the thing. I’m not alone. I have a sister, younger than me. She is a lot less strong than me. She is in the same situation than me. She is now 19 and has no job, no formations. She is scared of everything. She is very sad. And she is the reason of why I came back in that Hell. Why I am writing this. Why I am in despair. True despair. Not these bullshit things I often see.

True despair is when you see no solutions.

I tried everything. I tried to endure the work with my father. But it’s impossible. You want to know why? Because he is aged. He is in his sixties. He has the right to stop working, and he wants to stop. The problem? At the time he proposed to help me, he underestimated the task. I don’t know how he made, but he could not have formed me in 1 year. It has now been 3 years since I’m with him. So, one year did not suffice. But he was tired. He wanted to enjoy life. He did not want anymore to give me a future. So, he stopped helping me, forming me. I was still working, but if one day he stopped coming, I wouldn’t be able to get a job or to continue his business. 

Let’s resume the situation: he doesn’t to work anymore, but he doesn’t show it. 

At that time, I think things are still ok. But it’s not the end. Because I am “forcing” him to help me. It is still time for him to stop everything, but his pride doesn’t allow him. If I say I stop, everything in my family falls apart. It’s pride. Always his pride. 

So progressively. He starts to hate me. And I also start to hate him. Nowadays he considers me as his enemy. We tries multiple time to explain everything between us, but it doesn’t change.

And my sister is amongst all of this, blocked. She is depressed. I cannot help her. My father make me work every day, even weekends, holydays. I mean ok. If it’s only this. But he doesn’t pay me anymore. He yells at me for anything.

Think about the solutions I have. I can tell you that I tried everything I could think of. Of course, some things are too dangerous or illegals. I envisaged suicide multiple times. But even suicide will not help me. As the problem is concerning my sister. Should I try to leave home with my sister? Would she follow me? I think not. I don’t have any money; I don’t have a true job. We had nearly no contact between each other, I as come back from work tired and have difficulty in socializing. 

Only several minutes ago, I was thinking about my choice. And there is a sentence which left my mouth several times in my life. “There was no solution since the beginning”. I am scared of that sentence. I suffered a lot, I worked a lot thinking there was still hope. I discovered that I had a talent. At least that’s what I think, but I’m starting to depress about it. I am a good writer in fantasy. I have good imagination. I started learning English because I wanted to publish my novels in English, making money with them. 

You have to know that the only safe place I have is my room. I still live in the house of my parents. And the only thing I can do here is dream. I did this all of my life. I read several novels and think I am quite good. The problem is, I have difficulty writing. Either in my language or in english. It needs work, training. That’s what I was doing of my free time. I started to write several stories, but every time I stopped since my english and my writing skills were not sufficient.

So progressively I started to lose confidence in myself. At the beginning I even thought I was a genius.

But the true problem is. I can’t dream or think when I am angry or sad. I can’t concentrate. It was the last thing I add, and I can’t use it nowadays. I lost hope. 

So the last thing that came to my mind, only several minutes ago. I would ask the world. I would ask on a forum. Do you have solutions. Did you live through something similar.

I know that some people are giving money at stranger on internet. I spent a lot of time on internet in my life. If you can give me money, I’ll be grateful. I don’t know how to ask it, really. I don’t even have time to correct my sentences. Thank you.",28Dec2020,1
565,"Hello!

So, my brother in law joined my partner and I for Christmas as he lives alone. He came to our house on the 23rd. He is 20 but mentally he is younger due to their upbringing.

Since being here he has not bathed or showered, I have not seen or heard him brush his teeth, nor have I heard him wash his hands after using the toilet. In the past, my partner and I have briefly spoken about his hygiene after we have visited him or vice versa, but this is the first time he's stayed with us for multiple days and we're really seeing it.

Now, he doesn't smell. Even though he hasn't washed, I can't say he smells. I'm never physically close enough to know if his breath smells. 

We have tried to hint by saying things like 'If you want a shower, just have one. You don't need to ask. There's towels in the spare room.' and my partner asked 'have you got a toothbrush here?' and when he said yes my partner made it sound like we had spares and wanted to know if he needed one. 

He's a very sensitive guy though. I think he could easily cry if this isn't handled in a good way. He will be embarrassed no matter what.

572,"Hi,

I was the kind of teenager who experimented with MDMA quite a bit. It's common where I'm from. Fortunately, my friends and I were safe enough to know what we were doing (usually), but the stupidest thing we did was photograph and video pretty much every experience we had. It was a funny idea at the time, looking at how weird/messed up we all looked etc. 

I'm a bit older now, and look back on that time on my life as kind of wreckless and embarrassing and I kick myself everyday for taking so many photos and not caring about it. Now, lots of people I hung out with have access to photos of me looking my worst and weirdest. 

I am constantly paranoid they will fall into the wrong hands one day or that my family will somehow see them. The anxiety I feel around it is pretty strong. 

I've grown, I've changed. I'm terrified it will come back to haunt me one day. I just don't know how to deal with the regret and the paranoia.

576,"They moved in 2 years ago with one dog, it was young and friendly. Then when that one got grown to full size, it was put outside at ALL times and they got another. First one will be called BH, second one BW (Brown husky and black and white). BH is nice, will let you pet her over the fence. BW is loud and barks at any hour of the day if so much as a kid riding their bike passes on the street (which is like, 50 feet from the fence). Then when BW got too old/big, they got LB (light brown). LB is even worse about barking but has stayed inside mostly

This past Christmas, they got another. Freaking. Dog. This time I believe a Doberman puppy. And I’m willing to bet that LB will be put outside, permanently, shortly.

For one thing, they don’t have a big enough yard for three dogs, let alone four, and they don’t take care of the outside ones and I doubt the inside one gets much better care. I’ve never ever seen them washed, silenced for barking, or taken inside during rain/snow/extreme weather/extreme temperatures (there is an enclosed desk but it’s only net). There are bad storms and high winds regularly. 

They’re getting a dog, playing with it until it’s grown, then tossing it out. BH is super anxious and loves attention, even from strangers. BW is skittish and barks at everything, including it’s own owners going outside, making BH bark too. LB is the same but worse as BW

I just don’t know what to do, because they’re collecting dogs to neglect, but I don’t have any real evidence of that AND they have young kids who I don’t feel like traumatizing. 

Live in a rural area with no noise ordinance, can’t do much of anything about that but what is there to do about this probably neglect situation?

I cashier as well as work mainly on the floor putting a lot of clothes back, cleaning, straightening up things that other workers are too lazy to do, and stock shelves. My title is still cashier as is theirs. I don’t understand why they’re making more when I’ve been here longer and do the same job and more. My recent performance review was great and I’ve personally been told by multiple managers that they depend on my for a lot because they know I get things done. 

I want to bring this up to my general manager. I do not want to bring up names because I don’t want the people who told me to somehow get in trouble. I’m aware that some employers say that it’s illegal to talk about wages with other employees but I have researched it and it’s not illegal and there’s also nothing in our employee handbook about it. I like this job because it’s steady and I’m currently working on my bachelors degree. I’m 21 and this is my first job.  I live in a small town so there’s not many job available, especially with everything going on. Any advice?",28Dec2020,1
578,"I am a first year Masters student. I have always been quite diligent in studies, but I keep shifting my hobbies. Once I have learnt something, I lose interest in it. After that I don't pursue ut rigorously, but only when I want to. This has happened with painting, swimming, karate, playing ukulele etc. The only constant is that I've been a voracious reader ever since I can remember. 
During the lockdown, I took up cooking amd baking as a hobby. Amidst the pandemic and pressure with my thesis, it really helped me relax and cope with my anxiety. My mom was initially amused by it, but gradually she started persuading me to quit. Now any time I cook, she shames me for having a hobby which a maid can do. Infact she said she got a free maid, and that I'd end up being a housewife who only prepares meals for her husband and children. She feels I'm too lazy to have a proper hobby and stick with it.

581,"Hey guys I'm a 33yr old male who struggles almost constantly with anxiety, depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts.

I moved back to where I grew up around 4 years ago after spending my 20s living closer to the city where I feel like I had quite a successful/full life (Good job, long-term relationship, friends, money, etc).

After a tumultuous period I ended up back home having to restart in a lot of ways with very few friends remaining and most of them living quite far away.

Since then I've drifted in and around a few social groups (as I have my whole life) but still feel on the outside and almost convinced that people don't like me.

This anxiety transfers to my love life and I've been struggling to find any success in that regard despite dating quite a bit and really putting myself out there.

I feel like I'm constantly sabotaging myself and probably making a lot of situations worse through a lack of self love and worrying about what others think of me sometimes to the extreme that 'no-one likes me' or 'all women think I'm a creep'...

I'm at an age where it seems like a lot of people are getting married and having kids amongst other personal successes and I would love some of these things myself but often feel overwhelmed with sadness.

Anyoke have any advice on how to worry less about what others think and love myself more?

583,"Context:

I'm a mid-20's male, earlier this year moved across the world to the UK on my own. My dad has estranged himself from most family (only speaks to me and my brothers) and has really been falling down a slippery slope the last couple of years with conspiracy theories. He refuses to use WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, so our only real line of communication for the last 12 months has been email. This morning I recieved an email from him:

&gt; Merry Christmas [my name], missed you as I often do.

&gt; My Christmas was forgettable... 

&gt; I didn't want to be sitting here on my own again so I went for a drive- it didn't help at all.

&gt; Sorry you have to go through all this.

&gt; There is so much going on worldwide surrounding cv-19 but it is basically a tool of manipulation over the masses.

&gt; I have spent most of my time- not just spare time investigating, trying to work out what's going on.

&gt; I wish I could have talked you out of going, but now I'm begging you to come home.

&gt; PLEASE refuse any cv-19 or other vaccinations especially if they are associated with Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci (NIAID). Most of the Trump team have had cv-19 and recovered quickly with  

&gt; There are too many globalist agendas at play and the middle/lower classes are the target.

&gt; None of the global organisations are there for you/us, including the WHO &amp; CDC, they are all compromised by the CCP, who is the organised force of the globalists, using money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to create the conditions in which they (globalists) can take over.

&gt; Trumps team is trying to clear out the corruption, but the CCP have infiltrated ALL government departments in all countries, making it almost impossible for the USA to survive as a republic. 

&gt; If the USA falls, the rest of the world will follow.

&gt; The Biden Administration is full of CCP puppets who hold high rank positions, but are corrupt and compromised, so they're not working for the people anymore, but working to enable CCP take-over of USA, so that the globalist regime can enact the BIG RESET, and then the NEW WORLD ORDER.

&gt; You may have heard something about this, they are telling us we will no longer own anything- but we will be happy.

&gt; Mate please don't write me off as a conspiracy theorist, I am trying to save my son from a eugenics exercise in the vacc's, and civil liberties violation that prevents him from being free to return home as he left- UNVACCINATED.

&gt; This is very similar in scope to what happened in Nazi Germany, but dressed differently for the complicit media to present to &amp; fool the masses into quiet compliance of a fate no better than the trenches full of chemo treated Jews in Germany.

&gt; The big difference now is that the whole world is at risk, not just German Jews.

&gt; There are some cheap houses here, family that love &amp; miss you, friends, [my hobbies], sunshine, everything you need to create a good life.

&gt; I don't want to lose you to this bullshit mate, please stay safe and jabb-free and come back home. You only get one body in this life and they know how to fuck it up. No job or amount of money will make this a good risk. 

&gt; love dad.

TLDR: My dad believes COVID19 is a eugenics exercise orchestrated by China/""the globalists"" and is begging me to fly home now so that I'm not at risk of being stuck in some kind of communist regime or forced to get vaccinated.

I know that he genuinely believes this and is looking out for my best interest. If it's not clear, I don't believe any of this shit, but I also don't want to belittle my dad. How do I even respond? I honestly worry for his mental health.",28Dec2020,1

586,"My friend and I have been planning a trip abroad for 2 months. Since deciding to go, I’ve been overly cautious and have been self quarantining to make absolutely certain that I would be able to go on this trip.
A week ago, my friend asked if he could bring his gf along to the trip, which I said was fine as long as he told our Airbnb host that there’d be an extra person. Which he did (after me really pushing for him to do so). 
I think everything is fine, so I continue business as usual and pay for my mandatory COVID test and fee for a travel authorization (which totals to a couple hundred dollars). I get cleared to travel. 
He texts me later letting me know that he actually has COVID and can’t go. He says that if he’s not going, his gf won’t be going, so I’ll most likely be traveling alone. Which I’m fine with.
I’m just not sure if I should refund him and his gf their portions of the Airbnb cost? 
I don’t want to be the friend who lets money interfere with our friendship, but at the same time, if the situation were reversed, I would just eat the cost and let them enjoy the trip. What would be the best course of action?

I have bad untreated anxiety and depression.  Unfortunately, I can't get help because my parents reject all notions that anything is wrong with me.  This anxiety is also partially previously caused by a traumatic/toxic relationship I got out of a little less than a year ago.  My boyfriend was fully aware of all of this before the relationship began and has been supportive.

The problem is, I never lead onto how bad it actually is sometimes, because I know I'm (probably) overreacting.  There are some days when if a vibe is even slightly off (sometimes, not even with him), I will freak out and be in panic mode all day.  But I never tell him, because I know everything is fine.  My brain can think ""oh my god, he's probably gonna break up with me"" for a reason I have manufactured in my head, and we'll call at night and everything is completely normal.  This seems to be a recurring problem for me on our ""boring"" days.

We otherwise have perfectly open and honest communication, and rarely argue (and if we do, it's about football or something stupid like that; never about the relationship itself).  But now I'm in a situation where I feel so rotten, but it's probably really not for a major reason.  (use this as an example of things I subconsciously freak out about)

(context: he is a Seahawks fan, I am a Packers fan.  If you don't keep up with football at all, we both won yesterday) We called after both of our games were over and were discussing our rankings for best quarterbacks.\*  Of course, we got into the ""Wilson is better/Rodgers is better"" argument during that, and also got into a disagreement over Big Ben as well.  I could tell he was getting a little heated, but we're talking about football, not a major disagreement directly regarding our relationship.  I eventually just said, ""okay, I'm not going to keep arguing this, I don't wanna get pissed at you for no reason.""  He went to get food and said he would call me back when he was done eating, said ""I love you,"" all of that.  This is normal.  I just played Madden for a while waiting for him to finish up.

About a half-hour later (it's about 12:15 at this point), he Snapchats me and says he's gonna play some games with friends for a bit and then call me.  He hadn't really done that all day, and we had called earlier in the day, so I let him.  I wasn't really tired so I just stayed up and waited.  Going on 2:00, he was still only Snapchatting.  I asked if he was going to call me and he said he was still playing with friends, so I said ""okay, I'm just gonna go to bed then."" He said, ""Okay, I love you"".  

I don't feel I can be rightfully mad, but butthurt that he didn't call me, especially since this is the first time it happened.  But the panicked, overly anxious me is coming back: my subconscious thoughts thinking ""he doesn't like you, he's gonna break up with you"", etc, even though realistic me knows that nothing really happened (if someone could reassure me of that also, that would be very helpful to calm me a bit).  It's not that I'm controlling or overbearing towards him: he can do what he wants and he always makes time for me at some point.  I think it's just the argument (if you can even call it that) that threw me off.  But also sometimes, when I feel this way, an argument doesn't even happen.

I just don't know what to do.  Our relationship (at least to me) is healthy, and we communicate well.  There is zero underlying problem in our relationship.  Am I overreacting? Is there actually something wrong with our relationship? How do I stop this from happening without professional help? Any help/insight/commentary is appreciated.

I'm still very fond of him. After the breakup I cried 2 days straight and since then it's been a long and tough battle to get over him. At first I begged him to come back and was saying maybe we could get back together after dealing with our individual mental health. He never said he would want to or sounded like he was hoping for the future, except to say 'well maybe one day we will, who knows'. We the remained friends, me being careful because it was hard at first not wanting more.

After a while it was really nice being friends. I was happy he was still in my life and not thinking about anything more. Then I felt ready to move on. I felt like I'd like to be in a relationship again. I had spent all this time telling myself that my ex is gone, that no matter what I want, I'll never be with him again. Anyway, I found this new guy who just came along and I really like him. I'm trying to move on, and just do what will make me happy.

Then... You guessed it. I told ex I was sort of seeing someone new and he's now saying he misses me, he feels bad for what he's done and he wants the good times back and was hoping we might get back together one day. He didn't say any of this before because I believe he was scared he'd ruin my progress of working on myself because part of my problem was ignoring my issues by burying myself in the relationship.

He's sad, and confused and all sorts, and I feel like such a horrible person. I was going straight, not thinking of him and excited for a potentially new happy relationship. But now, after reading the ex's messages I just feel... Distraught. I'm confused and I feel almost like the heartbreak had returned. I like this new guy, it doesn't change that, but also I don't want to move on for the wrong reasons.

1) They don’t know me. I’m afraid I might look stalkerish and somehow invasive and that’s the last thing I want as I deeply respect these people.
2) I don’t even know where to start when texting them. Should I tell them I got their number through a friend? How do I introduce myself? How do I praise them and show my interest without licking their boots? Should I go straight to the point or let them get to know me?

Only the oldest of my half-siblings (I have 3, I’m the youngest) completed college with the help of her father (not related to me) and she’s currently a homeless heroin addict and has been for some time. She never did anything with her degree or worked in her field. 

Around 12-13 after dealing with sexual abuse I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, my mother made me feel guilty about her buying my medication so I stopped getting refills. I’m still struggling with it to this day. 

No one ever told me about how community college works or scholarships or anything so I just gave up. I started working at a grocery store on my street full-time. I never took the SAT and barely graduated high school. I was great at tests but when it came to homework or projects I never completed them because I was so burnt out. 

I started working multiple minimum wage jobs, at one point I worked 7 days a week for 6 months until I started to forget how to function. I ended up getting a job at a more upscale grocery store at the age of 20, who promoted me within 6 months. This promotion was for an hourly rate of $4 over minimum wage, so I was very happy. I moved out and rented a house with my friend shortly after. 

Cut to my current situation, I’m still working with that company in the same position but different location, at a little more than that starting wage but not much. I moved across my state to rent an apartment with my boyfriend of 3 years with a friend as a roommate back in August. With COVID I had a problem finding a job in the area so I transferred to the nearest store closest to where I wanted to move, so I currently work an hour away. 

I’m miserable. I feel hopelessly stuck in my retail job. I barely make it with all the bills I have to pay so trying to go back to school just isn’t an option. I can’t afford to got to doctors or dentists or get the mental health treatment I need. My once brag-able work ethic has diminished and I do just enough to maintain my position. My depression is worsening and all I want to do when I get home is sleep.

I’ve applied for at least 13 jobs since I’ve moved, ones that didn’t require degrees or experience and some that offered to train and seemed so promising and I’ve been denied for all of them. I’m afraid it’s due to my only experience being in retail positions or my lack of education. My friend who also worked nothing but retail was given a job with a shiny title at her father’s company although she just did errands, and after he went under she has had no issue finding office jobs. I don’t know anyone in my area that could help me get a job, as I know no one outside of my boyfriend and his family. 

I want an actual career path. I don’t expect to be a CEO or anything but enough for me to eventually plop a little manufactured home on a little plot of land and actually own it. my biggest goal in life is to give myself the stability my parents didn’t give me. 

Has anyone else gone through similar and can tell me how they succeeded? Or someone who works in a specific field give me solid advice as to what they’d look for in a job candidate? 

Thank you for reading and helping if you can. 

Also, if anyone checks my profile and thinks it’s my appearance that is stopping me, my Facebook profile isn’t searchable, my Instagram doesn’t have my last name, I recently dyed my hair a natural color after years of neon, my bridge piercing is covered because I wear glasses but I’ve accepted that I’ll need to lose it when I do find a non-retail job, I have a retainer for my septum that stays in my nose so it’s not visible, I have 2 tattoos that are easily covered, and I’m able to wear natural makeup and dress professionally.",28Dec2020,1
607,"Feeling stuck, will try to keep this short.

I'm a 30 year old male in the pittsburgh area, I have a fiance who's 25 and a almost 4 year old daughter. I'm feeling stuck in life. I was a high school drop out, but got a GED a few years ago while laid off from an oilfield job. My fiance and I have been together for 5 years, she worked and paid half the bills until she was 8 months pregnant and we decided for her to stay at home and take care of our daughter. My fiance has since developed very bad knee problems, they have degenerated very badly and she can hardly stand any longer than an hour, this has happened over about the last 2 and a half years. She applied for disability and was denied because we had more than 3k in our joint bank account as far as I know. I got a CDL through the state right after I got my GED and took a job over the road. I was promised a lot and none of it happened, I hated the job and quit. Went back to the oilfield, and when i say oilfield, i mean the shitty crap paying jobs out there, like 12 bucks an hour jobs. Anyway I got laid off again, got a job at a propane supplier driving a bobtail, I'm still in this position. I make 22 bucks an hour after almost a year and a half but am expected to stop receiving raises after 24 an hour I believe. My boss rents me a house for really cheap, 400 a month but I still cant seem to get a head. I dont party, I have hardly any debt. I have a car that's 8k left to pay which I'm trying to pay off asap. I just feel stuck, do I need a better job? Is 22-24 an hour good for me? I'm going crazy thinking about how to make my families life better. We can save some money but itll never be enough to do anything with. What should my fiance do, we have no family or friends around to help with child care and since we live together we always come in just above the limit of any assistance. I just feel like I need some advice or guidance, so I can focus on fixing and not always wondering what I need to do. Thanks in advance.",28Dec2020,1
608,"I (15M) have been friends with this guy, let's call him Jake, for about five years. He is the closest person to me after my parents and I usually share a lot of personal stuff with him. 
Jake has been calling me ugly for about two years now. 
It is never direct, and I am not sure if he says it unintentionally but whenever we're talking about anything even slightly related to one's looks he usually ends up saying that I have bad looks BUT I'll probably grow out of it. I don't know if I am overreacting but this leaves me hollow from inside and I begin thinking how easy it would be to just ""delete"" everything bad in my life by killing myself. 

To give you a clearer example, I will tell you about what just happened today.
We were cycling together and he out of the blue asked me about if I was gonna ask any girl out someday. (FYI, having girlfriends/boyfriends or asking someone out is a HUGE deal where I live.) I said that with looks like mine it would be impossible, so no. He responded to that by saying that I should not say such things and even though I am not good looking now I'll probably be in the future. He continued by giving me example of this character ""Ben Hanscom"" and that he was ugly too like me but grew out of it. 
I am sorry if I wrote way too much, I honestly don't know what to do. Am I the wrong guy here? Jake has called me ugly so many times that I now believe him (hence my comment earlier.)",28Dec2020,1

610,"Because of the pandemic we are technically not allowed to be getting together with other households. I (27F) live with my partner (29M) in my parents basement, so we are in the same household. My sister (31F) lives with her husband and son, and my brother (29) lives with his girlfriend. So we are technically 3 households, however my mom babysat my sister's son up until the week prior so it is almost as though they are in our bubble. That being said, my sister and her husband are off work for a little bit now and have the opportunity to quarantine with just the 3 of them. 

Originally our Christmas plan was to have dinner at my parents house (where me and my partner also live) with my sister's family and my brother and his gf.We were also going to go up to our family cottage for new years.  Our region is going into a strict lockdown on the 26th so my mom decided she felt uncomfortable having a bunch of cars with city license plates up north at the cottage because it looks really bad to neighbours. She called my sister to tell her this and my sister said there was no point in saying we can get together on Christmas but we can't a few days later, we may as well cancel the whole thing.  My mom was really upset by this and felt like she shouldn't have brought up cancelling the cottage because now everything has been cancelled. At this time I backed my mom and said I agreed with cancelling the cottage but still having Christmas, because at the cottage if we are all living together for multiple days we probably wouldn't social distance or use any safety measures such as wearing masks or using seperate washrooms, whereas if we get together for a few hours on Christmas it is easier to keep these safety measures in place. 

My partner's parents were having me and him over on Christmas Eve and we wore masks, stayed more than 6 ft away and had a great time. My friends did a similar thing with their family and so I thought this was a great suggestion to not only make my mom and sister feel better but I also really don't want anyone to get sick as a result of us seeing each other for a few hours. My mom brought up that it was also important to her to not have everyone's cars parked out front to draw attention that we are having a gathering, so she was going to tell my brother she can pick them up from their house too. 

 Wellllll a few hours later, my brother calls my mom all pissed off that she has 'changed all the plans' and 'convienced' me to back out of the cottage as well. This all came from my sister calling my brother and blaming my mom for changing the plans. My mom told my brother about wearing masks and my brother was yelling about her ruining Christmas and who know what else, but mom was not able to get in a word to explain herself, tell him about the car idea, and ended up hanging up on him in tears. 

My brother then started messaging our group chat. He completely blamed the whole wearing masks thing on me. He said it was sad I had to power trip on Christmas of all days and ruin it. He insulted my education and intelligence (background- I'm a nursing student and have a BHSc- he graduated highschool.). He said he was just going to go to his girlfriend's house instead for dinner. I asked my mom if she would make dinner for us and my sister's fam and have an open invitation he could come if he puts a mask on. My mom said no, that she's not picking one kid over another and that Christmas is cancelled. This went on for several more hours, but my mom was hard on her stance of it being all of us or none of us.

My sister then all of a sudden is easy going and Is down for dinner and doesn't care whether or not we wear a mask. Same with my mom, she doesn't care about the mask either. So now my brother is really personally attacking me about the mask issue. My dad said the issue is we both have too strong of opinions- mine being that we should reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted and his actual opinion is ""I shouldn't be asked to wear a mask at my own mom's house"".

So since my mom is at this point upstairs in bed crying and telling me dinner is 100% cancelled if we can't all be there, me and my partner decide to go see his family for Christmas. So we make plans with them. A few hours later my sister calls and tells me my brother is sorry he got personal with his insults and should have just discussed his issue with masks at Christmas, but he is willing to have Christmas with a mask. I said it's too late I'm not canceling dinner on my in laws.  My mom asks if we can do a gift exchange in the morning as my sister drives by on her way to the cottage (just her fam is going up) and I said yes. She asked if my brother should come and I said I didn't want to see him because I strongly doubt he would wear a mask and if he did he would just make fun of me the whole time. (He has a real bully mentality, always has). 

I didn't hear anything else about Christmas now until Christmas morning. I wake up and do gifts with my parents and partner since we all live together. My mom's in a great mood, Christmas music on, house looks nice... Big difference from the day before when she couldn't get out of bed crying. Then I notice a huge turkey in the kitchen. I asked her if she's making a Christmas dinner and she honestly looked like she got caught. Then says yeah well your sister is passing by so we are feeding them, and then your brother's going to come over (once I'm at my in-laws) and we might as well give them dinner. (Btw she's planning a full blown dinner party, not just giving people food as they pass by. Like they are all coming at the same time for a Christmas dinner party).  They will not be wearing masks, everyone's driving their cars, no using seperate washrooms, no safety measures at all. And no me. 

I felt like they pulled a fast one over on me to get me out of the Christmas party. They all just caved to my brother and he got his way as usual. The fact that my mom was so against dinner without my brother, when in my opinion, he was in the wrong, but then so quick and excited to have dinner without me did break my heart a little.  Me and my partner were hurt about this, but they don't seem to understand how we feel this way. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way?",28Dec2020,1
611,"I am in panic mode &amp; do not know what else to do so I’m asking an entire subreddit. Here we go.

So back I’m August I quit my job in corporate law because obviously, but one of my ex-partners is an idiot who knows nothing about the digital world, so I still have access to his email. Every once in a while I look at it for fun, and I mostly forget it’s there, but I looked at it today to see if he made the whole office work on Christmas and discovered he got a positive COVID-19 test on December 18th (I forking KNEW he would but I digress). He told the other attorneys in the office BUT NOT THE STAFF (one of whom is pregnant!!!) and not HIS FAMILY. There are emails between him &amp; his buddies about going to the gun range, hosting meetings with other firms, and then.... dear god, I hate to even say it, but there are messages between him &amp; his wife, who also has it, that they are going to see his entire family, including two pregnant women, two brand new babies, lots of kids &amp; lots of old folks &amp; they aren’t going to tell them &amp; they aren’t going to wear masks.

I just can’t live with myself if I don’t do anything, but this is happening soon &amp; I don’t have any of his family’s contact information anyway, and even if I did what the fork would I even tell them?

People used to assume I'm stupid because of how I spoke and everytime I was asked to speak in classes I would hear snickering. This used to infuriate me but it got better as I got better at faking accent.

A boy from my hometown recently joined the college. I helped him throughout the process but one thing I forgot to mention was about the problem his accent will cause. Everytime I talked to him before the college he sounded confident, he knew what he wanted to do, what he was interested in. He was my sisters senior and she told me that he was someone involved in a lot of extra curricular activities.

How every since he joined the college's I've noticed he's trying to talk less and less every time I've talked to him. There's a dumb ""tradition"" in our hostel called ragging the juniors. I've heard some guys really made fun of his accents when ragging. He had applied to some student groups but I found out he didn't go to any interviews there.

Is there any way I could help him? I really don't want to tell him to change his accent, but even the professors probably judge him on the accent because I felt like they used to judge me as well.",28Dec2020,1

I have a crush on a girl from my last part time job, which I left for an internship 2 months ago. This was not a onesided crush, cuz I know from my interactions as well as other people telling me that she she likes me. The only problem was that she was in a relationship, and knowing that, I chose not to do anything.

I talked with her once a few months via a job texting app. But now that I left the job, I have no way to contact her and she left that work only a few days after I left, WTH. I don't like being friends with girls I like but, I just regret not asking for her contact info or asking to be friends.

So, the advice I want is how do I get over it?? It's been two months and I feel like its getting worse. I do get enough attention from girls, but it seems pale in comparison to what I got from her. Do I just miss the attention?? Am I addicted or something??

When I have a conversation with some and later someone asks me what we talked about, I don't remember. I lose my phone and other things constantly. I can work on memorization and I study hard, but everything just disappears in my mind. Memories of events are fuzzy. I can't imagine myself there or think about the feelings. If you ask me what I did on a vacation, it would take me a while to come up with the answer. Sometimes I can come up with what happened or someone might have to say something to trigger the memory, but other times it's just blank. It's not that I am not paying attention, because I really try to. If my friends are fighting and they ask me later what they said, I don't remember. If I talk to a boy I like and my friend asks me what we talked about I don't really remember. Days fly by and I don't know what really happened.

I wake up at 5am for work eat a cereal bar or granola bar at 9am (usually have 1 coffee by then)

A sandwich and chips sometimes at 12

I'm on my feet all day long, usually lifting 40-60lb boxes all day

I can never really fall asleep until 11-12 so I average about 5-6hrs of sleep a night which I know is part of the reason I'm so tired. Which is why I try to take a nap. I usually end up sitting on my computer when I get home.

I was wondering if I changed my diet or started drinking a protein shake or something to wake me up, something healthy to add or swap out in my diet. I do have a lactose intolerance similar issue so something with a lot or milk or something isn't really an option.

630,"So I met this girl from my cousin somewhere near the end of August and since then till now we've been so so close. In a span of a short period we hung out every single day together and we both acknowledged how we felt some sort of connection when we hang out. We don't love-love each other but we've told each other that we do love one another as such good friends. We have given each other a gift from time to time like a normal thing and I truly think she is the closest person I have other than my sister.

Recently though I've been struggling with anxiety, depression, anger issues, stress and so on... and because my town is quite small and there is nothing to see... not even a park... I felt like I needed a change. So I went to my sister's house that is in our capital which is a far bigger city than ours, with so many parks, buildings, museums, places to visit and everything you could think of. I stayed there for a week with her and her husband and I felt the best change in years. But before I told my friend that I was going to go to my capital, I stopped hanging out with her due to having so much anxiety when I was outside my house. I even told her about it and she understood me but I guess since it kept happening and happening and I deny going out with her so many times she felt disappointed or mad even at me that she stopped asking me about it. And she did say that she only stopped asking me because she knew I was going to say 'no'. I totally understand that and I even appreciate it cause I do need some time to work on myself. 

Now when I was at my sister's place like I said I felt this big change that I needed... I bonded with them, watched movies, went on walks, played guitar and overall had so much fun. I started losing that fear and anxiety I used to get when I stepped outside my house and I even went to a psychologist there that helped me out with my personal issues from where my stress and anxiety comes from. Now with all that being said, the week passed and now I'm home in my town again but whenever I speak to my friend she messages me in short, if there is something that she wants to tell me she also keeps it short with no details to which before all of this we would talk and talk for hours and she even says that she will go to a different city to stay there like I did with my sister and I totally understand that and encourage her to do it but the way she is saying it... kinda sounds like she's saying 'I'm going there to take a break from you"" type of thing. She never said it like that but she always says like, ""Yeah I'm going there cause I want to see new people, people here are boring, nobody is worth it here, this town sucks."" etc.

Again I totally understand if she needs a change cause I did but I am still working on my personal issues and I don't know how long it will take... but does all of this mean that we are done with each other and it's over?",28Dec2020,1

I live in a very conservative society that will never accept me. The only thing I could think of is running away to another country. I have been discussing studying abroad with my parents since last year but this year, for whatever reason, they changed their minds. They are using covid as an excuse even though I know they just don't want to let go of me. They are narcissistic, abusive and I am their scapegoat child. I don't have much time left to apply to universities but my parents are making things harder, I can't apply without their consent. 

What should I do? I have brought up this topic today and they said we need to have a long discussion about this. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I can't discuss this with them without breaking down. What can I do? Can someone give me advice?",28Dec2020,1

636,"Ever since quarantine began, I haven't hung out with friends in-person or seen co-workers in-person. I do have a big group chat with friends and we talk all day on there.  These are my best friends and I'm so grateful to be able to talk to them so much, but these people are not funny. They say things like, ""You're the eggspert on that one"" if they're talking about a problem with their morning eggs.  

Normally, this wouldn't bother me. I can ignore their dumb puns and move on with me life. But yesterday I realized that I'm slowly becoming unfunny too because they're my only social contact with the world basically. I'm losing my edge. 

Here are some other facts about these non-jokesters:
- one them says he doesn't like watching comedies
- when someone makes a dad joke, everyone else (except for me) responds ""HAHAHAHHAHAHA"" and begins complimenting the person who told it
- 75% of them have never watched Seinfeld

What do I do? Should I resolve myself to enjoy dad jokes and puns? Start a new life with only hilarious people? Stage an intervention in the group chat?",28Dec2020,1

638,"So I guess this is pretty specific advice but I basically need to go back to school to get a better job. From undergrad I have a BFA in Digital Art and my area of expertise is graphic design (more tailored to web and multimedia instead of print) with additional skills in marketing, advertising, photography, and video production. I also attended a coding bootcamp after graduation to have more coding-based web projects in my portfolio (I have no desire to go further and become a full fledged developer though). Since march I've been trying to get a decent job and so far I haven't been able to land anything related to my degree or area of expertise. I'm now considering going back to school to make a career change and I would like some input from others on my options.

1. Go back for an M.Arch degree. This is honestly my preferred choice, but I can't afford it out of pocket (and scholarships, especially decent ones, are pretty rare) so I would easily have to go into over $100K in loans just for the degree, and I'm not sure initially I could find a job where I could pay the loans back. Plus, I would need to figure out how to afford the licensing cost (it would be the only way to get where I want to go with this option) which is easily another $10k on top of the other loans. Also this option is super dependent on the health of the economy which makes me strongly think twice about it since I am not a trust fund baby. My entire problem with this option is that I don't know how to make it work financially.
2. Go back for an MAT in art education and become an art teacher in k-12. I could pretty easily find a decent full-time job with this. In my current area, there are art teacher jobs that regularly open up (either teachers retiring, new schools opening, or current art teachers moving to administrative/non-instructional role or just better schools) and I would also be fine with moving elsewhere to get hired if need be too (and honestly prefer that). I could also afford the degree out of pocket at my preferred school while continuing to work my ""day job"" (its second shift so there's no time overlap). I guess the catch here is that I don't really like young children, and I would almost certainly have to start in an elementary or middle school and probably a pretty rough school at that, and I am no sure that I have the patience for that.
3. Go back for an MFA so I can teach college. This was my original plan, and I was in the middle of applying for it this time last year. I even got into one program (albeit my last choice program) and ultimately decided to not attend given a lack of clarity surrounding COVID changes to the program and even though I was awarded full funding and a stipend I would have had to take out more loans than I was comfortable with for this program (minimum I was looking at \~$30k over the total 3 years). For me to really consider an MFA again, I would really need to go back on my own terms (the program I got into I only applied for because I was really pushed to apply for it by one of my undergrad mentors) and that it is either a fully funded (without any loans) interdisciplinary program (or a medium-specific program that is open to interdisciplinary explorations and the majority of the courses are with other masters students instead of with undergrads) or a more affordable low-residency program.
4. Go back for an MA+PhD in Art History so I can either work in a museum or teach college. This option is kind of a wild card (but also not really). During undergrad I produced 2 solo art history publications (and third that was half art history half studio art). I know for at least one of my main research interests there is currently a large gap in literature so from that front I shouldn't have an issue, to the extent that the faculty sponsor for my Art History undergraduate thesis said I could easily turn it into a doctoral dissertation. I also could afford my top choice school out of pocket (The Open University in the UK), however, I'm not sure how financially sustainable this option would be, especially given how competitive the job market for this field is as a whole (although it seems to be getting less competitive since fewer and fewer students are pursing it and its at the start of a major retirement wave, but everyone who is retiring is being replaced by a full time position, let alone tenure-track position).",28Dec2020,1

641,"Hi guys,

So I’m (18F) and my friend B(18F) are friends for more than 10 years. We went to the same school together and have a pretty good relationship. She’s not the closest friend I have but I really like her. It started few month ago when a mutual friend (19M) talked to me about how she needs to have female friends and not only guys. (We all come from a conservative community and her family don’t approve about her having male friends) He then continued that she feels left out when going out with my friends and so I needed to put some effort to make her feel more welcomed and all. 

I talked with the girls and they all were fine with her coming and joining our gatherings since all of us are friends with her even if she’s not really close to all of us. This was all fine and we gathered multiple times (we are total of 5, we all wear masks and follow the guidelines of our country) until I noticed that every time she tries to make fun of me, and many times my broken glasses. I come from an upper middle class family but things have been rough lately due to Covid. No one knows we are struggling financially and a good quality glasses cost around $400 because of how compressed they are etc. She every time makes fun of how they look, how it makes me look stupid, and she offers to buy me one sarcastically. 

Also, few days ago we celebrated Christmas (we’re not christian) but we really like the vibes and meanings behind it and we did secret santa for fun. We all agreed that the gift should be around $27 and everyone was fine with it. She was my secret santa and I thanked her for her gift. But then she pointed out that the 3 mini hand creams I got where all free samples from a store that her aunt got and a palm sized artwork was just their at her house and she didn’t understand what was written on them since it was a gift from a family relative too. I honestly was fine with a small note and didn’t expect a lot of stuff.

I for the first time have strong anger and hurt feelings, I also feel disappointed that I don’t get the same energy I give. But I always think that we were friends from way back and maybe I am exaggerating? What do you guys think? And what should I do?

642,"Good morning/Afternoon/Night depending where you are :)

I’m a 22 year old female. 

I live with my grandma and grandpa. 

I’ve always been super close with my grandma because of issues within my family. I’m in college at the moment, and do not have a job. My grandparents are supporting me.

Anyway so my issue is that there’s a guy that I like and my grandma always gets pretty upset when I try to date someone because she thinks I’m going to act like my mom and disappear in the middle of the night and never return or something. So she gets really upset every time I try to go out with someone.

She’s also very strict about who I hangout with and everything. I have to tell her where I’m going, who I’m with, what we’ll be doing etc. 

The guy I’ve been talking to is pretty upset that he can’t just see me whenever he wants. The last 2 guys previously have broken up with me because of the same reason. 

I need advice on what to do in this situation. I do not want to hurt my grandma in any way, but I don’t want to lose the guy I’ve been talking to either.

Basically, I started university and got really close with a group of guys. Unfortunately, I slept with one of them. Several times. And he’s in a relationship of about a year. 
I’ve said to him that he should tell her and he just won’t. But I can’t shake the guilt because I was cheated on before and I know how horrible it is. I’d be lying if I said i didn’t have feelings for him because I do and they’re strong. But I also value our friendship, because aside from the intimacy we’re genuinely good friends. They’re moving to live together in another country in a few months for a while. 
I have literally no idea how to go about telling her or whether I should tell her at all. If I was to tell her, I wouldn’t want to ruin our friendship.

651,"I just got back from an aggressively mediocre Christmas at my Dad’s. His wife seemed to be expecting a romantic week for two and instead I was on her couch unwinding after a horrible semester. Honestly, I tried to just stay out of people’s hair, I did chores even though I wasn’t expected, watched what they watched and still got animosity. Also, when I went to another city to hand over my siblings gifts, my older brother ripped the bag from my hand and shut the door before I could say hi. My dad seemed to be the only person who wanted me at Christmas, I guess. 

The day before I left, my dad invited me to the garage where he told me he wants to buy me a vehicle. I have a Dodge Calibre right now, I had tons of good options  from strangers but bought from the older brother who’s always dwarfed me in accomplishments. 

My brother has been ahead of me on everything. He did what my small town and society told him to, he had an IQ of 180 and while he got endless activities: Celtic dance, lacrosse, track &amp; field. I got a PlayStation 1, Captain Highliner in the freezer and was told to occupy myself. He also got a doctorate by age 28 where, despite a 3.4 GPA and being 100x more level-headed than I was as a kid, I’m still dwarfed. 

This being my brother’s car, all I get from family is, “it’s so nice that your brother was charitable enough to give you a car” when I payed out of my own pocket, above market value, on a university student’s salary. Then, when I got the Calibre, I found out no repairs had been done to it, I had to do a comprehensive restoration on it to keep it running. It’s true, I’ve been shopping around for my perfect vehicle, but I want to find it on my own, have it be mine; something tangibly mine. Up until 2016, I had this ugly SOB of a Pontiac Sunfire, I also restored that and it purred, never died. My family never understood why I was so in love with it. It was because it was mine, I scoured ads, I paid cash, I restored it myself. 

My dad is also dead set on us kids staying near him, my four siblings and I are all in a big city and he’s in a hundred-person town a few hundred clicks away and he wants it to stay that way.

654,"Throwaway account...

I know that’s a weird title. But let me expound...

A few months ago, I moved away from my home town to move in with my boyfriend. I’ll call him Steve. While we have been very good friends for over a decade, and he has always had romantic feelings for me, the relationship as an actual couple is new. Previously, he had been coming to see me, and the sex was mind-blowing. But for the last few months, he has been very depressed. While this should be a naturally very physical time for any relationship, he has been very distant, to the point of no sex. He has told me multiple times in the past that he has problems with initiating any kind of sex, and I’m kind of ok with that. But now that he’s depressed, I’m not sure that he even finds me attractive anymore. We haven’t had sex in 2 months. I was talking to a mutual friend of ours, and he told me that sex is very important to Steve, and that the one thing he liked about his last girlfriend was that she would initiate sex a lot, and that I should try to do the same. At first I got upset, but I’m dying for physical attention. And if he’s wanting a physical connection, but can’t initiate it himself, should I be the one to just put the moves on him? It’s been very difficult for me, because my body has changed a lot in the last few years from surgeries, so I’m not as confident in myself as I used to be. Do guys want it, no matter what? Or would it be out of line to try to get him to have sex with me? I kind of wonder if it would help with his depression.

656,"I want to preface this by saying my boyfriend and I haven’t been together for super long.  Today marks our 4 month anniversary, but even though our time has been relatively short together, he has made me feel far happier and secure and wanted than any prior relationships of mine had, including a 3 year relationship. 

My man is a wonderful person inside and out, and he always manages to bring a smile to my face and make me feel like a better person. He’s patient and understanding, we have tons of fun just being around each other, and I feel like I’m right at home with him. We deeply care for each other and it’s all around a great, healthy relationship in which we both treat each other with respect and kindness and warmth. 

Suffice to say, we probably do love each other or are at least falling for each other (I have no idea how long it takes to actually fall in love but I can’t imagine it takes too terribly long if you have a good connection with someone) but neither of us have said the words and part of me wants to keep it that way because I am afraid of the words “I love you.” 

Growing up, I never saw any healthy loving relationships. My Dad is on his third marriage and constantly bashes my ex-stepmom, and my Mom and stepdad have had some pretty tumultuous fights due to drinking and my Mom has dragged me in between their arguments and shouted he should just divorce her if he doesn’t like her drinking. When I began dating, my parents never told me the healthy do’s and don’t’s of a relationship, and due to us having a rocky family relationship, I ended up in some pretty bad situations with people who claimed to “love” me. My first boyfriend was an abusive, manipulative jerk to put it simply, and used the word “love” as a tactic during his abuse cycle. Since I had never been in a relationship prior and my parents didn’t seem to care about the relationship or notice the very serious changes in me, I thought that abuse was love until we eventually broke up. In my second relationship, he said he loved me within three months but constantly cheated on me and really only “loved” me for sex it seemed. 

The third relationship, which was the longest, was also abusive, though it was a different form of abuse than the first relationship so I did not see just how bad it was until I was finally fed up with my unhappiness I left. For that relationship, he could never say the words “I love you,” back, like it was a chore to say, and if he did say it it was so quiet I could never hear him. I’ve had good friends throughout the years who claimed they loved me and ended up hurting me deeply by bullying me, stealing the boy I liked or taking things from me in general, or telling me to kill myself. 

Needless to say, the word “love” is surrounded and rooted by a lot of trauma or traumatic events that have affected me greatly. And in being in this wonderful and nourishing relationship, I’m scared to hear “I love you,” or say it back because part of me is scared love is an illusion and doesn’t exist or that people who say those words are just going to hurt you. I’m scared once the words are said somehow the relationship will change drastically for the worse and the past will repeat itself. And I’m scared that maybe my boyfriend doesn’t feel the same way I do about him, even though he’s assured me he likes me a lot and his actions have never made me think otherwise. 

I just don’t know how to feel. I wonder if maybe I’m undeserving of love because I’ve never experienced before and maybe I’m a really bad person or did something really bad that I can’t remember and I’m being punished for it. I don’t know. Maybe it’s an irrational and silly fear to have to be afraid of love, but I don’t know how to not be afraid of it.

Again and again, I’ve lied to their faces, declaring things “good” or “progressing normally.” I’m the scum of the Earth for abusing their trust, but I keep doing it because I know my father and mother will be furious with the truth.

666,"First of all, I’m 29M based in London, UK.

November 2019 I worked as a Line Manager at a restaurant in Chelsea. It was a tough environment and a pretty bad company, with history of treating employees badly, cheating us on payslips, forgetting to pay the wages (salaries), lying to the employees and in general disrespecting the law.

In November 2019 we had our Assistant Manager - superior to me - quit the job and a new one took his position. The guy, 40M, has never before been a manager and needed training. Ive been appointed to do that.

One of his first days after closing the restaurant, we were left alone in the premises and I proceeded start the training. My new Manager insisted on having a chat and having some wine. I rejected the wine a few times but eventually caved in, he seemed to have had good intentions. However at some point he changed the topic from how to run a restaurant to sex.

Then he started touching me inappropriately, long story short he managed to slap me, choke me, he showed me his wiener; I said that is not welcome and refused his attempts. Eventually he threatened to get me sacked if i dont ‘suck his dick from time to time’ and left.

The moment he left the premises I notified HR. They have reviewed the CCTV, confirmed that the touched me, slapped me and choked me, but in turn suspended me for three weeks; after that they allowed me to go back to work but at 67% wage. He got sacked.

The crazy part is that this guy admitted to the HR that he tried advances on me and that i said NO. That i said it was not welcome. Also, again, him groping me, slapping and choking was all clearly captured by the CCTV.

Obviously the HR tried to make me admit i wanted it and it was my fault since I ‘didnt punch him’.

It felt disgusting, i felt abused, violated and then, punished - financially - for speaking up. I have never been disrespected so much in my life.

It has been over a year now, but only now I feel ok to talk about it.

The problem is, there was alcohol involved - you can see me drinking wine, you can also see him pouring the wine into my cup.

What should I do about it? Can I stand a chance against that company in court? I dont even feel like i want to be compensated, i just want this company to face and admit their toxic policies.",28Dec2020,1

668,"Looking for some outside perspective and this post turned into a bit of an info dump. Like most others, the whole pandemic/lockdown/WFH has been driving me crazy. As the title indicates, I am trying to decide whether I should quit my job and take some time off. Really just looking for any personal experience from others, suggestions on how to approach work life right now, or whatever people have to offer.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr privileged asshole has no passion or desire for anything, slacks off and procrastinates at work, and now wants to quit said well paying job because he is a whiny baby

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a very privileged position right now as I have a well paying job that allows me to safely work remotely and amazing parents who continue to let me live at home. I have enough personal savings right now to sustain about 2 years unemployment including unforeseen financial changes. I currently have just my room to myself where I spend &gt;95% of my time. Both work and recreation are from the same chair and same desk with no real alternatives at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past two months espcially (but really starting over the the past sex months) or so I have been getting less and less efficient and stressed during my working hours. I really liked this job when I started and for my first six months I had initiative and drive to learn not only my immediate job, but things beyond that specifically assigned to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Through some combination of shifting responsibilities and the transition to WFH back in March, I feel myself slipping and all the interest I had before is almost entirely gone now. Six months after starting, I effectively inherited *ownership* of this thing at work due to my minimal experience (which was still more exp. than others). I never really wanted to do this work and I was forced into becoming the (relative) expert on it because tasks I did not know how to do just kept getting thrown my way. At this point, I know my way around the work, but I am exhausted. I wake up every morning dreading to walk the 5 feet from my bed to start work. I procrastinate far too much and hate myself for all the work I am not getting done.

&amp;#x200B;

For a little background, I have been working since I was 18. Started in my last semester of high school and continued working through my 5 years at college/university. After graduating in Spring 2019, I stayed at the same job until starting a new position in Dec 2019. From 2014 to 2020, I had one week where I did not go to school or work, which was the one week between my last day at the old job and my start date at the new one. For years I told myself that things would get better when I finished school as I thought the stress I had was associated with doing both work and school together. I don't really have any passion for anything though. My first job I got because my Dad had some work and his boss was willing to hire me for it. The only interests I have are in gaming, but even that has significantly decayed over time such that I sometimes feel that I just do it because I have nothing else to do. I would prefer just to die and be done with everything, but that affects family too much so have to shelve that for a later date.",28Dec2020,1
669,"Sex with stepmom ?

Hello i need help!
I’m a 16 year old boy and My parents are divorced. My dad Got married to another women and they have been married for 8 years, and im just gonna be honest and say that i’ve had a crush on her for the longest time.

It started when i saw her in Some outfits (ankleboots, tight skirts, tight tanktops) that really turned me on, i have therefor never had a good relationship with her, because i was affraid her and My dad would find out and be angry

It Got so far that on rare occasions when my dad and her where out of the House, i would play with her underwear and smell them while jacking of.

But this year something changed, as im know 16 i have grown alot, also downstairs if you know what i mean. Im know taller than My dad and i am around 6 foot 5. 

One night at like 2am my stepmom accidenly walked in on me jacking of in My room! I have no idea why she would walk into My room, byt the fact is that she quickly left and i was greatly embaressed. 

She didn’t tell My dad and since that day she has acted different around me, almost flirtingly. She would tell me how big My hands had become and would touch me whenever she could.

But this Christmas something changed, because of corona we were only 9 people at Christmas and spent it at My stepmoms sister’s house, My stepmom was wearing her red ankleboots, and a tight leather skirt.

It was hard not to look at her, but i Got threw dinner and we were almost done with opening our gifts when My dad handed My stepmom a gift, naughty underwear, i lost My breath and excused myself to go to the bathroom. When i Got out their i heard a knock on the door. I opened thinking it was My dad but it wasn’t it was My stepmom, she asked if she could come in and i agreed i don’t know WHY!

When she Got in she turned around and locked the door, turned around and looked at me and asked if i liked My gifts. 

I quickly said yes, and asked if she liked hers, she did and asked if i liked the underwear My dad had given her, i said i did.

I don’t know what happened but suddenly she reached around me and went in for a hug, i was caught of gaurd with My hands down and when i reached up to place them on her back i hit her ass!

I felt my penis grow and knew she could feel it, suddenly i felt a hand on My hard on and looked down, My stepmom had placed her hand on My hard on and was smilling up at me.

I asked what she was doing, and she shhhhed me and went down on her knees and before i knew what was going on she was giving me a BJ, after 4 min i came and she left.

She acted like nothing had happened afterwards. 

later that night when we Where taking pictures we stood beside eachother to the left i had My hand on her back, and she without anyone noticed moved it down on her ass!

Know i don’t know what to do! One side of me is disgusted! That’s My dad’s Wife!
The other side is a honey 16 year old, with a crush on his stepmom, that would do anything to have sex with her!

I know ask for help, what should i do!?



Ps.
Im from Denmark therefor i am sorry for gramma mistakes.
The fact that im from Denmark is also the Reason why we opened gifts in the afternoon as that’s the tradition here👍",28Dec2020,1

Yesterday I found a series of accounts that I believe are selling/sharing cp. All the accounts follow each other, each one has at least a thousand followers. Each account is devoted to a different girl, some of them filled with pictures of the same girl at what is clearly a photoshoot, the comments are all gross as well. There is one video of a young girl talking to someone behind the camera in another language, they reach out and adjust her bra by reaching under it. There is gross language in the accounts as well as the comments, with captions like ""for armpit lovers"".

All of the accounts have a link to an anonymous messaging app (telegram), advising that it's for 'real buyers only'. I even found an account in the comments of a post asking for 'cp trades', with no backlash at all. I have a side account where I follow models and one of these accounts popped in my recommended feed, and I found the rest. Im just fucking sickened to my core, I have no idea if they're just selling things or are actually involved with the girls. I don't trust instagram's report function, and there's no report option for something like this (plus someone might look at this, see no real cp and move on to the next report).

Since then we’ve both felt things haven’t been the same but we’ve both said we’re going to try and bring things back to how they were.

Here's a little context. Her mom got the flu (aches, cough, etc.). She got tested for COVID to be sure it luckily she tested negative. Now my girlfriend's (call her G for the sake of this post) dad and little sister have a bad cough. But that's it. So they presume it's just a cold. I spent Christmas with them, and G did not tell me that her father and sister had a cold (she says she thought she did, but she didn't. Happens to the best of us, IMO.)

When I got home I informed my parents and I wear a mask everywhere except my room. Not because I think it's COVID but I don't want to potentially give them a cold or the flu or whatever if I can help it (I've kind of been a germophobe towards things like coughing, the flu and stuff like that and my mother is a part of the ""vulnerable sector).

G has not gotten a cough or and signs of a cold yet (knock on wood) and she remains pretty close to her dad and sister, despite their coughs and everything. I told her to stay safe and if she does get a cold I don't know if she'd be able to come celebrate with my family (per my parents wishes).

She doesn't think that it's a big deal to be around her family who has a cold, but told me she keeps a little distance and doesn't stand right beside them.

I don't know if this makes me an AH or not.

The way I see it, is school would tell you to stay home if you catch a cold. Why is this different?

he ~accidentally~ shared them by sending them to an email address that wasn’t mine. i guess he thought it was mine but it wasn’t actually mine, but i’m pissed because he has my actual email we’ve used emails SO MANY TIMES to share and edit google docs for school work.

i’m so stressed out because somebody random on the internet who i don’t know has access to two porn videos of me. 

i’m terrified that this is going to ruin my life.

i have lectured him about how important it is that these videos stay only between us, i set rules that said if we ever break up you delete these videos permanently and immediately. i made it absolutely clear that they are NOT to be shared with anybody else.

after i found out he did this instead of helping me or offering support he started yelling at ME, being passive aggressive, was huffing and puffing, shifting blame saying it wasn’t his fault because ‘he didn’t mean to’, saying that what’s done is done so ‘what do you want me to do about it.’ i am so shocked and appalled at his response to his fuck up. it’s making it even worse.

i told him he was being an asshole with his response, he got mad at me.

anyways, i have contacted gmail to report an investigation and have dealt with this myself, without any helpful contribution from him.

695," First time poster, and not sure if this belongs in [r/Military](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/), r/Divorce, or here. I'm hoping to crowd source some ideas or experiences here since I’m honestly just at a loss for what to do. Sorry if the story set up is pretty long, I’m not sure what details people might find important and I’m trying to avoid confusion.

I (32F) and my husband (32M) have been married for almost 8 years. He is currently active duty Army and has been in the service for 12 years. We have been having communication issues in our marriage for a long time and I had been asking my husband to do marriage counseling with me for a long time. I tried to balance pushing the issue for the sake of our marriage while also understanding that as messed up as it is, getting counseling while in the military can have negative connotations and I didn’t want to hurt my husband’s career. On top of that, he lost his mother a year ago and I know he has been struggling with grief and it contributed to an intensifying of his negative behavior. I am not saying that I have been perfect by any means, I have made plenty of mistakes in our marriage, but it seemed like the difference between the two of us is that I wanted to get help, make changes, try and fix things, while his solution was to live a double life, keep secrets from me, and lie over and over again. We finally reached a breaking point and in early December he finally agreed to try counseling to see whether or not things can be fixed between us.

Our first counseling session went well I thought and the counselor was able to facilitate a good discussion between us over some misunderstood expectations in our marriage that had been driving my husband away (expectations he had created for himself thinking it was what I expected when I never expected any of those things). I was hopeful that we would finally be able to talk about these things and find healing. Then less than a week after that first session I discovered text messages on his phone from a female co-worker revealing that they had been secretly seeing each other for several weeks. From the context of the messages it was clear that they hadn’t slept together yet, but that was very much in the plans for the near future as they were planning a secret vacation together. I was and still am absolutely devastated by this revelation.

I confronted my husband about the cheating and he admitted to it and said he no longer wants to work on our marriage, that he is just not happy being with me and he has found happiness elsewhere. I am heartbroken. I tried really hard to be a good wife. I tried to take all the stress at home away so that after a long day/week at work he could just relax, I tried to keep things exciting in our relationship by suggesting cheap/free date ideas for us to spend time together, I tried to always build him up and support and encourage him, and I never refused him physical intimacy (my libido was the higher one anyway). I know I’m not perfect, but I really tried to be the total package and to always make him feel like a lucky man.

So after all that set up the conclusion is I have agreed to an amicable divorce. I’m heartbroken, but I have determined that I can’t love him into falling back in love with me and so the best way I can honor the love I have for him is to let him go and do what he wants and for me to figure out where to go from here with my life.

Here’s where I need some advice reddit. I really do want this divorce to go smoothly and amicably, first because I do still care deeply for my husband and don’t want to inject anymore poison into the situation, and secondly because I have made sacrifices in my career in order to support our military lifestyle that has hurt my earning potential so that there is quite a disparity now between what he makes and what I make. It fees embarrassing to admit, but I need my husband to stay amicable during the process so that he will be reasonable and fair in the division of our assets so that I will be able to move forward with my life after the divorce is finalized.

But I’m really struggling with one issue. The cheating. I know who this other soldier is and I know she’s also married. I know that the military does not take affairs lightly. I am really struggling with whether I should inform my husband’s command about the affair. I want to make them aware of what is going on because I genuinely think that at least some part of this is tied to the self-destructive behavior my husband has been exhibiting since his mom died, and I really feel that he needs grief counseling and I feel like his command should know as he is in a leadership position and I worry how these choices may effect his judgement later on. I also don’t feel comfortable with them working together during the duration of our divorce proceedings. It’s takes a minimum of 90 days in my state to file and grant and uncontested divorce and I just don’t want to feel like there is someone else whispering in my husbands ear that whole time possibly planting animosity. And I honestly don’t have any desire t ruin my husbands career, or even the career of the other party involved, but as far as I can tell the other soldiers husband still doesn’t know and I feel bad about that. I don’t even know how to get his contact information to inform him of what’s going on and I don’t know if the command would inform him if I inform them. On top of all this I don’t want to give my husband any reason to want to fight with me during this divorce and I know if his command does punish him at all for this he will know it was me who told them. I thought about just waiting until the divorce is finalized, but that would be 3 months of me keeping this information to myself and also from the other husband involved. Even if I were able to find his information somehow, if he decided to go to their command then my husband would still figure out that I'm the reason the other husband found out. I would love advice and insight on what I should do.",28Dec2020,1

697,"When I was in middle school I got cut from the basketball team in 6th, 7th and 8th grade. The summer after my 8th grade year I played on a travel team and got benched the entire time. When I was growing up I never knew their was a whole another aspect to basketball which was practicing and drills I only ever saw people playing so I never realized why I wasn't getting better. Also, I never tried out in high school because I didn't understand why I wasn't making the team but now that I look back at it it wouldn't have mattered because my parents or me didn't realize the extent of what I had to be doing to play in college.

I tried to walk on in college but my college basketball team was so corrupt I tried two years in a row and never got a fair shot. The coach didn't even show up to the tryouts. I just feel like my sports experience is so unfair because my parents didn't know anything about the basketball world and I had no idea the extent of what I had to be doing in high school to be able to play in college.",28Dec2020,1
698,"I have anxiety and depression so sensitivity is unfortunately a given. Not to mention I had a verbally abusive childhood so that really cements it. Like I made a post on a different page on here and somebody decided to attack one thing I said in the post and accuse me of being “jealous” and “judgmental” because my opinion was different from there’s. Mature, I know. I left a lengthy and sarcastic comment in response and then deleted the post, I also told them I was going to in order to “make them feel better.” It’s just so ironically hypocritical that people expect you to respect and agree with everything they say/do, but the instant you don’t agree with them on something, you’re being “unreasonable” and “intolerant.” Do people not hear themselves when they say this kind of stuff or...? Ever heard of practice what you preach? No? Guess not. Either way all my life I’ve been sensitive to people hating me for having a differing viewpoint than them. Again, mainly cause of my background. Mom was a gaslighter/narcissist so if you thought you even considered not agreeing with her she would mock and degrade you. My dad is bipolar so when he’s having an episode he makes fun of you and degrades you. Or just flat out won’t let you speak if you disagree with him.

I really wanna see a therapist, not only for possible adhd, but also just because i have really low self esteem and i just want someone to talk to. However, my parents “don’t believe in therapy”. They think that anything i have to say can be discussed with them. It’s mostly my dad that feels this way, but my mom always agrees with him. Last time i brought up seeing a therapist, my mom shushed me because she didn’t want my dad hearing. Every time i talk about how i’m feeling, my parents either say i  1) am faking it 2) am being dramatic 3) should just stop, it’s not that hard. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried explaining to them that therapy is a completely normal and healthy thing, but they’re telling me it’s just puberty and that i’ll get over myself.

702,"In August 2020, I moved in with my 2 friends in a small house from my parents house. I’m 24 years old, so I wanted a change of scenery. I was starting a semester of university in the fall so I was very excited and driven. As soon as we moved in, we were partying and having a lot of fun celebrating, as someone in their 20s would do. Unfortunately, hard liquor and substances were always involved. And truth be told, I’ve been abusing alcohol and other substances for about 5 years. Me and my roommates would party maybe twice a week, but it still interfered with my studies because I had an intense course load. 

In October, my grades were slipping, and I had a stint with covid and had to quarantine for a few weeks, which caused me to drink every single day and do absolutely no work. My roommates joined me most of the time or would deliver me substances. During this time I was seeing a guy who had no idea this was going on in my life and I wanted to keep it that way. Fast forward to early November, and I’m drinking wine after I finish a project for school to “celebrate.” My roommate comes home with substances and we start doing it all night long... she kept picking up more and more, and so many sketchy people came to the house that day. 16 hours later I am still up and having the worst time of my life. I’m having a full mental break and my roommate is reassuring “it’s okay” and I’m overthinking it. I’m supposed to hang out with my now boyfriend later in the day and I was having the absolute worst time. I had a stint in the hospital years before from drug and alcohol abuse and have been under suicide watch in the past, so I knew this was a recipe for disaster. Long story short, I wound up in the hospital that night and worried my boyfriend sick as he had no idea the extent of my substance abuse addiction. He was crying and I was crying and I told him to never let me touch substances or alcohol again and I was counting on him. Fast forward to today and I am 1.5 months completely sober and I haven’t stepped foot in that house since. I feel great, ended the semester with good grades, and I felt a lot of support from my boyfriend. My roommates desperately want me to come home, but to be quite frank, I don’t even want to be around an environment that welcomes drugs and alcohol because it’s extremely triggering and I feel like I could relapse. The extremely unfortunate part is while I have not been there, my roommate moved in our other friend in the basement and he passed away from an overdose a few weeks ago. The amount of sadness, anguish and frustration I felt was insurmountable.... I wish I could have been there for him, but I was busy focusing on my sobriety. I am also just so extremely frustrated because they are still partying and using drugs as if nothing happened. 

Today, I am still at my boyfriends and he absolutely does not want me back in that house after everything that has happened, and I agree with him. The thing is, my name isn’t on the lease and I did not sign anything.  So that being said, would I just be able to pack up my things and move somewhere else? I don’t want to be rude and just leave so I’ll try to find someone to take my room but I preferably want to have a new place in 2 months that is healthy for me. I’m just lost as to what I should do, I feel like if I pack up and leave, my roommates are going to be very salty and hate me... but at the same time I can’t find anything in common with these people and have not been a good influence in my life with no desire to change for the better... I haven’t felt a lot of support from them.

703,"Hiiiiiii everyone it's like 2am and I'm pretty high but I started thinking about something (basically the title). Not having a hobby didn't really bother me until recently I realised almost everyone around me had something they were passionate about and I'm kind of jealous.

I do like to play guitar and sing and draw and play games but I'm not particularly good at anything and I don't spend enough time on any of them to refer to them as something I'm passionate about. 

I define a hobby/passion to be something where you have a drive of motivation everytime you do that particular thing but I just don't feel that way about anything. I've even tried to start reading but it's just not it.

I would love to have the passion for something also because you gain knowledge about a particular thing that you like and it looks like it feels great...

704,"So 7 years ago right out of high school I came to the conclusion I would be most happy working in the horse industry. I went off on an unpaid internship, and have more or less been doing that since. I got my Associates in Equine Science and Management in that time and am currently hired at a very low salary. I’m at a point now where I feel that this is not going to benefit me in the long term, and I need a more substantial job/career. My parents/family have been so supportive (in every way but financial) and are dead set that I’m going to see this through and train horses for a living. In a lot of ways this job has become my identity, so much so I don’t know if I can break away from this.

the guy lives in my town but goes to school in the town my friend lives in (about a 30 minute drive away) because of some issues that happened at the high school in my town. So they go to the same school and they’re in a pretty good relationship. 

my friend though has very bad mental health, depression, anxiety, and trust issues. it got so bad once we were once in a group chat with around 8 people all snapping back and fourth and i sent a snap saying “hey Kevin if you don’t stop using a British accent i’m gonna come punch you then we’ll get slurpees” and my friend called me crying “are you actually making plans with my boyfriend right now” and i had to explain i was joking and would never hang out with him without her there. she was paranoid that me and him used to talk (which i had brought up about 3 days before as a joke) and she was getting bad dreams about it but i assured her i would never do that because i wouldn’t. it was 2am when that happened. 

Anyways, i think that she should tell her boyfriend about her depression as anxiety, she told me “i’m not telling him because he will worry” but i think all that he has the right to know that the girl he is dating has mental health issues because one day everything is going to pile up and one of them is going to fuck up. advice ?",28Dec2020,1

709,"Need some advice. Ive been struggling with depression for years now, I think it just all came tumbling down on me about a year ago, however I can recall that I was never really happy since middle school. Its not diagnosed since I don't care about myself enough to go to a doctor, however I just ignored it and told myself I had to do what I had to do even if I just wanted it all to end and pretended to be happy. I had this friend from high school who went to the same college and we were pretty close and he got me into popping sleeping pills every night, I'm talking 800mg of DPH a night. However this wasn't the end of it. I know some chemistry due to my major and, to be vague here, utilized it to continue my downward spiral. I won't get into the specifics but I had no hope in myself and was very reckless; I'm amazed I don't have worse ramifications than the ones I have right now. I'm in my senior year of college right now, and up to this point I was  generally a good student with a 3.5 gpa (2.75 now). Part of me thinks the issue was that I was surrounded by constant negativity. Most of my friends I made switched their majors due to partying and skipping classes, and my friend from high school was constantly talking about how s\*\*t college was and ended up attempting suicide (I can't help and think that this was my fault since I was literally the only guy he hung out with, part of me thinks I should've been there for him; and I kinda ridiculed him for doing so many drugs after experiencing seizures). I kinda told myself everything was going to be alright while I did this, I have a decent trade job on the side which makes decent money. However I came clean to my parents a couple weeks ago and they expressed how they did want that for me. That later on in life my body will not be up to the task that the trade job demands. They of course cried once I told them about my excessive drug use, however I kept out the suicide attempt and more illegal stuff I did, and told me they loved me. I will be honest, I felt very alone my entire life and this made me realize how badly I fucked up. I was about to drop out of college however my parents are encouraging me to pursue my degree. However Ive reached a limit on the number of times I can retake a class on 2 classes. I haven't attended them in about a year. Im hesitant to try again, but I know I can succeed if I put the work in.

But life goes on and you pick yourself back up, healthy mind and healthy attitude and all that. I get myself into a position where I felt ready to meet someone else and to my surprise It didn't take too long until I'd found myself back in contact with a old school friend, things were going surprisingly well and plans were being made for the new year. Nothing rushed just slow and steady, I should also add that the divorce was of course mentioned and she humbly took that in her stride. All was going swimmingly until just before Christmas whereby I, a grown man, found myself crying in my car in a Tescos car park (strong choice I know). I thought I'd reach out for a bit of emotional support, as I don't believe anyone should bottle things away, however I was greeted with silence. The message was read and there was never a response, I've since sent a couple of other messages asking if things are okay but again these have been read and not responded. I won't pursue it any further as I don't feel it'll achieve much, perhaps try again in the new year?

I should add that we've always been open and honest with one another, I hid nothing from my previous relationship from her as I thought full disclosure was the correct path to take.

712,"Hey,
i’m gonna be really surprised if anyone actually finds this post out of the many other ones and says something about it, but I really need some advice from kind strangers on Reddit, since I’d rather die than talk about this to any of my friends, since it’s kind of an embarrasing topic for me.
I’m 14 year old and a girl.
So I do not really remember when this thing started in my head but I’d say it was like 1-2 years ago. I created an imaginary life in my head. It’s the life of a 20 year old who was practically born an orphan while his father died 3 months before his birth and his mom died after giving birth to him, he has a very unique “condition” i guess, which was genetically passed on to him, as his entire family is known to have it. I’m not really gonna twist the topic into what it is and who he is, generally, that’s not really the point. I’ll try to make this as short as possible, he gets bullied in school and abused his entire childhood, later falls in love with the only person in his life that showed some kind of sympathy towards him, they both love each other and get really famous, he manages to be extremely successful as both a model (important to note, he’s actually very very handsome in every way possible, seems like the perfect man to me and is literally considered a beauty symbol among men) and as a singer, and he becomes a very popular and loved singer. He becomes extremely popular and gains a very huge fanbase and friends among celebrities, who view him as an idol themselves. 
Now, to the important part..
This guy has literally become my entire life, and not to mention, I do actually have my own social life, friends my own goals and stuff, but I feel like this fictional character i’ve created in my mind is gonna start to have a huge effect on my mind if I don’f figure out what the actual hell this is. 
Every good song I come across, I imagine as if he created and is getting all the recognition. Every video I come across of guys doing literally anything a little interesting, I view it as if he’s doing it and my imagination makes me turn everything I come across into little situations out of his life. Even situations in my own life, I do the same thing, I imagine him in the situations, what he would say or do, when someone out of my guy friends does something, I imagine him doing that. This is literally so damn confusing for you all, but I truly don’t know how else I can describe. I basically view EVERYTHING as something he does. I feel like it’s starting to have an effect on me as sometimes I’ll imagine myself doing the stuff he does, he’s in every goddamn minute of my life, I swear. I imagine him doing everything I see others doing, and It’s actually getting uncontrollable. I think of random scenarios involving HIM and make up storylines and plots all in my mind. whenever something happens in my life or in the lives of people surrounding me, i have to imagine him going through it and basically entertain myself fantasizing all about his life. I sometimes even catch myself acting like him when I’m alone, which isn’t really normal for a female. I sometimes wish I was a male (not really strong desire, though, even though i was kind of worried about having gender dysphoria or something) just so I could be him, have his body, his looks, his life, try to act like him and stuff, basically i idolize him and his entire life in every way possible. I think it’s some sort of a coping mechanism I’ve created when I was going through a dark time, but it hasn’t faded along with the trauma at all, it has only grown more and more consistent in my life. I feel like i’m very attached AND attracted to him, as in my mind he’s the absolute flawless version of a man i’d want in my life and in general and he’s a great part of my mind and I was thinking about if I should attempt to force myself to stop fantasizing about him and eventually end the imaginary life i’m living in some unknown way or if I should keep this going on?
I feel like if i somehow get rid of it my life will become healthier, I’ll start comprehending every situation in my own point of view in reality and not think of him for once, even though I practically never make decisions from his point of view in situations happening in MY life, but I feel like some day it will evolve into that too. I don’t know why, I feel like I would feel more like myself and live my actual reality how it is if I didn’t obsess about his life all the time. But at the same time, like I said, I feel attached to this character. It seems like something geniunely valued by me to have this weird ass connection with this absolutely non existent fictional man i’ve created as a result of some kind of trauma. 
I know this may seem incredibly confusing to you, but I tried my best to explain my feelings, and even left some things out, as english is not my first language and I simply don’t know how to express myself in a correct way. I’ll appreciate any kind of response to this, any sort of information on if this is normal or not, or what it could be, or even if there’s anyone that relates to this in some way lol. and mostly, what you think would be the best thing to do in this situation.

[What u/Qeidren said about the butterflies is very true](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/klo6rj/how_do_you_know_when_you_are_in_love/gha81c1/):

&gt; When even after the butterflies have calmed down (and they will), and everything has stopped being new and exciting (that one is definitely inevitable), there are still moments where you look at them or just think about them and feel like 'how the hell did this happen and how could I ever be so lucky?'

&gt; And when you can't remember the last time you had one of those moments with them, your first thought is to do whatever it takes to find them again.

&gt; You'll still get butterflies, and you will still have those wonderful sun-blessed days where everything shines, but you won't be so worried about whether or not they're happening right now, because you know you've got the thing that those moments are made of, and as long as you keep digging, it will never stop flowing.

It's just like that one family member you really love. If you love a person, you will still be able to live your life knowing that you can go back to them. When someone loves you, you will know it because their support is still with you no matter what you're doing and you know you will be loved unconditionally when you get back. When it's a crush, it can be hard to focus on what you need to do, it's very easy to get envious about them talking to other people, and it's easy to worry about them getting their attention or worry about being around them.

I will say that sometimes exposure or addiction feels like real love. It's fine to be addicted or used to the one that you really do love but it'll go beyond that. When you truly love, it's about you and the person, not about you having the person. When you don't have the person you like, it's an emptiness around you and loneliness inside..When you don't have the one you love or family, it's an emptiness inside and loneliness around you. Love can also be both of these things inside and out.

When the pride or benefits or excitement goes away, and it's time for real life to start kicking in, it's easy to ask yourself if you're really in love.

**Needing the person**

When you're in the best of times, either it'll be WITH the person you love physically there or WITH them being supportive from afar, or it'll be BECAUSE your crush is there. Of course love can be pleasurable because the person is there but it won't be limited to that, the true pleasure will come with then not because of them.

When you're in your worst of times, even if your tolerance has been surpassed by the person or if you're hurting and the person isn't able to help, you will still need them there. When you love someone instead of like them, you won't expect them to be there because you need exposure or need something that can give you, you won't accept the behavior/problem as a cost for being with the person. When you love them, you need them there because you need the person, you need what you have together, and they would expect that of themselves if they really cared. When you want them there, it's not from exposure or out of habit, it's not about what you lose or gain when they are there or not there, and it's not about how long you guys will have each other. When you want them there, it's actually about what they are missing and what you guys won't have together and you not being there to support them. 

Of course you are going to need things from the person and you're going to need to give them things, and neglecting that can compromise the relationship. If a family member or partner is not giving you what you need despite fully being able to (or being legally obligated), that is neglect. When it's emotional neglect, it's a lack of their commitment. Of course there are exceptions when emergencies or tight schedules or medical problems arise, but if the person is not committed to you, then it is not high priority relationship. If you find yourself not having the time for the person despite having the time of day, that is a sign that you may not actually love them or be interested, and that is perfectly fine to feel as long as you are honest with your feelings.

**Support**

When the person you really love isn't supporting you, it won't be about them not doing their job, it won't be about them being terrible/neglectful/etc., it won't be about you losing your relationship status or not getting their attention, it won't be about what you are losing or what you want to see. When the person you love isn't supporting you, it's abandonment. When you love someone and invest in them, but you don't get it back, it'll be about you not being loved back. 

When you're worried about not being loved back, it isn't about whether you're good enough for them or not. You shouldn't have to worry about not being good enough as long as you're taking care of yourself. You also shouldn't be able to pick apart things you are doing wrong (even things you don't want to admit) or things they are doing that are hurting you/separating you. If you're worried about being good enough, it can either be from your insecurities, or be a sign of their high expectations, and can indicate abuse/manipulation.

**Second chances**

With a crush or a person you like, or a person who doesn't actually love you back, you may give a second chance, which will honestly be more about you having more time with them, reaching then how to treat you, and getting a second chance to be impressed. With a person you love, the second chance will be an opportunity for them to have better conditions because you know they can reach a potential and you know you have things to work on as well.

When you give second chances to a person you love and you are still getting hurt, or you find out it escalates, then that is not safe for you. That is a time where you are not unconditional with each other.

**Unconditional love and conditions and safety**

Related to the butterflies: Love is unconditional, yes, but when you are in love you have more clarity. When someone you love does something wrong, of course you're always going to defend the one you love. You're always going to be okay or want to not blame them because you know they didn't mean that, you've seen their better side. But when you truly love somebody, you also know that: if they're doing bad things on purpose or they're able to control their flaws and they don't, then it is safe to say that they don't actually care about your well being, their behavior is more important than others' safety, they don't care to take your support, and they don't care about what you guys have together. Either they don't actually love you back or there is something keeping them from holding you at that value. Sometimes it is not their fault due to other conditions, but that is not a safe or supportive relationship for you and you have to consider whether you can safely help the person or if you need to give them resources and go back to safety. 

If they did actually love you, they would know you have to be safe and that you worry about their condition too. Someone who loves you would either do what they could to control their condition because they're worried about yours, and they would accept your support, OR they would know that they couldn't control it and they'd sacrifice you for your safety and condition. If you love somebody and you are in danger, you will know that you are in danger. When you have an addiction or a crush or if there is psychological manipulation, problems with safety tends to come off as something else or be difficult to tell. 

Either way, even if you are in the deepest love with somebody, or if you realize the person you like is putting you in danger, do not tolerate what they're doing to you. If you are in danger by anyone, don't be afraid to hurt the other person, especially if they are threatening or injuring you. Intoxication and coercion and nonconsensual sadism are not excuses for them to hurt you. Accidents DO happen as part of life and they are forgiven. Have good judgement, because repeated incidents that are known about are not accidents. They are not acceptable. Neither is them making up for repeated incidents or buying you things or doing things for you.

**Do you love them?**

It's not about asking yourself if you really love the person, because if you could ask yourself that then you're always going to find problems. 

You know you're in love when you don't find yourself asking whether or not you love them. If you're not in danger or if there's no motive for you or them, then the question of whether you love them will not have to come up. If it comes up at any point, you know you have some things to look into. If you have a lot of anxiety or trauma, anxiety can trigger false red flags and can make you question things, however if you are compatible with the person and if you are a priority, then they will do what they can to help you through so that you can be loved and be safe. And if you actually love somebody, you will be able to do the same if the roles were reversed.

**For anything here, you should be able to see the roles reversed. Of course people are not ever perfect and there is no strict criteria to ever apply, but this can help you evaluate whether it is love or not.**",28Dec2020,1
715,Context me and my “Friend” cheated on an essay portion of a midterm he did two short essays I did the long one I poorly changed the words on the two I copied teacher caught us.

716,"I'll try not to overwhelm with the context. We're both 19, became friends about two years ago. She was in foster care at the time and I gave her rides home from work. I took her to get burgers on the way and we bonded.

We sort of diverged when I started college and she moved really far up north. Her mom overdosed in my first semester and I tried my best to be her backbone. She doesn't really have anyone else. Her dad died when she was young and her grandparents were abusive, and she was brought up in almost 20 different foster homes.

We grew apart a bit after that, partly because she was so far away. We still talk sometimes but don't see each other very much. She made new friends and I'm happy for her. I worry about her. I drink but not like she does, blacking out every weekend. She does coke and acid and probably worse. Even my boyfriend pointed out that she got so thin and she seems pretty out of it.

Recently she went back to her ex, who was emotionally abusive at the very least. I warned her against this but she told me he'd changed. They've been together again for two months and he just kicked her out, called the police on her and told her to kill herself. The police did nothing but now she's with her abusive grandma again. I offered her a place to live but it's over an hour away from her work, so she just said thank you, and she'll let me know if she needs anything.

Please someone tell me what I can do for her? She won't take help for the drugs or the alcohol even though I know it's eating her alive. Part of me understands that after all she's gone through she doesn't want to *feel* shit anymore. I can't give her a place to stay and I feel useless just saying sorry.",28Dec2020,1
717,"Because of online learning my grades have been much lower than in previous years. I have gotten all A’s for the last few years but this semester I am getting B’s and possibly C’s because of late and missing assignments. I will try to fix this issue next semester. I am worried how this will affect my chances of getting into MIT or Stanford and other things. Even though I am only in 7th grade, the classes I am taking are HS classes like Calc 1/2, advanced physics (basically ap physics c), and HS biology so I am getting HS credits and my grades will affect GPA for when I apply to colleges. I wanted to get a 4.0 when I started taking HS classes last year and would have if it weren’t for online school but now that is ruined. I am worried that I won’t be able to get into good colleges like MIT or Stanford. I am also worried that my reputation is ruined; I think that teachers will now think of me as a lazy kid with bad grades. Even though I probably got terrible grades this semester, I am afraid to look, I have been participating in math competitions, science bowl, in which I am the captain of our team, and NACLO.

719,"I think I have begun to notice a change in myself that is increasingly feeling more and more destructive. I have for a period of at least a couple years been feeling down, or not really happy, but I had friends and an environment and school and extracurriculars to distract myself. I was happy, or at least ignorant to my mental health to a point where I was starting to feel better about myself, but then, things changed. This year feels hard to me, and although I know other people have it worse, but I just feel like my life has been going downhill for a while. 






I graduated high school, and did cc for a semester before starting online college. My family had to move 9 hours away to a new home, and I felt more and more isolated. I tried community college classes, and did well, but other than that I havent done anything. I used to enjoy playing video games or reading books, but I can't seem to bring myself to do them anymore. I try getting a job before college starts in January, but again no luck. 



Emotionally I feel sadder and sadder, weaker, not being able to even bring myself out of bed before 12 anymore, not as hungry, and, more alarmingly, angrier and angrier. Its gotten to the point where I think I may be scaring my parents a little, with simple arguments or discussions turning into moments where I start yelling. Its like I feel like I can't control my emotions anymore, and that terrifies me. One time I flipped out on my friend, something we got over but still haunts me. I feel myself becoming more and more angry, more and more isolated, and I just hate myself and everyone else around me more and more. 



I fear this may be coming to a head. I feel like im useless, and that I'll never accomplish anything in life, and I feel like that fuels my anger, and not talking to people makes me more and more paranoid, like im falling down a hole or something. I spend a lot of time online, and that makes things worse (I'm trying to cut it out though), and I just don't know what to do. I want to get help, but im not sure how to talk to my parents about my mental health (usually they'll say I dont have it as bad so I should stop being sad or something, where I usually just get mad and stop talking to them), or really what to do next. I tried pulling myself up by the bootstraps, but that just got me stuck even farther it feels. Idk, I know I'm ranting, but I feel like im panicking and idk what to do to help it or rather even get out of this hole. I...

726,"I’ve spent a good chunk of my teenage years a depressed geek (the words I use for myself doesn’t reflect how I feel about anyone else.) I got my heart broken and it’s been a battle to stay in the right mindset and finally after three years of fighting insecurities, feelings of never being good enough and social anxiety, I’ve finally decided to work on putting myself out more. I brought a gym membership, I started buying new clothes that fit me, I’m teaching myself a skill along with a new language with my free time since I’m unemployed. 
I’ve been reading more and I meditate and listen to affirmations. I even cleaned my messy room and threw out a lot of stuff. 
It has improved my mood but for some reason, when it’s time to REALLY put myself out like for example, I’m going to the gym tonight to work with a personal trainer I’m feeling depressed almost. Whenever it’s time for me to really put myself out into the open I get depressed and start wanting to shut down. This has been a recurring theme for me. All the first attempts I’ve made at changing myself for the better ended in me closing up or shutting down. I get too comfortable with not doing anything and I stop attempting until I get happy and motivated again. I don’t want to drop everything just because I get sad or depressed or lose motivation. 
I have social anxiety but there’s times where it’s not bad and I don’t notice it or I’m not thinking about it but then I get in moods like today and I’m painfully aware of it. Is this a normal part of I guess self improvement and how do I get through this part?",28Dec2020,1

This roommate then brought up his ability to create rat poison, which was not considered a concern at first, but in retrospect, I think maybe he should have thought about a possible motive for making poison.

Small compact mirrors, my reflection, or the medium mirrors they put in public schools in the restroom, although they still give me unease it's easy to ignore, don't bother me at all. It's the large mirrors that almost have me crying.

735,"Hello, So I used to be friends with my cousin a lot back in the day (all early childhood) till about 12 odd, saw each other a lot as he spent a lot of time in a nearby relatives house. We saw each other less frequently as the years went on. A few months ago he was kicked out of his home in another town and has since moved back down here. I would only occasionally (once a year at best) see him for the last chunk of years and since returning he asked to hang out again. I agreed of course and we went skating with my friends as it’s a big common interest and I didn’t mind a catch up.

I should mention my cousin is one of these people that has a good few issues and negative traits. He’s a dark horse - most people see that in him, he doesn’t portray himself the best. The issue I find most irritable about him is back n’ forth communication. Considering the amount of common interests we share you’d think it would be easy to talk to him but no. It’s constant hijacked conversations from his side. He’s a guy that will talk about a certain topic relentlessly, without giving you any moment to shine in the conversation.

I will start a conversation with him, he will overtake me within 10 seconds and continue talking and filling every gap until whenever. It’s beyond exhausting if I’m being honest. I'm giving out about not talking either! It's how intense it the whole thing is. Regardless of what I say,, he will just talk over me and give me absolutely no space to talk or let the conversation ‘breath’. I avoid attempting to empower him lately as he’ll just talk for 20+ mins without me able to say a word and by the time he’s finished, I genuinely have no idea what he’s talking about.

I’ve never come across anyone who’s so draining on a social level. There’s almost a level of relief after hanging out with him. It was around the 3rd/4th occasion of seeing him that I realized I didn’t really want him in my life anymore, he’s too exhausting. At that point he had already behaved immature and childish to me on a personal level. Being the ages we are (Nearly Mid-20’s) I didn’t respect that behavior and had red flags since this was only the 3/4th in a long while we had seen each other.

There’s not enough positives to continue this redeemed relationship between me and him.

After much thought I decided to take the route of easing myself out of the relationship, forcing myself to see him less &amp; less. He will text me 2-5 times a week generally - I excuse myself with something else going on in my life, kind of hoping he eventually gets the picture and stops texting me. I still met up every 3-4 weeks with him since the End of October just as I felt bad for declining his requests so much so I thought every once in a while would suffice.

I know I chose to hang out with him on multiple occasions before deciding this so I claim responsibility for how some of this has panned out and I do feel bad about shooting him down.

What would you do? Let me know, thanks!",28Dec2020,1
736,"I have been drinking alcohol since I was 18, where I would get drunk a handful of times a month- it became a social thing and how I would hang out with my friends and distress. I started anti depressants back in March, where I had ceased drinking for a couple months (as you are highly advised against drinking). I think I started to drink again in July or so, but I think there were two main factors that had made me stop drinking was 1) my very low mental state and I wanted the medicine to work and 2) I hadn’t seen any of my friends because of covid, wasn’t going to restaurants where I could get alcohol, etc. At the start of November I had some blood work done (just normal checkup stuff) and some of my thyroid levels came back abnormal. Fast forward to December, I saw an endocrinologist to which they said I have hyperthyroidism and that my levels had got exponentially worse. This then prompted me to start on medication to fix that too. I’m currently in college and I’m going to be turning 21 next year and I’m frustrated at the fact that I won’t be able to enjoy my 21st for the fact that I wanted to go out and go buck wild. It bothers me so much that one of my friends is finally coming back to my state that we come to college in and I won’t be able to drink with her like we used to- it was something we both enjoyed doing together. 

I am fixated on the fact that I am going to be missing out in drinking with my friends for the foreseeable future (as I have no idea if and when I’ll go into remission from my hyperthyroidism and I don’t want to stop taking antidepressants because I feel they help me to some extent). How do I stop being so bummed out about not being able to drink, especially for my 21st which will be coming up in a few months?! 

Sure, it’s better for me to stop it all around for my health, but there’s a lot of “fear of missing out” mentality going on in my head",28Dec2020,1

739,"(I feel like this is really stupid to post on this subreddit when there are bigger problems here...)

I (15F) am starting to get a bit annoyed with sharing a room with my younger sister (11F). I feel really bad for saying this because I don't want to sound selfish. But she has so many toys and its just flooding the room so its always a mess because of this. And its not just her toys that is flooding our room. Our room is so full of her stuff, I don't even have space for mine. Not to mention, I share a bed with her (she refuses to get separate beds) and I'm a bit annoyed by that too. 

 Since we have another room that's supposed to be hers, I tried asking my parents if she could move there and they agreed with me. However, my sister doesn't want to move to her own room because she is afraid of sleeping alone and she needs a night-light. I can't really facetime my friends anymore or do anything on my own because of this. What should I do? And is it selfish for me to feel like this?

740,"Throwaway account.

Over a decade ago, I (26F) lost all of my friends and was a loner. I was not close to my family and spent my days playing games online in my room. I made friends online and a friendship with a guy flourished into something more. Let's call him B. I didn't love him, I just loved not having the feeling of being alone in the world. This was my biggest and most stupid regret in life. I was a stupid kid and said anything to keep his attention. My parents found our ""romantic"" text messages on my phone and took my phone away and I was grounded for months. Our relationship ceased. Looking back, it was really so dumb of me to do something like that but I was quite literally young and dumb, but I also was a vulnerable soul.

Today, B messaged me on Facebook because he was diagnosed with MS and said he never stopped loving me and never stopped thinking about me. I never gave him my full name, so I am not sure how he found me on Facebook. 

I actually have forgotten that this situation has happened in my past. B apologized for what he did to me, but I don't actually remember what happened or care (sorry if that sounds bad, but I genuinely don't). I'm currently in an amazing relationship with a man I've been with for 7 years and we plan on getting married. I don't understand how something that happened over a DECADE ago still resonates in B's mind, especially when we were literal kids. 

My immediate response was to block B and make sure my whole profile and posts were private, which I could've sworn they were before. But now I'm worried that he will contact my boyfriend and family members now that he has found my Facebook account and my full name. What should I do? I don't want this from my past to ruin my present or my future. My boyfriend has no idea of this, and it was something so stupid I did when I felt alone in the world growing up.",28Dec2020,1

I haven't told my dad about this yet. Nor my auntie. My poor auntie.

I know that, where my auntie lives...there's so much more to it, in the city. More jobs, more choices, etc. Plus, I find their family pretty cool. They have what I love or like or want, to put it simply. I want to make friends in the city too. I want to see what being a city girl is like too.

My boyfriend was mocking and annoying me earlier while I was trying to do work, and wouldn't stop after I repeatedly asked him to. It gets to the point where I yell at him to stop because I don't know how to get him to listen to me.
When I was done I tried to hug him, asking him to stop being annoying on purpose and just hug me for a minute. He kept doing stuff like breathing in my ear and licking my face (things he knows I hate) and when I tried to push him away, he started 'play fighting' with me. It started with him pushing me off the couch onto the floor, but again he didn't stop even when I was using this 'safeword' we have, specifically for this reason because me saying stop isn't enough.
I kept telling him that if he won't stop 'play fighting' with me (which usually involves actually hurting me) I'll probably end up hurting him by trying to defend myself. It's always like that, me asking him to stop, him not stopping, and him eventually getting scratched or something when i try to get him to stop hurting me.
He still kept going, getting on top of me and holding my arms down really hard. At some point he (accidentally) hit me in the face with something while I was trying to get out from under him, and my lip was bleeding. I was crying at this point and he was still on me, laughing, and doing shit like licking my face.
Eventually I bit his finger to get out of his grip, and pretty hard apparently. That's when he finally got mad at me and stopped, saying that it was enough. I was still crying and asked him why he has to get hurt before it's enough, why me bleeding and asking him to stop doesn't mean it's enough. And he mocked me, asking 'you can't take some playing?' and saying that I was making a big deal out of a little blood on my lip. 

He's been KINDA violent 2 times before (sitting on top of me like that and screaming at me, or grabbing my hair to yell at me) but that was out of anger, and never like this.

757,"Hello reddit, this is something that I have been struggling with for a while and could use some outside help in making a decision. I am a cat lady, have been since I was a kid (cat kid?). And of course with pet ownership comes hard decisions, possibly the most important one being when they are old and you need to decide if you should take them to that big rainbow bridge in the sky or let them carry on and hope that when they go themselves that it doesn't hurt. I have a cat, his name is Jasper. Aslo known as: Jazzy, Baby Jasper, and Snookums. For over a decade he has been my child, my baby! He's going to be 12 in a few months and when I got him he was so tiny he could fit in one hand. Hes been with me through all of high school, college, and countless nights of depression and anxiety, but now things are different. 

Over the span of two years his behavior has spiraled downward to the point that he's a completely different cat, he pretty much acts like a feral cat now! This is a cat that would literally reach up to be held and wrap his paws around my neck for a hug while nuzzling his head under my chin! But now I can't even touch him without him hissing and growling at me. He's become so aloof and we joke that he's a grumpy old man, but I'm seriously concerned. A few months ago I had to move to another city for a job and my parents talked me out of bringing him, he's an outside country cat and if I took him then he would be cooped up in a tiny apartment and would be miserable, but he seems miserable anyway! My mother has done her best to keep up his care: he always has food, she tries to get him in the house when the weather is bad, and he gets his special treat (ham) almost every day. But unfortunately no one can touch him or else he loses his mind. It's like he doesn't know who we are anymore! The only living thing that he allows near him is our old dog Sophie whom he was a baby with.

Mom brought up the option to ""send him to live in a farm"" on my last visit because he seems so miserable and she is worried and not just for my 4 year old nephew and for he, but for Jasper as well. She's worried he might have dementia or something or some other condition that's just making him like this! I'm not good at letting go of those I'm close to, especially my fur babies, but now I'm seriously thinking about this.

Am I a bad cat mom?

For example, she has serious trouble doing things like adding single digit numbers, and telling the time on an analog clock. She operates intellectually at what I’d estimate to be an 3rd grade level maybe? She is also extremely belligerent, and always has been. She verbally abused and harassed my parents daily. I cannot remember a day in my life where there wasn’t a fight morning, noon, and night between my sister and my parents about gosh knows what. 90 percent of the time my parents gave in to whatever her demands were just to stop the screaming and pestering. She is incapable of empathy or understanding how her actions make others feel. Essentially, my parents whole lives have completely revolved around her since she was born. She has never received outside help other than when my mom took her all around to different after school special needs helpers/tutors, but that stopped when she got to middle school. She was never forced to contribute to responsibilities around the house such as doing dishes, laundry, taking the trash out, or cleaning in general. She fought too much that it wasn’t worth making her do it, and when she was forced to do something it was never done properly so it had to be done again anyway. She generally refuses to contribute to any responsibilities around the house. She has also never had a job.

Basically for the past ~2 years my mental health has been decreasing a lot. This is because of many reasons. But mainly because of the fact that my family is in poverty so we've had to move 4 times in these 2 years, usually have to chose to either by food or pay rent, have to ask for help from family and friends and so on. Also a very big factor to this is when I switched schools( also 2 years ago) I got a mentally abusive coach so I always left practice crying and many times also considering suicide (I had 2 practices a day so that was hard on me). And then my moms boyfriend he's probably the nr 1 reason why my family is in poverty since he doesn't earn anything and if he does he just buys alcohol and/or drugs. It's also not like he only spends his own money, he spends most of my moms money too. 

So this might seem insignificant to most people but the only reason I'm alive right now is my bestfriend, my sister, my mom and my cat who I've had for 10 years already. And my moms boyfriend is saying that he'll kill my cat and shit like that and honestly because of the amount of time I've had my cat it feels like he's saying he want to murder someone for my family.

I think it might make him uncomfortable since it is so focused on his OCD, but it would be a nice and practical gift even if it wasn’t about his OCD. How would you feel? If it is offensive, how can I soften the gift to make it less offensive?

768,"This happens recently a couple of days ago, I was invited to get some drinks for Christmas at my best friend house, someone who I consider close since we know each other from middle school. Her sister (Jane Doe) was there drinking too, after a while I was too drunk to drive so, I stay there to sleep and the only room I can sleep is in the guest room which Jane also happens to be here, tbh I never have any attraction towards her or saw her anything more than my friend's sister, but while I was laying there next to Jane I start to make some moves on her (don't ask me why I was already drunk) which for my surprise she didn't slap me or call me a weirdo but long story short we ended up making out and getting a bj from her. Everyone is of age and legal with me being a couple of years older. I vaguely remember saying that we couldn’t tell anyone about this.

I’ve never been in this situation before, I can remember some parts of what happened, the next day I text Jane to see if she remembers what happened the night before and she acknowledges what had happened, and I told her jokingly that if we should hookup she said yes.

Should I just stop there and not hook up with her sister or should I tell my friend so I don't ruin our friendship? Side note my friend has told me in the past he doesn't care who her sister sleep with as long they don't hurt her or do anything bad to her",28Dec2020,1
769,"For context: I recently got hired as a cashier and even though it was my decision i'm already dreading working. I've had jobs in the past and it's always been the same for me where my anxiety just skyrockets and I feel like im living in this sludge. I couldn't eat or sleep and it was like my only thoughts were about work despite me being part time. I lost a lot of weight and it was just daily headaches and crying spells. I know it's not my fault but I feel so weak for getting like this, I feel like a failure because I cant even handle a simple job. Anyways, at this new job I gathered my courage and told my boss that i could not work more than 20 hours a week under the guise that I had to focus on school and he was actually okay with it. The hiring process took so long that the fall semester already ended!! I think he knows this so i'm scared that he will give me longer shifts. My question is, do you think I should tell him about my anxiety? It sounds so lame to explain how I get so physically and emotionally drained after so little time but I really don't know what else to do, I don't want to feel like i did back then but I don't want to quit so soon after just getting hired. Also, this might help to explain my quiet and closed off demeanor once I start working, but again, I'm not sure if this is the right decision.",28Dec2020,1

I can’t help but overthink if I said something, if I’m boring, etc. it’s not that I want to be in a relationship with this guy, it’s that I just want to be liked and if I’m not I constantly think of ways to get people to keep thinking about me.

771,"Okay I’m going to keep this brief. I’m really looking for outsiders’ thoughts or opinions. My brother is in his mid twenties and about to start graduate school. He got engaged to his gf of 5 years in March. 

My whole family and SOs have been together for the last few months. My parents have had an issue with the fiancé since the start of the relationship but I was never really around and always wanted to give her slack. My bf and I have been here (at my parents) all year and not had many issues. My brother and his fiancé arrive and it’s all unbearable. It’s hard to put into words but it’s very challenging to talk to her, you feel like you’re walking on eggshells, she’s always hovering over you or forcing things on you (food, lotion, etc).  

It’s hard to explain because the gestures are nice on the surface but she doesn’t listen to other people. For instance she made lunch and asked if I wanted any. I said I wanted to finish what I was drinking and then I’d get some. A few mins later she comes with a plate of food and puts it next to me. Now it’s just sitting there for an hour until I’m ready to eat. Similarly, she asked if I wanted a lotion sample. I said no thank you I already have too many products she should keep it for herself. Every time I say anything that could remotely relate to needing lotion she offers again. It’s stuff that’s not even totally related. My eyelids are red from something I put on them then she asks over and over if I want the sample lotion. 

She also can’t just have silence. We’re watching a movie and she’s talking baby voices to my brother. She also can’t sit down if he’s not next to her. She’ll stand behind him on the sofa rather than sit in an empty chair. They also hold hands at dinner and are basically constantly PDA even in moments where it’s clear others aren’t totally comfortable with it. 

It’s all these little things combined that are just non stop. My bf feels the same way which is what makes me think it’s more than just us being petty or hypercritical. Every night I try to say I need to be nicer and not judgmental but I just can’t. 

The worst part is I’m not sure if he’s happy. I hope he is but the first night they were here I had a panic attack wondering if they were actually happy just based on their interactions. She bosses him around doesn’t take any responsibility for herself. She has food allergies and she doesn’t call restaurants or ask them herself but makes him do it. It’s like that with everything. Her low blood sugar is on him, etc. they also adopted a dog which she is afraid of (or something) and she’s afraid to walk it alone, doesn’t want my brother to be out of the house because of the dog etc. but HOW is he doing to go to school if she can’t take care of the dog on her own? 

She also insulted a few family members with passing comments, calling out specific relatives and saying “oh that’s the one we like” and things like that. Just little passing slights. 

Also, we just found out her parents gave him the ring a year in advance of the engagement. Is this weird? It’s a family ring so I understand getting it but for the parents to give it (unprovoked) a year in advance? 

Are we just the terrible in laws? 

Any thoughts or opinions would be great. Thinking of contacting his close friends to see if everyone feels this way or if we need to chill out.",28Dec2020,1

773,"So long story short there are 2 particular friends in my group who have become unhappy with me, and very much so. Instead of strong arming the situation I decided to go to therapy since one friend is my best friend, the other is his friend with benefits who doesn’t much like me at all. I go to 3 therapy sessions and spill all the beans to my therapist because if there is a problem I wanna fix it, this friendship is very important to me. Well my therapist basically told me that the only person I can change is myself I can’t change his friend with benefits so it would probably be best for me to cut her out of my life, she also suggests that I don’t need therapy and suggests that I only come back if I really want to since it’s pretty pricey. This makes me feel great, until I go to confront my best friend. He gets mad about me saying that I don’t like his friend with benefits attitude and that I suggested that I don’t want to be around her anymore. Fair I guess, maybe he loves her. He proceeds to tell me that I got a shit therapist because “real” therapists wouldn’t tell me to stay away from anybody regardless of how toxic I find them to be and that a real therapist would never tell a patient they don’t need therapy. Am I supposed to be in therapy for life? Did I actually get a bad therapist? 

On a side note I also went to one session of anger management to which the counselor for that also said she doesn’t understand why I was there. He also believes anger management is not something you can stop doing I think? I need help please",28Dec2020,1
775,"Picture this, I’m a college student who was not doing too hot in one particular during the fall semester and I almost withdrew from it. Then I found out that if the Professor allows, I can work on the course between semesters and maybe even into the spring. My dumbass didn’t realize how poor my work ethic was when it comes to reading four textbooks and writing a paper for each one during the regular semester let alone during break.

Here I am, I told my professor that I might have everything done by the 13th of December (i have no idea how I thought I would pull that off). I last emailed him maybe in late November and I’ve barely done most of the work. Where I need advice is how do I apologize to him for taking advantage of his kindness just to slack off and how do I also try and find a solution?

He’s a very nice man but these last few weeks have been the most stressful and emotionally taxing of my life. I’m thinking of seeing a counselor to alleviate myself a tad.

I have been to a psych ward for an attempted suicide. I barely lived at home the last 2 years of my life, doing everything I could to never be home. 

I was subjected to racist and homophobic remarks day in and day out, I was denied medical care after my sexual assault. I was denied therapy and medication I needed to function for nearly 5 years. For the longest time it seemed like I was screaming for help and no one heard me. I knew exactly what I wanted and no one would give it to me. So I took it. I helped myself I gave myself what I needed. I have never been so proud of myself.

it’s now 2 years on, and i can’t help but feel so much anger towards the world. for the last 2 years i haven’t made that many new friends because im still stuck on my old ones. i watch them hang out together all over social media and live great lives, and ive just gone M.I.A. no one bothered to reach out, no one bothered to catch up. i just feel like if i didn’t start the conversation, the conversation wouldn’t of happened. 
i know i shouldn’t expect shit from anyone, but damn, 5 years of my life wasted on people who gave THAT little of a fuck.

785,"As stated in the title, my best friend may have cancer. 

I say 'may', but really he does, I'm just struggling to come to terms with it. 

And before we start, he's my cat.   
I've just turned 18 years old, and my buddy here is 17, and his name is Meowmeow (I was too young to name him properly and I just called him Meowmeow). He's been through life with me, all the ups and downs, and he has has the biggest impact in my life. He is the reason I am alive today, and has helped me though the darkest moments of my mental health struggles, which to this day he knows exactly when to come cheer me up with a cuddle. Meow is also very close with my dad, who cares about the old catty very much.   


About 5-6 years ago, he suffered very severe Peritonitis (an infection of his abdominal cavity), and it was near fatal. He went though so much to survive, including a tube in his throat and surgery on his stomach. Meow pulled through and was a healthy lad for many years following it.   


He now has another issue; cancer. We noticed back in late September/October 2020 that he had lost an extreme amount of weight, was throwing up, and was so weak to the point he couldn't walk up the stairs of of the house, and it was decided he would stay with me in my room, which is next to the cats' room. We took him to the Vet who took a needle sample of his stomach lining and it came back inconclusive; they gave him some medication, one for nausea and one for his appetite, both worked and he gained an incredible amount of his weight back in less than 2 weeks. He's been doing fine so far. They did say it was most likely cancer, as the lining of his stomach and intestine has been thickening. (I think it was suggested intestinal Adenocarcinoma?) After he seemed somewhat normal again, I decided to take him back to get checked again, and they said there was definitely a thickening of the lining, but he was healthy overall, so we could leave it for a bit and see how it goes. 

Well now he's lost a bit of weight again, but not as much as before thankfully. He's been eating so much it's getting worrying. He even jumped on the kitchen counter to eat leftover Christmas turkey, and I caught him in my bin at 1am munching at the leftover meat on the chicken bones from my KFC. Needless to say, he's been eating loads, but he's still not gaining the weight, and he's been having diarrhoea, he's thrown up once on boxing day, and has started behaving rather differently.   


The way forward, there's 2/3 options. My dad and I are split on it. 

  
1) I would like to take him back to the vet and see what should be done, i.e. - steroid medications have been suggested, or possibly surgery to see what the best way forward is to help him and possibly cure him.

  
2) My dad would like to just leave it, and he doesn't want to put Meow through any more pain, which I completely understand. Dad just wants him to live out the end happily and comfortably.   


I don't know what to do, push forward with getting him medical care, and putting him through surgery, or leaving it be so he can live out the rest of his time in peace and comfort? Financially it isn't an issue, and if my dad doesn't want to take action because of funding, I am willing to pay for everything (if we decide to get him medical help).  

I'm struggling to write anymore, and it really hurts. I just feel so helpless and I don't want to say goodbye earlier than I have to, I just love him so much and I don't have lots of friends in reality, he's my closest and I just want to do what's best for him, but I don't know what that is. Of course I don't want to make him suffer, but I also don't want to let him go when there is something I could have done to prevent a premature goodbye. 

**TL;DR - My cat of 17 years has cancer. I don't know whether or not to put him through medical help or let him live out the end in the comfort of home.**

Hope this is the right place to post this if not please send me the right way.

TLDR: Met a girl on tinder, hit it off for little while, she wanted to be friends instead, how do I move on?

Throwaway account because i don't wanna disclose this much info my regular account.

This may bit of a rant, but some advice would be useful.

I (m25) matched with a girl(f23) on Tinder in the start of October, it started off pretty and i asked her for snapchat about 2 days on to writing via Tinder, and then there after about talking via snap for a couple of days, i asked if she wanted to go on a date for coffee and a movie. (its pretty open here where I live in Norway, even with Covid-19.) We really hit if off and planned a date to cook some dinner together and watch movies at her apartment the following sunday. That date went pretty good as well and we totally hit it off again. then the following friday we met at hers again along some of her classmates (we studie at the same uni, but on different bachelor programs) and drank some wine and again hit off. During the week we planned on meeting the next weekend on Saturday, where we went for a walk, made dinner, talked and kissed all evening. I left her apartment feeling pretty great, and had a great sunday. Then it started getting weird, she suddenly didn't respond as fast as usual, but i had it down to some exams we both had. So i texted her the following Friday, when i knew we where both done with the our exams that week. And asked if we were gonna meet that weekend (we had talked about it during our forth time together), to which she replies that she wanted some alone time during to the lack of sleep and such stuff during the week of the exam. I of course gave her some space during the weekend, but had a feeling that she maybe was getting tired of me or something like that. So sunday I texted her that I would like to see before going home for the holidays(we live rather far apart) she wrote back that she did not know how she felt, and i asked if was about me, to which she said yes. She said that she felt it was more of a friendly relationship, but that she liked hanging with me. And that we should just continue as friends. To which I said, that I had gotten feelings for her, and that I would not mind being friends since we had so much in common.

I know I kinda put my self in the friendzone, and I don't mind being here with her, but how do i go from having feelings for her and see her more as a friends? Also how much should I be snapping her, if at all?

I can't stop thinking about her even though we haven't really texted much since we agreed to just be friends. So yeah any advice would be greatly appreciated.",28Dec2020,1

Recently the girl I'm interested in called me to see if I wanted to hang out with her and her sister on Christmas eve. Of course I was ecstatic and said I should be able to go. However my mother reacted extremely negative when I brought it up. 

She thanked me for ruining her day, somewhat insulted the girl I'm interested in, etc. Her reasoning was because it was a ""dumb"" idea to drive an hour in the rain to the next town over on Christmas eve. I gave in and said fuck it and that I wouldn't go after arguing. After that she told me to go but knowing her I would be coming home into a worse situation. I ended up calling the girl and explained to her the situation (to an extent) and told her I would make it up to her, which she was ok with. Side note, our conversations since then have been positive so I dont think it ruined everything.

Moving out isn't an option yet so don't suggest it. Another thing is that she's helped me get through college a great deal and obviously I don't want to piss her off to the point that she never helps me again.

I’m scared of being poor forever, and if I’m poor then maybe I won’t realistically be able to afford a family or partner. I don’t enjoy my degree at all, even though it’s something I used to enjoy. All I feel is pressure. I’m waiting for a surgery that’s been delayed for 2 years on the NHS. I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried working on my confidence. I can’t say I’ve really enjoyed any of my life so far. There is very few “memories” and very few friends and no relationships. All of it has been hard work getting out of my current situation, but it’s just one more step after the other and it never really gets any better. I’m disappointed and pained that my childhood and teenage years and early adulthood have all been spent trying to get things that adults should have provided for me, and now I’m still behind everyone else. I just can’t see a way out. I don’t find any joy in being alive. There are hobbies I want to do but I’m already failing uni and I feel like I’m not allowed to do anything else apart from uni work.

800,"This is such an odd one, but I need advice. For context, I’m 30f.

I made my first true friend when I was 12. She was the first friend I had that liked me completely as I was and we had such genuine fun together. From ages 12-14, we spent all our time together and came up with cute little imaginary worlds where we’d be the main characters and go on all these adventures. I used to draw these worlds for us both, and she’d colour them. 

Once we hit 15 however, things started to go sour for us. She seemed to tire of my friendship as I was being badly bullied at school and so had a lot of time off (meaning I didn’t see her very frequently). I desperately tried to cling onto her, but she didn’t want to be friends any more.
(I’m simplifying this story a lot; there’s a lot of little fights and talks in between all that, but that’s the general gist of it)

It’s dumb but I still think of her a lot. It was over 13 years ago that we last spoke to each other, and that conversation was not a pleasant one. But sometimes I daydream that I might meet up with her again one day and we’d talk about the past.

So to bring it back to the artwork that she and I made together - I still have it, and keep it all safe in my house in a little folder. However I’m starting to feel like holding onto it is getting a bit unhealthy, like I’m clinging onto the past. I doubt I’ll ever see this girl again, so I feel like not getting rid of it all is just me hoping to see her again.

Should I throw it away? Or keep it? 

I know this isn’t very high stakes and seems pretty petty, but I feel like I need an outsiders opinion on it all.",28Dec2020,1
802,"Hi everyone,

Sincerely looking for helpful comments here.

Early into the pandemic I received a payout from my car insurance stating I had $2300 to my name to get my car fixed (had some minor damages). Investments were made through cryptocurrency, and I made a turnover of over 200k within a year. The way things are looking I'm expecting to receive a lot more within the next year. 

This experience has made me rethink of what it means to have wealth in 2020. The fragility of life and health, but also the gift of living at all. I'm single, healthy, able and supported by family and friends, not looking to settle. 

So humbly but selfishly I ask the communities to help me make good-minded, thoughtful approaches towards my future (and the surrounding ones).

He told me that I was ""too young to be gay"" (I'm pansexual not gay) and that I'm getting ""manipulated by social media"" because I came out. They act like that a lot that I actually made a catchphrase when they do that.

Anyways, he told me to stop watching ""gay videos"" and if I find anyone ""manipulating me to be gay"" to tell him.

815,"I’m absolutely terrified because due to some special personal circumstances, I pretty much guarantee I’ll have to work remotely (from home with the OCCASIONAL local travel, like no more than an hour drive for emergencies) and I also drama of freelancing. It’s the only job path MEANT for me. I know myself and my mental health and I WONT be happy unless I freelance.


I have made some money on commissions. I have worked with both little individual clients and CEO’s of large businesses. My resume is amazing. I just CANT seem to get to the point where I have a steady income, which for a freelancer means ALWAYS having a client at all times, someone who wants art made, designs done, or writing for a project done. I make decent money sporadically, but the commission market is SO competitive.

The problem is with individuals who want to commission for art and writing, there’s:
1. Less money involved because it’s usually like a start up business or middle class person who buys art for a present or their own decorating
2. Literally hundreds will reply to their request and it’s impossible to get chosen as the artist or writer they choose

The problem with being hired to free lance for large companies is:
1. They want like ten years experience and I’m literally like 21 dude this isn’t fair
2. They don’t just want art or writing like individual clients mentioned above. They want you to be able to use excel, photoshop, make and take calls, handle finances for their sales, use specific ink and printers, use video software like WHY does no one want just art and writing and YOU GUYS handle sales.


It’s frustrating because I see people living my dream online making enough through selling their art to support them and quit their day job. But then they have 100k followers on every social media or more. When I post my art it gets like 20 views and no followers.


I have a writing blog and I get commissions through there but it’s like an odd 30 bucks every few weeks MAYBE if that.

What is the best way to show that we have always thought about him?

817,"Okay so, some context, i am a 21yr old male (also for later context my sister 26) and have had zero contact with L (i refuse to refer to her as any sort of mother) for nearly two years now, and about a year ago i moved into a new house. 

Also, L was extremely mentally abusive and manipulative to me between the ages of 5 and 14 (from when my parents divorced and she moved 250 miles away and when i eventually moved back with my dad), for example letting me pick out and keep a kitten only to tell 6 year old me that she'd have to kill him if i moved to my dads with my sister(11) but in such a way to make my dad the bad guy that now looking back on is obvious but not to a 6 year old. The abuse lead to me developing severe depression and literally crippling anxiety, the latter of which has caused me to lose every job ive ever had and is why i am legally classed as disabled. 

Even after moving in with my dad (who until recently didnt know the extent of the abuse to no fault of his own) i kept visiting her for the holidays mostly to keep my grandparents happy.

Now the thing is i adore my grandparents, they are genuinely the stereotypical extremely loving, devoutly Methodist couple, whos parenting clearly wasnt the issue as their eldest turned out fine and they have never been anything but kind to literally anyone i have seen them interact with. 
But i know they wont understand and would be massively hurt by me telling them how i want absolutely nothing to do with their manipulative abusive daughter whom they dont see as such, partly due to her manipulationof them (they are in their late 80s and have both lost a bit of a step mentally.

Now the thing is L has manipulated them multiple times in the past into thinking my sister hates them (she broke contact with L like 7 or 8 years ago) and my sister has to constantly remind them otherwise and they still get anxious when they havent heard from her in more than a week (bearing in mind she lives in Australia, us in England and she works 2 jobs). L has also started doing this with me to them. I must also say that i dont for a second doubt L loves us, its just that her idea of love is extremely possessive, twisted and cruel, which makes it even harder to explain to my grandparents.

Also i feel the details of my zero contact with her are important, i was still semi in contact with her until i was 18 (again to keep my grandparents happy in their last few years) but i ended up losing a job (repeated anxiety attacks) i had in london that i was also living in, this lead to a brief homless stint / couch crashing. Now thing is my dad lives quite far north and she lived just north of london and i cant remember the exact circumstances but i needed a place i could reliably stay in for 2 nights till i could get the train up, so i resolved to stay with her thinking i could manage two nights, but i had a massive anxiety attack the first night and ended up stabbing myself in the arm and needing stitches, out of desperation i ended up staying the rest of the time at my childhood bestfriends parents. But that wasnt before i laid everything out with her and told her exactly what i thought of her and that i wanted absolutely nothing to do with her. 

About 5 months later (feb2019) my grandad had a massive stroke and we all thought he was going to die (tough old fucker made a nearly full recovery now though thankfully) but i wasnt told until two weeks after as L had told my grandmother that she had told me and that i didnt want to come (absolute bullshit) i found out when i rang my gran one day and she told me, i went straight down to help out (btw dont wsnt to make this post any longer than it already is but i was helping my gran with everything, transport, washing, cleaning, appointments etc while L who had a car wouldnt drive her to the hospital until i came and did absolutely zero work around the house) and when it was just me and L i reaffirmed i was there for my gran and not her and that if need be id talk to her infront of my gran but otherwise i want absolutely nothing to do with her, she agreed, but then persisted to take every opportunity to talk at me infront of my gran including talking over my (supposedly) dying grandads body about absolutely nothing but knowing if i didnt respond itd hurt my grandma. This eventually culminated into an argument while my gran was at the hospital (she liked to have an hour with my grandad before anyone else arrived, that again i arranged her transport for) and L storming out for a drive and when she returned she said that i needed to leave  as my gran had told her i was being a burden on her (again absolute bullshit especially considering i was the only one helping) and then me having to pack my shit and leave before i hit her, im not a violent man but thats the closest ive ever been to hitting anyone like that, and ever since i have had no contact with her.

That was until recently. Mine and my sisters birthdays are a week apart and very close to christmas and my grandparents usually like to give us a bit of money, in which they usually give me a cheque that i will cash and share between me and my sister, and with lockdown i said they could mail me the cheque and i could still get my sisters money to her, for which they needed my address, which i gave but i should have known L would get her grubby claws on it. So, i ended up getting a card from L, now while i know how that that in itself isnt bad i hope by know tou see why this is extremely fucking disturbing. And to reiterate L lives 250 miles away (as far as i know) and absolutely no one who knows me knows her besides my dad and her parents, they are the only people she would have gotten it off. 

Now L has a history of this, she  managed to get my sisters first Australian address off of them and somehow managed to find out my sisters (now fiancee's) birthday and send him a card without ever having met him or anyone to do with him (my grandparents didnt know him either) and L doesnt have my sister on any social media (though clearly must have a catfish account) and ever since my sister has given my grandparents her work addresses just in case (and good thing too as she got a card from L too this year after she had me give our grandparents her new work address).

Now to the actual advise part after all  that context (sorry) my sister has told them once or twice not to give L her address but she has always gotten it, whether they willingly gave it to her or she went through my grans address book idk. But i have no idea how to approach this topic or if i even should since L already has it but a fully grown man whos a full foot taller than a 50 something year old woman shouldnt feel this fucking scared just by seeing her hand writing arrive through his front door. I dont want to hurt them especially since it might be pointless anyway but im genuinely so stuck as for what to do",28Dec2020,1

822,"Everyday is the exact same. I wake up at 2PM, eat, play games with friends online, do some sport, sleep and repeat. I am tired because for months my life has been the same every single day.

I really wanna change this situation but I cant find a way. Everyday is the exact same as the previous one and its extremely boring.

Im studying a marketing degree in college but right now I only have 2 subjects because I did another degree and because of that most of the first year's subjects are automatically gone for me.

That leaves me with a lot of free time every day. A lot of hours of the day that I waste browsing social media, watching netflix and youtube, playing videogames... nothing good for me.

I do have a lot of projects in mind but I cant find the motivation for starting them anywhere. And this is something that I noticed this year.

Everything that used to make me happy is now meaningless for me. I used to enjoy a lot of things that now dont cause the smallest hint of happiness in me.

I see everybody my age with their own projects, progressing in their lives and doing things that they like and makes them happy and I see what my situation is right now and I feel sad.

I feel like Im just sitting, watching how my life passes without the ability to do anything for changing it.

As I said above, I have a lot of projects in mind that I would like to start but I always find a problem with them that holds me back. The main problem is risking money that I cant afford to lose.

I noticed this feeling of emptiness, apathy and fear this year, right after the covid lockdown started in my country. A year ago I used to go to college from monday to friday, and I spent weekends working at a restaurant. I was occupied every single day of the week and the truth is that I was very happy with my life back then, I had no complaints.

Suddenly we got into the lockdown and from night to day I had absolutely nothing to do in my life. And its been like that since March.

Lost my job and because of having only 2 subjects, I only have 6 hours of online class a week.

I dont know what to do with my life, I cant find anything that fulfills me. I wanna find something that I like doing and that its useful at the same time. I dont wanna play videogames and let my life go to waste.

My sleep schedule is fucked up and I tried a lot of times to fix it but I cant. I go to sleep at 4-5 AM and wake up at 1-2 PM. I really tried to fix this but waking up sooner would result in the exact same things I do everyday but early in the morning.

I feel like anything I do is useless and a waste of time. I feel Im wasting my life and it scares me a lot not being able to achieve my goals and dreams.

I applied for a lot of jobs but no one is hiring right now, not even for non marketing degree jobs like cashier at a supermarket.

I also have a strong feeling of lack of affection and social life. I do have 2 groups of friends but I dont see them more than twice a month and I have nobody to interact with other than my family.

I love my family and Im grateful for them being healthy, and I know how lucky I am for having both my parents and my sister with me. I'd do anything for them and it's the only part of my life I'm happy with right now.

5 years ago I fell in love with a girl that rejected me. That hurt, of course, but now I feel better.

When I say I fell in love with her I really mean LOVE. Now I think in what I felt for her and I cant think of someone loving me as much as I loved her, because what I felt for her back in the day was such a strong feeling that I cant even imagine someone will ever feel something even close to that for me, I cant find a reason for loving me that much.

I'm not the kind of person who desperately looks for romantic love anywhere, I think its better to let it happen.

I've never experienced in my 20 years of life what romantic love is. I mean reciprocal romantic love. I have never had a girlfriend, I havent even kissed a woman yet.

I have been overweight 19 out of my 20 years of life. I had a very low self steem and confidence issues but last year I lost a lot of weight and now I feel a lot better and do exercise everyday.

Last year, at this time everything was beautiful. I had a huge confidence boost because of my weight loss and everybody telling me how good I looked, I had a job that I liked, I was addicted to doing sport, I was learning something I liked and enjoyed at college, I saw my friends several times a week... I felt like I was progressing in my life and like everything was good.

Right now I have no job, Im studying something that I dont dislike but I dont like either, I dont like doing sport anymore, I have almost no social interactions and I spend the day at home doing nothing.

Life has no meaning for me at this moment and I dont know what to do for fixing it at this moment. I feel Im stuck in a void, in where everyday will be the same until its too late to do anything to change it.

I have considered going to a psychologist but I cant afford it.

I (23 F) am going through it with another (23 M) i  should’ve dropped officially a long time ago. But i keep going back. Today, i finally found the strength to reach out for help from this community because trying to do it on my own has been driving me mad. 

We went to high school together, never talked but knew of each other. my senior year in college, we matched on tinder (2019) and have been texting on and off ever since. This relationship has consisted of mostly texting... i’ve talked to him on the phone twice and hung out with him 3-4 times at his place. we’ve kissed and cuddled and watched movies, talk about moves we’re making in life, current events all that casual stuff in person. but in our previous texts, he mentions how attracted he is to me, how i’m the type of woman he needs in his life and so forth. I even started dating someone briefly who i thought i had way more attention and love to give, more than this tinder guy - but the tinder guy insisted we keep in touch because he felt strongly for me and was okay with being on the side until the time was right or until i was single. When me and tinder guy first met, he was dating a girl a had  class with he but told me he didn’t want anything serious with her and they stopped talking about a month later. Now i know this is where it gets messy and i feel absolutely shameful for even keeping him around when i was with someone. I’m not with this person anymore.

 i don’t why i kept chasing tinder guy for soo long. we made plans to go on dates, never happened. i tried to get in the rhythm of talking on the phone instead of texting, but no cooperation. I start pulling away and stopped responding to his texts and then he blows up my phone about how he doesn’t want to let me go. His birthday rolls around in October and he texts me a week in advance to say he had no plans but he wants to take me out to dinner. In this moment i felt surprised that he wants to hang out in a different setting other than his crib. I was hoping to go into it open minded and see if we are just better off friends or if he’s ready to fix our communication skills. But, his birthday comes and he hasn’t texted me a thing all day. I texted him at 7 PM to see what was up and he responds 3 hrs later saying he won’t have his car available tonight... I was really disappointed that he didn’t even ask if we could use my car instead (which we always use since he just got a car for his bday) or just chill inside bc ya know covid... since the point was just to see each other anyway since it has been months since i last saw him. I ghosted him for a month because i was just disappointed. 

He apologized in November and insisted we hang out more because he wants to see me. Again, weeks go by and we still haven’t seen each other. I even initiated seeing him multiple times, gave him my schedule when he asked and nothing happened. My frustration starts to build up and i start ignoring him again. But this time, he doesn’t come running back. I feel the distance and did what pick me’s do. I started to miss him and want to be closer to him even more despite this mistreatment. desperate energy ik. ik i need some work and improvement in this area. 

I texted him 2 weeks ago saying i missed him and really wanted to see him and show him. he responded very quickly to this and i took my dumb ass over there to fuck him for the first time. we cuddled after and caught up on life and he even asked me “what made you come over here? how much do you think about me? . I felt so stuck for words but i spoke from my heart and told him i really liked him and i want to get to know him more, beyond texting. I told him we’ve been up and down for a while but there’s just something keeping me here. he seemed really happy with my response and pulled me closer into him. he said he wanted to see me the next day, then tomorrow comes and once again he’s “unavailable”. he didn’t even try to propose a new date to meet up so i let it go. Idk what got into me that might but i felt good about taking control of the situation then but now i ultimately feel shitty for even opening up to him like that. He hasn’t acknowledged that night at all, has been texting me less and less. basically acting like it never happened. 

I told him 2 weeks later that this isn’t working for me and I don’t like this texting relationship. he responds with “what did i do wrong?”... idk know how he doesn’t know what bothers me at this point bc i’m VERY VOCAL. I cried for about a week straight, started reading the FDS handbook and other supportive posts about how to just move on and block guys like this... but i also feel like i’m overlooking some of my own flaws and mistakes in this situation. Maybe he doesn’t want me bc i was in a relationship when he met me but so was he? Maybe he was just into how i looked and not into who i am. I beat myself up so much yesterday about it that i finally reached out yesterday to him to ask for the truth. I just wanted to know what he wanted or if i should even keep letting this go on. He was so into me and i grew to like him based on the actual in-person time we spent together, even tho it was rare. 

I feel so dumb and clouded... i can’t even process what our lost convo even means. Does he want me to just go?? How do you fuck with someone hard but you don’t even want to see them or you let their texts sit for hours when they’re telling you they’re bothered by something involving you? Please help. I know i’m young &amp; dumb but i’m so ready to be dismissive to this type of behavior instead of trying to be understanding and stick around for the better. I am cringing and sobbing all at once. Please help.

825,"About a year ago my dad discovered he had an uncle, after his dad passed away. Apparently the uncle and his family are well off. Since discovering our existence, my uncle has sent use two family $1000 checks, one out of the kindness of his heart and the other for Christmas gifts. Instead of using it to pay debt or even put someone into college savings. They use it to take a trip to Vegas, or to make my dad’s man cave more extravagant. I asked them if they already spent the check we got yesterday, and they said yes. I feel entitled saying this, but I feel like I have a small portion of that money.

826,"I have mental issues. This means that when I have extended amounts of free time I tend to become quite detached from the outside world, playing games etc. (This is what I mean about travelling to another world - detachment is the problem I'm trying to solve)

Especially since it gets dark so early now, it's hard to tell the time and day so things sort of blur together. Obviously this isnt healthy so I need some help finding something to kill some time while also not detaching me even further, so no reading books or video games. 

Some things that are probably important - I'm currently at school (16 y/o) but because of christmas we have a short break, so whatever it is that you come up with could just be a short term solution. It should also keep in mind covid restrictions, and it's probably important to note that while I'm not completely adverse to socialising, I'd still rather not do it with strangers on the internet without the guarantee they wouldn't just disappear. 

I'd also be happy to hear ideas for the future, when things return to normal since I'll probably still have the same problem until I'm an adult.

Anyways I think that should be everything you need to know about me, but if there's anything else I'm happy to answer further questions in the comments.

Thank you",28Dec2020,1

829,"I'm in my early 20's, and I'm female. I have worked on my mental health a lot in recent years, and am finally putting myself out there in a meaningful way. Because of very intense struggles with mental illness, I didn't date much when I was much younger but I am finally in a secure enough state where I can put myself out there. 

But I'm really feeling done. Every single person I meet is a dead end. I'll talk to people for 6 months and they'll ghost me. I'll talk to people every day and want to meet (in person [socially distanced and with masks of course!] or over video chat), and they'll tell me they don't want to after leading me to believe otherwise for a long time. I'll meet someone, feel like I have a connection and that goes nowhere. Or every other person just wants to fuck me during a global pandemic. I'm getting very tired.

I'm not sure what to do. This isn't me not being comfortable with myself - I am. But I've decided connection (and not even nessacarily a relationship! But meaningful connection) is what I want and it feels like nothing I do is going to enable me to find it. I'm about to give up, because the frustration isn't worth it. It'd be one thing if people were upfront - because then I could make my choices - but nobody really seems to be and I feel led on over and over. 

It makes me feel like I'm the issue. Which, hell, I may be. But I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. And I can't keep facing frustration after frustration... it isn't sustainable for anyone. What do I do?",28Dec2020,1

831," Hello, I've come to an interesting point in my life. I have a small business that is either on the cusp of achieving our projections or taking time out of my life better spent focusing on a career change. I started this business with an overseas partner in a market that is now affected by the pandemic. The pandemic has increased the length of time required to make projected revenues, which would justify the amount of time I am putting in.

**Background**:

1. As as the pandemic started affecting our overseas operations (delaying, stopping, etc., especially payments and account conversion), I began exploring alternate interests that could eventually be a stable professional career path. Initially, I had thought I would get the sales cycle done by Dec 2020 and then start my transition into a tech career through an immersive program in January and I would keep the venture as a side gig as my partner is more than capable of operations and my further involvement wouldn't require much time (5 hours/month).
2. However, due to the pandemic, that cycle has been delayed to January - May of the new year as the overseas market has been alternating shutdown periods, hindering my partner's ability to implement our processes without a negative effect on our revenues. Now, due to the pandemic, we will know about our sales by March, not in December as previously planned.

**Considerations**:

1. The program I was considering starts in January and ends in April. It has a fixed schedule and no flexibility. We have been at this startup for a year and secured our initial performance-based contracts a couple months ago. Due to the pandemic, our sales cycle is now January to March. 
2. Long term, I see myself in a stable career but I don't want to throw something away that has the potential to be a passive income stream for a long time. I ran the numbers and without additional clients we can increase our delivery and make the same revenues in the next year, assuming the vaccine rolls out by Q4 this year, eliminating the need for me to actively develop business the next year. My business partner is able and willing to execute on operations even if I have FT employment stateside.

**My questions**:

1. Should I just start the program in January and limit my further involvement till I see favorable results or market conditions or both?
2. Should I delay the program till March or June, and give my best effort till March as this is the time for the business to perform?

**TL;DR**: Pandemic delaying startup results and revenues. Opportunity cost adding up. Performance window Feb/March but no guarantees conditions will change. Career change now, or in 4 months?",28Dec2020,1
832,"Everyday I wake up. I get dressed, I gather my child and I watch him get into things for eight hours, then my SO comes home. They ask me what's for dinner, we discuss it and then I continue watching my child for another three hours, then make dinner, then put my child to bed and then I just... Sit there. My SO plays on their phone or the console and I play on my phone and that's that. They go to bed and I follow a little after and then repeat. That is my life 24/7 and had been for two years.

I used to have dreams. I was joining the military and was going to travel and paint the world on canvases as I did so. I was going to go to so many places and experience the world. And right before I shipped to basic... I got sick.

I hadn't done anything my entire life. I choked all through school and had no plans. But then my art teacher found my sketch book I had lost and in the summer, she took me to an art exhibit. I fell in love. I wanted to be those paintings. I wanted that life. I wanted to experience the articulation. I wanted my hands to speak when my mouth couldn't.

It was my senior year so it was too late to turn around my gpa, so I signed up for the military. I was going to be in unit supply. Something safe and secure that I could also travel with. And then I got sick. My body started failing. And as I fell through the floor, I felt everything black. The door shut and it was over. I would never get into a college with a gpa barely above 2.0. I would never get a decent enough job to travel. Everything slipped from me. I got sick.

A year later, I found my SO. They told me we'd travel together cause they want to as well. They're a little older than me and they have always had their stuff together. Intelligent, good job, stable footing. I was finally seeing the light of life again. And before we got to our full planned saved amount to travel to Japan... I got sick again. I couldn't travel...

They decided to buy me paints and canvases to help me cope. For a few months it worked. I started a business and I was thriving. And then I got pregnant and had to stop painting. It's been two years and my paints still collect dust because I don't have the time. And looking at it all... I haven't done anything.

My dreams, my hobby, my heart, my ambitions... I'll never do it. I'll never experience... Cause I keep getting sick... My life has no meaning or purpose... Because I'm sick. I want to travel just once. Just one time. I don't even care if just over the border that I go... I just want to go somewhere.... Just once and I'll die happy. But I can't. Because I'm sick...

I was given a very unique gift of art. If only you could see how happy I am when I'm painting and in my zone. Music on, windows open, paints out and mixed and give me a whole day and I can never be sad in those moments... But I'll not have one for a long time. I've done nothing with my life. I went from the top to the bottom.... Why? Because I'm sick.....",28Dec2020,1
833,"Hi my name is John, I am 21 years old and. I just want some advice and want people to answer my questions for me. First of all, I have had only 1 relationship in my life. When I was 15 - 17. She broke up naturally and went our own way. And I had sex with another women. I only slept with two people and dated only one girl. 

Is this a turn off and I am scared. I was about to go approach people outside and have active dating life but Now I can’t. I am scared as I am not good in bed and I can’t undo a bra lmao. 

Would this be a turn off. I am average looking best. Also.",28Dec2020,1
834,"I want to start this off by saying I have never and would not smoke inside of the house, and my roommates have never had an issue with this and are on my side with the issue.

So I’m a smoker, and my house has a front porch which I have always smoked on. Before I moved here, the two previous roommates also smoked and did it on the porch, and my last roommate who recently left ALSO smoked and did it on the porch as well.

So on Christmas Day (merry Christmas) I’m sitting on the porch having a cigarette and the landlord comes by (don’t know why she did) and she says hi and then notices me smoking and says the following:
“You are NOT smoking a cigarette”
I look down and back up and say “I am”
And she just says “NO”
And I say “no?” 
And she goes “no”
One of the other people who lives in the house chimes in and says “not even on the porch” and the landlord says “go across the street if you have to do that”
And I kinda vaguely say “I’m sorry” and then she goes off being rude as hell saying “don’t you know how fucking disgusting you are for doing that? Why would you EVER even smoke? That’s so gross. You’re gonna look horrible when you’re fifty” and then she left shortly after. I feel like she had no reason to be that rude, and I also feel like it’s not her business whether or not I smoke? Like, sorry I’m poor. 

So after she leaves I just feel weird and sort of unwelcome in my own space and I check the lease and the only thing it says is “no smoking in clearly designated non smoking areas” and I don’t really see how the porch would be a clearly designated non-smoking area, and also I don’t see why it matters at all as long as I’m outside, so I really feel like it was uncalled for of her to chew me out like that.

So now a few days later I’m still unsure what to do. I don’t really want to talk to her about it and have her go on some tirade and double down, but I also feel like, especially while it’s the dead of winter during a pandemic, I do not want to go across the street to have a smoke in the pouring rain, that seems completely unreasonable to me. Should I talk to her, should I just ignore your request, or should I just comply and deal with the inconvenience?",28Dec2020,1
835,"When I (21F) was growing up, I often hang out with my cousins (13F ""J"" and 10M ""E"") and I was able to relate and have fun with them! They are very well behaved and I absolutely love their parents because they absolutely chill and relaxed about everything! Since they were little, we've always had this strong bond that pretty much unbreakable and I spend way more time with them than with anyone else. On the other hand, my sister (18F ""G"") will always talk to their mum (42F ""L"") since everyone else in the family speaks Chinese, and since L cannot speak Chinese, G talks with her to make sure she's not bored.

However, when our new cousin (now 6F ""Y"") was around us, we all had problems with her. She would literally scream in our ears to get our attention, gets upset if she loses a game/we don't give her attention, and etc. We believe this has been due to the fact that my Aunty (40F at the time ""W"") and Uncle (45M at the time ""R"") had trouble conceiving and were desperate for a child, so now that they have our little cousin, they're giving her all their attention to make sure she survives(?)

*FOR CONTEXT: This has been going on for years, so we've been irritated by her for years. The reason why I do not exclude her from hanging out with me, J and E in family gatherings is because my mum lectures me for excluding her. She does this mainly because when I was young, my mum's family friends' older children also excluded me everytime I wanted to hang out with them, and I ended up despising their children. So, my mum doesn't want Y to despise me, J and E if we kept excluding her when she's young. And my mum made me promise her that if I hang out with J and E, I must also invite and play with Y.*

J, E and I play (often violent) video games together, talk about internet memes, use swear words, teach each other new things that we've learnt and etc. However, Y thinks that J and E are better to hang with since they're more closer to her age, and she doesn't exactly want to talk to the adults. However, when Y is with us, we cannot play our video games, talk about the internet, and use swear words because if Y learns bad words or about what 'bad' things the internet can offer from me, J and E, her parents (W and R) will berate us (particularly me) for 'dirtying' her mind. If we talk or do things that she doesn't like (such as video games) or not pay attention to her, she starts screaming, crying or doing whatever she can to get our attention and to do what she wants. J, E and I are getting annoyed by Y, and we don't know how much longer we can stand it before we might end up snapping.

A week ago, I had 3 days off work, so I spent all three days hanging out with J and E (without inviting Y). We went out shopping, trying new foods, playing arcade games, watching movies, etc. They were very happy and we all had a great time.

Yesterday, my mum took me to Y's house. Then my mum and W arranged a last minute sleepover and made me invite Y to hang out with me, J and E today, so Y ended up staying at my house last night AND hanging out with us three AND arrange a last minute extended family dinner. Like always, me, J and E all got irritated with her hanging out with us since she would scream, cry and etc. if we didn't do what she wanted. Then at the family gathering, me, J and E also observed that W and R were also getting annoyed with Y too, so that would explain why they arranged the last minute sleepover and wanted me to basically babysit Y for 2 days.

Since I will have to hang out with Y everytime I hang out with J and E, I'm not sure what I, J and E can do to avoid losing our cool against Y or how I should really be approaching this whole situation.

TL;DR my mum gave me an ultimatum where I must include my annoying cousin (6F) everytime I choose to hang out with my two favourite cousins (13F and 10M) or I must talk to the adults. My favourite cousins and I are really losing our cool everytime the little cousin wants to hang out with us and we need to find a solution to our problem before we lose our cool.",28Dec2020,1

837,"This semester I took anatomy to online with a lockdownbrowser through my community college on one quiz back in September my anatomy teacher claims that she heard notes flipping in the background and me looking left to right so she gave me a zero for the quiz and told me I needed to start providing clear extensive environment checks she had a zoom meeting with me and told me that if it would happen again I would be indicted on an academic integrity report. She even told me in the zoom that even though it’s not basis for her to claim that I was cheating that because she heard notes flipping in the background that she was giving me a zero. After that I started to mute the audio on my computer  because I was paranoid that she indict me on the same thing again. For exam one I got a 100 and she sent me an email questioning respondus browser when I got up to get a pen and I said that I got the pen to write on the blank sheet of paper that we r allowed  that I SHOWED on the camera and she left me alone. I just finished the final exam 5 days ago and she sent me an email saying she needed to review respondus browser with me. I never emailed back because grades were due soon and I thought her claims were just gonna be ridiculous. I wake up this morning to zero for the exam which I originally got a 97 on and my class grade dropped from a 96 to 79.52.... I emailed her and this is what she responded even though I never moved from my bed on exam three and there was no notes around me because I did an extensive environment check of the floor and the bed to prove that there was nothing by me before starting the exam I requested a copy of the lockdownbrowser recording but she never responded I now have to file an appeal and I don’t know what to do I feel really defeated somebody please give me advice



Hi Natalie,
I had sent you an email on Saturday so that we could discuss this matter before I changed your grade.
I did not get any response until I changed your grade. Your grade was changed because of an Academic Integrity Violation. Reminders of the Respondus Monitoring expectations have been posted multiple times this semester and were included in the Exam #3 Announcement:
     -You may not use any notes or other materials during the exam (make sure all materials are away  
before you begin the exam)    
During the exam you walked across the room and were flipping through papers and reading what was written on them which is a violation of the testing rules and an Academic Integrity Violation.  I will be filing an Academic Integrity Violation Report,  you will then have an opportunity to challenge the Violation and your final grade.",28Dec2020,1

839,"Important notes: this is aunts 3rd marriage (1st was to an abuser when she was 18yo who’s now in prison so we don’t really count him). The only positive thing from the first marriage is my cousin was born. 2nd marriage was okay, married for 20 years but she was never actually happy. Pretty much a loveless marriage with little respect of her feelings. So all that I think plays into her mental state and understanding of marriages. As in, she’s in her 50s and never had a happy marriage. Also my cousin is a schizophrenic and is 30yo, she lives on her own and has good days and really bad days. On and off medication, currently on and doing as well as she can be. Yes, her and my aunt have both been in therapy but it’s hard to get my cousin to continue going for long periods of time. All this info plays into the story. 

New marriage is a guy who left his wife and 2 kids for her about 4 years ago. She says he’s her “soulmate” and she’s happy to be with someone who “truly loves her.” Him and my cousin got along at first but there was a lot of rift in the past 2 years and they are no longer on speaking terms. At one point my cousin broke into and damaged their home while they were out of town. Yes it’s horrible, but she was having a psychotic episode and didn’t truly understand what she was doing. She spent the night in jail and they didn’t press charges. 

Moreover this guy is just weird. He seems to have no understanding of mental illness. He texted my cousin after Christmas calling her a “parasite” and that “no one talked about her on Christmas and it was lovely.” We had Christmas with my cousin earlier in the week, he was obviously not invited. He apologized for this and says that he thought she still had his number blocked and he was just venting some frustration. I believe he thought she had his number blocked as she had for a while. I’m not sure why she unblocked him but it makes me wonder how many texts he’s sent like this over the past few years. My cousin sent a screenshot to the family and he was exposed. Obviously my aunt is furious and confronted him. He apologized to the family but my cousin told him to basically kick rocks and I agree. I don’t like him but my aunt is so starry eyed I’m sure she won’t leave him or do anything about this outside of being furious about it. My cousin and aunt also have a strenuous relationship due to her mental illness and the impact that’s had over the past 7 years. It’s hard for everyone. 

I didn’t like him before this. I think anyone willing to cheat on their spouse (especially when they have kids) is a scumbag. But he’s made my aunt happy for the past 3 years of their marriage and I love my aunt so I was willing to look past his faults. That was, until this happened. Now I truly want nothing to do with him but I’m not sure how to navigate this. Before the text it was like my aunt was trying to force it down everyone’s throats (social media included) how good of a man he is and it was nauseating. Luckily I don’t have to see him anytime soon but when I see him next I don’t know what to do. I’d like to tell him to fuck off and that he’s a scummy person who deserves to live miserably alone but that would kill my aunt. I’ve been told by my mom that my opinion “means the world to my aunt.” I love my aunt and she has had a hard life filled with emotional and possibly physical abuse although neither my aunt or mom would ever tell me this. I also don’t want to lie and pretend to be his friend and pretend to be okay with his apology and what he said to my cousin. I’m just not sure what to do. I truly believe that you can judge a person by the things they do when they think no one is watching and he’s failed miserably on all fronts.",28Dec2020,1
840,"Im beginning to get very worried about the behaviour of a family member of mine who lives in the same neighbourhood and I see at least once a week. 

She is in her 60s and recently retired. She has always lived alone and never in her life has she had a partner or even dated anyone that we or any of the family knew about, even including her teens and 20s, we are certain she is a virgin and i think her ocd is to play for that. She has no friends either and is very antisocial.

She has terrible OCD and since retiring this has gotten so much worse. Her anxiety and ocd stops her from doing pretty much everything, and this has been made much worse with covid. She is so stubborn so talking to her about it is near impossible. All she does now is come to my house once or twice a week and sees or does literally nothing else. She won't drive anywhere and when she goes to the food shop for absolute essentials she walks 50 minutes and carries a hairspray bottle in her pocket for safety. 

Since retiring she has also lost a significant amount of wait and looks dangerously thin.

First he was really nice but then he would start texting me over and over and over again and when i would be busy he would keep textinng me asking why i wasnt replying,
Soon after probably 4 weeks into knowing him he told me he fell in love with me and i was his soulmate i rejected him knowing i didnt feel the same way back asking him that we could still be friends, it was back to normal for abit him still being friendly and overall his usual over bearing self.... but he asked me weird and uncomfortable questions “do u have childhood trauma” and just weird things like that and obviously i wasnt gonna tell him anything like that so I ignored it only for him again to tell me hes in love with me “im his future” and “we were ment for eachother”  but IN PERSON TO MY FACE so once again i rejected him over text cuz i couldnt tell him i didnt love him to his face..... 
later he tells me he feels uncomfortable around me and doesnt want to talk to me (probably hurt his ego) ive known him only 4 months now and hes getting worse.... stuff like “what are u insecure about” “when do u get ur period” and the latest one “You a virgin” which was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable I genuinely couldnt believe he would ask it unprovoked and then when I answered he said .                                         

“I'll tell u anyway, I don't feel like I could ever date someone who's not a virgin, I feel like it's part of love that shows ur completely comfortable being with them n like u love them more than anything, n soo like dating somebody who's not a virgin, idk I feel like sex is the difference between a relationship that'll last forever n one which won't”

So yeah.... now hes being really weird and saying “the you i know is a virgin and not that who u were before” his ego is huge to think that he changed me? Hes told a friend of mine before that he’s convinced that if i dont date him im gonna turn to drugs and alcohol (keep in mind i have never drank alcohol or done drugs) at this point im just totally tired of it and i dont know what to do know i cant be friends with someone like that he makes me uncomfortable... there’s plenty more to this but i think what ive already wrote gives you the gist.

850,"LONG POST AHEAD. This has been going on for YEARS at this point. I don't really know how to qualify that. I believe my mother has some kind of paranoia or schizophrenia. Here is a list of all the weirdest and absurd things I heard her say and do:

&amp;#x200B;

\- She apparently once found a red wool thread lying around and took it some supposed evidence of people spying or listening to us.

\- She literally thinks that one of our neighbor, whose name and identity she ignores because in 20 years she never spoke to him, is a spy. Once that neighbor and my mother and me were on the same bus and I began talking about family matters but my mother signaled me to stop talking because ""she could see based on his behaviour/gestures that he was listening to us"" \[note: I was talking  in Russian and I highly doubt that this neighbor could understand anything\].

\- Once some of our other neighbors were fixing a fence which is located between my house's garden and theirs. My mother thought they were installing a camera to spy on her. 

\-The abovementioned neighbors have a tree in their garden on which they installed a small bird house. That small bird house faces our garden somewhat. Well guess what....my mother thinks there is a camera in it ! Like how absurd is that ? When I told her there was nothing inside that bird house she told me she was ""feeling"" she was being spied on to which I replied that her claims were all nonsense. She also claims that these said neighbors are spies ! 

\- A light pole faces the back of our house (the opposite end of the light pole that is). My mother also claimed there was a camera in it ! I told her that it didn't make any sense and had there been a camera in that light pole then the angle of the camera was pretty bad as it wouldn't allow to film much of anything. She still persisted in her nonsense.  

\- My mother is technologically illiterate. That doesn't stop her from claiming that she is being spied on whenever there is a seemingly strange thing happening on her phone. She also claims that other people have supposedly access to her emails and routinely delete or alter already sent emails. 

\- One day my mother was searching for some musical notes. These were rare notes given to her by some old professor or acquaintance. As time passed and she could not find them she started going crazy and claiming that people ha spied on her, broken inside her house and stolen her notes. Funnily I found her notes in another room. An hour of my life wasted right here (it was past midnight)....

\- She gets suspicious whenever she finds some pens lying around as she thinks they contain microphones or cameras !

\- Lately I've started hearing some noises coming from my roof at night. Judging by the sounds I'd say it's some animal, a squirrel, bird or rat. I don't know yet. I admit it's annoying but I can't deal with it now. Why am I saying this ? Well....my mother literally thinks that these are the sounds of some random dude literally walking on our roof at night for the specific purpose of damaging the roof or spraying dirt all over the roof and walls of the house ! Like how dumb does this sound ?! I've heard this specific nonsense for weeks now ! I'm tired ! 

\- Some real estate agents wanted to buy our place but we couldn't sell it yet for many reasons. That's important because once she saw these two estate agents close to our home, talking about something while pointing our roof with their fingers. My mother took this as ""evidence"" that these persons were supposedly deliberately conspiring against us and that they were supposedly sabotaging our house at night to make its value drop so that they could buy for cheaper. This is linked to the previous point as she thinks that these are the same individuals who are supposedly sabotaging our roofs. Sounds outlandish I know.  Yet my mother claims she is ""doing deductions like Sherlock Holmes"". I know Sherlock operates rationally: he gathers all the facts first and finds an explanation that takes account of all of them and explains them. My mother just takes anything at all and jumps to absurd conclusions. 

\- I had an absent father for years and he died not too long ago. Before he died she sometimes claimed that perhaps the individual answering my emails (I communicated with my father with emails) wasn't my real father and that my father was held hostage somewhere. After he died on two occasions my mother suggested that perhaps my father had somehow staged his death for God knows what reasons. Duh ! 

\- She has questionable memory. Like lately she found some ten year old email exchanges and as she was reading through them she said "" I don't remember writing this ! I don't remember saying that!"". She has many books at home. It's not uncommon for her to sometimes pick up a book and then proclaim that she doesn't remember ever having had that specific book; she then claims that someone must have stolen the ""real"" book and put this one in its stead.   

\- I saw some cracks on my balcony but they've already been there for quite some time. A few days ago my mother claimed that she had just noticed them now and that these cracks were a further ""evidence"" that the above mentioned real estate agents were supposedly trying to damage our house. I began an argument and told her her claims were utterly absurd and that cracks can happen overtime. She got irritated and accused me of ""being with them"". 

\- Sometimes she sees some tiny black spots on green leaves outside our house (I also noticed them. I don't know exactly what it is, probably some biological process. I don't know). Guess what ? My mother also takes this as evidence that some people are supposedly spreading dirt all over our house for God knows what reason. 

\-She often claims that we are having intruders at night in our house. I know it's false because I witnessed anything like that and nights are usually calm, not to mention I stay up many nights. Yet she's been repeating this same nonsense for almost all my life now ! How can I make her understand she's completely wrong ?! 

\- Last point: my mother is preoccupied by her looks which perhaps is fairly understandable given that she is in her late 50s. However at times it's almost the only thing she ever talks about. At some point she claimed that a part of her chin seemed bigger than the other; I replied I didn't see any difference and that it seemed fine. There she told one of the stupidest thing I ever heard: she started speculating that one our acquaintance, who is a skin doctor, supposedly came into our house at night and pumped some fat into my mother's chin to make it fatter or distort it deliberately ! She thinks that this could explain a dream she had that same night where she claims she saw an angel next to her bed with a machine the tubes of which were connected to her body........I'm not making this up. I obviously thought it was sheer nonsense. 

Here's some useful background: My mother is originally from Eastern Europe and used to be a prominent  Opera singer (Soprano). I've often tried to understand how she could arrive at these stupid types of thoughts. Once I asked her ""why would ANYONE spy on you ? You're not a high end individual with classified information or anything. You're just an artist or former artist. You're not a person of interest to any State or Security agency "" to which she replied ""because they want to prevent me from singing"". Duh. Are all opera singers this retarded ? Or is it the effect of not being famous anymore or not having contracts anymore ? Is it the fact she grew up in Ukraine and then Russia ? Or did she always want to look and sound smart ?? 

It is not my intention to bash my mother here. Despite her many flaws and all of the above I'm grateful for what she has done for me. But I can't deny that hearing all of this nonsense nonstop is really annoying the hell out of me. Sometimes I avoid talking to her altogether. It's as if I can't have a normal or rational discussion with her. 

What should I do ? I'm growing quite tired and very irritated from hearing all of this nonsense. I don't have anywhere to go too. I don't know who I should contact. 

Thanks for reading.",28Dec2020,1
851,"Fair warning this is long so I appreciate the time and advice offered in advance

Ive been dating my girlfriend for just over 6 months and it has been absolutely wonderful, we have been having by a great time even though times have been harding with Covid. Ive spent a lot of time at her house and around her family and they are in general very good people, but she has always had problems with her mom. Her mom is very controlling and employs a lot of parenting techniques that I find disrespectful. 

Her mom had a rough childhood and her own mother was very distant and forced her to learn a lot of things on her own and didn’t offer much support from what I understand, but it does not excuse how she has been treating my girlfriend. She has always looked for any reason to criticize even for things as small as not having the sheets the ‘right’ side up or eating foods she doesn’t like the smell of. My girlfriend has always tried her best to do things the way she wants but is never congratulated or appreciated when she does and only ever gets yelled at. My girlfriend has a younger brother who gets it worse than she does and seeing her parent him makes me very uncomfortable, she will constantly take his phone away for the smallest thing like playing music too loud even after he turns it down. Once she takes his phone she goes through it and looks at all of his text messages, instagram messages and any other apps. He is not allowed to have a snapchat and she is logged into his instagram account to monitor his activity, he is 15. This happens at least twice a month if not more and he is almost always ‘in trouble’

Recently things have been getting worse and on Christmas they went to look at a light show. When my girlfriend said she had to go home after a while to go to the bathroom her mom started making fun of her saying she needs adult diapers and that she is always the one who ruins their activities. My girlfriend got upset but her mom continued to berate her about it. Eventually my girlfriend broke down into tears and still she did not stop, they dropped her off at home and left her to go look at the lights again without telling her. When she called me having a breakdown her mom texted her saying “you better not be upset, there is no reason to be sad” when she responded to tell her that she really hurt her feelings she responded saying “You hurt mine by ruining the light show” and threatened to not let her see me for our 6 month anniversary because of it.

Since then things have been very tense and I have been doing my best to not confront her and keep my girlfriends mind off it but its impossible to escape her criticizing. Christmas was only one example and there are numerous, Ive even seen her get into an argument with my girlfriends dad because he had two meetings for his work that both started at 4, thats literally it, just because she said it was impossible to have two meetings at the same time. Things like this happen quite literally everyday in her house and my girlfriend does her best to avoid it and not get upset but I can tell its taking a really big toll on her mental health. I know its not my place to tell her how to parent but its painful to just sit and listen while someone constantly refuses to take any responsibility, seeks out any reason to criticize and makes a household a war zone of insults and insecurities. My girlfriend and I are both over 18 and she will be moving out soon but with covid and the current situation she cant escape her house almost at all unless she spends the night at mine, I don’t want to overstep any boundaries but I cant just sit and watch it all happen, any advice or ideas is really appreciated, my girlfriends family is for the most part really nice and good hearted but her mom is a constant raincloud that they don’t deserve to have to deal with.

Thank you",28Dec2020,1

It just occured to me, is there a section where you would have to specify your dog will be traveling with you? It was just a little pug, I did not realize owners specified whether or not dogs are permitted. I have not replied to the owner yet, but I wanted some input as to how I should proceed.

855,"I got a layoff notice for the company I am working for. It was a seasonal, part-time, side gig, and I got the notice on Christmas Eve that I will be let go immediately on New Years. However I was told that if I didn’t not finish my schedule I would be ineligible for re-hire, which I am not that concerned about because frankly I hated the job and just wanted extra money for the holidays. 

My concern comes in with the fact that I receive texts multiple times a week of employees on different shifts being diagnosed with covid. My main job is based on billing not a salary. The conundrum I find myself in is I don’t want a bad mark on my work history for quitting a job abruptly when I got news I didn’t like, but I’m also concerned that if I contract covid this week, I’m laid off with no financial reimbursement this company would give if I were in the middle of active employment.

In all, am I being unreasonable to go ahead and quit to protect myself in my main job, or is terminating my employment at this point going to appear poorly on job history

856,"So, I (17F) am considering a diet. I am 5’5” (165cm) and 175lbs (79.4kg) so I am definitely overweight for my height. My holdup is that I am a VERY picky eater and I want to change that. I hate most vegetables and I also hate working out (and honestly surprised I’m not bigger than I am :/ ). I’m thinking of trying a Ketogenic diet and I was wondering anyone had any advice. I’ll ask the following questions to give some people a starting point for advice.

1. Since I hate most vegetables, is there a way I can “ease” in to eating them? Like, what order should I eat vegetables in and how I should prepare them.

2. I know I need to start working out more but how do I do that? Are there some workouts you particularly like? Should I do cardio, flexibility, or strength first? (I do have access to a gym)

3. How can I increase my willpower? I have basically no willpower. Any tips and tricks?

4. How do you keep yourself motivated and on track?

5. Finally, are there some other forums I should post this on? I’m new to Reddit.

858,"I’m (18F) in a community college criminal justice class this semester. I thought it would be an interesting class to take and the course description made it sound like it was more focused on victim services and forensics than it actually is so I was initially disappointed by that. I decided to stay enrolled to collect some easy college credit and move on.

Turns out, this class is AWFUL. The teacher doesn’t respond to any of my messages or emails. Our syllabus is incorrect so I never know what to expect each week, and we have this massive semester project we’re working on right now that is giving me the worst anxiety I have ever experienced and I really need advice or encouragement because every time I even think about it I feel sick. 

This project is an outline (40 points), a powerpoint presentation (100 points), and a class vote (10 points) with potential extra credit (5 points). It’s worth a total of 155 points out of the entire semester’s 360 points, so basically if I fuck this up my grade is ruined. I already got the 40 points for the outline, after having a mental breakdown and nearly killing myself for several days. I was confused and didn’t know the due date and couldn’t ask my teacher because she won’t answer me so I completely thought I was going to fail it. I don’t think she even read it, but she gave me the points so it doesn’t matter. But now the presentation is due in a few weeks and I am terrified. 

I feel the anxiety and the stress creeping up and it’s like I’m paralyzed. I want to work on it. I need to work on it. But even thinking about it makes it hard to breathe and makes me think of how burnt out and awful I felt when I got so overworked with the outline. I’m absolutely terrified that I’m going to do it wrong and lose a ton of points. I can’t fail this class because it’s on my college transcript and I’m planning on going to a university next year so I can’t have an ugly score on my transcript. 

I feel like my powerpoint is too long and has too much on each slide, but then if I don’t put that much I leave stuff out. Since we’re an online class, the other kids that don’t see me present it have to just read the slides at a later time so I have to make sure the slides are more thorough than a powerpoint normally would be since not everyone will hear me verbally elaborate. I have the rubric but it’s extremely vague and she never talked about it so I don’t know if I’m actually meeting the criteria.

Plus, we have to present it to our “class”, which for me is 7 people, but there’s no rubric for the presentation so I don’t know how to prepare and I don’t know if she’ll be grading my presentation or not. I hate talking in front of the group and I’m terrible with technology so if she is grading my presentation I’m worried I’ll mess up or something. There’s so much that is on my mind I can’t even cover it all. 

If anyone has ANY advice or kind words at all I would really appreciate it. I’ve been anxious about assignments and classes before but never like this. All the advice I get from my family or friends is just “get it done and stop worrying” or “who cares about the grade?” which really isn’t helping me right now. Thank you.",28Dec2020,1

864,"So, my best friend was born on December 2, 1994 and died on December 21 or 22, 2016 (a brain injury 6 months prior from a longboarding accident). I have been uploading a lot of music and covers to my YouTube channel lately and I would like to dedicate a cover of a song to him (just me playing electric guitar, no vocals). It was one of his favorite songs and he would always play it on his phone when we went longboarding.

There's just one problem, however...

The song is ""You're Gonna Go Far, Kid"" by The Offspring. I'm just afraid that it's a bit ironic dedicating a song like that to someone who, in a sense, didn't ""go far"" but had an untimely death. I can already imagine a ton of YouTube commenters pointing out the irony of this when I upload the video. On the other hand, however, I feel like dedicating that song could also mean that he could go far and live on in our memories, so it might be a good thing.

871,"So at the beginning of the year I got with this girl, we were both so happy together. But I made a mistake a few months in. We broke up but we still talked. I have no one else, no friends, no one to talk to. We have both been struggling with depression so we were there for eachother and gave eachother someone to talk to, she has other friend.
Eventually in August we got back together but it only last a few weeks. We still talked again after that. Then in October I tried to commit suicide. She was there for me while I was getting better and helped me. We still continued talking until a couple weeks ago. She said I was just making her life worse and that she never wanted to talk to me again. She was still remembering the mistake I made. I can't carry on without her, when I was with her everything wrong in my life disappeared. I tried everything, I apologized, I was there for here, I gave her time when she needed it. 
I just want her back, I really can't carry on without her. She's the only reason I got help after I tried to kill myself. She's the only thing that had kept me going. I have tried telling her this. I don't what to do.",28Dec2020,1
872,Quick back story. Been talking and seeing this girl for about a month. We got into a pretty heated fight the other day due to my own insecurities. I screwed the pooch bad. Well today we talked a bit and of course I promised which I had before that I wouldn't do that crap. And I failed. So now I have to prove that I won't. She didn't really say anything. Well this afternoon she sent me a single text with a video of the heart on ice song. What exactly is she trying to tell me?  Is she trying to tell me to just give up?,28Dec2020,1
874,"I'll try to make this short. Over 3 years ago I was in a relationship that I'd say was the first one I was truly ready to commit to long term. I was myself and it was great. That ended.

I spent the next 3 years single and went through the process of using dating apps ect. No luck.

Now I'm in a relatively new relationship that I'm very happy about and have no doubts about being with this person. They help me in so many ways and I've fallen for them much more than I would've ever thought.

The thing is, through this whole 3 years and even now. My ex comes into my mind on a fairly regular basis. A lot of it was just me taking too long to move on. And I know it sounds simple. My new partner makes all my bad feelings disappear and I've never had that with anyone before.

I've remained friends with my ex and we get on well. But I feel like I still miss her sometimes. I don't think I want her back. But part of me wants her to say she wants me back. I try not to talk to her because I know we get on well. But I still end up messaging her.

This probably came out as a bit of a mess.

I know on face value what I should do, but I just feel like I need a bit of help figuring out why I'm feeling this way.

877,"This is a long one I think so bear with me. 

I know some of you will read the title and say, “if you have to ask, you aren’t ready.” Understandable. But that’s why I am asking. I know I’m not ready, but I get these fleeting moments of wanting to be a mother so badly. 
My husband and I are both 22. I’m a college graduate with a job in education. We were together 6 years before we got married in October. (It was a Covid friendly wedding, only immediate immediate family so I don’t want to hear shit about getting married in a pandemic. We followed every precaution and guideline) 
My husband (then fiancé) was in a car accident in May where he broke his neck, he leg, his elbow, his jaw, and a handful of ribs. I spent the whole summer being his sole caretaker. 


There’s a minor backstory of us, but if there are any questions I will answer! Here are my main thoughts and concerns that go through my head whenever I think about getting pregnant: 

-my husband turned 21 right before Covid. We are both people who like to go out and have a drink but with covid and then his accident, we weren’t able to do any of that this year, or any traveling. Usually we like to go on a weekend trip during the year and an actual vacation over the summer but with him being unemployed bc of his accident and travel restrictions, we couldn’t do any of that either. I don’t want to have a child before we are able to enjoy our early 20’s. 

-on the opposite of that, in the 2 months after my husbands birthday and before the lockdown in March, we went out to the bars only 2 times (we lived in a college town bc I was in school) so it’s not like we would have to travel to go to any good bars or anything. We just didn’t go. So I’m left wondering “if I’m waiting BECAUSE I want to be able to go out to a club or a bar whenever we want to, but we never go anyways, then what’s the point in waiting??” I was also roofied in February when I went out to a concert and haven’t even had a drink of tequila since, so why am I holding out using the excuse “we are young and I want to be able to go to bars and not get a babysitter”? 

-my best best best friend just gave birth to her first child on the 16th and throughout her pregnancy I was really curious about how it felt and how she knew she wanted a baby (she is the nurturing/mother type and has been since I met her in middle school, so I knew it wasn’t a difficult decision for her) but I still was very put off by the idea of having my own until I saw her daughter. I was instantly so in love with her and was so proud of my best friend and slightly jealous! I wanted that! It surprised me, 100% never thought I would feel that way. Because up until then I was totally against having a child at all at least for the next 3-5 years (which breaks my husbands heart). 

-my husband is still very young and definitely acts it. I know he would make a great father but he is very immature about a lot of things. Obviously I would hope that fatherhood would change that about him and make him more responsible but I’m not going to have a child in hopes that my husband matures a little bit. On the other hand, if we keep living life the way we are, when is he going to get the opportunity to mature and become more responsible? 
I hope that makes sense. Like we are living the same routine every day and I’m not UNhappy with it but how to people grow doing the same things over and over again? We have 2 puppies and that made him a little more responsible. He’s never had inside dogs that he’s had to clean up after or pay attention to what they ate or the content of their puke. He’s handled it well and cares about our dogs a lot more than what I expected. Like I said he has never owned a house pet, never really gave a shit about any animals bc they are animals according to him but he looooves our pups. Even the oldest mutt who I picked up for $40 despite my husband not really wanting him. Loves him now. They are best buds. (Obviously I’m not comparing animals to real human children, I’m just showing my husbands ability to show responsibility and care for something other than himself and I). 

-my parents are getting older. I’m their youngest. They turned 50 this year, my in laws are 3-4 years younger than my parents. I have a nephew who is autistic who my parents take care of full time as my sister is a recovering addict living in a recovery center across the country. He is the apple of our eyes 100% but I see how much they love him and I just want to be able to give them more grandkids to love and spoil because they are literally the best and I want them to still be able to enjoy my kids younger years and maybe even see them graduate. I love my parents so much and have great relationships with them and want them to create memories with my children before they are too old to. All of my grandparents are were in their 60’s when I was a youngster and wanted to go and play at their house. My grandma could never take me to the park or the mountains like my mom takes my nephew. 

-I’m worried about losing myself when I become a mother. I know so may parents say that once they become a parent they couldn’t imagine their lives without their kids. Don’t know how they did life before their kids. Once I become a parent I feel like that’s all I’ll ever be. That will become my identity like I see so many mothers complain about. I enjoy my alone time, my husband works on oil rigs so I get half of the year to myself to enjoy being an introvert. If I have a child, I lose that. This summer was hard enough having to spend every day within 3 feel of my husband (I love him to death don’t get me wrong but we spent 2 years living together only seeing each other 1/2 the year and then just like that he was at home 24/7 and I couldn’t leave him alone for 3 months. I was stuck in my house taking care of someone and my mental health was awful. I couldn’t be alone to recharge as I normally would. I had to be up every 4 hours in the middle of the night to administer pills and clean wounds. It was rough and if having a child is anything similar, I don’t know if I can handle it. 

-we have these friends, they are a married couple with a 1 year old daughter. The husband is one of my husbands best friends from highschool. They are scarily similar in personality, but he’s 2 years older than my husband. Anyways, as soon as he and his wife got pregnant, I noticed a huge change in him. He is the best father to that girl and loves her so much. And I’m like “well if he can grow up and turn into that type of man, my husband can too, right?” 
I feel like I sound like I’m comparing my grass to my neighbors, but I’m not. They are a great family and I love them all so much. They drove 3 hours one way to come help me move into our house while my husband was in the ICU. I’m not at all jealous of what they have, it’s more of a “well if he made this change to a respectable father figure, then can’t my husband?” 


I asked my mom when she knew she wanted to have my sister and she said “well because all my friends were married and having babies and that was my next step too” 
Is that all it is? You get married and that’s the next step? How did you come to terms with that? 
I haven’t been on birth control since May. I knew that we wouldn’t be having sex for a WHILE after his accident and my RX ran out that month and with the move, I just never got it refilled or anything. I also wanted my body free and clear of any artificial hormones so my body would begin its ovulation cycle again bc I knew we would want to have kids after getting married. I didn’t want to struggle with conceiving bc of my birth control. But we are still pretty “safe” I guess. An accident very well could happen as all I do is track my ovulation and we use the pull out method every single time (not a sure fire method, I’m aware, but along with tracking ovulation, it’s worked so far) 

I am just so conflicted! There are so many pros and cons and I just don’t know how to just rip the bandaid off and say “let’s make a baby” because every time we are in the mood I get worked up and almost say it but then chicken out right at the last minute. It’s hard for me to realize that I’m a married woman now and can let my husband get me pregnant 😂🤣 we have been together since we were 16 so we spent years and years actively trying to NOT get pregnant but now it’s okay and I’m unsure if I even want to right now.",28Dec2020,1
878,"To be clear, there is some TV I enjoy like crime documentaries and some comedy, but even then I would only watch them if there was nothing else to do (e.g a plane journey).  For example, I can't remember the last time I went to the cinema and didn't check my phone 30 mins in to see how long the runtime was.

I'm not sure what it is but I just find most media incredibly dull and in the case of movies I can never look past the fact that none of it's real and they always seem to push the limits of possibility to make the story more interesting (which I get) but it just makes it so boring to me and no matter how hard I try I can almost never get invested.

Then there's all  the amazing games which people rave about but yet when I play them it mostly just feels like a chore.

There are multiplayer games I play regularly and enjoy but even then I think sometimes I just enjoy beating people more than I do actually playing the game.

And no, I don't have depression. There are things I'm very passionate about like music production and sports but I just don't get why I can no longer enjoy anything most other people enjoy. It's been that way for 5-6 years and I'm only 21. It's like I've become de-sensitised to anything that's supposed to be interesting...Everything just feels so stale and never ignites that spark of enjoyment in me..

It's almost like I've seen everything there is to be seen a million times over, yet nothing could be further from the truth.",28Dec2020,1
879,"My friend, Bobby, was going out with someone over a year: that someone is now someone I call my best friend. They separated last March, it was a really messy breakup. Lesley, my best friend moved in with me during this time for support because Lesley was going through a really tough time even without having to deal with breaking up with Bobby. During this experience, Lesley and I got even closer. Bobby was pissed, which I understand, but at that time I had to pick between helping two friends and I picked Lesley. Bobby and I stopped speaking for a few weeks, but we’ve since mended our friendship. While we are not as close as we were, I still care about Bobby, but I’ve developed strong romantic feelings for Lesley. Bobby and Lesley are now on good terms and remain friends, but I suspect that Bobby might still be in love with Lesley, and though I am 100% sure Lesley has absolutely no romantic feelings about Bobby: we both care about Bobby as a person. 
I have fallen deeply in love with Lesley. We are extremely close and Lesley is now a huge part of my life, to the point where Lesley spent Christmas with my family. We call each other most nights and really miss each other when we’re not together. All I know is I want to be with this person, I’ve never loved anybody this much.
However, I’m worried about how Bobby might take this news. I have no idea how to approach this and I’m freaking out. I don’t want anyone to get hurt but at the same time Lesley is the most amazing person I have ever met and I feel like this is a once in a lifetime kind of love",28Dec2020,1

881,"My mum hasn't got the motivation to find herself any hobbies or do anything all day. So I got her some jig saws for Christmas and she was elated. But for the last few months or so she has been watching the same repeats of judge Judy and channel hopping constantly complaining that there isn't anything on tv and it is really putting her in a bad mood. I know it is a symptom of her depression and even watching new tv shows/films if that's all she has the energy to do will perk her up and get her excited about something. So a while back I bought her a fire stick, subscribed to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and downloaded the extra apps for the \*parrot on the shoulder peg-leg\* stuff. So she has access to literally everything she could ever want to watch and has the ability to find new things anyway if she doesn't have anything in particular in mind. But she still sits for hours and every time I head into the living room she's sat there channel hopping with a frustrated look on her face. When I ask her what's up, ""there's nothing on TV"". MUM, I don't want to here it! You have the firestick! What's actually the matter?"" ""Nothing"". If she doesn't want to talk to me about her problems or visit a therapist how can I solve the channel hopping problem? Every time I set her up with a new show or a movie she gets two or three episodes in and never watching it again. Even stuff she was interested in and asks me to find for her.",28Dec2020,1

883,"A short but odd situation on my end. I purchased a VCR player many days ago from a Craigslist seller/stranger and now I received a text from him that reads ""how was your Christmas sexy"". I know he's married because he specified that the barking dog on the balcony was his wife's.

I feel like I should have something mailed to the house with a screenshot of the text for the wife to see. It might not seem like a big deal to some, but honestly, multiple aspects of this situation really bother me.

First, I'm just trying to get a VCR player to help with my conversion of an old home video to dvd. It is a VHS my mother recorded, and she just passed away a few weeks ago. Can't I just grieve in peace without being harassed by some creep?!

Secondly, I feel I can't possibly be the only person the guy has tried to contact this way. I feel like the wife deserves to know, if she doesn't already. Her husband is attempting to creep around.

Lastly, this whole situation is not something new or unheard of for both genders (unwanted advances in obviously inappropriate settings). This is the first time I have the means to make their actions have consequences. Too harsh? What about the wife's feelings? Unsure on whether to leave it at ""do not contact me again"" or to take some action. It strums on my conscience to do nothing when I think about the wife. How would I even approach this, if I should?",28Dec2020,1
885,"Hi, so I have been in conversations quite some times, where I am not necessarily too interested or well versed in a topic (example politics or sports).

888,"I am a F(20), lately it’s been hard trying to adjust to adulting. With paying bills and juggling a job and school and a pandemic it’s been horrible which I assume many can relate to. I have also relapsed into my eating disorder which has made it even worse. This has also caused many arguments at home such as why am losing so much weight, why am I so picky with food, why I have anxiety or why am I depressed if I have everything I can ask for. My mom has told me that I should move out because I’m causing her anxiety with all my issues. As much as I love the idea I’m not financially stable. 

I hate myself for feeling so powerless. They blame me for everything that happens at home. For example, yesterday my sister and I decided to go to the book store. She’s 12 so she’s really into manga and wanted to buy a Yaoi book (like hentai but gay and manga) and I didn’t think much about it whatever it’s a book CANT cause that much harm. Later on I hear my dad telling my sister that I am a horrible older sister and I should be taking better care of her and all this stuff and I just question like why do I have to be her care taker? Isn’t that your job? It a freaking book dude.

My parents have always been super controlling. They stopped tracking me when I got my own phone phone plan not too long ago but up until then they were always tracking me and seeing where I went and who I was with. They even would track my expenses until I was 18. I couldn’t have any sleep overs or be home past 6 any day of the week. I had to race home on public transportation since I got out of school at 4:30 and it took about an hour and a half to get home (on a good day) 

I just feel super suffocated. I wish they would try and be understanding of all the stuff I deal with but being a first generation latinx person they expect so much from me. Most of the time I’m not home and at my boyfriends because his family is so loving and I get jealous of how patient and understanding they are. 

There’s so much more I could go on about but idk. I just want to find someone to relate to me or that can give me some advice...",28Dec2020,1
889,"     My Aunt had found a cat a few days ago on the streets in the snow. They decided to take it in as they already have a cats and this one seemed friendly. 
I met this cat, and it was super soft, fat, medium grey colored, and friendly. It sounds sad, almost like it's crying, up to now, but it isn't afraid. Initially, they thought it might be pregnant because it was so fat and that it was a stray. But, then they thought what if it belonged to someone else as it was so tame. Tamer and friendlier than any of their cats, by far. 
    Now, they found this cat just a few days after her father's/my grandfather's funeral. One reason she originally got her first cat was because of my grandmother's death last year. It helped her a lot and was very therapeutic to her, and she became very attached. Now, this cat coming in her life at the time it did, she took it as a sign that it was meant to be and immediately fell in love with it.
    She just discovered that this cat actually isn't a stray, and that the owners had opened their garage and it escaped by accident one night. It's just a street  over from them. But, my aunt feels too attached and said she's keeping the cat, and that it'll get used to them in time.

I flew all the way to Boulder with my parents and during that time, yes they did judge me and yes they make a field trip out of it of course.  Once I came back, from that trip, my parents almost want to take me out of school, and more curfews. And my sister treated me like I was a monster. I've strict asian parents and egotistical sister. During that time, I honestly wanted to die. Because I've nothing going on for me. I was flunking out of college as well. And I had no friends that was closed to me. The only person that my back was my boyfriend at that time. I couldn't even tell my parents that it was a fucking tinder date that got me pregnant and that I was drunk completely. 

Fast-forward to now, I got out of 5yrs relationship. And he used me for money. He still owes me $6k and doesn't even want to pay me back. He lied and said it was for rent. Never given me the paper trail to prove that it was rent. The money was wired to his bank account. And he doesn't even care that I am still completely mad about it. I did trash his place completely because I was running away from that house and his emotionally abuse family. I dont even feel bad that one of the kittens broken his TV, that I got him as an Xmas gift a long time ago. 

It has been a year, and I still feel mad and rage when I harass him for the money. I honestly dont even feel any remorse. And to be honest, I don't feel anything. I dont really care whom I piss off.

(20F) Need serious help here. So I spent Christmas weekend with my boyfriend(21M) for the first time since we’ve been together for like 6 years now. We met in hs and he’s met my mother on many occasions but my mother still has this idea that he is a bad person and out to get me. It’s monday now and I’m going back home later in the evening I get a call from my mom I don’t answer b/c she always calls and calls and calls and ruins my mood. And it’s annoying how a big person my age has to keep answering to their mother for every single damn thing. So she goes and calls my bf phone. She found his number the first time by going through the TMobile account to see who I call and text. I delete the number out here phone b/c I don’t want her harassing him. She goes through the account once again to call him b/c I didn’t answer the phone. 

She calls him and he passes me the phone and says “do you think it’s fair I don’t know where you are for two days” “why is your life only have to do with ___” “why is he controlling you” “if this how you want to live your life it won’t be under my roof” I don’t respond I just say ok until she hangs up.

Then she send me this text, “Why is ____ dominating your life? You interact with no one but him. So much that u can’t call me to say where u r. Are you banned from using your phone or talking to other people? In time to come you will remember my words. Stop being  a follower be a leader and stop letting people use your body and your mind”

Now. For one my bf doesn’t control, not possible knowing the type of person I am I’m very independent and don’t tolerate mess so that’s that. He doesn’t hinder me from being with friends or doing anything. If anything he supports me in every single way. When I’m depressed he’s the one to make me feel better. He motivates to reach my full potential. No one knows that though. I don’t have to bring nobody around if I don’t want to. I dont have to do anything I don’t want to especially with me being grown. 

So it’s like what do I do. It’s so annoying having to deal with this. It’s like what do you want from me. Why can’t I just live? What am I doing wrong?",28Dec2020,1

She took advantage of my mum being so nice and my mum then told me I should spend more on her because what she was planning to get me did not correlate to what I got. However on Xmas day it turned out she lied and manipulated my mums kindness as she spend around £50 on me and I spent £400. She also said she got my parents presents so my parents got her something nice and she got them alcohol when she knows my mum and sister don’t even drink. Anyway I felt like she snaked my mum and lied in order for me to get her anything she wanted. 

On Boxing Day all she would do is lie about everything too but then never admit even when I told her straight to her face she’s lying. I just thought enough is enough but on Xmas day I bought her a promise ring. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed but it was the worst and most heartbreaking goodbye I’ve had from a break up, even though I know it’s the right thing to do. I just feel so down and lonely without her. We also have each other still on all socials and all our pics are still up so I’m not sure if it’s too early to block her or delete her, I’m not sure? 

I know time will heal, but I just needed to get it off my chest as I feel very lonely right now. Thanks",28Dec2020,1

So I spoke to my boyfriend this morning he said he was fine. We normally talk all day and around noon be suddenly just went quiet. Didn’t go online for 7 hours which is really uncharacteristic of him. He came online just now but hasn’t answered my message. It’s not a super important message just a meme but we normally as I said talk all day. 

Recently he has been going quiet a lot and ignoring messages. I have asked him twice if he’s ok to which he relies “I’m fine” when he clearly isn’t. I feel like I should just leave him be this time?

Is it my place to let my parents know? I feel like a ""nice"" brother would stay quiet but a great brother would look out for her by ratting her out...

906,"I’m a college student in an Asian immigrant family. My parents aren’t strict or abusive, but recently I’ve been stuck on something that happened to me as a kid.

I don’t remember this too well because I tend to repress memories but when I was maybe 12 or so, my mom and I would get into typical mother-daughter arguments. Once, this argument escalated to the point where my mom would start screaming hysterically about how “oh apparently she was such a bad mother” and dial 911 on the phone, threatening to call the cops to take her away. I would start begging and crying for her to not press call. She would also laugh hysterically as I begged her to stop, bang her head with her hand or against the wall, and threaten to kill herself all in a “since I’m such a bad mother” kind of way while I was terrified and crying.

This happened a few times (maybe over the span of a year). I repressed those memories but I’ve started remembering them again recently and I just don’t know how to get over it. I think what my mom did really hurt my preteen self, and I find it really hard to forgive. But it was out of character, and I think it was because her dad died earlier that year and she was mentally in a bad place.

On the whole, my parents do a lot for me and are supportive of my goals, and many people go through worse situations and have much shittier families.

I know this is something I should talk about in therapy, but that isn’t an option for me at the moment. How do I resolve this? Do I just forgive my mom for what she did, or does this whole thing not even count as trauma and I’m being overly sensitive? 

TL;DR My mom hurt me emotionally when I was a preteen. Does that count as trauma? How do I get over it?",28Dec2020,1
907,"My uncle lives across the road with his parents despite being almost 40. His mum is his servant, that's why. He's even hurt her a few times. She ended up in hospital last time. Sometimes he comes into my house to steal food, steal printer ink, or annoy my family. 

Whenever he comes, he goes into my sisters bedroom then my bedroom. Of course I mind when he comes to my bedroom, but I prefer it over him being in my 15 year olds sisters room. He walks into her bedroom and asks her how she is. You may think this is normal but you must realise we do not like this man. I've known this man my whole life and if he died, I wouldn't care and neither would my sister. He's not a good person. Anyway, my sister tells him repeatedly to go, sometimes she runs downstairs and cries. He does leave after a short while, but it happens everytime he comes to our house. 

My auntie has told him he should knock before entering teenage girls bedrooms, and all he does is knock then go straight in. Someone please tell me how I can deal with this vile creature. Even my mum is scared of him. She lets him take my 13 year old brother to random places, it's so weird. My brother hates it.

At one point, I was asked to try out for pro cheer squad, but I said no since I knew it would have been miserable for me. Working on minimal pay, going to practice really early in the morning, going to all the games, and working another job would have been a pain in the ass.

Something else that happens with people like me is that we tend to attract others like us. Last minute cancellers/etc.

I used to work at an in-patient addiction center, and something I really admired about alcoholics was how creative they could outsmart everyone in finding a way to get what they want.

915,"Hi, I have a friend. Well a close friend who I don’t really know what to label. They and I have always been in this “romanticish but not labeled” relationship. About a week ago, I spent about 5 days with them. And they were very affectionate and gentle with me and they like seemed to be attached to me in a very romantic sense. That makes me happy because I like them very much so romantically. On the last day there, we had sex for the first time. And it was nice. However, on the drive while they were dropping me off at home, they talked a lot about things that made me feel kind of conflicted. They mentioned about how their family might say things about them having sex without being in a real relationship. And I understand where some of it is coming from.

919,"Hey guys. I have been feeling very distressed about my family life and a situation that happened as recently as last night is causing me to ruminate and have many anxious thoughts. I need to have a way to both express my thoughts in writing to clear it up for myself, and get some input. 

I (16F) have been having problems with my parents for my entire life. My father grew up in an abusive home with a step mom who didn't treat him well, and it showed in his parenting. I won't get into the details, and I want to assure everyone that I wasn't unsafe, but there existed a lot of clash between my parents and myself. My brother, who is a couple years younger than me, is severely mentally disabled, took up a lot of time and energy from my family's life. This, along with financial constraints and other things, mainly religious conflict, resulted in the unfavourable atmosphere during my childhood. Let me explain.

My parents used to be very religious, and naturally, wanted to pass that on to me. I attended weekly lessons, was forced to pray multiple times a day, partook in many different religious rituals and, possibly most important to my present-day situation, wore clothing that my parents deemed religiously O.K. This has always been a major source of conflict between them and I. You may think that this is common and not a very big deal, which is true to an extent, but my situation was very different. From a very young age I had to cover up and was pressured by my parents to put on a veil at the age of 9. I felt controlled and put down. I felt like I was forced to express myself to the world in a way that didn't reflect my own thoughts, and I felt ashamed and embarrassed. My outfits were horrendous for a young child who saw her friends wear stylish dresses, t-shirts, pants, and shorts to school. We fought over this very commonly and I guess it was just undebatable for my parents because they never let up. I often times ended up missing out on social events because I couldn't bring myself to wear what they wanted me to wear. I want to stress the importance of this because while, again, it may seem small, it was a very big deal to us. 

I took off the veil when I was 13, to my parents disapproval. They constantly told me how ashamed they were of me, how they would not be seen in public with me (I would have to run away from my mom in a public place like the mall when her friends showed up), how what I was doing was religiously prohibited, etc. To them, this was their ""trade"" for my ""reprehensible actions""; as in they deserved to make such comments to let their anger out since they couldn't ""force"" me (as if this isn't basically forcing). Anyway, this was the tipping point to both our relationship and my relationship with religion.

When I was younger, as in 8-13 years old, I had been diagnosed with and suffering from severe OCD, depression and anxiety. Many of my ruminations were related to religion. The religion I was a part of was extremely micro-managing and obsessive, and my brain fed on that. I suffered a lot of religious trauma and the fact that I wore the veil accentuated that. My headdress was a billboard for my religion and a sign on my forehead that read information about my personal life - a life I did not want to live. I was terrified of God and of Hell, but I didn't truly believe. It was purely obsessive. When I took of the hijab, I felt a weight being lifted off my shoulders but that did not come without a cost - my relationship with my parents. One thing led to another, the comments piled up, and I spit out that I ""hated god"". From there, my atheism became a taboo and they stopped making comments. My mother and I got into many arguments and eventually enough was said that we no longer speak to each other even though we live in the same house. This is a great source of pain to me, but not so much as an apology was uttered from her lips for the very horrible things she said, and that I cannot forget. I still cry thinking about how worthless I am in her eyes and how I cannot satisfy what she wants. It has been 6 months and I have forgotten how to speak to her. It's not that I am ignoring her, but that we both have halted any effort of deliberate communication.

My father, on the other hand, basically became extremely liberal overnight. I guess my exclamation of infidelity made him realize his mistakes, and he actually allowed me to have my own beliefs. He (over time) stopped making comments on my clothing, and our relationship got stronger - but was still very shaky. Recently, with this lockdown and the fact that we spend so much time together, things have gotten worse. The lack of communication between my mother and I is bothering my dad, but he also has complaints about my behaviour.

I am not a bad kid. At one point, I misbehaved a bit (no parties, sex or drugs, but I did do things that I regret), but this has completely disappeared over the last 1-2 years. I am a straight A+ student with research commitments and I take part in STEM related contests and tests. I tutor math and science. I am planning on going to the best university in my country to study astrophysics and I spend all of my time reading, rarely leaving my house to do anything with my friends. I am not a bad child in that sense, but I admit I can be disrespectful at home. I live with 5 siblings (6 including me), the youngest of which is not even 2 years of age. My house is not big enough to accommodate all of us and it gets in the way of my schooling, social life, and mental health. It is constantly noisy, smelly, overwhelming and active. I can never have any friends over to my house, I have trouble opening a mic to speak in school or during ECs which frustrates me to no end, and to be honest I do vent out my frustration to my parents. I am not very giving with my space, and I don't allow my siblings to play in my homework area, even though our house is not big enough for them to have any other space to play comfortably. It's just something I can't give up, and I already share the area with my disabled brother. I complain about the noise and I sometimes make comments about how I am looking forward to moving out so I can actually focus on my studies without children running around me. I hope someone can empathize with the feeling of having goals and a yearn for independence as a teenager but acting as a sort of parent to younger siblings. I single-handedly taught my toddler sister how to read and write, and I try to help take some weight off my parents' work, but I honestly don't do much. I know it is hard for them, but I can't help but repeat the stereotypical teen phrase of ""you chose to have kids"". The amount of stress and disappointment I face because of living in this highly disruptive house forces me to think a certain way. Any inner retrospection and vows to change my behaviour go out the window when I hear children screaming during an online presentation. It drives me crazy.

Sometimes I can make rash comments about something my parents are doing,  that they are ""hindering my happiness"" or that their choices about religion and the amount of children they had is ruining my experience as a teenager and with school. This is fuelled by the frustration of my current home-life situation, but also with my unresolved feelings about the past. My parents were unforgiving and borderline cruel to me when I was younger. They were going through their own stress with a disabled child and financial struggles, and they took it out on me. A lot of my mental health issues stem from that very directly. Whenever I try to bring it up and talk through it, for the sake of my healing, I am gaslighted and told that I am ""ungrateful, selfish, and want to ruin their life by not giving up this narrative of 'us' \[them\] hurting you."". This is justified by my father's current generosity and willingness to abandon traditional beliefs to allow me to have my own, along with the fact that I probably get the most material wealth from my dad. This is new behaviour on his part, and just a couple years ago I would have been yelled at for wearing a pair of jeans with a shirt, or spilling some water on the counter. I was raised in an explosive home but my siblings are being treated with affection and care. It hurts, and a twisted sort of jealousy towards the treatment my siblings now get exists on my end. I have not heard so much as an 'I love you' from my parents, but they claim that I am spoiled rotten and ungrateful. I'm not sure if they are purposely doing this or if they just don't understand that I am trying to heal from the past. I hate that I stick to it and I wish that I could move on but I can't. The gaslighting does not help. I still have panic attacks and issues today with my social life, outfits, self worth, romantic endeavours (I feel dirty if I even think about it), and so much more because of my childhood trauma. This has been discussed with a psychologist and I am not making it up.

Last night, my father and I got into an argument which ended with a long monologue from him about how I am ruining his life. He told me that he wants me to leave yet also complained about my wanting to leave. He said some self-deprecating things in a way that is manipulative and it is still stinging me right now. I know that he is suffering, I went against what they wanted as a daughter. But I wish him and my mother would finally let that vision go for good and, as vain as it seems, apologize to me. I asked for an apology yesterday and he told me that he will never apologize for what ""he thought was right at the time"". My mom still won't talk to me. It's been 6 months. I am lacking parental guidance and it is hurting me. I don't know what to do. I feel that I have no room to talk because I can seem ungrateful at times but I can't just apologize again and keep bottling up the unresolved trauma. It is sure to come out again. I don't know what to do. I feel unwanted and unloved and like a burden. I don't want to show my face to them and I can't even begin to muster up the courage to say a word to either of them. I want my parents back, but I can't give up my principles. I can't revert. 

Please be nice if you do so choose to comment. Thank you for reading. Sorry if this is poorly articulated but I am in emotional distress and I guess that isn't the greatest of my worries.",28Dec2020,1
920,"Hello Reddit, 

My name is H69 and I have come here to share my troubles with you. 

I recently turned 18 and my whole life I have had a hard time sharing, toys, room, bed you name it, I have hated to share it. 

I don’t know where this came from, might have a hunch, but I don’t know if that’s relevant (if that is the case I will elaborate, with pleasure!). 

For example, my dad got me a weighted blanket for x-mas. I’ve slept with it for 2 nights, I am absolutely thrilled about it. I do whatever it takes to keep it in pristine condition, shower at night so it will feel “clean” and in my mind stay clean. Am really careful when using it, also put it on top of my bedding so it won’t touch me, to keep it idk, clean or something. Just whatever it takes to keep it nice. 

My dad wanted to try for a night, I obliged. However over the years I have gotten better at pretending to be okay with this I might not stand a 100% so. I convinced him I was ok with it, even happy. Because I love him, and I want to share with him, I just don’t have the balls to share my conditions with him, because he’s my dad. 

Now he has the weighted blanket, I don’t, and I’m at the verge of crying thinking about how it might get “dirty”. I feel stupid writing that down. 

I love him, can’t say no to him, want to share with him, hate sharing without conditions.

I fully expected tomorrow to be my last day. I've been calling off a lot lately, and honest to god the idea of going in tomorrow just fills my head with even more anxiety. I want to quit. My family keeps telling me that I shouldn't. I don't have any issues with the people I work with, but the retail environment of that store is just so bad and I do not have the capacity to handle it anymore.

My mental health is so horrible and I don't know what I should do.

I (28m) was seeing a girl(22F) for a month. We slept together a few times and had a lot in common. I found her very attractive and she basically checked off every box for things I’m looking for in someone. 
She ended things out of nowhere saying she was too busy in her life right now. Tried reaching out a few times but she never replied.

I’ve been having a very hard time accepting this because we had so much in common and things were so good when we were hanging out. 
How do I stop obsessing about this? It’s really messing with my head. It’s been 2 months now... 
I think what really bothers me is that she was able to just end things and not even want to talk or be friends afterward. 
Any tips? I know people say I’ll find someone better or focus on other things etc. but I keep feeling like I won’t find someone better because it’s so hard for me to get feelings for people",28Dec2020,1
926,"Hey guys, I am 25 YO Male, and I recently started to think about moving back with my parents.

I'll try to describe the situation so you can draw a better picture of my situation:

A year ago, I finally moved out and started living on my own. However, what I didn't anticipate, was this whole 'pandemic' thing. You see, I was struggling mentally even before moving out from the parents sort of. And I thought that moving out would push me in the right direction. On the contrary. I fell to quite weird states (multiplied by loneliness and cold weather) and when I seriously couldn't bear it anymore, I realized I needed help. So I found a therapist. She helped me realize a few things and helped me a lot, however, I still did not feel completely okay. What got me out of that miserable excuse of existence was an exercise. More specifically weight-lifting. I started slow and steadily increased the number of workout sessions per week. This led to me being quite addicted to working out and I was there 5 days a week. Finally, I started being sane. I was happy. Feeling great. Focused on myself and my well-being.

However, a few months back, another covid wave struck the Czech Republic and with that, the government closed gyms. This obviously had a huge impact on my sanity and overall mental state. I am now at the parents' house since I can't go to work anymore (we have a home-office ordered by management) and would be all day, all by myself in the midst of winter at my flat. Quite depressing.

One of the reasons why I moved out (other than the attempt to give my life a new direction) was this weird idea, that it would be somewhat easier to find a girlfriend if I live on my own. This theory, however, couldn't be proven or disproven due to the mentioned Covid induced lockdown.

**I seek advice on whether or not is it bad to move back with my parents to preserve mental health in these times, or if I should just try to push through this and stop being a 'pus\*y'?** 

**And would this action be considered a 'step back'?** I am in quite an anxiety situation about this and I definitely want to contact my therapist, but with all things going on, the waiting time is long and I really want to get a different point of view on this.

*One thing I have to mention is, that the reason for 'moving' would be only the mental aspect and not financial - as money is not an issue right now (I have a pretty stable job).*

**Am I childish for wanting to move back? Is there something wrong with me?**

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate your insight. Should you have any further question, please, ask, I'll respond as soon as possible.

Thank you all who will make time to read this and possibly respond.

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kcoisb/did_post_before_about_saying_something_petty_that/).
Since then, I have been trying to meet up with said friend and have been constantly blow off. I understand they are stressed from work at the moment and it is hard because of lockdown. But it really feels like they are avoiding me on purpose.

A good example is when I was out in town with my family earlier and we walked past them walking their dog. We all said hi and I stopped to carry on talking, but they just carried on walking. My parents then started asking if we had fallen out of whatever, but I just said we hadn't and they were busy and it was fine because I don't know what it is.

I've tried asking what I've done, I've tried ignoring it and pretending nothing happened, I've tried saying sorry. Not really sure what I can do tbh. 
I've constantly had friendship problems throughout my life because I don't get a lot of social cues and am either overbearing or underbearing (if that's a thing) I don't know that I'm doing this unless people tell me. It could very well be that I am being over the top, but just don't realise.

Most of my other friends my age have moved away, so I guess that's why I don't want to lose this friendship, but I can't help thinking that is how it's going to go.

Tldr; accidentally insulted a friend by not realising a joke wasn't a joke anymore (because I'm shit at social cues) now it feels like I'm being left out and ignored by said friend and don't know what I've done. 

Sorry for posting again, I dont really know where else to go to get anonymous advice. Thanks in advance.",28Dec2020,1
929,"I have a “good friend” I went to college with freshman year (I transferred after) who is a soft dude from LA where I live now. I had beef with a kid on my floor in our dorm and after a night of drinking, this kid I had beef with and 2 of his pledge brothers knock on my door while me and my LA friend are in there. My friend opens the door without checking who it was and they push him out the way, run up on me and start jumping me. I just had to cover up.

My so called good friend just stands there in shock while I’m getting my face kicked in and I yelled his name and he tries to do something and gets shoved out the way and maybe punched in the face, don’t recall. It all happened super quick. 

Fast forward 7 years and I move to LA and we rekindle our friendship. What’s crazy is I forgot about that part of the story (that he didn’t have my back). He brings it up after we hang out a few times and formally apologizes. Said he grew up super soft, had never been in a fight before and if he could do it all over It would be different. I forgave him and said don’t worry brotha, I know you have love for me, etc. 

Sometimes I think gosh, my moral principles would objectively say fuck this guy. Same time he feels really bad about it to bring it up 7 years later and I believe humans are complex and we all have interactions we wish we could have back. It does amaze me tho he wouldn’t have the instinct to jump in physically.

Would you still consider this person a good friend or one at all after this?",28Dec2020,1
930,"I'm sick of college. It's so stressful and tiresome, it saps all of my energy and now I think I've become lazy. I've been sick of it for quite a while now but recently I've just had enough. I take maths, computer science and economics. I don't mind maths, computer science is ok but I dread economics. I haven't listened to a single lesson. I don't know how I'm surviving in it. I regret taking it as a subject and I'm falling far behind. I try to learn but I just can't. I hate the subject.

I've been thinking a lot about giving up with school. Or at least with economics. I don't want to force myself to learn something I dread. However, I fear that I won't be able to progress in life and enter a university with the grades I would get if i quit. It's too late to change subjects or drop it. Even if I manage to get good grades for maths and computer science, my Economics grade is going to drag me down.

I'm just sick of the education system right now. But I know my parents would very much want me to stay in education, finish college, get into a good uni and then finish uni.

I've been doing something else - I have my interests in music right now. I'm really interested in it and I love that particular subject and craft. I watch tutorials, read and study the theory and practice the production of music. I've been studying and practicing it more than my school subjects. I love the art. However, I fear that I can't make a living with that. I would need a job. And to get a job, I'm guessing I need those grades, qualifications, a degree and whatnot.

What should I do? I know the answer would probably be to hold on and try to finish college with decent grades, maybe drop music and focus on studying. But I hate studying, especially economics, for something I'm not interested in. I want to give this music thing a proper shot. I don't even know what I want to do with my grades or degree (as in, i have no aspirations with them, I just want a job that will pay me enough to get by). Dropping music and just forcing myself to study would probably be the logical option. But I finally have something I'm passionate in and a dream I want to take a risk for. I don't know.

935,"So the other day I had made plans with my friend to go thrift shopping in a suburb about a 45-50 min transit from us.  We were to meet at 2 pm originally but she asked if we could push it back to 3 cause she had some stuff to do for her mom.  I was completely okay with that. At 2:05 I leave my house and I’m on my way to the destination. At around 2:32 pm I’m about to get onto the bus that will drop me off at the thrift store when I get a text from my friend advising her mom needs her to do a few more things so she’ll be late.  My friend and I are usually late people but if I’m 10 mins late shes 30.  At this point I wasn’t mad or anything like that I just told her I was gonna be there early (showed up at 2:45) and so I would start looking around.  So I’m doing some thrifting thoroughly looking through different sections to kill time. At around 3:21 I text her to see if she’s on the way, in which, she replied should be there in 30 mins.  I was a little tilted at that point because idk how much more time I can kill without looking through the entire store.  I was also concerned cause she had an appointment at 5pm in a different city, so I didn’t want her to be late for that either. I also wanted to leave before the sunsets because I have to walk through a sketchy area to get to/from the thrift store.  She offered to buy me some food to make up for being late but I already ate before leaving my house so I was still kinda stuffed. At around 3:58pm I still haven’t heard from her and at this point I was just frustrated. I texted her I was getting kinda tired and was gonna leave the store soon. She texted me back saying she was gonna be another 15 mins and she was sorry. I was kinda frustrated that she was gonna be more than an hour late on me, so I purchased my items and left the store. Of course I told her I left the store so she wouldn’t go there and see I already left. I walked to the bus stop and as I got on the bus I saw my friend, so I went and sat beside her. She apologized and didn’t mean to be late but her mom wanted her to do a lot before she could leave the house. I tried to communicate that I wasn’t mad her mom needed help. I was mad because she could’ve texted me before I left the house to push back the time or cancel all together. She was being super kind to me but I was just in a bad mood and not being my usual responsive self. We got to the station took the train together one stop, hugged and parted ways.

937,"I need some advice on how to move out of my parents house since I'm now able to as I am 18 and need some advice on what types of decent paying (around $50-70k a year) and interesting jobs I could get to support my new independent life.

Hello all. I just turned 18 a few days ago and have really been reflecting about my soon to be future and have been thinking about life in general. I don't have a plan at all and am always stuck thinking about a bunch of ideas or things I could do but ultimately just brush off for later or as something I might do.  

Right now I'm a senior in highschool and just need to finish the rest of the year to graduate with my diploma and I have all my credits and such so I'm fine high school wise. However, ever since I started 9th grade, I've been really tired and done with and bored of living with my parents. My parents have always been very strict and don't let me go outside the house or with my friends (only very rarely), won't let me get a job (so I would be able to save up money to move out and not be stuck at home all day being useless), and they keep me stuck at home all day doing chores for them. I'm fine with the chores and all as I'm thankful and grateful for the house and good life and love I'm provided with, but I'm just tired of living in this house for 18 years of my life and just want to move out and move on independently with my life and obviously visit my parents every once in a while and help them out and say hello and such. Also, my parents are very kind and loving people when they aren't being worried, helicopter parents. I also get along with both my brothers and grandma quite well. I don't hate anyone in my family, I'm not a hateful person, but when I meet a person that is toxic or hateful to me, I just tend to avoid and never speak to them much and not argue.

Also, I want nothing to do with college. I'm a very relaxed and chill person, but when it comes to school and all the work I'm bombarded with, I turn into an angry, pissed off mess. I've hated all 4 years of high school because the work was always boring, the constant and hard homework I received daily was absolutely useless stuff to learn about, and it all felt like a waste of my precious time. The only thing I liked about high school was my amazing, loving, funny, and supporting friend group, and I have a very close friend I could really trust as well and could rely if I'm in a tough situation. Anyways, I feel and know very much that college would also be the same experience and a similar stressful environment and situation like high school to me all over again. Although I consider myself a fast learner and intelligent person, I hate the part about school that makes me do useless and so much extra busywork after I get back home from school when all I want to do is relax after a hard long day of learning at school and my brain is pooped. I know that won't happen with whatever job I get, no extra work to bring home. Also, I don't want student loan debt and don't want to waste 4 years getting a degree I might not even want after 4 years of college, it would be a waste of time for me. I just don't want to risk getting a degree in college and being forced to find a job of that degree which I might not even find or will be bad or I might not like at all because I tend to change my mind a lot and that doesn't go well with college and my money situation as I would have to fully pay for college myself. I'm not lazy and will do whatever it takes to get a good job and interesting career ultimately that won't require college. I just despise the busywork I would have to do in college when I'm fully capable of teaching myself things on the internet or from getting taught how to do things such as getting work experience from the job I want or internships.


TLDR: 

I just really need some advice on if moving out of my parents house is a good idea especially since I live in California which is quite an expensive to live in. Because I really believe it is a good decision personally as I really want to move on with my life and have a place of my own and live my life out however and whenever I want without my parents telling me how to live anymore. And I need advice on what types of decent paying (50-70k a year) and fun interesting jobs I could find without a college degree.

My family has been trying to get him to lead a healthier life for a while now, and he’s certainly improved since he was diagnosed with pre-diabetes a year or two ago, but he still maintains bad habits. He refuses to eat more healthily than he does now, and when we remind him that food X is unhealthy, he tells us to stop “micromanaging” and ignores our suggestions to eat something better. And then of course there’s the smoking, which is a more difficult issue to deal with since it’s an addiction.

How am I supposed to get him to practice healthier behavior when doing so just makes him angry and more likely to do the opposite? As per the smoking issue, I know that telling someone to quit often just makes them less likely to do so, but he’s been smoking his whole life practically - he’s not gonna quit on his own.

I can either contact my ex’s mum about his behaviour, or I can not contact her and try to get this to stop myself. 

My long distance ex’s mum is a very sweet lady. I met her once while I was on a video call with my ex, and we chatted for a bit.

I dated her son for around a month before I broke up with him. He was abusive, toxic, manipulative, and would often guilt trip me. After we broke up, this is when he started to show me how nasty he could be. 

He’s been harassing me on my social media accounts (namely Instagram and Tellonym). He has been calling me names, coming up with lies about me, accusing me of doing things I’ve never done, etc. I have blocked him numerous times, but he’s come back with more accounts. 

His behaviour is completely unacceptable, and is taking a toll on my mental health. But he doesn’t see it that way. He doesn’t see that he’s lying, being rude, and hurting someone. He thinks what he’s doing is okay. And I don’t think he’s going to stop. 

I’ve been thinking of wether or not to tell his mum. I would just tell her that her son is doing stuff that isn’t okay (I would send her photos of what he’s doing) and then ask her if she can have a talk with him. 

However, she already has a lot on her plate. I don’t want to burden her with this. And I’m afraid that if I tell her, he will snap and just keep on harassing me.

948,"I lost my most recent job on December 2nd due to low sales from the pandemic. It was a dream job: in my field, great commission availability, work from home on my own time, it was great. But the company ran out of money and has temporarily shuttered, no clue for how long.

To try and make it, I took a job at a local warehouse - one of the only jobs available, and the first to call me back. Pay isn't as good, but at 40 hours, should cover my bills and expenses. The problem is, I've been at a desk job for a loooong time. My body is soft and weak. I knew that starting a physical job would be difficult, and I was worried my body wouldn't handle it. I have some medical conditions - nothing severe enough to warrant special accommodation, but severe enough to cause me difficulty breathing under duress even when I'm not overweight. 

Today was my first full day. I vomited 8 times, 4 times at work, and gagged all day. Just after lunch, my lower back and my knees gave out. I know how to lift correctly; I worked on a farm for years, and had some other physical jobs, so I know the right way to lift and such. And I wasn't lifting heavy boxes either. Buy my back and knees gave out anyway; I could not bend or squat at all shortly after lunch. Trying to do so would cause those parts of my body to lock up and/or cause unbearable pain, and also caused me to get lightheaded and nearly, or actually in one case, pass out. Luckily when I did pass out my trainer was gone, and I didn't hurt myself - I fell on a sturdy box and knocked my glasses off, that's it. I don't know how long I was out, but I came to and was... Well, not okay, but that wasn't due to the faint. 

When I walked to clock out, my back hurt so unbearably much I couldn't actually breathe. I was taking these rapid, tiny breaths, like I was hyperventilating, because there was nowhere to sit down and I had to get to my car. Twenty minutes sitting in my car with the heated seat on and I still couldn't breathe; being very lightheaded and probably dehydrated, I called my mom and tried to drive home, all while gasping for air. Halfway home I pulled into a Walmart gas station parking lot. Next thing I remember my mom is screaming at me to wake up; apparently I did pass out as soon as I parked. I managed to stumble inside and get a Gatorade, drank it, and just sat in the car for a while. I told my mom I thought I had to quit, or the job would literally kill me.

Thing is, today was an easy day. I'm in training. The boxes were light and small. It's slow right now. And my trainer literally told me there is no way I'm going to be able to keep up; she has been doing this for 30 years, and said that people who adapt have a place to start from. She said I don't have that, and said I should not be there at all. 

Now, if I quit, I'll have until January 15th to have income again. If I don't have it by then, well, I don't have enough money to make it to the end of January. There are other jobs around here; they may not pay as well, and it's a struggle, but they do exist. If I do lose everything, I can move in with my mom; not optimal, but it is an option. I'm worried that if I stay, either my body will straight up die from the strain, or I will kill myself from the pain - I have a history of suicidal thoughts and even failed attempts, so it's not impossible, even though I'd rather live nowadays. 

So what do I do? The job is going to destroy or kill me, but without it, my continued independence is a coin flip. I can't get unemployment if I quit. I know the simple answer is to stay, but... I do not think I'm physically capable of surviving. Help.",28Dec2020,1

950,"So for context I'm an introvert I usually do really well on my own but lately, none of my friends are texting me and I can't meet up with them because covid. I got through my countries full lockdown relatively fine, but recently outside of school none of my friends have time for me even for socially distanced activities. One of my friends got a boyfriend and hasn't really spoken to me since. Another has basically replaced me with other friends, and my school friends don't really want to hang out with me anymore. And more recently unless I purposefully start a conversation nobody bothers texting me anymore. I think this is the first time I have been genuinely lonely in a long time. My only real company has been my dog. I know how sad that sounds but its true.

I am someone who doesn't have high confidence, isn't very social etc but one things that lifts up my spirits and confidence in everything, is doing small care things. Taking care of my appearence, clothimg, fixing hair, eating well, working out etc. I have come to the conclusion that, to live a good life, you need the base of self care. You can't build something good without it. It is not the end of all your problems. It certainly has not been for me, but ironically it is a step that is often ignored because of how obvious it is. 

Just wanted to share this. I hope everyone who is struggling with self-esteem and social skills notices this. I am not writing any of this from a higher place. I'm at the same level, but i feel like it's kind of pulling me out slowly. Good luck everyone, and live good lives",28Dec2020,1

958,"Hey I’m not sure if this is the right place for this but since lockdown I’ve noticed I don’t feel ‘myself’ kindof I don’t want to see a doctor or therapist because they’ll think I’m being stupid or something idk. I have already been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD so if there is an overlap of symptoms ignore them but I’ve felt;
A complete lack of empathy for others 
Purposely manipulating others 
Feeling much superior to others 
Persistent thoughts of killing( I will 100% not act on so don’t report or anything  but they’re  there if that makes sense )
I’ve always thought that ghosts / Satan have a particular interest in me and are always watching me but recently have had 1-way convos with them  in my head 
Periods of feeling like things are touching me like bugs and crawling all over me 
Social withdrawal 
There may be other ‘symptoms’ that I haven’t been aware of but these are what comes to mind are these relatively normal or is it an issue?

959,"I’m in a relationship with the most amazing soul in the universe and she gives and gives and gives absolutely everything to me all the time. I however always find a reason to be angry and annoyed with her and everyone.

I have big mummy issues and trust issues as no one wanted me around when I was a kid so I’ve always just rejected any kind of love anyone tried to give me. 

It hurts and it’s scary how much of a dick I am. I just constantly find a reason to moan and be miserable with whatever amazing, kind, loving thing she does for me. 

My mind is so toxic and constantly full of negative thoughts and I am trying to shut them down and force myself to think more positively. I’ve made progress with the way I think but my progress is slow in the way I express myself. It’s not enough. 

I’m sad and miserable all the time when I have no reason to be! Yet I still find it so difficult to love and let love. I just can’t believe the way I’ve been acting and how badly I have fucked this relationship up because of my refusal to be happy. 

I want to be happy. I know I can work harder. I need something to click in my brain but it just isn’t clicking!! I feel dead and I’ve felt it for a long time. My mood hasn’t changed in so long and I miss genuine happiness. I’ve wasted so much time and now I’m wasting others time and love.

I just want to be happy. Please help.

960,"What is the best way to not be that toxic person in a relationship?  I know recognizing you are one is always a good start but what can you honestly do to push yourself, break bad habits and change so you can not only better yourself but make amends with those you’ve hurt by being this way.  I am at a point where I’ve hurt someone I’ve cared about deeply. This isn’t the first time it has happened, as I’ve had a similar situation happen in the past. The difference here is that I made amends with the person in the past and we are best friends again. 

It’s hard to fix what is broken, even I can recognize that. But I truly do want to change for the better so I can not be the same person. This person who leaves a trail of destruction in their wake.

I assume I have to find a homeless shelter otherwise I’ll be on the street. But I’ve heard most shelters aren’t taking in any more people, or they’re full. Another problem is i don’t think I can go to a shelter in my current state, since I moved to a different state last year and never updated my ID. How am I supposed to get to a completely different state with no money.

Also I don’t know what to do with all my stuff. It’s everything I own, including all the stuff I saved from my childhood, plus my important documents like social security card, etc. 

I’m just really pissed I have to Literally throw my life away because I got fucked over by unemployment. I would’ve tried harder to find another job if they didn’t tell me to just wait for a little more and it’ll be accepted again. I’m never gonna forgive myself for this.

Hey everyone,

I know this sounds stupid but I could use help from people as I don't know how to start a simple diet to lose weight. I know what has caused this weight issue and honestly I'm ashamed for it as I know I should look after my body.

I know the issue comes from my past as my mom used to be verbally abusive to me (moved away from her as soon as I turned 16) after her divorce to my father. I guess due to the stress for a 5 year old I started eating a lot and put on the weight. I'm a fairly chubby girl and I hate that.

I don't want to look and feel better for the guy I'm with (he doesn't bother what I look like he loves me for who I am) I want to feel better for myself. During lockdown is when everything started to go nuts and now the weight has just piled up so I have no idea how to lose it.

Initially I bought weights to help out but I know I need to do more to remove this weight. Right now I do have a weight goal of 60Kgs and my current weight is 82.5Kgs. I know it may not be much but I can't stand these dough-like bits of skin hanging off me anymore and need to get rid of them.

I know this might be a strange request coming off a total stranger but please can you help me with a bit of advice.

Enjoy the new year everyone!",28Dec2020,1
