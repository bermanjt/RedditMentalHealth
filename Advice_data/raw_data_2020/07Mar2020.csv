0,"3 years ago i started having these tics and facial movements they were not as much as i have today and i didn't get them in public or when I'm around people and was able to control them so i didn't care that much about it

 then until 3 months ago these tics started to increase gradually and i started to lose control over them also started to appear in public 

which brings us to today so This just happened today as i was scrolling through Facebook and came across a post about Billie eilish and her having tourette syndrome which i had no idea what it was at the time reading the post

 i have been a billie eilish fan since i first listened to her music but this was the first time i read about tourette i knew she had a syndrome but i didn't knew it's name or what it did

so i went to Google to try and understand what tourette is and i read that it was tics and irrational movements in your facial expression so i stop there for a sec to think about it and i was like nah it can't be the same thing That's happening to me

 but then  i decide to search on Youtube ""Billie eilish Tourette syndrome"" to see if it was the same thing

 so i find  the video i click on it i start watching and 10 secs into the video i start tearing up and crying as i realise that what i was having for the past 3 years was tourette syndrome 

I felt scared because i also read that tourette is untreatable

Our tics where pretty much the same at some point she even tried to play it off by pretending she is trying to get rid of a fly which is the same thing i do whenever the tics happen to me in public 

This is the first time i talk about this, none of my family members or close friends know about it
The reason I posted this here is i need help making tourette stop or at least get my control back  i want to stop having these tics before it escalates even more

Thx for reading

9,"I filed my taxes independently in June without an accountant nor TurboTax nor 1040.com. My dad helped me and we had copies and took pics but we no longer have them. My low-income apartment told me in late January to give them a copy of my 2018 tax return in addition to W-2s, with 3 days notice and then some extensions. I did not previously know that they would require it. Unable to contact IRS, as there are no humans at any extension or 0 and I am on hold for at least twenty-five minutes or they automatically hang up, and they do not reply to texts nor emails.

Unable to get student loan account # from FAFSA, FSA.ed.gov, nor my university financial aid office, and award letter # is apparently not it. I went to the local IRS office and took a pic a sign with another phone # in case. They said I should have an appointment but understood my inability to contact them, so they printed me a copy of my 2018 tax return within five minutes after I said that I need it. I took a pic in case. Now, my apartment gave me a letter saying that they are increasing my rent on 1 April for non-compliance, and my land lady said that I handed her a ‚Äútax transcript‚Äù which is not the same as a copy of my tax return.üò´ What should I do?

11,"My paternal grandmother is someone who isn't loving or someone who shows care. She actually lives in my childhood home with my parents and my maternal grandmother. One day when I was leaving home to go back to college, I was putting my things into my car. I had a decent amount of things so I was constantly in and out of the house. I remember placing my favorite jacket by the door because I planned on wearing it out. This jacket was completely unforgettable because it had a giant logo in the right breast pocket. Long story short, the jacket ends up missing and I'm just thinking that I must have placed it in the car or something. I get to college and I can't find my jacket. I ask my parents to look for it and they're saying I didn't leave a jacket at their house.

About 2 years later, one of my cousins who live in a third world country adds me on Facebook. I scroll through his pictures and there it is. He's wearing my favorite jacket. Probably a coincidence right? I messaged him complimenting his jacket and how I used to have one just like that. He said that our paternal grandmother gave it to him last time she was visiting. 

So I showed the picture to my parents and they didn't really do much. They just thought pure coincidence. So I shrugged it off and it was just a jacket right? The next time I see my grandma, I ask her if there's anything I can do to help my family members that's in the third world country, please let me know. I wouldn't mind giving them some money or some clothes or something of that nature. She told me there's nothing I can do.

As time went by, more things started missing. Some clothes, random bathroom supplies such as toothpaste, and other small things. However lately, bigger and more expensive things have gone missing. Jewelry, designer bags, etc. 

It started getting on my nerves, but last weekend felt like the last straw for me. My maternal grandmother has started to live with my parents and she's the sweetest old lady who is constantly praying for everyone's happiness. Last weekend, my maternal grandmother told me half of her rosaries are missing. I immediately knew it was my paternal grandmother who took it. So, I snuck around her room when she wasn't around and found a few of the rosaries. 

Now, with this proof that she's actually stealing. I have no idea what to do? Do I confront her about it? I tried going to my parents but for some reason they don't want to discuss it further. I'm afraid if I go and confront her, she's going to steal more things but because I don't live with my parents, she won't care.


TLDR: Grandmother is stealing from family and giving it to other family members in a third world country. Her kids are quiet about it but I want to say something. What should I do?",07Mar2020,1

I thought its just nothing and brushed it off but then after be put his hand on my face. yes, that hand.. I smelled something I can definitely describe as ""ass"" so I just felt like yeah that's definitely what's going on but I'm still doubting it. I said a few minutes later his fingers smelled stinky and he smelled them and said ""I don't smell anything"" said they smelled like butt and he insisted they didn't even though I smelled 3 times.. and I was sure.. how the hell do i bring this up without him getting so defensive? why is he hiding it from me? why else would his hand be down there and under himself? or him being in such an odd position?

18,"Ok. For a little history, I met this girl 4 years ago. I had just started watching supernatural and someone told me she liked it so i went in and yelled her name in her classroom. When she said it was her I marched over and said ""Supernatural?"" And thus started our friendship.

We hung out almost every day for a year or so and became best friends. Eventually I made a new friend and she got really jealous and even went as far to make transphobic comments about my new friend. The second she said those things I told her we were done and didnt talk to her for a year. 

We met at the bus stop and thus the friendship started again. She said she had changed and apologised to both me and my other friend. 

For the last 2 years we've been pretty close again.
But the thing is that she has never put any effort into the friendship. I always have to be the one to make plans or text her first. A lot of the time she wont reply until it's too late to do the plans I suggest, not only that but she openly brags about reading my messages from the notification bar and ignoring them. Any time I bring it up she gets mad at me and yells at me saying she has social anxiety. 

The thing about me is that I have almost crippling depression and anxiety. To the point where I cant go to school 4 days out of 5. She constantly throws that in my face saying I'm never there and I'm the one not putting effort in. 

The reason I'm making this post now is because yesterday we made plans to go to town today after school. I was going to make myself go in for her. Only she said she was sick and wasnt going in today. After school had ended today she texted me about something a teacher said. 

This is word for word the conversation we had:

Her: Mr ___ said the school might close because of corona virus.

Me: I thought you weren't going in today???

Her: What makes you think that?

Me: Because you said we weren't??

Her: Oh yeah I only said that because I didn't want you to and i didnt want to do our plans incase i was actually sick.

     (I took a page out of her book and read the message from the notification bar)

Her, an hour later: Are you seriously mad i told you i wasnt going in today.

To me it sounds like she's openly admitting to lying so she wouldn't have to see me. Is this toxic??? Should I try talk to her about this??? It makes me very nervous because she was the only person that was my friend and I love her family so much. She has bad anger issues and I'm scared she'll blow up on me. Any help is appreciated.

I tend to put myself down with funny stories which definitely get laughs but ultimately make me look like an idiot or an asshole. I think I'm a little too self depreciating as I was bullied alot by my family when I was growing up and it sort stuck with me and made me feel like I'm a walking failure so I dont mind putting myself down. I was always, and sometimes violently/abusively, asked to put my families comfort above my own self worth so I still really have no sense of intrinsic value as a late 20s man.

Generally when people even ask me what I do I kind of distance my job/abilities from my own competency and act like I sort of just...bumbled my way into it. I have a pretty serious job and I also have alot of side talents/passions that I work hard at but I can't bring myself to sell my talents. 

I almost blew a huge oppurtunity this weekend when I was hanging out with some well connected people and a guy who could blow the doors open to success for me in a field I'm passionate about asked me what I do and my friend told him I do ""thing that I love"" and I immediately said ""no I dont"" and he said ""SHUT THE FUCK UP YOURE GOOD AT *thing I love doing*"".

Before this we lived in a much smaller place and as grandma didn't need any furniture in the nursing home we were left with all of the furniture and stuff that none of her children wanted (tables, chairs, pots, plants, curtains, cleaning products, lamps, you name it). The result is that I feel like we have everything that we could possibly need, but much of it doesn't feel like it's our own. But at the same time it feels like a waste to replace perfectly functional stuff, like our table feels like grandma's table but it seems like a waste to replace a good quality old table with something from Ikea... I also feel hesitant to throw out things I don't want (for example we have a ton of vases now that we don't use) because I guess I feel like it would be disrespectful because it doesn't really feel like they are ours.

36,"Male, 22

About four years ago I moved from my hometown to another city for studies at a university, and after three dedicated years I finally graduated last spring (2019) as a structural engineer. 

During my time at university away from my hometown, I really thrived and grew quite deep rootes. I met new people, made many new and close friends and found interests and commitments that really meant much to me. All and all I really loved the town itself and I felt really happy.

However, once graduation started closing in, I struggled getting a job relevant to my education and passion. I applied every company that existed (it isn't the biggest of cities) but couldn't get what I wanted. So I expanded my application to other citys, including my hometown, and there I got a bite from a great firm doing exactly what I wanted to fill my career with. They had several employees with long and established experience that I could learn a lot from. A dream job. 

After realizing I wasn't gonna get a job in the same city as my university, I signed for the firm in my hometown and moved back home. 

During my interviews with the company's manager, who me and my parents know well since young age (Yes, I had contacts as an advantage), we talked about the importance of me not suddenly quitting if I got a job offer in the city I just moved back from. This was because of the time, resources and money the company in my hometown would spend to teach me the profession in the long run for their own growth.

I agreed and convinced the manager that I was ready to stay in my hometown for a long period of time (a couple of years atleast) and then I signed the employment papers. This meant that I basically left everything I loved in the city I did my studies in during three years and moved back home.

The first month was tough, both with the new job and adapting to coming home again. Then it slowly felt better and better. I refound old friends and relationships and also made some new friends. I also felt more and more comfortable in my new job, both with colleagues and the work itself, but I didn't have the possibility to exercise my main interests and commitments that I had in my last city, and it didn't really feel the same. This was the start of me changing my mind about my job.

Despite moving back to my hometown I still visited my former city and everything I left there quite frequently (they aren't superfar apart). During this time I started missing everything so much, my friends, my interests and the town itself. In all this I also got a girlfriend there who I had been close friends with earlier, and she has a very long time left with her studies in that city. So currently we have a long distance relationship which tears on me.

Most of the people I currently hang out with in my hometown is now also talking about moving to other cities for studies, work etc. and I really feel like living in my hometown anymore. I often feel anxiety about how much I want to be in the city I went to university and I sort of fear being left alone here in my hometown.

Now yesterday I got a call from a structural engineering company in the city I miss so much. I had written my masters thesis for this company but didn't get a job because of their lack of projects at that moment. 

This time though the manager of this firm called me and claimed that they have grown since last year and now have much more work/projects falling into their hands, making them want to expand and employ. Knowing my situation he asked if I was interested in joining them in this journey.

I was quite chocked from this actually happening and I said that I was interrested. He proposed that we could meet over a weekend when i'm visiting the city and talk about the job and what it would mean for me.

Now i'm standing in this dilemma and is unsure on what to do. I really miss and want to go back to my old city for the job and everything else I love there, but at the same time I would feel really bad over leaving the firm I work for now and i'm afraid of creating discord between me and my manager (who I also know in person) as well as my colleagues who spent time, resources and energy to teach me the profession. I have only been there for about six months at the moment..

At the same time i'm 100 % sure that I would regret and dwell if this opportunity would be lost. 

I really feel like I could use some input on what decision to make here. It feels like a very difficult and big decision to make.

I am worried because I feel that if I don't help my father who is financially bleeding then he won't be able to support himself but in a way it's also his fault because he refuses to cooperate with me.

My mother on the other hand has a completely different issue. Her parents (my grandparents) have alzheimers and one of her sisters (my aunt) decided to take advantage of this by convincing them to make her son (my cousin) power of attorney. Because they have alzheimers, they agree to do it and because we don't live near them and the evil sister does, we can't do anything about it.
After this my aunt and cousin now have full control of their finances. They are joint owners of all the bank accounts, they use their credit cards, the statement are all paperless so the grandparents can't see what they buy. They also withdraw thousands of dollars a day from the bank accounts and put it in their own bank accounts.

One of the biggest reasons I decided not to go to college was to help my parents move to a different house but all of a sudden they don't want to move now. They tell me at the last minute that they don't want to move after all the stuff I packed for them. I want to be an accountant but I am just so depressed from all the problems that I am facing with my family. Nobody wants to help me and everyone is against me. Sometimes I think about just ignoring my family and going to university but I also feel that I need to help them.",07Mar2020,1

I am introverted. I have a demanding job that takes a lot of my energy, and the very, very last thing I want to do in my free time is do small talk with strangers or acquaintances. It‚Äôs absolutely draining for me to have to listen to people, especially when they talk incessantly. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. Most people have been able to tell from my body language that I want to be left alone, but there are those folks who are adamant to chat no matter the fuck what. 

Particularly, there is a guy who comes to the office a couple times a week who has this outgoing, gregarious personality, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him, but it doesn‚Äôt mesh well with me. I have a highly technical job that requires a lot of concentration and focus, and when I arrive at work, I really need that time to get prepared and organized for the day. It‚Äôs not negotiable. 

This man cannot or will not take a hint that I am absolutely not interested in having a conversation with him, beyond the normal pleasantries. No matter how many times I flat out ignore him, he‚Äôll pepper me with questions the second he sees me. ‚ÄúWhat are you up to this weekend? Should I be jealous? How many hours are you at this week?‚Äù All I want to do is get my things set up in peace, and he will not leave me alone. 

This has happened repeatedly. The other day, he came into my office to say hi and actually trapped me there and wouldn‚Äôt stop talking even though I wasn‚Äôt making any eye contact and making comments that I was feeling exhausted, desperately hoping he would finally take a hint and go away. 

I had to leave and go into the women‚Äôs restroom because this man just would not stop talking and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone. He was gone when I came out, and I actually went and spoke to someone about it. I‚Äôve had enough. 

But I wanted to tell him, ‚ÄúLEAVE ME ALONE. I don‚Äôt want to talk. GO AWAY.‚Äù I honestly can‚Äôt believe he hasn‚Äôt taken a hint yet because every other person who‚Äôs tried and tried to talk to me hasn‚Äôt been this continually in my face when I‚Äôve ignored them. They go away eventually.

In public, it‚Äôs gotten better because I have headphones in and completely ignore everyone, but I can‚Äôt just stuff headphones in at work or if my dad‚Äôs friend is talking my ear off, and I can‚Äôt be a hermit. 

And to be clear, I have a normal social life, and I can converse with people. It‚Äôs not like I completely shut down anyone who tries to talk to me. I just don‚Äôt have the time or energy to be social at work, and I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to stop and talk to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who wants to chat about my shoes or my bag or about the weather or about their dog.

I got back together with my ex in January after I broke up with her last July because I wasn‚Äôt happy. 

When I broke up with her, she was threatening to kill herself if I left her. I tried to calm her down for a couple hours and then she had to bring her child to her parents and she expected me to be home still but I left with everything. She blew up my phone that night, to try and manipulate me to come back and talk to her and she kept saying she was going to harm herself. I didn‚Äôt respond at all because I felt it was the right thing to do to just cut off all communication.

After some time, I was willing to try things again but that was when i found out that she was talking to her ex most of the time when we were together and I caught her sleeping with her personal trainer when we were ‚Äúworking on getting back together‚Äù. I completely cut off communication after that, other than work because we work together. 

We ended up talking again in late December and I got back together with her and I‚Äôm back to square one, I‚Äôm not happy again. There‚Äôs more details to her madness, but I was looking to see how you guys would suggest i handle this.

I feel like I should take my things and leave when she‚Äôs not home and explain to her why through text message. I feel like she‚Äôs going to make those same threats again. Should I do that and then text her after? And block her or leave her unblocked in case she says anything crazy? I just really don‚Äôt want her to harm herself.

I have been abroad in South America now for about two months. It has been super fun. Also, I (F20) have never been with anyone in my life. yayyyyyyy.

Anyways, I was out at the bars this past Saturday and at some point I ended up with this group of locals. I started dancing with this guy and we had a great time. He gave me his number and we have been messaging and met up once. Just to ride around town on his motorcycle as I had class the next day.

The thing is, he is 33. He definitely doesn't look 33 but he showed me his ID and it said his dob was in 1986. I would have guessed 25 max.

But like, it's free attention. so I hit him up again today kinda knowing that the conversation was going to head to ""are we doing this or not?"". And he wasn't that upfront about it but he is suggesting it but also saying like ""no pressure! only if you want"". And like, I am just kinda over being a virgin? but also I am a bit apprehensive about my first experience being with someone that much older than I am?

57,"I'm absolutely sick to my stomach with anxiety and have no idea what else to do. 

My brother has kept to himself for over a year now, just staying in his room mostly (we live with our mother). In the past, he went to the doctor after a breakdown in college years ago, but seemed to get better over time. He hasn't been ""normal"" as he talks to himself in his room and mentions events that couldn't have happened/are impossible.

Well, today he went from about a 15 to 100 when he suddenly came into my room and slammed the door behind him. He ask what the fuck was with all the brainwashing and hypnosis I supposedly have been using on him for years now. He believes he was a multi-billionaire, a producer at a very important movie studio, a charismatic sex magnet who attracted A-List celebrities and models to our house for constant parties (we're broke as a joke), that he was a genius inventor (which is supposedly how he got his billions) AND that he had supernatural abilities.

He truly believes that, and that I somehow took it all away from him. He believes that I tried to make him kill himself. He believes it's because I'm Jealous, spiteful, and gay (I'm neither of those things). Whenever I tried to rebuttal with logic, or consideration, he got **angrier** and mentioned that he could beat the fuck out of me right now. I asked what does he want from me, and he wants to me to admit he was right, tell him why, and make up for it (presumably by giving back everything he believes I stole, including powers and billions of dollars that don't exist).

He went back into his room after a lot of screaming and threats. I immediately backed a bookbag and separate bag with essentials, texted (not called) a friend to pick me up, and quietly (quickly) left. I'm currently staying with a friend and his SO for the night. I have been unemployed (mostly due to a lack of jobs and severe depression) for over a year now and have no money or car. I don't think I can stay with my friend for much longer either.

I haven't called my mom yet, which I'll have to do soon, but she lives paycheck to paycheck and just bought the home we stay at. I don't think he'd hurt her, but not being sure makes me hesitant on how to act going forward. I called her and told her the gist, and she put on a strong voice and said to just stay there for now and that we'd figure things out tomorrow, even though I can tell it broke her heart absolutely. After hanging up, I was completely overwhelmed and cried for the first time in 16 years.

I don't think the police can help (especially in my city), as I don't have any evidence and my brother is smart knows how to act perfectly normal. This is also why I know he'd never agree to being institutionalized or taking medication and if he was forced, he'd probably act like a model patient and be released immediately. He's had small moments here and there of weirdness, but he's **never** gone anywhere this far or been this scary. And I'm mostly worried about some form of retaliation towards me for anything I might think of(like a restraining order, potentially getting my mom to kick him out, or go to the doctor) or anything he believes. 

So the best thing I can think of for now and going forward is to stay away. I've got nothing to my name, no real money (about $70), no job, no car, and soon, no place to go.

So, any advice?",07Mar2020,1
58,"OK so there's a little bit of back story here. I'm currently in my first year of college. I'm loving it so far; my course is great (people and content), I've settled into my accommodation, I've opened up a good deal, I've made friends, I've had fun, and I've  even managed to do well in my exams so far (knock on wood). It is a little different than I thought it'd be but really only for the better.
Really only bar one bit; the confession posts. Like some other colleges and universities ours has an online confession page where students can essentially thirst post anonymously. It's usually pretty tame and not altogether that interesting. Our course kind of ruined it though. To put this into perspective we're a tiny group (40ish in a year of 3000), but starting after Christmas it seemed like nearly every second post was related to us. It just continued and continued, with much interest and jeering from those courses adjacent to us, until our class rep essentially told us to cop the fuck on. By then there was basically a post for every one of us (I think there was over 30 in total by someone's count. There are courses nearly ten times bigger than us that have maybe a third of that. It's insane). It seemed then that we'd reached our senses. There were a few more posts commenting about the sheer number from our course but that was pretty much it. That was until this morning, when this one was in the most recent batch:
To the boy with the big cute birthmark on his face- sorry for staring, it was cause you‚Äôre so damn cute
I have no clue what to make of it. I've a very distinct birthmark on my right cheek, stretching from a bit above my hairline to my upper lip (it's the same type Gorbachev has). I don't know anyone else with one, and it seems pretty reasonable to assume, considering prior horniness, that someone in my course wrote it about me.
As far as I can see there's three possibilities:
1. It's a joke:
Perfectly alright with me. No bother as long as I know it is. 
2. My crush wrote it:
Obviously preferable though I can't be sure. 
3. The horniest man I've ever met wrote it:
No offense to him, but I'm het to a flaw.
In favour of 1 you have the fact that there's been a few joke posts before. Against it is the fact that it's not funny, it isn't worded like a joke, and it doesn't mention our course by name like the majority of the previous ones have. 
In favour of 2 is the fact that I caught my crush looking at me last Friday. Against it is the fact that we barely talk and that she's given very little indication of liking me. In favour again is the fact that she's very shy. 
In favour of 3 is the fact that I've caught said horndog staring at me before. Against that is the fact that that was ages ago, that I've explained that I'm not gay to my course at length (very long story), and that he made an extensive reply to our class rep's telling us to cop on agreeing with her talking about unhealthy it is to make these posts. He's also been direct enough to ask out two people on the course already. In favour is the fact that he almost definitely wrote a number of the confession posts.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 17-year-old junior in high school, and basically I want the hell out of this house. I have gotten to the point where I resent both of my parents (they are just both full of shit), and it's just an environment that I want out of. This isn't life. This isn't life at all. Let me tell you about my life, then I will tell you the plan I have made up.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bullshit:

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and step father's marriage is dysfunctional. My father has this weird thought process that his outdated view on how the world works is the only way to do things (literally is very sexist to women, and is the type to say ""suck it up"" to men). That already is a few red flags. He is also the type of person who can never be wrong, or else its a huge deal, and even when he has to be carried away from the police after almost shooting my mother in the head (actually happened), after an argument got really intense, he can still make it seems like he's the victim. ""Officier, I didn't do anything wrong"", he also told me after the entire matter that I ""messed up his chances in the music industry"", after I looked through his phone to see if he was actually cheating on my mother as she claimed he has. Apparently she texted all of the people on his phone saying how bad he is or something (notice how I did not do this, but my mother did, yet I still get the blame). He is a manipulative fuck, with an outdated view of the world. Even worse is that since he's the ""adult"" he thinks he has divine power over other people's life. He is bullshitting around with my dream. One second he is like ""sure ill purchase you the PC you need to create your life's dream"" to ""yea no. It's your fault for the actions of the dogs escaping their cage (It's my job to take care of the dogs, and one escaped from the cage and pooped ""everywhere"" (it was really just one area) in the basement)"".

&amp;#x200B;

Both of my parents play favorites it's painfully obvious. My mother does not even speak to me like I am a normal human, and she always seems to speak with me with disgust. I say a simple ""hi"" to her, and she does not even respond with anything. It's like this too much with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want any sympathy for that, I just wanted to give you guys an insight of just how it goes, and make you wonder if you want to live this life. Of course, I am sometimes irresponsible, and I slip with my chores, but its been at least 2 months since my little brother who is about to be in high school has even done his chore, and he gets no bs.

&amp;#x200B;

The Plan So Far:

&amp;#x200B;

I am very limited by my situation. I am 17, and a junior. I can't get any jobs besides food jobs, which are also very hard to get, because they usually require a phone number, and yes, I am the only person in the house without one, because I was irresponsible with one in the 8th grade, and I have not gotten one since. So it's hard to get a job, and I can't buy myself a phone with a number because I don't have any money, and I can't get any money because I don't have a fucking job. I can't drive, because apparently the excuse with that is ""We are waiting to get your sister her license first"". She fucking 20, and is not doing shit to get her license, when I had a drivers manual studying to take the test at fucking 15, but guess what? They took the manual away and gave it to her. But nonetheless, here is the plan I have composed to get the fuck out of this house, and in on my own:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Try my best to get a job (I have a decent chance with the Hardees up the street, but who knows)

[2. ](https://2.Save)[Save](https://2.Save) up like 600 dollars, and buy the computer to continue working with my passion project

3. Save, save, save the rest of the money

4. When I graduate in 2021, try my best to find a roommate, or try to get a cheap apartment or something,  and use the money I have saved for the past year to last me at least 2 months or so. While I have those 2 months, get a job at Amazon, and make more money

5. Amazon has the option to work 12 hours on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and  Saturday, at like 15 dollars an hour. This gives me decent money and gives me Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday to work on my passion project (My sister and stepdad currently work on that schedule)

6.Pour my heart and soul into my project, and when it becomes good enough, try my absolute best to get funds for it.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: I have, and will be working on my passion project throughout the year. I have wanted to create this since I was like 7, and I don't want to be in a world where I can not finish this. I also live in America btw, St.Louis, MO.",07Mar2020,1

76,"I got an a relationship for the first time ever and I had my first chance to use my libido which was really high or I at least though it was.

And this lead to me calling a quits on the

77,"I will call my new friend ‚ÄúDave‚Äù for ease. 

Dave walked into my life about 5 months ago. We are both film makers I was doing cinematography for this film and I met him on set he was a runner. Me and him got talking and we got on, in my opinion not super well but he says that we got on really well from when we first met. 

Now this was a weird point in my life. First of all there was a girl, who I‚Äôm not in a relationship with, after a few weeks of being with him I told him about her as she was on set with us so they both new each other. When we wrapped we went out and had a party. This is where Dave started to hit on my now girlfriend as me and her weren‚Äôt a thing at that time although I didn‚Äôt like it and was hurt I didn‚Äôt say anything. However when me and the girl got together he said that he didn‚Äôt care about her in that way he just did it to try and motivate me to ask her out. This was the first big red flag from Dave. 

The other thing that I don‚Äôt like about him is that he wants to hang out all of the time. And I mean all of the time. He is very alone at the moment so I feel sorry for him and in the past I have asked him to come with me and group of friends (sometimes my girlfriend) just to hang. The thing is he just doesn‚Äôt go away and doesn‚Äôt get the hint. If we go for drinks he says so what are you guys doing now and guilts me into staying out more or coming with me to where I was going. 

At one point I said I‚Äôm going to go and do some work at the library and he said can I come. I was reluctant and said I don‚Äôt want to be distracted but he said he won‚Äôt distract me and I was like okay fine. I don‚Äôt see why anyone would want to come to the library and sit quietly while the other person works and when we got to the library he was very distracting. Now when he asks me to come along I say no cus of how distracting he is but he says he won‚Äôt be like that but I put my foot down. 

He messages me literally everyday asking me if I have any plans for the week and stuff. I don‚Äôt even message my close friends everyday and it‚Äôs really annoying. 

The thing is he is a nice enough person but I don‚Äôt want him in my life 24/7 if I ask him to come hang out I want him to hang out for the thing that I invited him to and not stay longer if I say I‚Äôm going I want him to go and not follow me back or walk with me to my car. 

The last part I will say which really annoyed me inside was the other week. It was me my girlfriend and some of her friends and I said shall I invite Dave to the quiz they said yes so I invite him. When we meet we realise that the quiz was for a subject that we knew nothing about. So we didn‚Äôt do it but we just hung out instead. However me and my girlfriend were having some alone time when Dave comes along and says this is boring I might just go home. We say go and speak to the other friends and we will be over in a second. He hangs around more and then my girlfriend shouts across the room ‚Äúhey, speak with Dave‚Äù in a jokey way that meant no harm. Dave reacts like it‚Äôs a massive deal and is really angry with my girlfriend I tell him to chill it was a joke and he did but I honestly thought he was going to flip out.


He told me before that he has had friends that ditched him in the past and he doesn‚Äôt want that to happen again but I am starting to see why they did. 

Just wondering if this is like normal or should I be worried I honestly feel like he is a bit manipulative and I‚Äôm starting not to like him and becoming quite scared of him.",07Mar2020,1

80,"My ex best friend

So I've been friends with this person for like 2 or 3 years now. We met in middle school where I was new and she was one of my first friends. We have a pretty rocky history. We dated but we broke up because it was a really toxic relationship. At first she was really sweet and stuff but after awhile she said stuff like oh you don't love me, you're going to leave me one day and junk. Then she just wouldn't talk to me for days. Even in school she would barely look my direction and got mad when I made new friends. She then broke up with me. We decided to still stay friends but after a while I stopped being friends with her because of the same reasons we broke up.

We became friends again after the summer because we both apologized. and for a year we were fine despite some arguments. She was like my best friend yanno. We went over to each other's houses and we talked everyday. But then summer came. My family and I took her to our lake house. Everything was going fine until we watched a really scary movie. I'm a puss so I get SUPER scared and I get nightmares about these things. My friend wanted to go outside and make some smores but I was scared to death and did not want to go outside in the dark. She got upset so she went without me anyways and ignored me for the rest of the trip. After a painfully awkward car ride we arrived home and she just found ways to ignore me and stop talking to me. Whenever we argue she's always passive aggressive and starts to hang around other people she never does.

We made up after that though and things were pretty chill for the most part. My friend whenever she talks to someone she always has something to say under her breath. Loud enough so that they hear it but quiet enough you can't start a fight over it. Like if someone says, ""Oh I'm so happy I got (blah blah blah)!"" she would go, ""Oh good for you"" in a rude tone. She also got very mad and jealous easily. Me, her and a few other friends shared the same elective. I begged for this class because I wanted to hang with her but I was missing my old class a lot. My other friend who was in that same class with me were both reminiscing about the old times because we missed it. Then my ex friend started to get mad and was like ""What's even the point of being in the same classroom if you're just going to complain the whole time?"" and then proceeded to turn to my other friend to talk shit about me right next to me. It was at that point where we stopped talking less and less. I was still mad at her for that shit. So the next day came by and she was all by herself. Part of me wanted to go comfort her but the other part of me wanted to ignore her because I was still mad and I didn't want to deal with getting ignored and getting aggressive energy towards me. So I choose not to talk to her. It was a bad choice

After that day she texted me really angry saying that she was alone all day and that she really wanted a friend. I apologized because at that point I knew what I did was wrong. I asked what I could do to make it up to her and that I'll be better from then on but she didn't believe that I was really sorry and that I wouldn't understand. Even though she did the same shit to me when we were dating. After that she started getting more and more distant. She wouldn't talk that much to anyone and when I tried being there for her she kept pushing me away. All I wanted was for her to be happy. I tried being more affectionate like she asked me to do because I know I have my own problems of showing my emotions and being affectionate. When she got sad I tried holding her hand and I tried asking whats wrong. She just shrugged me off and started hanging out with other people. And instead of talking about her problems to me like we always have she went to somebody else as if i couldn't be trusted.

I finally said something about it to her. Our conversation went like this:  
 ME: Hey why were you sad earlier?   
*FRIEND:it was nothing I was just tired*   
ME: See I don't even know if I can believe you anymore smh   
*FRIEND: okay*   
ME: üóø  
 *FRIEND: bomboclaat*   
ME: why are you so dry   
*FRIEND: idk man I just don't have anything to say. Also you said you don't trust me and that kind of offends me*   
ME: because you've been so distant and you haven't been telling me anything   
*FRIEND: what do you want from me man*   
ME: I guess I just want things to be the way they were   
*FRIEND: when*   
ME: When we were all friends and there wasn't that much drama and when I had people to talk to. *FRIEND: Dudette i'm gonna be honest if i'm being distant its because I feel like you were choosing \_\_\_\_\_ over me all the time* (She was upset because at lunch her and my other friend had a fight and the rest of the people at our table kind of just stayed quiet since they were both our friends) *and if I kept out you don't have to make a choice*   
ME: Bro I barely talk to \_\_\_\_ I only talk to them in like history and in lunch   
*FRIEND: well you don't really talk to me at lunch and she just seems like she's the one you'd rather be around so*   
ME: That's because in lunch you're really quiet and you don't answer me. I remember deadass trying to have a conversation with you and you didn't say anything back. It just felt like you didn't want to be around me anymore. And it wasn't just like a ""hey"" it was me going in depth about something and you barely even looked at me. It just felt like you were tired of me and I understand you haven't been in the best of moods lately but you've just been so different.  
 *FRIEND: that's tough man and I'm sorry if that's making you sad but idk. well i do know i'm just trying to explain it. you're not a bad friend I just don't feel good when we talk anymore. I feel like you're always analyzing me (which is true I do like to analyze people and see how they work.) which stresses me out by the way and also i feel kinda pressured by you by silly things (me reminding her to read the manga that I gave her for like a month) i'm just trying to figure out what I need. You're not really the type to be tender with me and I feel like I can't tell you my feelings anymore. When what I need is just someone who I feel loved by chica and it's not like you're flat out terrible to me. I just don't know if it's there anymore. I'm just trying to deal with it in my head first because our lives are so involved together and I've spent money and time and tears in you and I don't wanna be alone but when I think about it it feels like you could care less if i weren't around.*  
ME: Okay I understand   
*FRIEND: so idk like we can talk about it now but if you're upset then maybe think about it for a little before we do*   
ME: i'm fine there's nothing to talk about and nothing i can do.

As you can see I didn't handle it well. Now that I look back on it we could've talked about it and made up but I was too hurt. I tried so hard to be better for her and more affectionate and it hurt a lot to basically get told that I wasn't enough for her. I cried a lot after that conversation. But the fact that I tried to brush it off probably proved her doubts that I didn't care she was gone. Now we don't talk at all. The most we talked was today but it was very aggressive.

Someone asked us what was going on between us and my ex friend said we just stopped being friends and it was mutual. I agreed but inside my head I was kind of pissed. I didn't want to stop being friends. I put in a lot of effort to try to be better and when that conversation came down I took it as a one-sided ""its not me its you."" (Now that I looked back on it I know I had the chance to try and fix it and that is entirely my fault). The next time we interacted was in my Spanish class. We were split up into groups and my ex friend yelled to my partner ""you're the smartest person in your team."" At first I was really confused because I wasn't even looking in her direction so I just shot her a confused look. A few minutes passed because we were playing a class game. It was a buzzer game where you press the buzzer if you know the answer. Her team pressed the button but the person who pressed the button didn't know the answer so our team tried to steal the point. One of my teammates got the wrong answer so my ex friend started saying things like ""it was obvious"" or something like that. I could be wrong tho all I remember was that I got a little offended so I yelled out ""Well at least she said something!"" I immediately covered my mouth because that came out really aggressive and I felt bad for yelling. My teacher went,""woah i thought you guys were BFFS."" and I was like ""no we are not friends anymore."" My ex friend looked offended and started talking about me to one of her friends.  
   
The only other times we talked was about information like netflix passwords and stuff. Because we shared almost everything. It's been really lonely. Ever since I lost my best friend I have no one to talk to. I know she's going through the same thing too. I'm not sure about missing me but I know she's lonely too. I know that my friend has a lot of problems and I know her past and how that translates to people's actions. She is also not a bad person. I know that she isn't. When she isn't going through things she's very caring and funny. I miss what we had. I miss having someone to talk to about anything. Part of me is really upset at her but I know deep down I want my friend back. I feel like it's too late though and I don't even know if it‚Äôll be worth it.",07Mar2020,1
81,"Looking for mainly advice from any seasoned musicians out there but anyone can chip in.

So I've been drumming on and off since I was about 5 years old and have played in numerous bands over the years. I took an 8 year hiatus when I got married and following my divorce the first thing I did was start drumming again. I mainly play heavy metal/metalcore/deathcore genres. My last band of two years broke up and I've been looking for something new.

I happened to find a local signed band (not name dropping so I can stay anonymous) looking for a drummer and they're really interested in me joining them on a month and a half tour across the US. At first I was thrilled, but now I'm worried about what I should do.

- My health is shaky at best. I'm diabetic with high blood sugar. I'm worried about being able to make it through a tour. The first leg alone has ten shows before a day off. I also suffer from severe depression regulated through antidepressants.
- The drummer I'm replacing was very good. I consider myself a pretty good drummer but this guy was a beast. It's going to take a ton of work to get up to snub in time for a tour. I'm also way out of shape as far as my stamina goes.
- I don't have much to lose all things considered. No longer married, no kids, minimal bills due. However I would lose a pretty chill job that I have now. I just dug myself out of the aftermath debt from my divorce after 2 years and part if me just wants to keep working and make some money.

Basically, I'm torn between risking it all in pursuit of a dream I've had my whole life or maintaining a comfortable, chill existance. I love playing music, but the touring life does not have a lot of appeal to me. Besides the half an hour set daily the rest of the time is trying to grab a few hours of sleep in an old van on the way to the next show. No comforts of home or anything like that.

On the other hand this might be my one shot at going pro. If I don't take this offer, I'm probably done as a musician. Can play for fun or have a little local band but I'll probably never get signed on my own. It is a huge opportunity, but I don't know if I want it or not. It's my time to rise to greatness but I'm hesitating.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",07Mar2020,1

For context, my friend's name is going to be Jane.  


8 months ago, Jane and I broke apart. What did I do to her may you ask? Well, here goes the list   


* Had thoughts and dreams of me having sex with her and seeing her nude  

* She also talked to me about a toxic relationship that she had in elementary about her and another girl being in a toxic relationship and I went around her other friends that she didn't tell and told them about what happened.    

* Told her multiple times while I was mad to kill herself    

* Had many dumb arguments with her about stupid things, one time about K-Pop and Anime.    

* Broke many of her promises    

* Gave her nightmares of me raping her   


After we said our goodbyes, she blocked me. I don't know when but she deleted her Facebook account too which was just a fake Korean account.  


After asking people on discord what I should do, I had a variety of answers, people saying yes and no.   
People saying no because it's clear that she doesn't want to be contacted by me due to the fact that she blocked me   


People saying yes because if I don't, I won't be able to move on with the guilt and regret i'm still carrying.

Hi, 

Last week a friend suggested that we go to the beach. She friendly asked me if I want to go and I said ok. Later, I confirmed with her and I waited for her to get ready and go. Later on that person left and we ended up alone for 1 hour until our other friends came to join us. And they left too after sometime. Then we had deep conversations at the beach that I felt so comfortable around her and I would like to go out with her again. In fact, we maintained good terms communications during the week that I had the courage to ask her out in person. 
The only down side is that, Sunday is her only day off and she would want to rest than do anything else. And I wait patiently to have her free time to do some activity together.

How should  I approach her again? 

Thank you,",07Mar2020,1

90,"Long story short, I landed a management position with a large multinational corporation right out of college in 2006.  I specialize in electronic workflow management.  I hold a few certifications such as CDIA+ and ITIL.

However, the field has recently transitioned towards automation and certifications in fields like lean Six Sigma, AI, and robotics have become more relevant.

Honestly, I missed the boat on keeping my certifications relevant to the field.  My team is being downsized and I can read the writing on the wall that my position will also soon be eliminated.

Over the years, I was promoted into management positions of greater responsibility, including being a hiring manager, and worked extensively with HR.  I find myself considering a transition into that field given that my resume may be out of date and my certifications worthless.

Hey!

I will start and end it fast!

I‚Äôm 20 years old with NO illness or disease in the family! 

About 2 years ago i found a node or nodule or bump or what to call it on my back! It‚Äôs an really small and doesn‚Äôt stick up! I can just feel under my skin! And that also gave me cancer health anxiety! But after 2-3 weeks I forgot about it, and About 4 weeks ago my left rib was sticking out, and it was not painful but it feelt Weird that really gave me health anxiety! 

And then I also have something under my jaw/chin! Someone said it‚Äôs an lymph node and I searched it up and it said that a swollen lymph node can be caused by cancer and other things but I have also had that thing under my jaw for 1.9 years? 
I thought it was cancer or something! And then I started to get health anxiety again for the thing on my back! It hasn‚Äôt grown anything and still feels the same! It‚Äôs not big or anything! Maybe like an chickpea? So I went up and got my left rib checked out, and it turns out that I have a small scoliosis and that‚Äôs why my left rib is sticking out! And after that the ‚Äúpain has gone away‚Äù and now I‚Äôm just focused on the back! It doesn‚Äôt hurt or anything but if I‚Äôm touching it a lot in a day it can get irritated, (still doesn‚Äôt hurt) I‚Äôm probably there and touching 30-40 times a day! Should I be worried? And again it‚Äôs not in the way or hurt anything and it hasn‚Äôt growth or change shape! 

Should i be worry about cancer tumor or anything? When i‚Äôm only 20 years old and healthy? And my family is also healthy and everyone who has died is from age!",07Mar2020,1

99,"So some context, I'm 15, in high school. This all happened about an hour ago. So it's still fresh in my mind and I'm not in the right state emotionally. It's a lot to type out but here's the email I sent it to my counselor:

My mom just uh, said I was a sexual predator? And that I've been banned from like 5 of my friends houses? And she didn't offer any context? I'm so confused.¬†She said that some ""families"" have complained that I'm a bully who acts inappropriate in public and exploits girl.¬†I don't know who, but she said she believes them.¬†I'm just so confused why she would believe some random people she barely knows. Or at least people who she won't tell me about.¬†And she would believe it without even asking me about it or confronting me at all.¬†Apparently that's why she hasn't spoken to me in three weeks. I'm really hoping she's making all of it up.¬†¬†But that would be a really messed up way of convincing me to stop seeing my girlfriend. I texted all my friends and none of them have banned me from their house. I don't know what to do. I'm really scared.¬†

Basically three weeks ago she found out I have a girlfriend, she's not really taking it well because she still thinks of me as a girl (I'm a trans guy which she also knows and hates) So for the past hour I've been doing a lot of back and forth texting with friends, And my mom's story kind of fell apart. 

For starters she said five families, I only hang out with two of my friends outside of school. She also didn't specify which families. I checked with my friends and none of them said that I was banned from their houses. On top of that she was pretty adamant about mentioning that this was how the rest of my life was going to pan out if I ""continued down this road"" (me being trans). I know you don't know me, but I can promise you I would never sexually assault anyone, anything and everything I do with my girlfriend is consensual and we don't do anything at school besides kiss in-between classes. At this point I'm convinced that she made the whole story up to scare me into being cis, but instead all she's done is emotionally traumatize me. I'm leaving the house and staying with my cousin for the night.

I went to a used tire store in town recommended by my the previous friend and bought a set. The tech who installed the new tires mentioned my front end was messed up (ball joints and tie rods). Immediately after the install I noticed a wobble in my frontend when driving. I was hopeful an alignment might fix this and had one done today. I asked the techs performing the alignment to check on my front steering assembly. They told me everything looked good. I then took it to another mechanic and had him do a once over. He concluded there was nothing wrong with the vehicle, the tires were culprit and a new set/alignment should fix my wobbling. I'm taking the tires back to the tire place tomorrow. What grounds do/should I exercise during my negotiation in the case they refuse a full refund?",07Mar2020,1

103,"For about 6 months now, my brother (22 yrs) has constantly every time I (24 yrs) talk to him been describing his sex life to me and asking about mine. A few days ago he described this ""sex hotel"" to me in great detail about him and his girlfriend and describing where he was, and I quote, ""fucking this shit out of her"". He asked me if I had ever had sex in a hot tub, and then described his experience he had with his girlfriend that night...and then related it to doing it in the shower, and said, ""you've had sex in the shower right?"" I very clearly uncomfortably answered his question...As he continued to describe his opinions on showet sex. He had suggested me and my bf get the same room as he did if we ever go there which I assumed it was because it was a cool room but with evwrything else being said I was just uncomfortable....later that night he called me to come pick him up from that hotel because him and his girl had gotten into a fight. I got there and he was extremely drunk (I believe he uses alcohol as an excuse to do and say stupid hurtful things, he often ""doesn't remember"" the hurtful things he does but can remember other details just fine) anyways, after about 2 hours of making sure everything was okay...I went to give him a hug as I was leaving, usually our hugs are very short and light, but this is the first time he's ever squeezed me tight to where I can't move, caressed my hair, and kissed my head. I thought at first, ""maybe he's just had a really bad night"" but shortly after that, he slapped my bf's ass....which he has never done before in the 5 years I've been with this guy....guys, is my brother just having some kind of breakdown or....the whole entire thing made me feel extremely uncomfortable to the point where I'm actually scared to be alone with him. He has been my best friend my whole life. Am I over reacting or is that kind of physical contact normal between siblings? My father kisses my head but he does not grab me like my brother did or rub my head like that. Maybe I was just still uncomfortable about all the sex talk from that night and the several previous times he had talked to me. I don't know. I was sexually abused by an older step sibling when I was 15 and my family did not believe me and lashed out at me when I told them. For the passed 6 years of trying to confront my brother about any of his behaviors, he tends to guilt trip you and make it seem like you actually hurt him...so I've been scared to confront him about how I feel and to set boundaries which I thought were already there...and I'm scared I may be reading him wrong too so I don't want to falsely assume anything but it's really freaking me out.",07Mar2020,1
104,"So, I‚Äôm an 18 year old female. I turn 19 in one month from now. I met a guy that I really really liked, and before we met in person obviously I got to know him pretty well. He told me he was 17, but was turning 18 next month, so I made it a point to meet his mother (in my state it‚Äôs legal if the parent knows. better safe then sorry) she knew my age and we clicked well. 

Everything was cool until a few days ago I‚Äôm talking to his sister about what I‚Äôm gonna get him for his birthday. She look really confused. She said his birthday wasn‚Äôt until summer and his 18th was two years away so why was I worried now. I freaked the fuck out and left. 

Turns out he‚Äôs only 16. Like, not even almost 17. His 17th birthday isn‚Äôt for 7 months. I feel gross. I feel disgusting. We did things. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep and I blocked him on everything but I do have genuine feelings for him before everything went down. He had tattoos, piercings, his mom seemed oddly cool with me being almost 19 (not odd at the time but looking back she couldn‚Äôt care less.)

105,"I currently live with 4 other adults and am very close friends with 2 of them. I moved in just about 2 months ago. The place was a wreck when I moved in. So instead of judging and deciding not to move in I went ahead and moved in and started cleaning for them. I would clean while I was the only one home so they didn‚Äôt have to worry about it. Top to bottom in a three bedroom apartment. Here‚Äôs the issue that I need a little advice over. It took me 2 weeks to clean the apartment spotless. I scrubbed everything, picked all the junk up, took out all the trash, did the dishes that had been sitting for who knows how long because they cooked with them once then never touched them again (very nasty), and I even took all of the cushions out of the furniture and vacuumed inside the couches. I asked over and over again if they could help keep it picked up. Our apartment managers are starting inspections soon and I don‚Äôt live like a slob. I love a clean house. I have one of the other four adults that actually help and keep her things picked up but the others absolutely trashed the place every single time I‚Äôve ever cleaned. What do I do?

107,"This happened today in my second to last class. Today out of all days we get a sub. Honestly i dont like having subs because i actually love my math teacher shes very kind and great at getting the point across yet strict when she needs to be. Shes my favorite math teacher of all time. So half way through we get a code yellow via the school speakers. No info. Only 5 of us take it seriously.  The rest of the class is goofing around and the sub is doing nothing.  Few minutes later we go into code red. Again only us 5 do something.  We turn off the lights and go into the corner but we dont even know if the door is locked due to the sub not having a key. So here i am shaking and crying in the corner knowing something is wrong.  This girl (lets call her sara) she texts our theater teacher to get updates and she confirms its real. This code red lasts for 25 minutes not 5 like that drills. They even held the bell yet the others believe its not real. Later from rumors we heard it was from off campus or another school.  Honestly we got lucky god forbid this was a VERY different situation we would have possibly been victims of a tragedy... im still very shaken up as this is my biggest fear and i felt useless.. i dont really think anyone can help here but its worth a go.. i just cant believe they didnt take it seriously all because we had a sub... if my teacher was here nobody would've said a word and be on their phones... i just wish this whole thing didnt happen and i know it couldve been worse but no matter what it is its still a very scary situation that couldve had a very different outcome... im just grateful ""sara"" was here.

But who is there when I don‚Äôt. It sounds dumb but for the exception of every blue moon I‚Äôm not checked on by anyone. The only reason I came to this school was because they offered me a full ride on a track scholarship. I was actually very good at the sport and well known, my family would call me and of course I was always around them just because I was home. I also had many friends I was really well known these people I knew for years some even since I was born. Now in college I still sit here and ask myself where they all went. I heard that college was starting a new life but I didn‚Äôt think that nobody would join me into the next alongside their own journey. My family doesn‚Äôt check on me unless they need something or I call even my grandfather who is in prison checks in more then they do and he only gets a phone call every so often. Idk how to bare with the loneliness the school I go to is for me and I enjoy it very much I‚Äôve even made friends but sadly they do their own things as well.

110,"This is more of a rant then anything but regardless;

Just like the title; my friend sent me a picture of his balls. We were playing a game together having a casual conversation about dumb shit; I brought up the time how he flashed my friends webcam in the background (he didn't know) on discord with his balls and thought it was kinda funny, but also really fucking disgusting; and that it would be funny if he sent a pic of his nuts to our other friend (I said this a joke). 

I guess he was trying to mess with me so he said we was gonna send me a picture of his sack, and I told him if he did that It would make me really mad, because that's gross and really weird. 

I was cracking jokes how I would kick his ass if he did that, but eventually I said firmly ""don't do that, I'm not kidding; that's gross"".

He did it anyways and I got pretty upset and I said: He had mental issues, ""don't fucking do that it's weird"", I can't trust you worth shit.

I was going off on him, but all he said was I was being a little bitch and he thought it was funny and any of our other friends would've found it funny. After getting heated it got really awkward so I just left the call and got off. 

Honestly, he's my closest friend but if it were anyone else that I was cool with, I probably would've found it hilarious. But sometimes he gives me really weird and creepy vibes and that's why I got really mad. This isn't the first time he crossed my boundaries, and it pisses me off when he does; but he acts like its nothing to get upset about.

I would appreciate some advice on what I should do? 

I don't want this to effect our relationship, but it really weirds me out when he acts like this and if I were to bring it up to him, he would probably call me weird &amp; a little bitch for making a big deal about it. I really don't want to be judge for being sensitive, but I feel like its valid.

How should I got about this? Should I confront him or just pretend like it never happen?

2 - They get slowly less interested in me because my life is boring and i don't really contribute much to our conversations

3 - They make more friends and stop messaging me except when they are bored and so we talk less often

4 - They stop talking to me unless I send multiple messages and I get lonelier than i was before I met them

I'm on a dating app and I matched with these two girls. I'm 19, and one of them is 18, the other is 19. They are both beautiful and I'm starting to connect with both of them... the problem is that I don't know which one I should choose, or how to let the other one down easy.

They both live 34 miles away in opposite directions of my town. After I matched with the 18 year old on Bumble, we talked for a DAY and she deleted her account on the dating app. She said on her profile she was looking for a relationship, but I think she acted way too quickly. She doesn't even know me but she's that quick to hone in on me? I see that as a red flag.

The 19 year old was on Tinder, and were just talking. We're going at a comfortable pace. I've got a lot more in common with the 19 y/o than the 18 y/o, but shes not as responsive as the 18 y/o. They're both really sweet, but I find myself flirting with the older one more.

I'm not an asshole and I've been cheated on so many times, I don't want to do that to somebody else. By talking to them both at once it feels like I'm just stringing them both along because of how good its going. Plus its the first time I've had people who were genuinely interested in me.

This is the longest I've gone without her since we started dating. I never told anyone about the hurtful things she did to me, especially because everyone thought I was mature enough to date her at the time. Now, since we've broken up, I (F17) am finally starting to open up about our relationship to my closest friend and my parents, but I can't help but feel like I'm exaggerating everything she did to me because I was so young at the time (and I still am). She did a lot of things that hurt me, a lot that would count as abusive behavior, but I feel awful thinking that she might've abused me.

120,"Hi all, throwaway person here. Roughly 8 years ago, my parents and close family had a falling out with my oldest sister (31 now). At the time, I was only 13ish, didn't care much for family drama, and didn't know her that well in the first place considering she moved out when I was a baby. She is my half-sister, and she has no relationship with my mother (except a few phone arguments and passive aggressiveness). She also has 2 kids, who I only knew as babies.

I find out A LOT of details now as an adult: my sister was diagnosed early with BPD and Bipolar disorder, wasn't taking her meds, was stealing money from my father, manipulating family into giving her money when she was in debt... it wasn't a great situation.

In the past few months, my father has reconnected with her. She is doing better, apparently. Therapy and medication and escaping an abusive relationship has greatly improved her. My mother entirely disapproves of her still, VERY openly.

I am considering reaching out to my sister after all these years to ask about going out for lunch or even just having a chat. We have had NO communication all these years, and I would like to see my niece/nephew finally as teenagers. I do not live with my parents, but I am still greatly concerned that it will cause a rift between me and my mother AND even my father. My mother clearly has a very strong grudge against my sister, and believes that she is nothing but stress for my father. She has strongly suggested that my father stop talking to my sister for years, even now as they reconnected.

121,"Graduated college last May, am staying with my parents until I can afford to move out (hopefully within the next 6 months or so). Already understand the principle of ‚Äútheir house their rules.‚Äù

With that being said, my parents are what I would describe as being overly involved in my dating life. Within the past few months I‚Äôve started dating again, trying to meet new guys and hopefully begin a relationship. 

Every time I go out with a guy, I‚Äôll give them the smallest amount of information on him, and they‚Äôll manage to find his social media profiles and ‚Äúwarn‚Äù me if they see anything they would consider to be inappropriate. They‚Äôll ask super intrusive questions and I feel very uncomfortable. 

For example, a guy I‚Äôve been seeing invited me to his art show at a local gallery. I marked myself as going on the event‚Äôs Facebook page. My parents somehow found photography work he did years ago that they considered inappropriate, and warned me that ‚Äúwhen he r*pes me I‚Äôll kick myself for not listening to them.‚Äù

I‚Äôve tried discussing boundaries with them. I‚Äôve tried telling them that it‚Äôs inappropriate to stalk men they don‚Äôt even know on social media and then cast judgements. And I‚Äôve tried telling them that I do have sound judgement, considering I was away at school for 3 years and encountered my fair share of real creeps. 

How should I even approach this anymore? I know the obvious answer is move out, but unfortunately this is not possible for the time being. I just want my romantic life to be private.",07Mar2020,1

Was unaware for about 8 months and thought we all just gradually grew apart until I spotted then together at the usual place we hung out on. 

Confronted them about it. A few of them felt guilty and decided to tell me everything after apologizing. They just casually decided to leave me out for no real reason. One of them felt a few people in the group didn't really feel comfortable with me. I'm more than a little eccentric and they had to deal with personality problems I used to have. The latter was dealt with a long time ago. Decided to try and fix my eccentricity and do my best to be less socially awkward.

They started calling me up again, but it didn't feel it used to. Only one of them I felt was seriously apologetic and made an effort to be inclusive. The others I felt like they were calling me up just because they pitied me. I still took it as an opportunity to reconcile with them but after what I think was 4-5 months, I found out through that one guy they started going out without me again. I'm not sure why, I tried and was making improvements.

127,"Over the last two years or so I have been looking back over my life and the things that have impacted it. While doing this I begs to look back at how my life was when I was in my early elementary years. One of the things that I remember vividly was my friend Tom (name changed for reasons soon to be disclosed). Tom was what I thought was the definition of cool even though he was a year younger than me. His parents allowed him to play cool video games (COD and Uncharted), he also had an IPad that was completely unrestricted. He used this ability to expose me to porn (this is not what why I am changing his name). Sometimes when we would be in his room tucked away from his parents supervision, he would pull his pants down and jump on me and hump me (I am not completely sure if he would always pull down his pants but I do know he did at least once). At the time I didn‚Äôt understand what this was or what it meant, but I did know that it made me uncomfortable and that I didn‚Äôt like it. Also sometimes when we were in his basement he would say ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt show me your penis then you can‚Äôt come and play with me anymore.‚Äù I would of course say no until he eventually would pester me about it until I would get annoyed and do it. Looking back I am embarrassed of what I used to let him do to me. I told my very close church  friends about this experience, I felt like they judged me because Tom was younger than me. One thing that I feel would help me is if I could give this a name. What happened to me? I know it‚Äôs not rape so what do I call it?

I spend every waking moment thinking about her and how she‚Äôs doing but I don‚Äôt know how to say I‚Äôm worried or if I should say anything at all. I spend most of my time with her but I couldn‚Äôt today and she seemed pretty unwell, bored out of her mind and refused to have a snack when I offered her one.

Im going to be visiting my girlfriend in another state in 2 months and I need some advice. 

 I'd like to be able to lose a few pounds and straighten up my posture and weight before 
I go see her. I kinda have a beer belly, I dont know if it's because my posture or just that I'm packing a few pounds, either way I need to get ride of it and dont mind going through some extreme cardio to do it, not only to be good looking for her but for my own health. I have some pretty bad neck and shoulder blade pain.

I decided hey why not give it a shot? So I got the job and well, I‚Äôm really starting to feel depressed being there. For one, I recently started talking to one of the girls that work there and she‚Äôs interested in dating me. But the only caveat is that she‚Äôs poly, therefore she would already be talking to another dude :/. (FYI: I never dated/have a relationship before). I haven‚Äôt told her how I feel since we have different work schedules. Secondly, there‚Äôs this one guy that knows how to talk to the other girl staff like if it was nothing. And I‚Äôm just sitting here wondering: ‚Äúhow come I can‚Äôt do that? I‚Äôm like literally bad with people‚Äù. This shit in my head has also been making me feel like shit and making me even more sad. I never really had the skills to talk to the opposite sex and sometimes I even wonder if I ever will. Lastly, work has been just getting hard from the previous stated issues I have having. With that said, I‚Äôm starting to hate the place I loved going. Which makes me even more depressed that I let this happen. I‚Äôm starting to think that my future isn‚Äôt gonna be as bright as I hoped it would be. Since all I ever wanted was to fuck bitches and have fun.

-Is that enough time?  
-Do all of us need good credit or just one or two of us?
-How much is a down payment on a 2 or 3 bedroom house usually?
- We are three guys. Will that scare away potential leasers? 
- Would it be better to maybe rent it under me and my girlfriends name so they won‚Äôt think we will cause any trouble? (We won‚Äôt, but I could see why someone wouldn‚Äôt want to rent to three 20 yr olds guys)

144,"About a year ago my (18 F) friend (18 F) started dating a guy (22 M) she met on a dating app. She always told me he was the most perfect guy. Caring, attentive, funny, good looking. He really did seem perfect by the way she described him. Too perfect. But, after a few months they split up. They just weren‚Äôt in the right headspace for a relationship, I guess. 

However, a few months ago during a deep conversation we were having, she told me that while they were ending things he admitted that he raped a 5 year old girl when he was 12 years old. I was sick to my stomach. She had dated the literal worst kind of garbage on earth. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine how she must‚Äôve felt. But, she wasn‚Äôt seeing him anymore. Or so I thought. Last week she told me that they got back together. This made me feel even more sick. How the hell could she even think about him without seeing evil. I don‚Äôt care how young he was, HE IS A PEDOPHILE. Yet, she claims that people change. Newsflash, they don‚Äôt. (My mom works with pedophiles and said that they will always have the urge in the back of their head no matter how much therapy they receive) 

This whole situation disgusts me. She even brings him home to her family where her 5 YEAR OLD little sister lives. I‚Äôm so disappointed in her decision to let someone like that into her life again. I know that she is trying to be accepting of all people, but he doesn‚Äôt get a second chance. Not to me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love her with all my heart, she‚Äôs practically family, but this not okay with me. I‚Äôm not afraid to tell her what I think, but she just keeps telling me that she knows and she doesn‚Äôt want me to judge her.

I‚Äôm in the music education program at my university and I loved everything about it first semester, the playing, the people, everything I was doing! I was passionate and happy. The only bad part is/was my schedule. I‚Äôm basically busy in class and rehearsal from 8am-10pm on a good day with very little free time in there (1 hour-2hours if I‚Äôm lucky). This schedule and the rigor of my program have just beaten me down. My last two private lessons through the university before break went pretty poorly and my desire to go to class is almost nonexistent now (I still manage to force myself though).

I‚Äôm dreading going back, I feel like this university and schedule have beaten my love and passion for music and education out of me.

148,"So the title might make the situation sound pretty mild, just staring right? Not really...

I live in a very urban area where you could easily pass the same person twice and not notice unless they really stood out. Around two years ago, I noticed this guy for the first time because of how oddly he behaved.

I crossed one of those wide streets that divided with a stopping point in the middle, and I realized this creepy man had turned to me at the stopping point and begun to stare while smiling in this horribly off-putting way. We were going in opposite directions, but he turned around to watch me cross the street, and continued staring until I was another 20-30 paces away. I was 16 at the time.

Since then, similar events have happened every few months. He stares whether I'm in running clothes, my SCHOOL UNIFORM, a dress, or a simple hoodie and jeans. I do not know who this man is and I have no idea how he knows me.  

I don't want to go to my parents, because quite honestly they will blame me. I live in a culture where it's normal to blame women for these sorts of things happening to them. I can't go to the police, because as unnerving as it is, he hasn't done anything else. He never speaks or moves, he just freezes, smiles and stares at me. I don't have a name to report either.

I'm starting to really worry about this because he's not stopping. Does anyone know why he could be doing this? Once again emphasizing that I live in an area where it's very difficult to remember people unless you know them, so this is very very abnormal and by no means normal creep behavior.

Turns out my Ex is in town for another two days. We'd talked about seeing one another a month before so we set up a time and place and meet the very first day I arrive. I tell my SO right before, that my Ex and I would be grabbing a coffee. They start to reply distantly and stiffly. Next thing I hear is they'd be seeing their Ex who lives in the same town we live in for the night. I ask if that's only because I met up with my Ex and they reply 'nah, they'd been asking for a while and since you're seeing yours, why wouldn't I see my Ex'. Next day I ask how the night's been they reply 'yeah great talked about a lot of things, didn't even feel the time pass until two in the morning'. So I'm mad, in my mind they met their Ex because they were mad about me meeting mine who's in town for two days, I tell them. They accuse me of doing the wrong thing by meetingy Ex in the first place and not telling the. until  just before.

Generally, though, for those who are coming straight from college like me and have no experience in the field other than education (I graduate in 2 months with my Bachelors in Science) you are paid a bit less. On Glassdoor, it looks like for this particular position, most are paid in the low 60k range.

Since I will be moving across country if I accept, completely uprooting my husband's and my life, I added on an extra 10k expected compared to the low 60k range I see online.

162,"im really lost here. i dont know where to post this or how to say what i wanna say, which is probably just venting, but i figured this would be the best place to do that.

I (14M) don't like my mother. we're not... compatible. ever since i was born she claims (joking, but I'm sure some of it's true) that my dad ""took her place"", as in taking care of me. I've always bonded and interacted better with him, and that has made me distant from her. 

I've had arguments (in which I'm told to be very blunt and most times say hurtful things) with her since age 8 or so. we do agree in some things, but when we don't it's extreme. she's called me ""monster"" (at around 9, i said some heavy things) and wondered ""what kind of person she was raising"". i really don't know, this topic has confused me for as long as I've thought about it, because there's no *actual* reason for me to not like her like that.

things got way worse, and off the charts at 2017. she moved out of my grandma's (she does pay her bills here) and got this ""boyfriend"" (mind you her and dad have been divorced since around 2014). at that house, the atmosphere was always heavy and oppressing, she was always in a bad mood and would often treat me bad/yell at me (I'm not victimizing myself here. again, most of the times i did something that upset her/she didn't approve of). once i started to deadass cry in front of her, because her boyfriend was destroying both of us. she had been very harsh to me (not in one sporadic event, but small things throughout the day). i started texting my cousin (who knows all my secrets, and back then, I'd already started to share some very intense feelings, which would later be depression). after that she took my phone, read the texts, though i had erased the ones with my cousin. we didn't and still don't understand each other, in that case, she to why i was crying, and me to why she was doing that.

after me being diagnosed with depression, she's helped me through, with very rare conversations (she had moved out of that house, back into my grandma's and broken up with her boyfriend) and paying for a psych and therapy. but even nowadays i just don't agree with her mindset. she's still trying to control me (which i will not accept since now im very much well and capable of standing up for myself)  she asks for absolutely ridiculous things that she could definitely do herself, and her opinions are just too ""extreme"". I've had a period of war with her, when she took me for a trip and acted bitchy all along (~12 DAYS). that's when i told her i didnt like her, and that I didn't know why, she cried and said she just wanted to make me happy by taking me to the trip, which made me think i was maybe being too harsh. 

we've had relative peace since then, but the battles are coming back. the stupid favors, the controlling a minor aspect of my life, the answering questions with ""i'm your mother"". also she's always said i should do something productive instead of just playing videogames but now that i want to study classical music she won't make the smallest effort to look into it. it's tiring, and now that I've written a whole essay here, it's starting to be very clear why i don't like her. 

my dad rose me differently. yes, they both used to be very homophobic and surveillant parents, but i feel like my dad handled the whole gay/depressed/atheist situation better. i feel like she has too many problems of her own to be able to handle mine.

the question here is: what the hell am i supposed to do? she's already confronted me with the idea of ""disowning"" her and going live with my dad, i know we dont get along but i just don't want to leave her. I'm afraid we'll have another ""war"" soon, and I'm sick of this come and go situation.",07Mar2020,1

\- Requested parts to order multiple times that the boss never ordered.

\- Boss didn't train me at all as far as how he wanted his store managed and kept organized and assumed I'd be able to just figure it all out.

\- The hours are set so the store only has one person working an 8 hour shift during store open hours and there's not enough time to keep up with repairs and keep the place organized and cleaned - we can't tell customers we're busy or schedule things even when we're physically overwhelmed.

\- Have asked the boss for help/extra hours/extra hands and the only way I can even try to keep up is coming in after hours which I've done and am done doing.

\- Have asked the boss to look at a few diagnostic repairs I couldn't figure out and gave him the information and steps for things I've tried, and he's made no attempt to come in or tell me when he can so the customers are left clueless.

\- He's blamed me for all this to the two other coworkers (one's last day is tomorrow) and made me look like total dirt.

168,"Whenever I‚Äôm just doing something I like ( drawing, playing video games, etc.) and my parents are home I get so anxious. If they come home and I‚Äôm playing a game on the computer and it isn‚Äôt one approved by them or if I‚Äôm playing modded minecraft (which I downloaded the mods for by myself, without them knowing) I immediately turn off the computer and rush into the living room. I can‚Äôt even watch anime on the tv or any movie I like with them home, even if they‚Äôre outside smoking. The only things I‚Äôm hiding from them is my social medias (Although I never post on any besides reddit), my minecraft mods, an online relationship I had when I was 8 all the way to when I was 11 with a dude over 18 who didn‚Äôt know my age, a few video games I downloaded on my own (which have no violence or 18+ things), the fact I watch anime, that I‚Äôm nonbinary and pansexual, and how I know what periods are and what 18+ stuff is without them explaining anything.

169,"My boyfriend and I just recently had sex and were still pretty new at this but the other day while we were getting it on he was too rough and I think he missed me and hit my perineum. There was a popping sound but I don't know if its a relevance to my problem. Anyways I had him stop for awhile because I felt a sharp pain and then we continued and the pleasure over came the pain. Once we were done I cleaned myself up and I noticed minimal blood(which has stopped after a few hours) and I also went to the restroom and it burned when I was urinating, not as much today though. 

I don't know if this is a big enough problem that would require me to go to the doctors because it is only a problem when I use the restroom and other than that I can go on with my day normally. 

Any suggestions or advice about my problem will be greatly appreciated! If you read this far, thank you so much!

170,"Hi I'm a 19 year old male who was orginally born in Texas. I moved alot with my parents being in the navy and now I live in Delaware. So to start this out I wanna give a brief (as brief as I can make this) history of what my past has been like from the early days of my childhood my father at the time started to abuse me where I ended up hiding bruises and had to suffer through the pain.i also started having nightmares of what he would scream at me and the times he had hurt me. He has even slammed me into a metal backdoor on christmas one year because I didn't think it was my job to do my older brothers laundry. I have back pain to this day and scoliosis from that incident. He's changed now but he is super controlling of my life to this day. For example he created me a bank account when I was super young as a youth account with his bank it has matured to an adult account but he has me trapped he wont let me take him completely off as a secondary to my account. He can litterally access all my money and see my transactions if he wants to. My mom has always been a women I look up to regardless she has alot of flaws but she would step in when I was being abused to protect me. She had stage 3 breast cancer a while back and is all okay and in remission. My dad walked out on her and my 3 siblings when I was 16 and filled seperation. She is now getting alot closer to pushing the full divorce through and when she does she plans to sell the house. Now I refuse to go live with my father after all the years of physical and mental abuse he put me through but she knows I'm in college and is planning on still moving despite I will have no where to go because I'm currently a community college student. I work as a Security guard barely able to afford my Bill's and college so if she does this I have no choice but to drop out and find a better job. Now that's basically the issues with my family now on to people. Every time I moved as a kid I was an outsider a kid who clearly didnt fit in. This pushed me to getting bullied from the kindergarten to this present day  as well as the fact I'm a twig I weigh 120 currently and have always been pretty skinny, also I wear glasses and a bookworm. When I got older regardless of how bad things seemed I always pushed myself to endure the pain and move forward. I mean as they always say ""things will get better"". When I got to the age of relationships I was never even noticed no matter how big that smile I put on my face was no matter what I did to seem like the BEST GUY EVER! I tried over and over again. First thing I got was flat out rejection normally followed up with a comment on how I'm ugly or a waste of air. The next thing I got was ignored. Then i was told I'm not looking for anyone and that person was dating someone the next day. The final step was imeaditly friendzoned ""your an amazing guy really I just dont want our friendship to end"" then they stopped talking to me 3 days later. In highschool though I'm pretty sure every guy knows what I'm talking about when I say I was a walking dick in highschool I just wanted to do things so bad because I had to already put up and watch people being so lovey dovey and happy together. so I found this chick she was older then me and was down for a one night stand. I HATED myself since that day just knowing I lost my v-card to a one night stand chick who didnt care about me what so ever. Though it didnt stop me from trying to meet girls and i had 3 more one night stands since that point. No actually meaningful relationships. So yeah my love life is pretty bad. All that time I spent looking for a relationship just led me to being used or manipulated by people. Just the other day a girl I was talking to for 2 almost three weeks that I was getting pretty close to something with hung out in my car and had a romantic day and said we were going to make things official and we made out for like 2 hours I felt so happy that things might be looking up for me. Unfortunately just the day after she went to her ex's house and slept with him and told me she had no real feelings for me and used me to get back with her ex. I got played like a fucking fiddle. So I dont know if I should even bother hoping I might meet a girl who will actually show me the time to care about me. Which is hard not to because my dad never having once cared about me no matter how many awards or achievements i earned he never said anything about them or came to any ceremonies. Back on the topic besides females I never had really any true friends everyone who I thought was a friend (even online friends) turned around to  stab me in the back, blackmail me, created rumors, or just used me as the friend groups punching bag. This has never been encouraging but I kept hiding my pain and internalize my stress while keeping that fake smile on my face. Now about college I failed 2 classes my first semester  I'm on my second semester now but the reason I failed those 2 classes was the fact that the professors didnt like that I sit in class not asking questions. Even though I understand the work and I dont ask questions because I feel dumb and like a burden. They made me fail by deleting one of the major assignments out of the system on the last day just to screw me. I went to the dean even though he just told me he cant side against his professors it showed that it wasnt submitted. Then they told me I was on probation so I couldnt retake those classes on top of this semester's course load so now I'm going to be behind 2 classes. Now on to the medical issues I've not had any real bad things happen to me other then my dad causing me a back injury that's permanent. Although just a few weeks ago I went in because I noticed a wierd lump next to one of my testicles and now I'm told it might be cancer i need to get an ultrasound to hopefully see it's not. I've skipped out on going to the ultrasound appointment because with all the stress I have do I really want a chance to add cancer on top of that. That's as much as I'm willing to share as of right now. So I would love to hear some advice on what you guys think I should do I left out the fact that the career I want to get into I most likely will never get it due to some situations that happend. But I'm just looking for advice on where should I direct any last strength I have to moving forward.

172,"TL;DR - My manager who‚Äôs been at this family owned dental office I work at for 12 years bullies most of her female employees and then acts fake-nice afterwards. It‚Äôs starting to wear on mine and a majority of my coworker‚Äôs patience and nerves. All management treats us like high schoolers. One of my old coworkers even quit and pointed a finger at M, blaming her for her reason for quitting. 

I work at a family owned, private dental office run by a rather tight knit group of managers and owners. My family and I are patients here so I decided it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to work there too as I was looking for an upgrade from my lifeguard/swim instructor job. This job pays well and takes care of me rather well. I get along fantastically with all my coworkers since we receptionists are all mostly a group of women in our 20s and 30s with the exception of two men. 

My manager, M, is a woman in her 30s who has worked here for 12+ years. She‚Äôs good friends with the owners and General Manager (GM), along with both of the men who work in our office. When I first started here, I was having a rough time and M kept calling out my mistakes. I thought this was normal because I was new and learning and actually was making mistakes. Shortly after I started, my coworker (let‚Äôs call her N) sat in GM‚Äôs office sobbing and talking with GM. 

Later, I was pulled in and asked by GM if I felt bullied by M. At the time, this came as a shock to me. I said, no of course not! M may have been kind of blunt with how she pointed out my mistakes but I didn‚Äôt feel bullied. GM dismissed me after a conversation about wanting to create an open work environment where any conflict can be settled professionally and with help from management if need be. 

Months later, I‚Äôm finally starting to understand why N said M was bullying me. M goes through periods of highs and lows throughout the day, and when she does catch any mistakes I make, it feels almost like she‚Äôs berating me and talking down to me about it. The words she used were professional enough but it was the tone of voice she used that left me sitting in my chair feeling a little beat down or humiliated for my mistake. I put up with it for a couple more months giving her the benefit of doubt - she‚Äôs a manager juggling a lot of work, she must be stressed and doesn‚Äôt know how to handle it well. 

M was training everyone differently or telling us to do X way but later she‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúNo, no. You have to do it Z and Y way.‚Äù GM would tell us one thing, M would say another. M would usually tell us how we were messing up and tell us to fix it. Asking questions to M was almost out of the question - M always seemed annoyed, like we were wasting her time. I‚Äôm the type of person who prefers to ask to make sure I did something correctly, even if I know it‚Äôs not wrong. Just to be double sure. Normally this is met with an expression and tone that screams, ‚Äúseriously? why are you bothering me with this?‚Äù 

Recently, my coworker (let‚Äôs call her A) told me she had been feeling the exact same way. We went to GM to talk about this and he gave us tips about how to handle the situation. Said we should talk to her to let her know how we feel. He said, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened‚Äù (I‚Äôm thinking of the N-incident) and said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt say anything to her until you speak to her.‚Äù A later revealed to me that GM spoke to M already, told her thing A told him in private. M apologized to A but according to A, it felt like she apologized bc she had to as a manager. M even told her, ‚ÄúAnd remember, whatever you say to anyone, I eventually hear about it.‚Äù 

I learned today that all of my other female coworkers have been feeling this tension, this wall of fakeness M puts up to placate us for a week or two before she drops back into her old ways.  However, neither of our male employees feel this way. They just say, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just busy all the time,‚Äù but admit they walk on eggshells around her when asking questions too. We realized this was a problem long before any of us came to this office and hadn‚Äôt been resolved. A expressed that she can no longer trust talking to ANY of the managers, the owner included, because they all protect M and let her off when incidents like this arise. Even J, an employee like us who recently was given more a managerial work, tends to blab to M about private conversations we have when it concerns M and how she makes us feel. 

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. My manager is, clearly, not going to be fired any time soon because she‚Äôs been here so long and is the only one who knows how to run the office aside from GM. A couple employees have left because of M, that I know of, but nothing happens and nothing changes. I love my job and the people I work with, but whenever M is in the office, there‚Äôs always an underlying tension and sense of discomfort. Talking with her casually feels forced because I can‚Äôt even talk to her professionally without feeling like I‚Äôm being a nuisance. I‚Äôm also not financially in a place to leave this job either - I‚Äôm in school part time and supporting my fianc√© who is in between jobs. I don‚Äôt want to quit but if this continues, I may end up like N crying in GM‚Äôs office while I point fingers at M. 

Any advice on how to handle this?",07Mar2020,1
173,"I wore a pair of high heels to my prom a few years ago, towards end of prom, I was sitting down with my friends at a table because my feet were hurting. My friends noticed that the front of my shoes on the outside was this red/pink color and they asked me if it was blood or not and I told them I didn't know because I honestly didn't feel any intense pain other than the pain you get when you walk in heels for too long. I knew it most likely wasn't dirt since it look like it was stained on there but I don't know how blood could get from inside to the outside of a shoe.

Last weekend I met up with a girl I have been with for the past 2 months but not officially dating. We were out drinking at the bar and I got too drunk which led to me saying some mean things to her after I had blacked out. I woke up the next morning with an insane feeling of guilt and saw that I had texted her after I had left the bar by myself. I texted her profusely apologizing and trying to explain that I did not mean what I had said to her. I spent the whole day trying to apologize but I wasn‚Äôt really getting anywhere with it. A few days later we began texting/snap chatting again but not the same as it was before. I only get responses from her maybe once or twice ever 3-4 hours.

184,"A year ago, I lived with a roommate in an apartment with a landlord that only accepts rent in the form of a check mailed to his PO Box. In the final 2 months of the lease, there was an issue with rent not being paid without my knowledge.

To clarify, I do not have a checkbook but my roommate does. I would pay my roommate digitally through Venmo/Paypal/etc and she would write the check and we would mail it to the landlord. For the last two months of the lease I was out of town for the summer. I paid my roommate virtually and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 

Apparently, the check got lost in the mail one month and the second check had the same problem. My roommate was well aware of this and did not tell me any of this had happened. I ended up getting an email from landlord saying we might get evicted bc rent was not paid and she finally explained it all and said it was all handled. 

Fast forward a few months later, we are moved into our new place and all of MY money from my bank account was garnished. Turns out we were summoned to court for the rent issue (we never got the letter bc we moved to a new place) and the court ruled in favor of the landlord. Mind you, she said it was all handled and I had digitally sent her the rent money each time. 

LET ME REITERATE... all of MY money was garnished and not my roommates bc she ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù changed banks around that time so they couldn‚Äôt access her account.

This incident left an emotional and financial burden on me as I was just finishing up undergrad in a month and was forced to move out of that toxic environment and commute 2 hours for my classes in order to graduate. 

I understand I can‚Äôt do anything about the landlord. But is there any way I can sue my roommate?",07Mar2020,1
185,"Not sure why people say ‚Äúsorry for formatting I‚Äôm on mobile‚Äù but there it is. (Also grammar for I suck). 

Let‚Äôs give a little background into my life for what it is currently at the moment. I live with my mom and one year younger sister as a senior in high school. I wouldn‚Äôt really say my mom is verbally abusive, I mean she kinda is but that‚Äôs a different story for a different day. As the first in my family to make it in schooling past sophomore year my mom really wants me to go to prom. 

The issue is not that she want me to go to prom but with the circumstances revolving how I got my ‚Äúdate‚Äù.

Let me start off with a little side note that I‚Äôm definitely gay despite best efforts to be otherwise. Of course she doesn‚Äôt know this and of course I have plenty of reason to believe that she doesn‚Äôt really like gay people either but again, another story for a different time. 

Leading up to before the incident, I made it extremely clear that I didn‚Äôt want to go. This was also made very evident to my sister. But despite this, my mom asked my sister to find me a date. Yes very awkward. 

Well she did find me one. Still I told them I didn‚Äôt want to go but still they didn‚Äôt listen and they invited her over. She came with some of her friends and we were hanging around and all of a sudden my mom pops in and asks what everyone is doing for prom. 

Never had I ever been so frustrated with the absolutely sheer amount of disregard she showed towards my own feelings. I saw this manipulation clearly and one thing led to another and the girl ended up saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a date yet sadly‚Äù and my wonderful sister, in what happened to be in sheer silence of the peers all around her said ‚Äúwell u/me would love to go with you, isn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù

Me saying no was never an option. My mom looking at me, me sister looking at me, her friends looking at me, and especially this poor girl that has been roped into a hopeless relationship doomed from the start all staring at me as I said yes. 

Let me just add that this girl is absolutely amazing and in no way deserves any of this but despite how much I try I just feel like an asshole. (Let me also add that this is like the third time I‚Äôve met her, again very awkward. ) I just don‚Äôt have any interest in going with her but still, I said yes. She‚Äôs trying hard to get to know me but Im basically just lying to her and wasting her time. Like I think she‚Äôs flirting with me and I‚Äôm just like ignoring it idk what the hell to do I just don‚Äôt work like that ( I know, complete asshole on my part, I‚Äôm regretting just not saying no I‚Äôm the first place). 

So I guess my question is what now. As much as I want to call it all off and never think of it ever again, the prom is in about two weeks. She has a dress already, my mom rented a limo, and she says she can‚Äôt wait to go. I‚Äôve been acting straight for this long what‚Äôs just a little longer is the thought that keeps on coming up but the longer I wait the longer she‚Äôs stuck with me and I feel as though that is way worse.",07Mar2020,1
187,"Could really use advice as soon as possible, I'll explain now:

I am a high school junior enrolled in a school with approximately less than 300 students. Last night, a sophomore, 16 years old, very well known and loved by quite literally everyone passed away in a car accident last night. He and a friend were going down a rocky, dangerous road, at 100 mph, and the friend lost control of the vehicle. The kid who passed away was not wearing a seatbelt. Everyone loves this kid. We all have memories with him. He was an amazing athlete, in many sports, straight A student, always knew how to cheer people up. Just yesterday he was solving problems on the board in our chemistry class, and he's just gone. 

Today is my best friend's birthday and she felt immense guilt because the entire school was dead silent today. It felt like a funeral visitation. Everyone was crying. Everyone was hurting. People who never talked to each other were comforting each other, this is such a massive thing for a small community like the one we live in.

I feel so selfish. Before all of this, I was planning to ask one of my best friends to prom today. The thing is, this best friend knew the kid who passed away. He's hurting so bad, pushing people away at the moment. We were going to hang out today, but then the news hit. We haven't really spoken to each other all day, but I've let it be known that I'm here for him.

188,"This is a throwaway account just bc. Also sorry for my english I'm not fluent yet.

I don't live with my dad and my mom was the one who raised me. A couple of times a year I go see my dad and his family because they live far. I have a little brother, he's 3, and he's taking a quite longer time to comprehend some things (he still doesn't speak coherently, like at all). I love him to pieces.

He isn't ""potty trained"" yet, but his kindergarten requires kids to be and my dad and step mom just didn't want to keep buying diapers. He tells us when he need to pee, but not to shit, and so he does it anywhere. There's other things that frustrate my dad and his gf about him but this is by far the biggest. They just scream at him whenever he does it, grounding him and shit. The last time he did it though (couple of hours ago), my dad just got mad and started screaming and hit my brother. It maybe wouldn't have affected me as much if it had been just one hit, but they were four and HARD, just inciting him to cry more as my dad shouted him to stop crying. 

I was just feeling really impotent at that point. I don't understand how kid's minds work, but I know that my brother just doesn't understand and my dad just justifies it saying that it's too much. I don't know enough about raising a child a parenting. My only experience with this is that my mom used to punch me in the head when I was like 11 or so and did some dumb kid thing that got her frustrated, which only proved to her that it made both of us more miserable, because I failed to see the wrong of my actions, only the pain (which is why she's taking the other path with my 5 y/o sister). 

My dad didn't go through the really tough parts of raising me, he's just experiencing those now, and I know he means well but I also know how he can get at times. I get exhausted staying only a week with him, so I'm concerned about how my brother would turn out.

If any of you can tell me if this is right or wrong, If I should calm down or idk (or how to make my brother start understanding things) would be appreciated. I just don't want bad things to happen.",07Mar2020,1

196,"This happened sometime in September of 2019, but I was too afraid to tell anyone about the situation. I see this student in my gym class everyday and it eventually got to a point where I would start trembling from anxiety at the sight of him.

I held my ground and didn't have sex with him, but he still touched and stroked me around my waist and thighs. I told my study hall teacher about this today and she told the principal, but he said he didn't do anything punishable. I completely disagree that he what he did was unpunishable and so does my teacher. Just because I didn't get raped doesn't mean the student's actions were okay and he can get off scot free.

208,"I‚Äôm very appalled that this is happening right now. I think the best way to describe what‚Äôs going through my head is ‚Äúshock‚Äù. I‚Äôm in complete shock that this event is something I‚Äôm writing about because I never thought I would be wondering if anyone could shed some light to this enigma of mine. 

Last month, my husband and I watched a Netflix series every day for a whole week/weekend.  Since we both have to work early in the morning, we tend to only watch one episode a night and binge watch the remaining episodes during the weekend.  We finished watching the second season of ‚Äúgood girls‚Äù and as usual, we began looking for another series to watch for the next week. We found one that got our attention and started watching it. We watched the first episode that Sunday night and we were hooked. As usual, we watched one episode every day throughout the week and on the weekend we finished the first season. Both of us have a habit of coming up with theories of what‚Äôs going to happen in the next episode, specially when it‚Äôs left in cliff hanger. We talked about the series during the week and what not. 

The month went by and we watched other tv series. The series that we‚Äôre watching now is boring and today I was looking for something else to get hooked on. As I am browsing Netflix, I tell my husband that I hope they come out with a second season of ‚ÄúWhat happened to Adam Legacy?‚Äù And he looks at me and tells me he‚Äôs never watched that show before. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because we‚Äôve watched a few since February. I remind him what the plot is about and the characters and he just looks at me and says (jokingly of course lol) ‚Äúyou must have me confused with someone else because I‚Äôve never watched that.‚Äù 

I tell him that we both watched it together and we loved it. The plot was so good and the twist was really unpredictable. So,  I start looking for it on Netflix to show him what I‚Äôm talking about. I typed the name and nothing comes up. I‚Äôm super confused but at that point I thought that maybe the content had been removed. So I google it and nothing. Not one thing comes up on my search that resembles this show.  I know for sure we didn‚Äôt watch it on YouTube tv, but I looked anyway and again, nothing. I looked on Hulu, Amazon, Disney and nothing. I simply cannot find the show anywhere!! 

I explain to him again the plot, the names of the characters and I ended up telling him the whole season of it but he cannot remember ever even hearing of it. And apparently not even google has heard of it either. I‚Äôve looked everywhere, I‚Äôve typed the name of the series, the plot, everything and it does not exist. I‚Äôm in shock that I seem to be imagining this entire fucking thing! I‚Äôm trying to find a reasonable explanation as to wtf is happening but I have no idea where to even begin. 

I know that Netflix series is real! I can‚Äôt believe this. I know is not a book either. I havent read a book since October. The name of the series intrigued me a lot because it sounds a little funny. So I know it exists. I watched it all, I know all the characters and the entire story!! I even remember the small details of the scenes and the cover of it. How can it not exist? What the hell did I watch then? 

Has anyone ever heard of it? Did I have a long ass dream, so vividly I‚Äôm successfully confusing it with reality??",07Mar2020,1

We hang out on the weekends because we are both busy during the week. In person we have a great time with each other. But over the phone texting, she is super short with me and it makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt even want to talk. Like yesterday she snapchatted me late and i was half asleep and opened it but didn‚Äôt respond. She got a little upset that I didn‚Äôt respond and that I hadn‚Äôt talked to her all day.

215,"I am 23 years old and have been offered a job as a firefighter with my local department. 

Pros: I have no criminal record, excellent credit, two AA degrees and a BS degree. 

Cons: My work history is not the best. My first job was at a 24 hour gym. I worked there for about 2 years before getting fired for shooting basketballs during a graveyard shift. I normally did this during graveyard shifts to help me stay awake and the manager that hired me did not have an issue with this. I was asked to cover for a different gym location graveyard shift and the manager from that location reviewed the cameras the night I covered for their gym and reported me shooting basketballs to corporate, resulting in my termination. I had no other issues while at my first job. 

My second job was at a notorious fast food restaurant. I worked there for about a year and a half and had two work behavior related issues while I was there. The first incident was when me and another co-worker got into a verbal altercation resulting in me telling my co-worker that they were ""acting like a bitch/being a bitch"" resulting in both of us receiving written behavioral warnings. This co-worker and I started work at 5am and it would be only us two in the store for a few hours before the managers and other co-workers arrived. This incident occurred  while it was just us two in the restaurant. The co-worker and I continued to work together after our written warnings for a few months after that without any other incidents. My second incident while at the fast food restaurant came as a customer complaint. I took the customers order and they complained to my manager claiming that I was the rudest person they have ever met. I don't believe I was being rude but I certainly know I was not the rudest person she's ever met. I struggle with putting on the fake overly happy persona that restaurant is known for. This complaint resulted in me resigning that day without proper notice. I was over that job and planned to quit once my semester for school started anyway. 

My third job I had no behavioral incidents.

Basically I was really close with my young female cousin who was probably around 6 or 7 at this time, and I made a very regrettable decision one night. One night while my relatives were staying over at my house, I was down in my basement playing around with my little cousin like normal.

Situation: My girlfriend rear ended a truck 2 days ago, the damage seemed minimal with the hood being crumpled up and the radiator being punctured. They sent out an appraiser and approved $3900 for the repairs. My deductible is $1000 so I'm assuming the total cost of the repair can be $4900. The car was taken to the body shop where they ""found additional damage"" and tried to increase the damage amount covered to $5100, this request was denied. I called USAA and they said my car was now considered total loss and they'd contact me Monday about getting me a check for what it's worth. I looked up the value of the car at dealers around me and they were around 8-9k so I'm assuming they're going to lowball my settlement or give me the cost of the repair as my total loss settlement. I cannot get a car with these features and this low of mileage(around 50k) for anything under like 9-10k not considering all the taxes, fees, and filing.

We talk for about 3 days and we are both slightly sick and busy so we haven't seen each other since we met. Around day 3 or 4 we end up meeting at the gym again and we workout together. Everything goes well and was good. The next day I dont see her and then the next day we face time for about 2 hours. During this we get really deep into our personal lives and getting to know each other. I asked the question of when was the last time you cried and she said that she cries basically every day. Not really because she is depressed but because sometimes she just gets frustrated and cries. She has been doing yoga for 5 years and worksout at least once a day. I would think she wouldn't cry that much unless either she has a mental disorder or she is hiding something. When I hangout with her I get a weird vibe sometimes where its almost like she isnt quite fully there in the conversation. When I would bring up something deep in a conversation she would think of a response and I could tell she wasn't thinking about the topic but more of a response to what I just said.

229,"* I'm posting this from my point of view to gain advice for my dad, who does not use reddit *

My dad's company is paying for him and some other employees to go to Vegas for a few days next week.  We live in a more rural area of the country, and our state has yet to have its first case of the virus. 

My dad isn't nervous about the virus at all.  He believes that this trip is once in a lifetime, and he will never have a free trip to Vegas again.  He believes that the thought that he would catch the Corona virus is so low, as this is vegas not china or another highly infected area, and that this shouldn't even be a worry.  Besides, if it's that contagious wouldn't he catch it anyway from his coworkers when they come back?

My stepmom, on the other hand, is freaking out.  With vegas being a big city, she believes that there could be a possibility of him catching it. She works in supply chain management, and the restrictions of travel and transport due to the virus is reinforcing her fears. She believes that with her elderly father living with them, it is unfair to risk his health, no matter how low the probability is.  She has made the compromise that if he wants to go to vegas, he would have to quarantine himself for 14 days after coming back.  (Quarantine being living in the horse trailer living quarters and avoiding the house)

I guess the advice I am asking for is multi-layered. Personally I support my dad in this arguement simply because I don't believe that there is a substantial outbreak worry in vegas, but I understand my stepmom fears.  

First, though I think I know the answer, I gotta ask. Is my stepmom justified in her rationale? Should my dad avoid vegas? 

If not, how could he convince her? 

My dad seems to be favoring the idea of just going and quarantining himself afterwards, but I feel like there is a better solution here then my dad living out of a horse trailer for two weeks.",07Mar2020,1

237,"Originally posted to AITA but got removed for metioning abuse. 

We're both in eighth grade (14).  The abusive person (12) will be called Hittney.  

In seventh grade, my best friend and I met this girl named Hittney.  She was interested in a lot of the same shows, games, animes, etc as us.

She was fun, however, she would hit, slap, kick, punch, and bite people (especially ME and MY BOYFRIEND) for fun.  She never took no for an answer and didn't care about anyone's thoughts or feelings.  

My best friend and I tried to report Hittney for this stuff a few times last year.  Nothing ever really changed.  

Near the last few months of school I finally cut ties and told Hittney goodbye.  My best friend did too.

The start of eight grade, she asked me if I wanted to be friends again, claiming to have changed.  I decided to be friends with her, only because I didn't want to have to avoid all my friends because she was there.  

I enjoyed being friends with her again.  She wasn't harming anyone anymore.  She had what some call ""crackhead energy"" but like √ó10 (tbf, she does have some mental issues)

 My friend, let's call her Furry, was having a sleepover.  Me, my BFF, another friend we'll call Anime, and Hittney were all there.  

Hittney wasn't taking ""no"" for an answer, some petty stuff happened, and her mom had to come pick her up.  After she left everyone just kind of shared their feelings about her.  Despite BFF and I being the only people that had ever stood up to Hittney, we realized how much she effected other people too.  

Furry and BFF cut contact with her.  

Anime did too, but for other reasons then ours.  

I didn't really know what to do.  I had really started liking Hittney again and suddenly all that liking was gone.  The following weekday I was the only person from the sleepover who talked to her.  I should have just stopped talking but I wasn't sure how.  

Eventually, a different friend (a seventh grader called Tiny) and Hittney were ""playing"". She was choking Tiny, and Tiny couldn't breathe.  She cried and begged Hittney to stop.  Idk what happened cause and wasn't told what was happening until afterwards. 

Tiny cut contact with her.  

I cut contact with her but I didn't say anything.  I didn't know what to say.  I just ignored her.  

Today I returned an insult to her that she threw at someone else.  I don't want to say what it was but it was vulgar.  I felt bad so I texted her an apology.  

These are the text messages between us, I regret what I said a quite bit.  It wasn't worded the best way it could have been, but I was just SO upset.  

http://imgur.com/a/CicA2Om

I'm sick of the way she treats everyone in general, and I regret becoming friends with her again.  Despite her being abusive, I'm still sorry for hurting her.  

Was I justified in faking our friendship?  What should I have handled differently and what can I do to improve situations like this going forward?",07Mar2020,1
239,"I'm (20M) honestly doing really horrible mentally.
I can't find a job (6 applications within the last two days and more before that)  and my living situation isn't great. I live with my mom and her husband. The bills never get paid on time and we haven't had a dryer in weeks. I barely sleep (less than 10 hours this whole week) I'm always stressed and feel sick I sleep in the laundry room/mine and 3 others living room (not including my mom and her SO) and don't have a bed. 
I'm barely eating because I've yet to find a job.

Basically to the point;
I'm fucking depressed as hell, don't want to talk to my brothers about it because they all have more important shit to worry about (we're all trying to move out, it's toxic for all of us) also don't really know how to talk about it. And no friends to talk to.  

I know I would be a bit less stressed if I could actually find a fucking job but it's starting to feel impossible. I've never been to school (parents didn't allow me too, long story üò¨) and wasn't allowed to have a real job. I'm even trying to apply at McDonald's and shit like that.

Is it too late for me? Did I fuck everything up? How can I go about talking to someone about feeling like life's not worth it? Nothing fun anymore, I've lost interest in everything I've loved. Music doesn't even sound right anymore and games are no fun. 

Side note; 
I also feel as if I'll be alone for most of my life if not all. Never been in a relationship (not for the lack of putting my self out there) and never know what to say. I'm a mess and I think I need therapy..

240,"So, long story, but bear with me. I was going out to check the mail when I saw a kid jogging behind a huge dog with no collar on. He was going ""come back here, doggy!"", and thru asking him lots of questions I got the impression he didn't actually know this dog at all. First he said he found it, then he said it was his, then he said it climbed the fence, he said he didn't know its name and then he said his dad called it Zeus, etc. This dog was looking very concerned and confused, very stressed out. I eventually got a rope tied onto him, and my husband found the boy's mom, who confirmed they did not  have a dog and didn't know this animal. We called animal control, and only after the dog was taken to the shelter did I get out of the boy that the dog was ""behind that fence over there."" (It was a long fence spanning several businesses and properties, so I have no way of knowing which section of fence, business, apartment, or home he meant.)

Now, I used to work at the shelter in question, so I know that the dog's owners are in for a crapload of city fines and charges- dog at large, no license visible, no rabies tag visible at minimum, plus the boarding and redemption fees. I contacted a friend who still works there to tell her what I witnessed, and let her know the boy may have let this dog out but I could t be sure, so if the owners insist that their dog was contained, they might be telling the truth and in that case, to see if they could reduce some of the fines. But I'm wondering how far my responsibility goes.

I cannot prove that the boy let the dog out, but if he did, it's not fair for the owners to pay hundreds of dollars for his shenanigans. But I also don't know the boy very well, or his mom, who was absolutely irate that the boy would be telling bald faced lies (When my husband asked her ""do you have a dog named zeus,"" parroting the boy's nost recent story, the boy shouted ""YES!"" while the mom went ""...No...""). She also seemed to have no idea he'd left the quad area of our apartment complex and gave him a verbal thrashing for running off when he apparently slipped back out to come see what was going on with animal control.
So do I let her know of my suspicions and see if she can get the truth out of him? Or would giving her my theory mess with the truth, kind of leading the witness so to speak? If the owners find the dog at the shelter but don't question it, is it even really a problem? My friend working at the shelter has my side of the story, so is that the end of my obligation? What happens if the owners do want to refute the charges, do I fess up and rat on the kid to them so they can take it to municipal court and try and get the charges dropped, even tho I can't be certain he did what my gut is telling  me he probably did?

I have no way to know for sure whether the kid interfered with a dog chilling at home, or if he found a stray and was trying to bring it back to his house. I just don't know why the boy would tell so many contradictory lies. The most consistent theme involved the dog being over a fence which he was trying to point out to me when the mom busted him for leaving the house again.
For reference, the boy is somewhere around 7 or 8 years old by my best estimate.

I know I'm probably overthinking this and just need to stop worrying and thinking about it, but I'd appreciate an outside perspective.",07Mar2020,1

251,"I'll try to keep this short and omit as many details as possible for privacy. r/jobs wont let me post this on a throwaway.

About a year ago I joined a construction union after hearing about the salary. I passed the try out evaluation and joined the local. On my first day I literally thought ""oh my god this is a terrible career what did I sign up for."" I tried to tough it out anyway. Things were sub par and being the new apprentice made me the target on the job.

All this was manageable albeit miserable. Things got hairy my 4th week there.

My foreman made me do some really dangerous work and I found myself hundreds of feet off the ground with no harness. Looking back I should have quit that day, but I told myself to tough it out and maybe that was a one time thing.

I had to do the same thing the next day and my foreman got really angry because I was going slow so I wouldn't fall over the edge to my death. He saw how scared I was and forced me to finish the job which I did.

3 days later he laid me off, this was last summer. The union ended up being okay with the situation because the journeymen said I was a hard worker and I had no experience.

Then months go by, and there's no work I can get on. 

2 months later I ended up getting ONE DAY with another company because a guy was desperate for a day crew for one project. That day I had to climb a terrifying contraption maybe 200 feet on the side of a highway to get to the top level. It was one of those parts where multiple highways intersect. 

I climbed it but was still terrified climbing and having a busy highway full of traffic driving on one side on the other side it's a 150 foot fall to my death.

I got up but was still shaken by the experience and then had to do brutal work which at one point  I was moving a tool so heavy (over 100lbs and 15 feet long) while hanging off the side of the highway standing on planks. At one point the guys all asked if I was okay because it probably looked like this tool was going to push me off the scaffold due to it's weight. 

The foreman on that job liked me but I was laid off again as it wasn't his call. I've now been unemployed for close to 6 months if you count that day but 8 months in reality.

I've come to realize that I just don't think I'm cut out for this kind of work. 50% of apprentices actually quit in this local.

I have other experience with sales, business, and accounting.

I've been working with a family member in his office to help with tax season and to get some light accounting experience. Now I'm not tooting my horn here but it's gotten to the point where I actually do the vast majority of the tax returns and really enjoy the work. I didn't attend college right out of high school because I had a lucrative opportunity but that fell apart in 2018.

So I've really been thinking about quitting my apprenticeship and going back to school to get an accounting degree. I have the means to do this and I'm only in my 20s, no kids or wife to support.

I can actually take my family member's practice over in the future without a degree but I want to have my options completely open and really feel this is a great reason to go back to school.

I'm much more suited for the white collar world than the trades, and I don't want to have to worry about getting killed or an occupational disease. 

I would however appreciate the community's thoughts on this. I wasn't the best student when I was younger because I didn't apply myself. However, now that I'm older, determined, and focused I really feel this is feasible and the right choice.

TL:DR construction is life threatening and brutal, I've fallen in love with accounting and personal finance and want to go back to school to pursue it. However I feel conflicted about quitting my apprenticeship. Would love to hear people's thoughts.",07Mar2020,1

257,"So I moved into this basement apartment back in June. My landlord lives upstairs and I occupy the basement. We‚Äôve had a good relationship, and he doesn‚Äôt bother me, I don‚Äôt bother him. I always pay the rent on time, I help out where I can, I keep the place clean and he never bugs me about anything. 

... except he‚Äôs had this weird thing with my girlfriend coming over. My girlfriend comes over 4-5 times a week. He asked me in August and September if she was moving in and when I replied no he asked if I could limit her coming over to about 2 or 3 days a week. I said I would try my best so we‚Äôve been trying to split days at her parents house and mine. 

In December he again brought it up and said that the utilities have gone up a bit. To be completely honest, I‚Äôm not sure what additional utilities she uses her besides maybe some water. But I said I understood and so she started staying at her parents one week, coming over the next week. 

Last night he sent me a text and said ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù. When I got home I knocked on his door and he told me to sit down. He said that the utilities have skyrocketed more than $150 in the last 3 months. He mentioned it‚Äôs because my girlfriend is over (she‚Äôs been coming over the same amount since I moved in back in June, and in fact less since December). I responded that I wasn‚Äôt sure how this was possible and he gave me a big talk about how he‚Äôs been renting for years and he‚Äôs never seen it spike this much. 

This is when he brought up what I assume to be the actual problem. He said money has been tight and he doesn‚Äôt want to lose his house so he can‚Äôt afford additional utilities (I‚Äôm living in his basement so the $1300 a month I pay goes towards his principal residence).He said either he increases the rent by $100 starting in April or I have to move out. He said he loves me as a tenant and would hate to see me leave but he can‚Äôt afford it. 

Now, I know this is illegal but I‚Äôm also weighing my options here. Imo creating an awkward situation between me and him doesn‚Äôt help me any. So I tried to make an argument and when he became heated I told him no worries, give me the weekend to think about it. Trying to make a fuss and tell him it‚Äôs illegal would just make living here terrible, so it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. 

Honestly, I can‚Äôt afford an additional $100 and it is an insane asking price. I have a hard time believing his utilities are that much more and I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs hard up for money and wants to rent his basement for more money. I was thinking of asking to see the bills so I can have proof that they‚Äôve gone up, but I‚Äôm also kind of in a place where I just want to leave so there‚Äôs awkward situation here.

I grew up with a non-lavish life. My father shot himself when I was 6, step parents of 12 years divorced, etc. bullshit. My boyfriend has always had the same parents and they‚Äôre super amazing, and partly rich, so they didn‚Äôt mind spending money on me every now and then (although I never asked them to and begged them not to). They gave me a part of that life. Throughout those 6 months, his dad would come home from work and every other week we would have a pretty long conversation to vent and talk and learn more about each other or knowledgeable things as well. Life stuff. I eventually looked up to him as a father figure and I know one day he may well be my father in law. 

After 6 months, we moved again back 14 hours down, me and his dad never talk on the phone really. 

He drove down 14 hours to drop off my boyfriend‚Äôs car. We will take him back in two days to the airport to fly back up.

My mental and physical health are at an all time low. Recently I've been having intrusive thoughts like ""I should crash my car on the way to work, at least I'd get some time off"". I don't plan on acting on them at all but I've taken it as a red flag.

Last summer I tried getting off of night shift and into another position at the university but they lied to be about scheduling. They said Mon - Fri but in reality it was all over the place and I'd have to work weekends and holidays. I threw such a fit with HR that they gave me my old position back, back on night shift.

Yet I have a 3.0 gpa at my community college, but it‚Äôs practically useless because of the 1.4 gpa from my old university that haunts me since I have to average both gpas out when I transfer.  

Right when I thought I was set to transfer this spring for next fall 2020, I realized I forgot to include my old university‚Äôs transcripts.... which basically means if the school finds out I can get expelled while attending in the future. 

I‚Äôve been able to get internships through networks outside of school, but to move on to even bigger ones they require that I at least be a junior or senior at a university.... eventually even if I stop attending school I still need a bachelors degree to apply to jobs in my field.

267,"I am an only child, immigrant, college student (F22), and have a speech impediment, a stutter. 

It does not always flare up but when it does it takes great effort to speak and the fear of taking too long to speak and annoying others, or simply the effort it takes to speak leads to anxiety and a feeling of exhaustion. So I dont make many friends, and I dont leave my room much. 

My stutter flares up when I speak Spanish because of the strong accent which has lead me to not speak to my parents very much (they dont speak English) Now my mother has been yelling at me  asking me what is my problem, do I hate her, why dont I talk to her, why I dont have any friends.

She has told me that I have no reason to act like this because she raised me better than that and I better not leave her when I graduate college like kids do be because she gave me a good life and I have to be thankful for it. 

I am happy in my room playing video games, reading and drawing. 

she thinks that I have some plot to hurt myself or someone else and that I am depressed. Which I do not I am very happy living my life, how do I make her see that I am not depressed or acting anyway, I JUST FUCKING HAVE A SPEECH INPEDIMENT THAT SHE HAS REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGED FOR SOME REASON.",07Mar2020,1
268,"Recently reached the one year anniversary of my dad dying, but find that I really don't give him much thought. He wasn't exactly Prince Charming, to me anyway, his only daughter. Growing up I was extremely shy and quiet. Even as an adult I tend to just fade into the woodwork in social settings. Definitely no physical abuse or bad stuff like that, but I spent a lifetime of him laughing at me. If something went wrong for me, he couldn't get enough and just found it hilarious. Teased me unmercifully about stuff in front of other family members who just stood there gawking and smirking at me because that kind of gave them permission to laugh at me too  (see the caliber of family I grew up in?) Being that shy I guess just made me an easy target. Yet the DILs and granddaughter in laws have gotten the red carpet treatment while he laughs at me in front of them. And they post this shit on their Facebook about 'missing that man and his stories' . I distanced myself from most of the family, and even him during the last few years of his poor health. I really give him little thought and his passing hasn't made much difference in my life. I feel just a twinge of guilt that his life and now death really mean little to me. Should I?

269,"Ever since I (19F) started college in august 2019 my parents have made me miserable. They don‚Äôt support my relationship with my boyfriend of 6 months because he didn‚Äôt finish college. When I am home from school they shame me for my relationship, limit where I can drive, and make me feel very isolated. They have an idea of the type of person I should be while in college, and since I don‚Äôt party and am not dating multiple guys at once, they are judgemental and disappointed all the time. I get really good grades and have a big academic scholarship from my university. Despite this, my parents will not be happy for me unless my social and romantic life is exactly what they imagine for me. In the past my mom has told me that I am ‚Äútoo good for all of my friends‚Äù which really hurt me. In high school, my parents would blame me for my friend troubles. I for much of high school had no real friends. My dad told me that people didn‚Äôt like me because i have a god complex and my mom told me I was just jealous of girls with boyfriends and not trying hard enough. They have such huge expectations for me and it makes me feel so pressured all the time.

I have begged them time and time again to allow me to be happy as long as I am safe and successful, which I am. I told them just tonight how isolated I feel and how unfairly they are treating me. When I bring this up, all they do is circle back to how they feel about my relationship which has no effect on them. I understand that they want me to date someone in college, but he is an amazing guy and I fell in love with him! At this point I am really anxious all the time and constantly thinking about how much I want to move out for good. The problem is that they pay for a lot in my life and I can‚Äôt afford to move into an apartment (I live in the dorms).

In person it would take you some telepathy to really see that there is something wrong with me. I've learnt to hide, as we all have. It hasn't been 2 day or 2 weeks or few months that I have had those kind of thoughts.

Everyone I know has or is talking behind my back, I have heard rumours that I smoke, drink, use drugs, take steroids and a handfull of things that I can't begin to explain. I am only 17, my middle school was nothing but me being bullied or made fun off, being used or treated as trash. In high school I had a crush on a girl from my class, we were texting, getting to know each other n stuff.... Just how much do I regret ever noticing that this human being even existed, if i could go back and just skip the part with her it would be the best thing.

My home aint a better place either, father is a drinker, sister is a little brat, my mother struggles to make ends meet since my father is a piece of shit, so I do my best to help with whatever I can. I am grateful that I have a bed to sleep in, though it aint always warm.. I am great I have food on the table. I am ashamed of how my home looks so I never have invited someone over.

Solitude is all I know, I have become to be uncomfortable around other people, just because I fear someone would pierce or see thru the shell of the cool and chill dude that makes everybody laugh, and will see what a mess he is when he gets a little privacy.

I am sitting in bed listening to sad songs crying my eyes out for no reason at all, I am really thinking about ending it all tonight. Tho I wonder will someone beside my mom and sister care that I will be dead? My abscense wont make a difference in anyone's life at all. Would anyone even care at all. My existence doesnt matter at all, and if that's the case why should it continue, why not end it tonight. I have promised my mother not to kill myself, but it is really hard to keep the promise.

273,"hello!!

im 15,f. i live w/my dad and my sister, dad is sole custodian.

ive had a slew of health issues for a lil while, my knee has dislocated 4 times in the past year &amp; i JUST had a knee reconstruction surgery.

went to a neurologist at the recommendation of my surgeon, neurologist did a spinal mri, and with those results he said theres a 50/50 chance i have a tethered spinal cord.

it would explain soo much. But i dont have all of the symptoms, i have the some visible ones (toe walking, my calves and legs being extremely tight) but theres a few others and things that could also point to me not.

he said they wouldnt know unless they did an operation. from what they talked about, it sounded really not so bad. small incision, small snip of something in my back, month or so of bedrest, pain is apparently really manageable after the first week or so.

The thing is though, i could also get the surgery and nothing would happen. If my spinal cord isn‚Äôt tethered they did a wholeass operation for nothing. recovery would be less long in that case id imagine but still. itd suck.

my dad and my sister both agree i shouldnt do it. They think of it as since theres no negative consequences of not doing it (The guy said if i didnt have the surgery and i did have a tethered spinal cord id go on living like i am now.) that i just shouldnt do it.

my opinion is that im in constant leg pain, after long amounts of walking my ankles will be so tight i cant get out of bed and it‚Äôs excruciating, i get stared at for walking how i do and i get asked OFTEN about it, im miserable. I see it as a 50/50 chance that my quality of life will improve exponentially. im tearing up thinking about how amazing it would be to be able to walk normally. i dont know what to do, and i sorta need to decide soon.

my family wont stop me if i choose to do it but they absolutely wont be happy (reasons listed above). so i figured maybe i could get some insight here? help is much appreciated",07Mar2020,1

He has no sense of boundaries and isn't respectful at all. But the craziest thing is that my dad is completely on board with this, encouraging even. He says that because my mom is from a very rural area she's never had a boyfriend before (their marriage was arranged) and that it's just casual flirting.

280,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I play lacrosse in college in the north east (US) and i recently got injured (Knee) and have been told that it is very likely I will not be able to return this season. I have realized that lacrosse is the only major thing that I devote my time and energy to outside of school. Now that I am just sitting on the sideline during practice I have all the energy I had before but nothing to direct it at which leads me to just sitting in my room listening to the same few songs over and over again, day after day. This is not a cycle that I want to be in. I have always had problems with committing to activities like video games or tv shows and it is hard for me to get really into a game or tv show so I am discouraged to start anything new because of this. However that being said I realize I need to find something I enjoy doing but I am not even really sure where to start. And before I get the answer I think I will get, I cannot join any clubs on campus because I still have to attend all Lacrosse events meaning I do not have time to join a club of sorts. This kinda means I am on my own and if I am being honest I do feel kind of lost in this process, so all that being said if you all have any suggestions for me I would greatly appreciate it. These suggestions could literally range from ""oh hey check out this video game"" or ""Check out this album by this guy"" or on the other extreme, a whole course of action for me that you think may work if you have been in my situation before.

285,"Let‚Äôs be real, I hate myself for multiple reasons but this just adds fuel to the fire.

My friend (15M) is possibly one of the most important people in my life. He‚Äôs so accepting, loving, and kind, and he‚Äôs kept with me through thick and thin even when we‚Äôve both been struggling through incredibly poor mental health. I have clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder and see a therapist about once a week. He on the other hand has clinical depression, anxiety (I‚Äôm unsure of which kind, and gender dysphoria (he‚Äôs FTM). He only gets to see his therapist once a month because his family is in a poor financial situation and because his dad doesn‚Äôt think he needs it. While I have an incredibly supportive family, my friends brother and grandma are both incredibly homophobic and transphobic, and he‚Äôs been repeatedly called a ‚Äòfaggot‚Äô by his older brother. His dad on the other hand refuses to accept that his mistreatment is a problem and basically tells my friend that he‚Äôs just ‚Äòover dramatic‚Äô and ‚Äòjust a teenager.‚Äô Since we both greatly dislike his ‚Äòfamily‚Äô and I‚Äôm a firm believer in choosing who is your family, we‚Äôre practically siblings at this point and tell everything to each other, and we‚Äôve both seriously considered trying to get him to live with me so that he can feel safe and loved in his own home. I want to protect him so that he‚Äôs happy and feels loved, which is why this hurts even more for me to say this.
There‚Äôs a girl who‚Äôs worked on the costumes for the musical I‚Äôm in, and the first time I saw her I really wanted to get to know her. She seemed so calm and down to earth that I wanted to become friends with her, but because I was so nervous I never really got the courage to. I was formally introduced to her by a different friend of mine a few weeks ago, and I started to be kind of interested in her. Not a serious crush, I just kinda liked her wanted to get to know her more. My best friend got introduced to her around the same time that I did, and we both thought she was cool. I thought that if I did get to know her, that I could see were my small crush went.
Then on Wednesday, she confessed she had a crush on my friend. He told me about it later that day and I felt my heart sink a little bit and I thought something I‚Äôm so pissed at myself for thinking:‚ÄùOf course she‚Äôd choose him.‚Äù The second after that thought crossed my mind, I became absolutely livid with myself. I of all people should know that feelings aren‚Äôt what you choose, they‚Äôre what comes to you, I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòlose‚Äô anything from her confessing to him and that I even thought that makes me feel horrible.
The more I thought about it the more I realized that I had been jealous of him for awhile. I was jealous of his kindness and how many people enjoyed his company. He‚Äôs handsome, creative, and kind, and I‚Äôm so bland and forgettable that no one really knows I exist, and when they do they see me as a ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô or a ‚Äòsister‚Äô, not someone that they‚Äôd date. Everyone loves him, everyone crushes on him, and I‚Äôm just there. I‚Äôm just ‚Äòhis best friend.‚Äô I hate having such negative feelings towards him because he means the world to me, and if I told him that I liked her in the slightest, he‚Äôd completely reject her. He told her that he needed some time to think about it, but I can already tell he likes her. I should be happy, they‚Äôre both good people and he‚Äôs a magnet for being manipulated because of his kindness so I should be glad that a good person has finally crossed his path, but all I feel is jealousy, self hatred, and guilt. This isn‚Äôt just cause the girl I like likes him, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs the hero who‚Äôs gonna save everyone and I just feel like the boring side character that‚Äôs just gonna get in his way.
I know to an adult this is all probably super over dramatic, and if I‚Äôm honest it 100% is, but I can‚Äôt stop being mad at myself. I‚Äôm already in a rut with my grades, and I‚Äôm constantly feeling awful, but this is just the icing on the cake. I feel lost, guilty, and a part of me is considering just shutting down completely because I‚Äôm so tired all the time. I know everyone is telling me that everything I‚Äôm going through right now is just a ‚Äòsmall bump in the road‚Äô but what do I do when the bigger potholes start coming my way?

289,"It's a bit of a long story so I'll try to keep it short. (Edit: I didn't really keep it short)

I met this girl at a party, friend of a friend. We hit it off right away, chatted a bit and then made out in the kitchen with over the clothes touching. We were both tipsy, but all seemed fine and this went on for almost an hour. When I left around 2am, she walked me outside and we made out for like 40 min again. I got a bit more handsy than I usually am like, hands up the skirt and copped a feel type thing. She felt up my dick. All ok. I added her snapchat and we talked for 3 weeks all flirty. She lives far, so we couldn't meet for a while.

3 weeks later I meet up with her at the same mutual friend's party. The day before she was snapping me saying she was excited to see me again, but at this second party she barely talks to me at all. I end up getting her in conversation downstairs, and we actually kiss more again. Seems good. I admittedly get a bit handsy again (nothing worse than last time, and nothing too overt. And there was no one else downstairs.) Anyway she pulls back and says she wants to see her friends because she hasn't in a while. Totally cool, we go back up. She doesn't talk to me for hours. Alright, fine. Eventually her friend randomly basically tells me ""X isn't feeling it, give her some space"" and I'm like ok that's cool even though I'm totally confused. I don't bug her the rest of the party. When I leave, I say bye and she hugs me and she says ""text me!""

I text her the next day, apologize if I was too much or anything and she says ""it's okay, we were both a bit too intoxicated"". Then we small talk a bit and she stops replying, and I basically just never bother her again after she deleted me off insta. Apparently she started dating some guy about a month or two later.

Fast forward to now, about 3-4 months later. I still feel a bit weird about it, but I kinda assumed it was cool and she just lost interest. Today I was out with a friend who knows her and her friend, and he messaged the girl's friend and she said to come by, but when she realized I was with the guy she said it's best if I don't come because it'll make her uncomfortable.

She wouldn't really give me much other info, so I just didn't go. Look I'm obviously cool if she's not interested, 100%, she owes me nothing. ...but with the way it ended I keep getting paranoid she told her friend I took advantage of her or something.

If I pass my interview on Wednesday, I‚Äôll start on the 20th, with a 9 week training course, with no possible time off in that period. 
Being in a job I hate, I‚Äôm eager to gtfo as soon as I can, but joining the police has been a dream since childhood so don‚Äôt want to pass it up(even if it would take about a year to start)However at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to refuse a way out of a job I hate to then potentially not even pass the assessment day. 
So please help me make a decision!",07Mar2020,1

Picture of my cat? Selfie.  A joke I sent? Selfie.  Anything pertaining to the current conversation merits a selfie.  It's starting to become a problem because 1. Its a conversation killer, how am I supposed to respond? and 2. She doesn't wash her fucking face and its gross.  I don't send or ask for these selfies nor do I send any in return but its always some weird close up of her making a face.  Regardless of who started the conversation what its about or how far into it we are she sens a random selfie and its getting old especially when she complains I stop responding after.  Shes a good friend and a sensitive person which goes against my abrasive personality and I don't know how to gently tell her to stop sending close ups and use some soap to clean her face",07Mar2020,1

Hello lovely Subaru owners! First time posting here, unfortunately this won't be a happy post. I took my 2018 Crosstrek in for my final oil change and free car wash today to Puente Hills Subaru (my frequented dealership, I guess now that's gonna change). Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary: parked my car, service person took it to their shop, car was returned to me, and I drove home. I did not notice that there was a sizable dent on my hood until I parked my car in my garage under light. The dealership essentially made a dent on my hood while they were servicing and washing it and decided NOT to tell me.

Luckily I had a dashcam and it was rolling during the service and car wash. I checked it and noted when they were performing the oil change, there was NO dent on my hood. When they drove my Crosstrek to the car wash, the driver rolled forward into the machinery and it clearly made impact on my car. It looks like he was not paying attention at all to what was in front of him because another car before mine was ahead of me in the car wash. He rolled forward despite being very close to the machinery and that car. Also, there seems to be lights on the machine that indicate whether the next car should stop or proceed. The light was on STOP. The footage then shows him walking out to the front of the vehicle while the car wash was still on clearly to inspect if there was any damage. After a few minutes of looking at that spot on my hood, he calls a buddy over and he too spends some time looking at the hood and the bumper. Needless to say at this point, they decide that it absolutely isn't their responsibility to let me know and continued the car wash.

I am extremely livid about this because not only did the dealership damage my car, they decided that it was acceptable cheat me and not inform me about this. Quite frankly, I feel absolutely insulted as a customer. I called them and they want me to bring in the car tomorrow. At this point, having to bring in my car a second time is a HUGE waste of my time for their mistake that they refused to admit today. I get the feeling that they will deny all responsibility anyway until I bring up the dashcam footage, knowing that this is the level of their professional integrity.

Aside from obviously repairing the damage on my hood, what would be some appropriate compensations that I can demand? I'm disappointed, but I don't want to be unreasonable. Thanks in advance!",07Mar2020,1

306,"Alright...
I need to seek advice with a younger sibling that doesn't have a work ethic. He has absolutely no work ethic despite being smarter (honestly, I wish I could pay attention well like he does). Right now, he's 17 and going to running start, but I am very concerned about his grades.

So far, he's gotten a B in Calculus 1 without even trying. Now, he does well in the rest (German, etc.), but the point is he should be trying harder in general in major prerequisites. He plays League of Legends more than he does study. I just told my mother about this concern, and he nearly yelled at her. I just want to slap him.

This isn't the first time he's clowned either. In Middle School, he chose to go back a year earlier in math despite his capability of going into Algebra I in 7th grade. He later came to regret his choice. Now, he's recently complained he had to take the writing portion of the SAT.

He wants to major in computers, but he's not even that PC literate like I am (I play around with old Windows and Linux on old pc's).

My brother does not realize how much he has that I had to work for (and it makes me annoyed). I had to work my butt off and sacrifice having any fun to do well in even high school and get accepted into a better 4 year university, before I went to a community college to save money. I'm 20 years old and I've been crazy amounts of effort into studying (ADHD).

Excuse me if I appear uptight, but I see a BIG red flag of potentially doing poorly once he finishes running start and inable to get into a better 4 year university due to neglecting the GPA. If he performs like this in Calculus I, then how do I expect him to do any better in Calculus 2, 3, and later?

I want to HELP him and stop a potential trainwreck here!! He needs to GROW UP! He's VERY sheltered and childish (innocent and naive) in general, he didn't even know to obtain his friends' home address despite planning a sleepover for at least a week!!",07Mar2020,1

309,"Almost 4 years ago, in my Junior year of HS, I started to have extremely bad back pain and the feeling in my feet would go out. I lost my recruiting spots for college, had to stop playing, and from that point, I have been on quite the ride. 

To keep an insanely long story short, I seem to be the proud owner of a novel neurological condition, at least that's what my doctors are telling me this month, they change their minds a lot. I take large amounts of L-dopa to keep my wheels greased, but off-meds I struggle to walk, I cannot stand/sit without nearly my whole body trembling, and have near-weekly seizures. My doctors, last month, told me that beyond L-dopa I don't really have many treatment options and I should prepare for the reality that my mystery illness will do what it is going to do and that there isn't much we can do it stop it. 

I am not here for medical advice(I've already exhausted the world's resources looking for that). I'm looking for advice on how to move forward mentally, emotionally. I've been through my stages of self-pity, fear, depression, self-destruction, the classic stuff you'd expect for a quasi-terminal kid. But my issue is I feel as if I can only switch between these states of misery anymore, I haven't hit a good week in a long time. I had good months in the Fall when they thought they had found a permanent solution for me, but in January my treatment suddenly stopped working. I feel like I've been thrown back into my wallows from when I started getting hospitalized in January 2019, which is when things got serious for me. 

I don't feel as though I am depressed, which I'm guessing is the first thought for most reading this. I get stuff done, I look forward to things, my apartment is clean, etc.. But say my meds don't hit me right and I have another seizure I'm back watching Fault in Our Start for the billionth time stuck in a self-pity cycle. 

Or take this week, for example, I'm fine Monday. Tues, Wed, Thurs I don't get out of bed because I feel like someone has been pumping me with adrenaline and I can't sleep and I know if I move I'll seize. Friday rolls around and I have an exam that I'm extremely well prepared for, but instead of actually doing it, I take 15 minutes and fill in purposely wrong answers and go home and sleep. To then wake up go back to campus, run into the girl I've been crushing on for months to just completely shut down and avoid hanging out for the umpteenth time. 

The only thing that gets me out of my funk is playing soccer. I'm much worse now, and my left foot is basically a peg leg, but I can do it. It's the one thing I will get giddy about anymore. 

I cannot maintain this. I already have limited time left, and I'm using it worse than ever. I've known the general severity of my situation since January 2019, so I feel like I've had plenty of time to get back into it, and I feel like I did in the fall. But now I feel like no matter how hard I fight my inner battle and even though I know I can win it, something or someone just pushes me right back into the fray on a weekly basis. 

I don't know what to do. I have no fight left in me. I need to get out of my own way on this one, and I just can't seem to do it. I already have a tough fight with my illness, so I figure the last thing I need is to struggle with my own head, but this seems to be my most serious problem, more so than my physical symptoms. 

Any advice would be amazing, I'm eager for the opportunity to stop this nonsense. 

Thank you all.",07Mar2020,1

*Context:* I‚Äôve been best friends with this girl for almost 6 years, and we know each other super well. We have very different personalities, and the vast majority of our larger-friend-group share her personality, that is, extroverted, confident, likes dressing up and partying, likes looking for guys to hook up with, and all the power to them, but I‚Äôm just not like that. I am incredibly introverted, and don‚Äôt like going out or really anything to do with crowds. I also suffer quite badly with anxiety, specifically a panic disorder that‚Äôs largely triggered by social crowds. In addition to this I‚Äôm also going through a really bad patch of depression. She‚Äôs well aware of all these things, as I said, she‚Äôs my best friend :)

*Situation:* Her sister has sent an invitation out to a group of girls, including myself, that‚Äôs basically an invite out to a very big nightclub in the city, and it‚Äôs meant to be a night full of clubbing; dancing, drinking, finding guys etc. I‚Äôm definitely not comfortable with the situation I know it‚Äôll be- I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt do drugs, I don‚Äôt go to clubs, I don‚Äôt wear heels and tight dresses, but that‚Äôs the crowd that will be there, and I know it‚Äôs expected that I live like that for the night. 

On a personal level, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I push my depression/panic problems to the side and just be there for my friend even though I know I‚Äôll suffer for it in the short term, or do I apologize and say I can‚Äôt go, and potentially suffer for it in the long term if our friendship gets affected by it? It‚Äôs a big issue in my head, because I can‚Äôt talk to her about it, and reassure her I want to be there for her, because it‚Äôs meant to be a surprise. I want to be there for her, supporting, celebrating, partying, but it‚Äôs a situation I‚Äôm so entirely uncomfortable with, especially at the current moment. Will I come off as a bad friend? I‚Äôm feeling so horrible about it.

For context, I work for a large nonprofit but I am on a specific team that is entirely remote.

1) My direct supervisor is the only person I have a really positive work relationship and bond with. I will tell him first and I think it‚Äôs going to hurt him personally, and I fully expect him to ask me why. I have a million reasons why, but to what extent is it appropriate for me to share? Should I simply focus on what I like about the new job, should I tell him actual reasons why I hated this job? If things end well with him he would probably be a reference for me, but I also feel that he deserves the truth.

A couple years ago I joined a group of friends and I became really good mates with one of the members of the group to the point where I consider him one of my best mates. We'll call him B. I fell out with some members in the group so badly that I hate them but that's a different story entirely, but still relevant to this. So after I fell out with the guys in the group, B still stayed friends with me throughout the whole thing even though it was extremely messy and a lot of drama happened. So he's a standup guy, one of the best people I've ever met and hopefully a lifelong friend. Now here's the problem I'm having. So basically the other guy in the group that I didn't fall out with ( we'll call him G ) is very good friends with B. And since we're all at uni now when I want to hang out with B, G will usually tag along. When we were all still together as a group ( before I fell out with the other guys ), I never really clicked with G. I talked with him, but I also didn't really feel like we had much in common, which we don't. Fast forward to now, I don't dislike him, but I also don't really want to be friends with him. I hang out with him without B when we're on campus together, but only because of the close proximity, I would never ( and have never ) asked him to hang out without B. The thing that's bugging me is that I know he considers me a close friend and he has opened up to me about personal stuff and I have a little bit too ( not much but when he said something personal I would also say something personal back because what else do you do in that situation ) and if I were to say I didn't want to be friends after sharing a lot of time together that would hurt his feelings and probably cause him quite a bit of pain. He's not a bad person, he's just the last person I would ever invite out or want to hang out with. I've just been feeling really weird about him lately, like I sometimes enjoy his company, sometimes I just want him to leave so I can hang out with B alone. I've tried distancing myself without making it obvious ( not messaging as often and not talking to him as much ) but I feel like I might have to confront him about the way I feel to spare him any more hurt feelings down the line, which I am scared to do, I am also worried about how this would make B feel about me, as I consider him a great friend and it may affect our relationship if I confronted G.

Rose has pulled pranks around the building (clogging toilet stalls, spraying fart spray everywhere, putting ketchup inside ice cream containers, blasted rap music on a hidden speaker, burnt residents cookies on purpose in the microwave and still served them, purposely avoided going to tables, has obscene nicknames for residents like mr ballsack and fat fuck at table #4, she also got a previous employee fired by lying about an incident that never happened.

My sister plays along with rose and loves to hide out in the break room or when supervisors not looking they both run to the elevator and go to different floors, she loves taking long bathroom breaks during busy services and leaves her tables up for somebody else to care for, or she will go sit in her car and jam out, rose and my sister are supposed to clock out for break and never do, they just leave for like an hour or sometimes two when it‚Äôs only supposed to be 20 minute lunch break. Leaving me to reset all the tables by myself and dish all the sides out for evenings service. My supervisor is well aware and he‚Äôs said bad shit about them when they aren‚Äôt there but he won‚Äôt do anything. 

They both also love to take full advantage of leftover food from lunch that wasn‚Äôt served which is free for all but they never leave anything for anybody else. They also take deserts and evening dishes that aren‚Äôt supposed to be touched. 

I do what I‚Äôm supposed to do but yesterday I got called into HR‚Äôs office for being late twice without calling. Which I find hilarious considering my supervisor is always having to call rose or my sister asking where they are and if they are showing up today. We have to be at work by 11am and most of the time my sister shows up after 11:15 and we are lucky to have rose by the time noon hits. There has also been times where it was just me and the supervisor serving dinner because rose just decided to leave for the day because she‚Äôs had enough.",07Mar2020,1

331,"I hate my mother.

I was ‚Äúhomeschooled‚Äù to help with my sisters‚Äô disabilities. I wasn‚Äôt allowed extracurriculars, didn‚Äôt have time for friends...nothing. 

My mother never actually homeschooled. She just gave me cliff notes books and expected me to teach myself. 

Later on, my mother had me complete high school online, so I could continue ‚Äúhelping‚Äù at home. I wanted to go to an actual high school, but I wasn‚Äôt allowed. 

I started working right after graduating to help with bills. I saved nothing; it all went to her account. 

I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have a bank account. Everything was to be direct deposited to hers.

My mother wouldn‚Äôt teach me to drive in high school. She said she would when I turned 18...I‚Äôm 21 now, and she still won‚Äôt teach me, or even let me take the test cold in her car. 

My mother let me go to college for less than one semester...but only so I could take out the maximum amount of student loans, which she used to pay rent. 

I made 30K last year, but she got it all through direct deposit; I didn‚Äôt see a dime. She said she needed it to pay bills. 

Because I have no license, and she didn‚Äôt feel like driving me, I walked to and from work. 

We both took out many loans to pay bills. But she only has enough money to pay her loans back. We‚Äôll deal with mine later she says. 

My credit score is worse than hers, and I‚Äôm half her age, but only because I take out loans for her that she won‚Äôt let me pay back. 

Why do I give her money? Why don‚Äôt I ask more questions? 

If I refuse to give her all my money. She threatens to kick me out. Or, my favorite, she reminds me I can just leave if I want to, but she won‚Äôt let me save any money, pay off the debt I put myself in for her, or help me get a driver‚Äôs license...so I can‚Äôt really leave. She knows it too, which is why she phrases it that way. 

To add insult to injury. I‚Äôm 3.95 GPA student, with a 1450 SAT score...but she won‚Äôt let me apply any of my own money to school, much less help me financially. She only let me go to community college for a little while so she could use the loan money. 

Even worse, all of the time I spent helping with my sisters‚Äô disabilities...was pointless. They aren‚Äôt actually disabled. The last doctor to see my oldest younger sister, said that there was nothing wrong with her. It‚Äôs insane. She forces one sister to wear compression socks for blood flow issues she doesn‚Äôt have, and take large doses of melatonin every night for sleeping problems she also doesn‚Äôt have. She forces the other to wear an OTC hearing aid for hearing problems she doesn‚Äôt have. 

She thinks the youngest had a stroke, so she‚Äôs not allowed to learn certain things because if she did...it might mean she doesn‚Äôt have a learning disability. 

She uses my sisters‚Äô imagined health difficulties to get sympathy and attention from EVERYONE. 

There‚Äôs so much more to say...you have no idea...

I don‚Äôt know how to escape. She won‚Äôt change, but I still feel like I‚Äôm supposed to wait it out.

332,"I'm currently 15, and just under 2 years away from finishing High School. I don't know why, but I'm scared about growing into the 'real world' adults are always talking about. 

I think I'm scared of having all these responsibilities like having to get a job, paying bills, do adult things like getting a car serviced. I just want life to be what it is now where I spend 7 hours at school, where an hour of that is hanging out with my friends, come home and I get to do whatever I want for 6 hours. I don't need to pay bills, worry about mortgages, or any of this 'real world' stuff. Life is easy right now,  I want it to stay that way.

And then I'm scared in a social sense. I'm scared that I'll lose my current friends, then struggle to make new ones. Maybe I won't meet anyone, and I'll die alone.

And then I get into a philosophy kind of thing. What's the point of living? We grow up into the 'real world' just to have a hard life.

Even writing this is hard for me, as It makes me think more and more about how adult life is gonna suck.

334,"Context:
I've known about this girl since I was in the 6th grade. I had a crush on her in the 8th grade and before I knew it we started dating my freshman year of highschool. I've ""broken up"" with her several times due to the fact that I was always so insecure about my worthiness to her. I know doing that has to have messed with her big time.

We kept a steady rotation of getting back together and breaking up until my junior year of highschool when I found out she allowed a guy to kiss her when they met up to talk about how he was. God, I remember sitting in my Spanish classroom hearing that being told to me and my heart sank to the bottom of the floor. My legs and arms filled with a pressure that hasn't escaped my body since. I fought with her about this and I don't even quite remember how it turned out other than during the last few months of our relationship that time, I was going properly crazy. She would go out after work with her friends to smoke weed or even drink sometimes. The paranoia would set in and all I could think of is that she was doing something bad and against me and our relationship. She always hung out with shitty boys and friends who weren't always doing the best of things. I couldn't take it anymore and I wanted to end my life from all of the thoughts that I allowed my brain to conjure. I knew this wasn't right. I told my mom very late at night. She and my dad talked me through it. The following days were rough and all but someone with my friends companionship I made it through. 

I got into a relationship with another girl and things were awesome. I was having the time of my life and my senior was really good. 

After bouncing from a shitty pair of boyfriends. She spoke to me often over text about her issues because I had been the only one who ever really listened and looked out for her and we had always been really good friends. We stayed ""friends"" for the coming months of my freshman year. During this time she wrote me letters of how she felt about me and how she wished I loved her as much as she loved me. The truth is that she's one of those girls I would risk everything for to be with. The months pass and we see each other every now and then. 

I come to find out she has an eating disorder. This rocked my world. I felt for her because her life has been everything but easy and the fact that this was another thing piled on made my heart hurt for her. I saw her more often and we became very close before she left for in patient care. She called me and I called her many times but no one picked up the answer so I stopped calling because I thought she hated me. I was told I could come visit but I've never traveled that far alone in my car, so I was scared. I sent her a Facebook message explaining everything that was on my heart that night and I told her that I believed she is my soulmate and that I am unhappy in my current relationship (which I was). Months go by and I hear back from her. She says she's hopefully getting released soon and we should talk. 

She left the hospital around the start of or mid summer. God, you should've seen her. She was absolutely beautiful, but no matter which way she looked my attraction never lessened. 

By this time my current girlfriend and I were ending our relationship. I didn't feel close to her at all and I wanted to be alone which spiraled into this whole other mess.

Now my ex and I were seeing each other often and we finally decided to get intimate. We would make and have sex. This is the first we had sex in with each other out of the 3 or 4, years we knew each other and had been in relationship. Months of this come and go.

-I don‚Äôt have a bank location (like an actual walk-in location) anywhere nearby

338,"     Hi all, I just wanted to write a personal story today.

     When I was little, I was a really happy, spastic child. I had a crazy imagination and I loved almost everything and everybody. In fourth grade, I slowly started showing signs of depression. In fifth and sixth grade, I started to develop anxiety. By the time middle school came along, I was starting to really sink low. At the time, I was dealing with an undiagnosed case of ADD (which was finally diagnosed when I was a junior in high school), so while I was never a good student, I genuinely cared about school. 

     Over time, as my depression and anxiety got worse, I started to have pretty dark, suicidal thoughts. Every day became a drag; a living hell. I isolated myself from my closest friends, I stopped caring about school altogether, and I dealt with panic attacks on a nightly basis. I lived this way for years, occasionally having periods that were better or worse. I was no longer that happy, cheerful kid that I had been; I was an entirely different person.

     I talked to myself a lot to get myself through my anxiety attacks, as I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs common. I always told myself that I had too much to lose, or that there were people that had it worse than me, or that it would be selfish of me to kill myself. I would invalidate my own feelings and make myself guilty for feeling the way I did. Through everything, I never self-harmed. I frequently thought of suicide strategies, fully knowing that I would never be brave enough to carry through. 

     On one of my worst nights, at 15 years old, I finally made a deal with myself. I said, ‚ÄúIf you still feel this way by the time you turn 20 years old, you can go through with the suicide.‚Äù

     The following, I had a mental breakdown in front of my mom. Terrified, she forced me to start seeing a therapist. It was something I knew I wanted but I was always too scared to ask about. I grew very fond of my therapist; she was the sweetest old lady. It wasn‚Äôt long till she sent me to a psychiatrist so that I could get officially diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. This led to the start of pills; they told me that my antidepressants would take about a month to fully kick in. I took my first pill exactly one month before my 16th birthday. That night, I cried of joy. I was happy to know that I was finally going to feel normal again.

     For the years to follow, I grew as an individual. I became quirky, made good friends, and got passionate about writing and performing poetry. I made a name for myself at my school, and I started to love myself again.

     Yesterday, I turned 21 years old. It‚Äôs been a full year after I allowed myself to make the choice between life or death, and my god, I am so happy I chose life.

     I‚Äôve always been really bad at advice, but there‚Äôs one thing I always tell people, as cliche as it is: things will always get better.

They are going through another rough patch for a while now and Jane came over the other week and said she‚Äôs miserable and wants to leave but Scott has said he will not give her a cent and she‚Äôll be out on her own if she does. Or rather she can leave but he will not give her anything to start her new life with. They‚Äôve been together for 20 years and although he‚Äôs become more financially successful she has always worked and contributed. The hardest part is she felt like she has no where to go because all her family live overseas (whilst all his live locally) I explained that the courts won‚Äôt let that happen and they have built a life together financially and otherwise so she would not get nothing to start again with. And of course I said she‚Äôs not alone and is welcome to stay with me as long as she needs to. She was worried about the fact that she drinks a bit to much and he always has a ho at her about being a silly drunk or embarrassing ect ect... she can for sure ( can‚Äôt we all) but it‚Äôs not out of control or anything in a daily basis. More like holiday/weekend partying. She was worried that would affect her ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô if it was bought up in divorce court. So I said that over the years we‚Äôve all been friends he can be a bad drunk as well. I‚Äôve seen him and been told about him getting way to handsy and inappropriate with women. I meant to assure her that people do stupid shit when they drink and none of us are faultless human beings. Anyway... she went home and told him that I told her he was a sleaze. That‚Äôs it. Nothing about the whole conversation and the context of it. So he texted me angry and I didn‚Äôt reply because I didn‚Äôt want to give away her confidence. I texted her to tell her this and she said ‚Äò I love you‚Äô.

My intention was to help her feel normal after being told she‚Äôs not and feels worthless. But without the whole story he now thinks I‚Äôm a total asshole. Maybe I am, I‚Äôm asking I guess did I do the wrong thing telling her the truth? And why would she tell him that bit and not the rest?

342,"I have recently graduated, at age 24, feeling like i am behind other people, despite knowing the rationale is that people live and progress at their own rate. There is also the Asian mentality of needing to be always achieving something, and i've only been able to keep the uneasiness of not progressing just under wraps. 

I dont trust my family with these emotions. We're asian. 

I have various tasks i need to do, and i know logically its not hard. But i have an undiagnosed mood disorder that is apparent to some friends and my SO. unfortunately it also makes me second guess if i really have mental health issues or im subconsciously being like this for attention. am i scared to do something because i have anxiety or am i just a lazy coward? i cant help wonder if im mentally sound and just duped everyone around me for attention. am i okay? i dont know? what if i am? Now i have graduated, waiting for my ceremony in 3 weeks time, and trying to find jobs amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. 

I have banks i need to call, plans to arrange, people to make arrangements with, material to study, finances to worry about as i have a family member with lung cancer and one with tuberculosis, a LDR with an extremely supportive and lovely SO that i often feel like i dont deserve, and struggles with a need for constant self achievements over the past decade. 

Trying to find a lifestyle in a household that feels oppressive in a weird way makes me unable to function.

10 hours. 10 fucking hours on an agreed position with at least 4 shifts a week (in a kitchen so 10 hour shifts give or take that usually rounds me to 40 or close to 40 hours a week). No clue why they slashed it, I know there's a ""new"" rule at work that repeated late arrivals will result in a penalty in weekly hours (doubt this is legal since we work on full-time agreements) but I was literally late one day before that ""rule"" came out.   


Thing is, my employer knows I  have a kid and stuff and that I obviously can't survive on 10 hours a week.   


What's my next step ? I'm obviously going to confront him at work in the morning tomorrow to figure out what the actual fuck is going on but I know management and this will surely escalate into some sort of yelling match.

We continue to keep doing our thing for a few more months and we finally come to late February/March. 

We went on a date one Wednesday to watch the movie ""Her"" at the Alamo. I was planning on asking her finally because I grew the confidence to just do it and try and make it last without letting what I'm going through get in the way of that but I didn't do it. She felt different, her vibe was off and it made me scared to do it. We talk less and less everyday. One weekend she goes skiing with her friends. I'm losing my mind of this and my paranoia is setting in. I ask her to please let us talk the day after she gets back. 

When we spoke she told me doesn't feel like she's living. She feels as if she's floating through her life. She's obviously still dealing with her eating disorder at the this point and I know that had something to do with it. But she tells me that she doesn't believe we can do anything together because she has to distance herself from what is preventing her from functioning. My first reaction was defensive. How was I preventing that? How was our relationship doing any of that? I didn't ask those questions. I just told her I wanted to make this work for once and that no matter what we're going through I didn't want to give up on this. It didn't budge. 


Advice Question:

Now, here I am a few days later feeling it all really. I feel the anxiety through my limbs every day. The paranoia of the fact that I'm not enough for her to stay with me through her troubles and that someone else is. I just feel rock bottom right now. 

How do I seem to find the time to distract myself of this for long enough? 

All I want to do is know why and understand it. I want to be at peace with it but I just feel like I can't get there.

345,"When playing a game earlier today, I had the opportunity to eliminate my GF or another player. I chose my GF because I perceived her to be the bigger threat between the two. She got upset and said that I targeted her. I told her that I felt she was a bigger threat, that someone else would eliminate the other guy the next round, and I did what I thought was the most strategic move. I asked would she be mad if it had of come from someone else and she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre supposed to have my back in life and in games.‚Äù 

Similar situations have happened 2 or 3 other times over the course of a year, and every time I‚Äôve told her ‚ÄúI felt like you were the biggest threat, that‚Äôs why I did x to you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve told her that it‚Äôs not personal. That it‚Äôs only a game, and that we all do actions that benefit us and help us win. I also think that giving her special treatment because of our relationship would be doing her and the other players a disservice. I also never get upset when she does actions to my detriment, because it‚Äôs a game and she‚Äôs playing to win. 

This next part is only my opinion, but I believe there to be a large amount of confirmation bias. I think she‚Äôs only getting mad at me when shes frustrated at losing and is looking for someone to blame, and since I‚Äôm around after everyone else leaves it‚Äôs easy to be mad at me.  

I don‚Äôt know how to address it. I don‚Äôt want to give her special treatment, but I also don‚Äôt want her to continue to think I‚Äôm targeting her. I truly don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm picking on her or being any more ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù towards her than I am any other player, but I don‚Äôt know how to get her to see that without just avoiding her when we play, which doesn‚Äôt seem like a good solution.

347,"I met this guy in the grade below me in one of my philosophy classes. We bumped into each other around campus through mutual friends but never really got to know each other until he came up to me at the library as I was studying and asked if I had done the philosophy homework yet. We ended up talking for an hour and a half (not about philosophy) - obviously we were flirting, he's super touchy and tease-y. So wee have continued to meet at the library with the claim that we are going to ""study"" which we rarely ever end up getting to do because the banter is just so great. Ugh I love the tension of actually having a crush that builds over time! It's the exquisite pain of yearning. Anyway I digress.

What I want to know is this. Why did he show me his tinder prof. randomly while we were studying asking me what I thought about it? It was so random, we were like 20 mins into conversation, and I was on a 5 minute silent grind for a moment when he rolled his chair over next to me and showed me his phone and said ""what do you think of this bio."" Part of me thinks that it was a weird way of showing me that he was single/looking for hook-up opportunities, dropping a hint that he was interested in that, but TBH I was a little turned off by the whole thing.

I mostly wear it for myself and to just dress up a little more for an occasion but his reaction makes me feel shitty. He said he just prefers me without make up on and I understand having a preference but his reaction is reducing my confidence. I know I cant just make him like me eith make up on either.

351,"I started my job 3 years ago. Before my boss hired me, I made him aware that I have severe panic attacks and am not able to drive. I work overnight at a medical facility, but driving would only be necessary in emergencies. He said, despite driving being in the job description, it would not be an issue because I will always have someone working with me that will be able to utilize the company vehicle. Multiple coworkers have known about my panic attacks and inability to drive. I have been through several work partners over the past three years and have even been by myself while they were looking to fill spots. This has never been an issue until now.

Recently, the company I work for has fallen on difficult times. In order to cut costs, they are cutting hours/workers. The plan from the higher ups was to only have one person on each shift instead of two. My boss said he really does not want to let me go, but in order for me to stay at this job, I MUST get my driver's license. I reiterated that my panic attacks have not allowed me to drive; I've been taking medication for my panic disorder as well as received counseling. But I am just not able to do it. He again stated that if I cannot get my license, he will be forced to let me go. 

Is he allowed to do that? Am I protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act? I thought he had to make reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities.

356,"I‚Äôve never met my new neighbor before. Yesterday, I got a note on my door (I live in a twin house) that she‚Äôs going to be cutting down her tree this Saturday. Cool. I come home today (Friday) and parked my car in my driveway. Hours later, my mom comes home and she says my car is covered the sawdust from my neighbor‚Äôs tree cutting. I moved the car inside the garage and spent a bit getting the sawdust off. I was already frustrated because neighbor said she was cutting tree on Saturday, not Friday. What even annoyed me more was that she didn‚Äôt bother to ring my door to tell me she had moved it a day ahead, leaving my car covered in sawdust.

So it gets worse. The tree cutting company truck moves and parks in front of my driveway. I was leaving for dinner with my friends and backed my car out of the garage. I saw the truck parked and looked back while backing up and accidentally hit my side mirror against the side of the garage door, leaving it completely broken.

Now I‚Äôm absolutely pissed. I step outside to talk to the neighbor asking why she didn‚Äôt communicate. She just said some BS which I don‚Äôt remember, and tried to defer the blame back to me saying it was my fault (which it was). But I stated that A led to B led to C. Without the truck or the tree cutting, and with better communication from her, I wouldn‚Äôt have been so flustered and I wouldn‚Äôt have ran my mirror against the side of the garage. I said I had to go, but she said we‚Äôll continue the conversation tomorrow. 

My dad later comes home and starts screaming at my mom and I because he wanted us to call the police, since the truck had no right to park there. I said it would just make the relationship with our neighbor hell, and at least see if she wanted to cover the cost of the damage.

T ""S said that I'm nice but annoying""

375,"Apologies for the long post - have put TL;DR @ bottom.

My mother (62) and I (M26) have a somewhat difficult relationship. Sometimes, we can be getting on like best friends and be on the same page and wavelength about nearly everything, but most of the time, we clash. A lot.

This kind of relationship has been going on pretty much since I left home and started university. She has always been protective to the point of being controlling but I never really noticed until I got out from under her roof and started having my own independence - which I love. And as I have started making my way in the world things have only gotten worse. She disapproves of my career path (theatre and drama) saying: ""it's insecure and you should get a nice safe job"". She's disliked every girlfriend I've ever had and behind their backs said some quite rude and awful comments. And when my last girlfriend (relationship lasted nearly 4 years, living together for 2) broke up with me completely out of the blue last year - instead of being supportive while I was heartbroken and devastated, her response was (and I quote) ""Get over it. She was a b\*\*\*h"" and ""I told you so. Told you so when you got together with her.""

I have tried to limit contact with her as much as possible - but I have a very small family (only child, no cousins within 150 miles) so I have been wanting to see my Dad (66) as much as I can to help me recover from the breakup. Unfortunately that most often means seeing my mother too. And every time I see her, I get anxious, tense and angry, at what she's said in the past and what she might say in the next visit, and, almost without fail she does indeed end up saying something hurtful, unsupportive or just plain rude. She is judgmental, gossipy and I would go so far as to say somewhat racist/sexist in her passing comments. When I call her out on them - it descends into an argument of ""I'm entitled to my opinion"" and ""Don't talk down to me"". If she feels she is losing the argument, she will resort to calling me a sexist because I ""don't talk to (my) father that way!"", which I in turn find really infuriating and offensive. It's gotten so bad that I actually dread going back to the house I grew up in, and whilst my Dad tries to come out and see me (without her knowing) whenever he can - he is unable to do this very often, so if I want to talk to my Dad about something I have to go home, and thus see my mother...

What has me particularly anxious at the moment is that I have made the decision to move to another part of the country (Britain) at some point in the next 12 months as there is simply nothing for me in my area (I am feeling somewhat lonely since my ex left me so out of the blue... other issues and a story for another time). The house I am currently living in belongs to my Uncle, my Mother's brother, and he is letting me live here rent free. I am incredibly grateful to him for what he's done for me and allowed me over 2 years (and as long as I want) rent free living, allowing me to save up quite a lot of money. This also presents the problem with my mother though, as when I told her my intention to move, she went somewhat ballistic, saying that I was ""throwing away my Uncle's generosity"" and then dismissing it as ""just a phase"". Since then, she has been making snide and somewhat cruel comments at every opportunity which are really having an impact on my overall mental health. I know I need to get out of this house for the sake of my mental health, as the isolation it creates, as well as the memories here (my ex and I moved in together, redecorated it and everything...) are taking their toll. She is determined to get me to stay here, somewhat close to home and if she had her way i'm sure I would live here (or back at home...) for the rest of my life because it's ""safe and secure"". But I have never been more sure about anything as I am about the need for this move. How do I get her to see that this is what's best for me, or at the least, get her to stop making such awful comments?

She has tried to persuade me to move back home with her and Dad a number of times since the breakup and she is actively pursuing this even more since I mentioned that I wanted to move. This would be the worst thing I could do though as it would expose me to her 24/7 and put me back under her controlling presence, like when I was a child...

No contact is not really possible without also mostly separating contact from my Dad... and I am also worried about causing a rift with my Uncle, who I get on with really well, but I am sure he would understand my need for a change. Any advice on how to handle this whole situation would be very much appreciated.

TL;DR - My mother is controlling, and her snide comments about me, those I hang out with and everyone (even those on TV) are cruel and impacting my mental state. Need to make a change in my life but she will not allow me the peace to get on with it.",07Mar2020,1

I‚Äôm really really high right now, and that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm sad. But I‚Äôm falling apart right now and I need to tell somebody.

My life has just. Changed. I don‚Äôt know how. Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that I graduated. And now I‚Äôm an adult and I have to do adult things. And maybe I‚Äôm just mistaking my suffering for life. Real life. But it doesn‚Äôt feel like that. It feels different. I don‚Äôt feel direct suffering. I feel empty. And suffering because of that.

Maybe it‚Äôs my character. Maybe it‚Äôs who I wanted to be, but lost the chance to be, or maybe never even had it. 

When I was in school my teachers and my parents used to tell me how smart I was. That I could be president of the United States. And my mom was always so fascinated with how outside of the box I thought. 

But I achieved nothing in school. I barely passed every grade, despite being more than capable of acing every test and assignment. 

I was lazy. And in turn I was a disappointment and a let down. I had so much ego, so much talent. And I threw it all away. 

Why? I think I know why. I never had drive. I never had motivation. 

I remember, even very early on. My peers had aspirations. Astronaut, FireFighter.

I had nothing. I desired to be nothing. I desired to go home and play video games, and with legos.

And slowly but surely I sank into this pit.

This pit of pure insanity.

Out of touch? Surely we know why now. I spend all of my fucking time inside. I go nowhere. I do nothing. I smoke and smoke and smoke and play video games and I make no progress. 

I have a job. I get there on time. I don‚Äôt hate the job.

I HATE THE PEOPLE. I HATE INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE.

I just want to be high all the time. I want to be alone. My favorite time of day is night. 

That‚Äôs the only time my mind is clear.

And my girlfriend. I feel like I don‚Äôt even love her anymore. I don‚Äôt ever want to talk to her. I don‚Äôt ever want to see her. I just want to be high and alone. All the time.

Please help

I‚Äôm just going to say it like it is

 I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid with crippling depression and anxiety. I just keep falling apart, I‚Äôm ripping apart at the seems and I can‚Äôt stand strait anymore.

I‚Äôve been to 3 therapist and I‚Äôm going to meat a doctor next week. Ive realized that nobody takes me seriously when I try to tell them. I‚Äôve struggled through life since kindergarten where I was bullied, now I‚Äôm no longer bullied and my life is fucking great. I have good grades, good parents and I‚Äôm not poor but still I‚Äôm empty I‚Äôm lost and can‚Äôt stop crying. Whenever I‚Äôm awake I think think and think then when I realize I‚Äôm just thinking myself sad I try to stop and it works for like 5 minutes but after that I just start crying and falling apart I‚Äôm no longer thinking sad thoughts but I‚Äôm still ducking feeling the sadness.

I struggle with everything under the sun.
I struggle with suicidal thoughts and self destructive behaviors.
I know suicide is just going to make things worse and I‚Äôve already gone through all of that with myself but I still feel like shit.

There is nothing wrong in my life I‚Äôm just sad.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sad now but I do know where it started. When I was really young I was bullied and beat by classmates and instead of crying out for mom I just took it I didn‚Äôt struggle. I skipped the stage where young people cry for help I skipped a crucial part of growing up and it ruined my sense of right and wrong and just got me to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky enough‚Äù even though everything was shit.

I no longer get disturbed by those memories but I still feel the pain.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm sick. The worst part of being ill is feeling weak and that‚Äôs the only thing I feel.

I have no fee and I‚Äôm to scared to try. I won‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. 

I‚Äôm just a sad miserable depressed anxiety filled person and I can‚Äôt express it.
I just want to be happy again go back to when I at home running through the grass and playing with my dad but now I can‚Äôt even tell him that I‚Äôm a sad miserable fuck.

I know this isn‚Äôt normal but nobody listens and just laughs when I‚Äôm serious. 
I hate the people that say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sad just kill me‚Äù for attention, like fuck you are if you where suicidal you would keep that under wraps trust me I know. The worst thing is that it always works but never for me a girl could say that she was a little down and she would get the day off if I say I‚Äôm sad depressed and thinking of ending my own life I get a ‚ÄúMan up retard‚Äù 

Why is it like this not just others but why am I like this if I was just happy I would just win at life but I can‚Äôt even remember what happiness feels like anymore. When you always have a knot in your stomach and silently screaming it‚Äôs hard to feel happiness when you feel like your throat is burning up even though it‚Äôs just you constantly crying it‚Äôs hard to feel ok.

What can I do help PLEASE !

I have a previous post about our concern that he has low sex drive and we went to the doctor today. We got the results and his testosterone levels are normal. He‚Äôs frustrated with the doctor because he only interpreted the results and said it‚Äôs normal and didn‚Äôt give him any more advice or at least show some concern to look any further what causes it. 

We have a wonderful relationship, he‚Äôs an amazing guy and his low sex drive happened quite recently. He started a new job and it‚Äôs pretty stressful, so maybe that could have contributed to his stress. I think he also got self-conscious when he wasn‚Äôt able to maintain an erection one time and said he wanted to see a doctor about it, and maybe every time since then he kinda feels like he‚Äôs pressured to perform. I want to be supportive as much as I can, I really love this man and I don‚Äôt want this to affect us negatively. 

Before we went to the doctor today, we were in bed and I kinda initiated touching him and he refused. Tears fell down my face after a while as we get ready, and he said he‚Äôs sorry, it‚Äôs just him. And I said I‚Äôm sorry too, and we‚Äôll make this work out. He just nodded. 

Now, walking back home we talked and he said he‚Äôs frustrated with the doctor and all that. When we arrived home, he was reading articles on his phone and wouldn‚Äôt talk to me nor respond to my affection. I wanted to cry so badly, so I told him I‚Äôll be upstairs if he needs me.

I spent the beginning of the concert not talking to anyone. I was awkwardly standing there and just waiting for the opening act to come on. I was kinda disappointed in myself. There were people in the crowd talking to each other and making friends. But I was too afraid to start a conversation. :,( 

At one point during the main act, a bunch of kids started moshing and shoving each other. So this other dude held me back and asked if I was okay. I said yeah and he helped me get to a safer spot near the side of the crowd. I thought that was pretty sweet of him. 

I later went to the bar to get some water and saw this same dude again. He asked again to make sure I was okay and I quickly said ‚Äúyep‚Äù, downed my water and went back to the crowd to enjoy the rest of the concert. I didn‚Äôt really know what else to say to him so I guess it was my usual fight or flight response. But I was pretty disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to say, instead I was just being my normal anti-social self. I kept thinking about that for the rest of the concert. 

Once the concert was over, I was on my phone trying to figure out what bus to take. Then I saw this dude again talking to a couple other people. I was feeling pretty bad about how anti-social I was all night. So I decided to come up with an excuse to talk to him. 

I pretended like my phone was dead and asked him for help to figure out what bus to take home. I also thanked him for saving me in the mosh pit. We added each other on Instagram and I left to go home. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt find him very attractive. (Which probably made it easier to approach him). But I left the concert feeling a small sense of victory. I haven‚Äôt been out with too many guys and I‚Äôm always too shy to approach guys first. So I was pretty proud of myself for this. 

HOWEVER, this guy keeps messaging me on Instagram multiple times a day. He seems like a decent guy and we apparently have mutual friends. But he seems extremely clingy. And after talking to him a bit more he seems really boring and I don‚Äôt think we have much in common.

As the title states, I have an issue at work with a coworker that repeatedly uses the restroom and doesn't flush. Our work staff is 50/50 M/F and normally, I(35M) would say something to the other guys at work for being nasty, but the problem is it isn't one of the men. We have seperate bathrooms for the staff.(locker rooms with showers and toilets) We have been short handed for about 5 months at work and overtime has been volunteer basis. Someone always has to be on shift 24/7 and each shift is assigned cleaning duties for certain areas of the building and locker rooms fall on the Saturdays 4pm to midnight shift. Said person is the last female staff member to work thursday and none of the others work Fridays or Saturdays. At first some of the guys were volunteering to work the shifts for extra money, but they got sick of cleaning up after said person. Now we have all been assigned days. It is forcing people to work 6 days in a row either with a 16 hour shift or 8 on/off/on again the first or last day of their work week. It is affecting morale and making people angry as they want to spend time with their families. When said person works the shift, they dont clean either locker room and the mess gets left for the other female staff members to find on Sunday or Monday morning. We have said something to my boss but he is afraid to say anything. The said person has gone to HR to file complaints in the past about staff members and managers when someone has talked to her about other issues on the job, including my boss. I have considered going to say something to HR, but several of our staff has stated that would put a target on me by said person and they feel HR wont do anything. So I am here, a bit embarrased asking for adivce on what to do.

TL:DR: Female coworker uses restroom and doesnt flush all the time. Shortstaffed and everyone is assigned to OT now and said shift has to clean up her mess. Boss afraid to say anything for fear of another HR complaint from said person. Staff feels HR wont do anything. Need advice on how to handle situation.",07Mar2020,1

3rd quarter ends next week but I really can‚Äôt deal with another quarter of this school.   My grades have been badly effected by this as well. I feel like I‚Äôd be willing to put in the extra work for the online class if I was able to work in an environment I felt comfortable in.

405,"Hey,

Every birthday I have had since maybe when i went over 17-18 and I'm 21 now I have done pretty much nothing on my birthday as I have no IRL friends... I have had no IRL friends since I was maybe 15, (i had one friend in school but eventually stopped being friends with them cause I felt people were taking the mick since he was fat), so for 5-6 years I've been pretty much a loner in my room, i had some ""friends"" in college but that was only short and we only spoke while in college, no social media or any contact outside of college, tbh it was just one guy who was in my class and he had some friends so i met them... That was when i was 16-17.

Do any of you have the same issues? I just do the usual, sit on my PC and play games / stream on twitch, my mom might get me a cake but that's it, it was my 21st recently and i just played games all day... And your 21st is supposed to be a special thing.

But I mean, I don't mind it's just something i'm wondering about and if others have the same problems.

Plus my mom said she would take me out for dinner or something and then she goes and does something else for her own self, like wtf... You'd probably think why don't you go out yourself, well I have anxiety issues that's why plus why would I go out to dinner by myself, that's stupid. My aunties have said they would take me out for dinner at some point though. IDK what's going on, people just don't care to be honest but I don't mind too much I just continue life in the routine that I have set which I do every day. Wake up, go to computer, stay on computer all day, go bed, REPEAT.

406,"I need advice for a few coworkers that haven‚Äôt had the chance to speak up in (10-20 years being at this ‚Äúhighly classed‚Äù work place. This company is a huge company so I won‚Äôt even mention the name. But I can probably say it‚Äôs a manufacture company for really cool stuff that surprisingly the military and other really know companies use. I do apologize for my grammar ahead of time since it‚Äôs pretty late or early here, (it‚Äôs 3:00 am here) and I‚Äôm in college to get my grammar fixed so hopefully there will be a edit of this post so I won‚Äôt a fool of myself...

So my coworker was explaining to me how she‚Äôs worked there for more than 10 years, she really has no right to say anything because she Hispanic, she claims this because In the whole building if you are white or black you are ok to do/say what ever you want. If you are any other race you are lower than everybody. For instance here‚Äôs one situation that has happen to a coworker of mine recently (not the only time it has happen). She was getting tired of picking up after people when the General Manager of the building was doing a tour for one of the new executives. She was trying to make sure everything looks good in the area before they walked in. Well she decided to politely ask this guy who happens to be black that if he continues to go in and out of the little desk he‚Äôs at he could clean it up before the executive comes in. Now I wasn‚Äôt in the area when I heard this but I had my fair share of racial slurs thrown at me but this one is pretty bad in my opinion. He told this little Hispanic lady who‚Äôs in her wary 50s, ‚Äú No, how about you go grab that broom over there and clean it up yourself, I mean that‚Äôs all your good at anyways‚Äù everyone was laughing with this guy. 
This Hispanic lady got upset but she didn‚Äôt go to HR because HR is best friends with the GM, and the GM he‚Äôs black he believes no one who‚Äôs black should ever get in-trouble. Meaning no consequence if you are black, HR has friends that are white and black and also favorites them more, and our whole building is mainly Black and whites, next is Indian, Hispanic, Asian, and well they all get treated like crap because the GM has favoritisms. 
Now in this whole ordeal is already bad I just started working there about 5 months ago and I think this is worse than High school. And I‚Äôm semi fresh out of high school majority of the building is about 30-70 year olds so they don‚Äôt bug me too much cause they think I‚Äôm dumb and un knowledgeable. When I‚Äôm literally the only person who has common sense and actually uses it. I want to help my co worker and the other people here who have experienced with harassment and racist comments but I don‚Äôt even know who to go to at this point when everyone who‚Äôs higher up won‚Äôt even be close to do anything. Plus there‚Äôs a lot of people who spread roomers about people. For me someone said ‚Äúdid you hear about (insert my name) she said she‚Äôs trying to lose weight but all I see is here just looking as big as her mom‚Äù ok that doesn‚Äôt hurt cause I don‚Äôt care I‚Äôve had worse  but that‚Äôs still annoying another one I‚Äôve experienced but this one is from my supervisor ‚Äúyou need to stop acting like a f***ing child, your just like your f***ing mom, this is why she can‚Äôt get a raise‚Äù this was over the fact I was complaining about someone who was harassing :-) yes ladies and gentlemen even my boss is against me problem is this place is rated as the best company to work at when I have hundreds of people I know who are 100% against it. I just wanna ask who do I go to if I can‚Äôt talk to anyone that‚Äôs higher up in this building.",07Mar2020,1

Half of her lessons are her ranting about various crazy stuff, there's so much stuff I can't remember it all but here's some examples: aliens/Bigfoot/vampires/mermaids existing, aliens building the pyramids, sympathizing with the flat Earth theory, and how we should avoid contact with Asians because of the coronavirus. Oh, in relation to the latter she also explains me the definition of basic words every time she teaches and constantly tells me I get bad grades because I'm not goot at speaking Italian (I'm not native but have been living in Italy for more than 9 years and my Italian is near perfect). 

Now she gave me an F grade on my essay while In middleschool I only got A's and they were way more complicated. The essay was on drugs and apparently the mistake that angered her was that I said ""psychedelic drugs"" (she literally argued with me for half an hour in class that the word ""psychedelic"" doesn't exist).

420,"A short backstory: I have been friends with the guy for 10 years and the girl for 24 years. My husband has known them and has been close to them for 5 years. They have a 1 year old in the house (that never sleeps or plays in the guest room- that will matter later). My husband and I were staying with some friends a few states over during this week. My husband decided to go to bed early one night and went into the guest room and noticed a Bluetooth speaker situated in the corner of the room, it had a perfect view of the entire room (including the bed). He inspected it closer (not sure why it intrigued him so much) but he found out that it had a camera inside. It was plugged into the wall and on the bottom a microSD card was inserted. He removed the card, unplugged the camera, and turned it to face the wall. The next night, he was looking for a cable to plug up an Xbox controller and found a microSD adapter hidden under a ton of game console cords. He told me about the camera last night before we went to bed, we are flying out early this morning. We never plugged the camera back in or turned it around. I realized that I‚Äôve seen that speaker in every room I have ever stayed in with them (they have moved a few times and I‚Äôve stayed with them alone multiple times and with my husband multiple times). It is always placed with a good view of the room. We both decided to take the SD card and adapter with us back home. I do feel awful because it is technically stealing. But we had no way to view what was on the card while we were there. The camera is not for the one year old or security reasons because they both have never ever mentioned it (and it was in their old house before the baby). 

Not really sure what to do now. When we get home, do we immediately see what is on the card? Do we toss the card and forget it happened, give them the benefit of the doubt (I really really don‚Äôt think the girl is capable of doing this. The guy, however, I now feel like this may be possible)? I have no idea how to proceed in the situation because I‚Äôve never experienced something like this. I trust this family with my life, I‚Äôve grown up with them. But I saw the camera and card myself and had a bad feeling about it.

TLDR; My husband and I found a hidden camera with a card in it in the guest room we were staying in. We stayed with good friends we usually trust completely. We took the card with us back home. Now what?",07Mar2020,1

While he and I were sitting down having some bonding time he was telling me about the dating app Grinder. It like Tinder but for gay men. You swipe right if you like a guy. He asked me if I wanted to check it out . I said sure and we were having fun swiping left and right.

We then came upon a picture of a man I recognized. I told Andrew to go to the profile. And despite using a different name it was DEFINITELY Connie‚Äôs husband.

I was shocked because they are anti-gay.  Not in a protesting, hateful way they just think ‚Äúmarriage is between and man and a woman‚Äù.

I am incredibly introverted, and don‚Äôt like going out or really anything to do with crowds. I also suffer quite badly with anxiety, specifically a panic disorder that‚Äôs largely triggered by social crowds. In addition to this I‚Äôm also going through a really bad patch of depression. She‚Äôs well aware of all these things, as I said, she‚Äôs my best friend :)

*Situation:* Her sister has sent an invitation out to a group of girls, including myself, that‚Äôs basically an invite out to a very big nightclub in the city, and it‚Äôs meant to be a night full of clubbing; dancing, drinking, finding guys etc. I‚Äôm definitely not comfortable with the situation I know it‚Äôll be- I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt do drugs, I don‚Äôt go to clubs, I don‚Äôt wear heels and tight dresses, I don‚Äôt do random men, but that‚Äôs the crowd that will be there, and I know it‚Äôs expected that I live like that for the night. 

On a personal level, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I push my depression/panic problems to the side and just be there for my friend even though I know I‚Äôll suffer for it in the short term, or do I apologize and say I can‚Äôt go, and potentially suffer for it in the long term if our friendship gets affected by it? It‚Äôs a big issue in my head, because I can‚Äôt talk to her about it, and reassure her I want to be there for her, because it‚Äôs meant to be a surprise. I want to be there for her, supporting, celebrating, partying, but it‚Äôs a situation I‚Äôm so entirely uncomfortable with, especially at the current moment. Will I come off as a bad friend? I‚Äôm feeling so horrible about it.

Just need a few words of wisdom right now...",07Mar2020,1
447,"Backstory to characterize who I'm dealing with: I met a guy, only went on two dates with him but we slept together once in November. The condom slipped, I took plan b. He seemed to be an overall good dude but some unrelated stuff happened and I told him I need to take a break from dating. Two weeks go by i don't message him too much, then he hits me up it off the blue asking when i last got tested. He says he started getting sti symptoms. He is trying to be a nurse so he gets tests done every month or 3 months or something, last time he was negative and he told me a few times (even the day we had sex) he hadn't slept with anyone for four months. For some reason, the way he stressed that after the symptoms, the way we had sex, and the way he first brought it up makes me believe him. During the whole conversation, he was never accusatory, mean, or judgemental; mainly calm and grateful i did not get angry. But he does say he is disappointed because he hoped the next time he would text me would be to ask me out.

Okay fast forward a few days later. He hits me up and apologizes for being such an ass but he needs me to talk to his gf. Apparently, he has been in a relationship for a while but she was out of the area for a while and wasn't coming back till February, and i was his ""moment of weakness."" I made it a point to talk about exes the first date, he never mentioned a current girlfriend. She came back to meet his parents (must've been a week or so after having sex with me) then they had sex. She started showing symptoms thought she didn't say what. She texts me asking about my sexual history, not really mean but just a bit short with me. I apologize a few times (feeling TERRIBLE, 95% convinced i ruined her life) in the conversation but understandably she pretty much ignored them. She never texts me again after that day.

Current situation: I get tested the same day she does. I'm negative for everything, she is positive for oral herpes. He doesn't text me after i give him the results. So to be absolutely sure, i get tested again in February (3 months from when i hooked up with him) again, tests came back negative again.

Reason for why i think i should tell him:

* He may be expected an update. I told him I would ask my ex to get tested, and report back to him the results. But my ex says he is new to the area and hasn't even picked a doctor yet. I told the cheater this and explained it may take a while. I could've pressed it but decided not to make him freak out unless i knew it was necessary.

* it would clear my name (but since we don't have any mutual connections that i know of, it probably doesn't really matter)

* It can provide a bit of clarity

* If it's not from me, and he truly did not sleep with anyone else, it could mean she cheated but never said anything. Which only really matters if they are still together when she got back in February.

* He expressed he was upset with his girlfriend because if it's not from him, that means it's from her. If he was cheated on too he deserves to know. I imagine he fessed up to her after the symptoms came and that's why he gave her my number.

* If he did not sleep with anyone and still has a slight wonder as to whether it was me or not, the guilt must be eating him up. I know it was eating me up when I thought i was positive.

Reasons for why not:

* He expressed he was upset with his girlfriend because if it's not from him, that means it's from her. (Who knows how he is when he is actually upset, I have only seen him as calm, cool, and collected but that's his ""getting to know you"" persona)

* It really doesn't matter where it came from right? Like they have it now so it is what it is

* If they're still together now, it would put a huge strain on the relationship

* He never asked for my ex's results

* This would just open communication again. I don't really think of him anymore. I mean it was the best sex I'd had up to that point and i thought of that sometimes, but nothing else positive, he wasn't remarkable in terms of personality aside from being chill. So i don't think there is any risk I'd go back to him, especially now knowing I'm negative and he is positive and a cheater. But I'm ending things with my ex today (again) and I'm already feeling how lonely I'll get.

* Part of me wonders if this is just something i feel like doing because I'm bored, because i make a lot of stupid decisions when I'm bored.

* It would be much easier on her to blame the cheater

* It's just oral herpes. It could be from sharing food with a cousin or friend for all they know, this may just spark an accusing fight between them.

* This man almost gave me oral herpes. Thank goodness I had something come up that made me stop dating. He planned on asking me out again!",07Mar2020,1

I admit, it goes really close to home for me. Some of the closest people in my life have been victims of assault and it is not their fault. I really regret not saying anything at the time, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how she‚Äôs probably saying that to more students. It‚Äôs harmful and wrong.

Well that is part of the problem. While that would surely solve basically all my problems, it's easier said then done.

Here comes the big part: I Can't get one. And by that I don't mean I'm not attractive or greasy or whatsoever, no. I can't show emotions to other people in my closer surroundings. And by I can't, I mean I can't, not just don't know how to. I'm paralyzed by a deep rooted fear of having the feelings I show made fun of and turned against me. Likely because that happens once when I was a child, which went on for quite some while. 
""So why don't you try with someone with less personal relationships towards, like a tinder match or sth?"" 
For once, fear of such people not taking it as serious as it is to me. Second, I don't want such a thing. I want someone I know and am on the same wavelength with. And I want to know that beforehand.

There are a couple of things that make me feel a bit safer though.

462,"First of all, please don't tell me it's just a flu etc. I'm not afraid of the virus itself, but the civil unrest and insecurity it's causing, and the effect it is having on my PTSD. 

My SO and I had a stillborn daughter in September, the weeks before she passed away were a complete nightmare, every week we had hospital visits to see how she was doing, and every week we got more bad news. I didn't eat or sleep and was constantly on high alert.
When she passed away I was devastated, but part of me was also relieved that the nightmare we had been living for weeks was over. 

I had therapy twice a week up until last week as I need to wait for the next therapy. I was diagnosed with PTSD.

Now the corona outbreak is happening and I am terrified. I feel like I've just been dumped back into the hell that was the last weeks of the pregnancy. 
The insecurity, not knowing what or when it will happen, the constant living from update to update.

I feel like I'm right back where I started back then. I'm not sleeping. Not eating, and struggling with taking care of myself. 
My SO got sick yesterday and all sick people in my area are told to self isolate because there is spreading from an unknown source.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I have a meeting with my GP on Monday as a safety net in between therapies, I really need this appointment because I'm losing my mind, but if I get sick with what my husband has, I can't go to the appointment.

I found myself developing feelings but just dismissed them and hoped they‚Äôd go away. During this time he got a Friend with Benefits  and I wasn‚Äôt really bothered by it because I thought what I was feeling was just confusion about how close our friendship was. 

We met over the Christmas period because we were both back home from uni. We both had a nice time and enjoyed one another‚Äôs company from what I can tell. I began to realise that my feelings might not be as easily dismissible at this time. However a) he has a friend with benefits, b) he has stated time and time again how he doesn‚Äôt want a long distance relationship and regrets spending most of his teen years in serious relationships, c) he also stopped talking to me as regularly (I partly attributed this to him becoming more serious with his friend with benefits and from he‚Äôs told me it is pretty much as casual relationship at this point). We still talked a bit but considerable less which I found difficult at first because I was used to him being part of my daily life even just as messages and phone calls. 

Anyway last week we both went to a concert together and he ended up staying over at mine because I live closer to it. It was during the day I spent with him that I realised how in love with his friend with benefits he is. Was constantly checking messenger to see if he replied what‚Äôs worse is that I know he used to do that for me even if just in a friendship way now I get left on read for days.

471,"Hi I know this seems so dumb but I‚Äôm freaking out and need advice. I went for a grad school interview to a very small program (they take 8 students per year), and they wanted to get to know the applicants really well. Applicants had an informal dinner with current students in the program the night before to ask them questions about the program and their life in the city. 

The day of the interview, current students took us on a campus tour and had lunch with us. Then the program director gave us an overview of the program, and then each applicant had four 30-minute one-on-one interviews with assorted faculty members, including the program director. 

My dilemma is this: throughout the two days, it was stressed to ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù and let everyone get to know you, as they believed all applicants were great on paper but just wanted to find the best fit for the program. A lot of the time the structure was less formal, as we were encouraged to ask the students questions about their lives. Some talked about their husbands and children. People would ask us about our plans, especially because for us college students spring break is coming up. A few times, I was asked if I had travel plans, and I told them that I would be leaving the next morning to fly to LA for spring break. Some people asked who with, and I told them I was going with my boyfriend.

I suspect that it‚Äôs not such a big deal to say this to the students, but I recall some of the faculty in the individual interviews asking this question and giving them my answer. Is it weird to refer to ‚Äúmy boyfriend‚Äù in an interview??? I‚Äôm kind of freaking out about it. Several times the faculty stressed how important professionalism is in the program and I feel like I completely failed at that. I didn‚Äôt even realize this mistake until I was trying to fall asleep that night.

Also, it's not like I dont like my job now, I just figured I'd go to the interview and see how I'd like it. The job doesn't look to difficult, but then again, my job now isnt that difficult either (they both have their ups and downs I guess lol).

Another thing is that both places are understaffed, so no matter where i go, the other place is screwed until the got more people. I talked to my now managers, and they want me to stay, but I haven't talked to my brothers boss yet. It might put my bro in an uncomfortable spot, but I'm not sure what to do.

Everyone in this world struggles to be loved. Be it an extroverted person, with positive vibes surrounding them, or an introverted person who finds joy in being alone, everyone struggles to be acknowledged. They may deny it, but they cannot hide it from themselves, right?. Extroverts find themselves to be alive by interacting with other people. While introverts find themselves, in being alone.

I am sure even the extroverts have few problems in life that they cannot share with their friends. And even if you share a secret with me, I don‚Äôt have anyone to tell it to, so, your secret is safe in my hands. :) 

I am sure everyone out there faces their sadness with a smile. Why doesn't everyone come to understand each other? I think that's what you feel too, right?

This is my personal view.

I don‚Äôt really have someone whom I can call ‚ÄúA proper friend‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I found anyone who can understand me or understand my problems and give me their warmth. I think it would be better if they are of the opposite gender. Not friends, not lovers, but something beyond that, something which brought them together.

I was a very talkative person back in school, with so many people surrounding me. Back then, I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself being alone. I had good friends back then, be it girls and boys. As I grew up, I began losing them, which sucks. Of course I want them, but they probably don‚Äôt want me. With a gap of two years for intense study, I lost them all. Even if I try to talk to them now, I don‚Äôt really have anything to talk to them about. We are like strangers. 

When I came to college, I thought I would make some friends, I did, but not the type I wanted, not the type I had in school. Well, I can‚Äôt blame them, because the world is diverse. I don‚Äôt know what happened to me in these two years, I am unable to talk to people like before. 

I might try to initiate a conversation, but before I do that, I would‚Äôve already imagined the conversation in my head and would‚Äôve come to a conclusion that the other person might not be interested in a boring person like me. And hence, in reality, the conversation never starts. Even worse for the opposite gender.

It‚Äôs been like that since I came to college, and I don‚Äôt think it will improve anytime soon.

I am also too worried about what other people think of me, while deep inside I know that they don‚Äôt really care about my actions. It‚Äôs really complicated. Making new friends is complicated. This whole world is complicated. All I ever wanted was to have good friends, with whom I can share anything without giving a second thought. Not many, one or two is fine. And I don‚Äôt want to hurt or get hurt. I want to keep learning from these awesome people.

I am sure everyone has someone whom they look up to, like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, etc. But I look up to my classmates, the ones who seem free, the ones who gets loved easily, I constantly observe them and try to learn something from them, yet I didn‚Äôt really change, at least that‚Äôs what I think, and there is no one to see me change, so I wouldn‚Äôt even know if I have changed or not. I just hope I change, or someone would change me. Otherwise, I think I will consider myself a failure.

Life truly is beautiful and full of surprises, but I think I am not able to grasp it fully.

What I wrote above, I wanted to convey all of this to my friend, a non-existent one, hence I am penning this down. This is probably the first time in my life that I am writing something like this. 

I appreciate and encourage you to comment anything (including suggestions for my well being and all), I will be reading them for sure.

490,"...But IDK what to say!

He was a very angry man when I was growing up, treated my mother horribly, abandoned us a couple times, and after the divorce (which happened when I was moving out as an adult anyway) he would come in and out of my life, and do some truly uncool stuff (like stalking me and my mom). Around 2015 he started emailing me asking to reconnect, and how he wants me, my brother, and my mom to be a family again. My brother and my mom want nothing to do with him, but I guess I'm a tiny bit more forgiving.

I sent him a long email detailing exactly why I was so mad at him, and he promised that he's changed, I didn't say anything for a couple years, still haven't. But lately I've been having dreams about him, nice ones, and its been sticking with me in my waking life and it makes me wonder if it's time to reconnect.

When I try and send an email, I get nervous because I don't know if he truly has changed or if I""ll get myself into another mess.

I'm also not the daughter he thought he would have. He wanted me to be wholesome, but I smoke weed, I work at a dispensary, I've gotten divorced and I like girls (as well as other people, but still). I'm not sure if he's truly ready for that knowledge.

This is what I've come up with so far:  
"" I'm not ready to meet up.

You say you've changed, but there's a long history of you not changing. I want to believe that people can change, and that our past doesn't define us, but I guess it's harder to put into practice when the person who was hurtful is your own father.

I've been dreaming about you, and its been surprisingly pleasant. Maybe my dreams are using you as a symbol for something else, but I can't help but wonder if it's time for me to make contact.

491,"So basically, I'm a loner. I'm 19f and I have no friends. I moved in 2014 when I was 14, and I had to leave all my friends behind. I've tried to keep in contact with them, but as it goes most of the time, they don't text or answer calls anymore. I didn't let this stop me from trying to make friends here.

In 2015, I started 9th grade. I started to talk with people and I even made a couple of friends. During this time, I developed severe acne. My confidence plummeted... people stopped talking to me and began to avoid me. Instead of asking me how my day was, I got questions like ""did you get in an accident,"" or ""do you wash your face?"" It was bad. This is when **I** began to avoid people and I felt ashamed in my own skin. I did meet my boyfriend during this time, but I was still awkward. In a way, I was relieved that he liked me despite my condition and shyness. We started dating in 2016 and are still together today. I began talking to people again during this time, but friendships never really developed. I found myself only hanging out with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend has his own friends, and I've hung out with them at times too. The problem is that I'd like my own friends and not have to depend on my boyfriend to experience a social life. He has encouraged multiple times to go out and meet people or join a club, but that ultimately fails. Usually people are already in tight friend groups and I feel like an intruder at times.

Fast forward to 2020, I'm in my last semester of college (dual-enrollment in high-school) and I'm graduating soon. During this time, I still had issues making friends and talking with people. I start university this summer and I'd like to take my life back. I still battle with acne, but not like before. I know I'm capable of bringing myself out, but I'd like some advice.

If a woman sleeps with me or does something while being happy with me and then getting sad that a less attractive man enters the room, I quitely tell her to get her shit together, etc.

Why are women so emotionally lazy to less attractive men? If you become emotionally lazy, he'll be also emotionally lazy, and you BOTH will resent each other! It's a vicious cycle of no one attempting to do anything!

I honestly believe when women say they love ""confidence"", what they actually mean is just unloading all of their shitty problems and responaibilities ON ME, or OTHER MEN:

1. *My man's here, he'll talk since he knows how to, no reason for me to learn to be charismatic*

2. *My man's here, he'll entertain everyone that's here while I watch*

3. *My man's here, he knows what to suggest, I don't need to think*

4. *My man's here, he'll decide what to do*

5. *My man's here, he can take my pain, I'll just unload everything on him. Oh he's unloading on me? No, I don't have the strength for that*.

Obviously this complaint is not exclusive to women, but when people say they want confidence, what they mean is THEY LOVE BEING EMOTIONALLY LAZY.

Like screw off. Incels can't get as ""confident"" , and likely shouldn't. I feel abused BECAUSE people feel that being ""confident"" (emotionally active) means they can just stand aside and be apathetic to everyone else. 

So as a tall, attractive, confident, self aware philanthropist, I must say I hate apathetic people like you who think that picking people up and helping them is ""none of your business"".",07Mar2020,1

518,"I agree it was my fault, because an year ago, me and the (now) bullies had some conflict, and in a stupid fit of rage, I kicked whatever we were playing with. I did not cause any damage, but that night I realized I was being a jerk, and I apologized the very next day.

The thing is, they still won't let me hang out with them. I have another group of friends, and we hang out, but they enjoy it more with them around. I don't want to be a jerk, point it out and look like a spoilt idiot, so I don't. I just go back home.

My mum still wants me to ""play"" with them so that I stay fit. I think I'm too old now, but she won't listen. She has no idea what's going on, and I'm not telling her I kicked something angrily. If I do, she's just gonna be angry with me, because I do stuff I'm not proud of in fits of anger. She wants me to be able to control my anger, and I really try.

Today, it escalated to a new level. They started throwing stuff at me, (and it would hurt really hard if it hit) but luckily, they missed both times, and I escaped unharmed.

522,"
I need advice for a few coworkers that havent had the chance to speak up in around 10-15 years of being at this, ‚Äúhighly classed‚Äù work place. I do apologize for my grammar or spelling ahead of time since it‚Äôs pretty late or early here (it‚Äôs 3:00 am writing this) because I'm losing sleep over this. 

So my coworker was explaining to me how she‚Äôs worked there for more than 12 years and apparently in this company, she really has no right to say anything because she is Hispanic. She claims this because in the whole building if you are white or black you are ok to do/say what ever you want. If you are any other race you are considered lower than everybody. For instance here‚Äôs one situation that has happened to a coworker of mine recently (not the only time it has happened):

She was getting tired of picking up after people when the General Manager of the building was doing a tour for one of the new executives. She was trying to make sure everything looks good in the area before they walked in. Well she decided to politely ask this guy who happens to be black that if he continues to go in and out of the little desk he‚Äôs at he could clean it up before the executive comes in. Now I wasn‚Äôt in the area when I heard this but I've had my fair share of racist remarks thrown at me, but this one is pretty bad in my opinion. He told this poor little Hispanic lady who‚Äôs in her late 50s, ‚ÄúNo, how about you go grab that broom over there and clean it up yourself, I mean that‚Äôs all your good at anyways.‚Äù

She told me later that many people around her started to laugh with this guy at her. This Hispanic lady got upset but she didn‚Äôt go to HR because the HR department has good ties with the GM, and the GM (who happens to be black) believes no one who‚Äôs black should ever get in-trouble because ""diversity"". The HR department has similar views on race, and the entire department just happens to be either white or black. Overall, the building contains primarily white and black",07Mar2020,1

532,"Hi everyone. Firstly I met my boss (I‚Äôll refer to him as N) (I am 25. N is 59)  through family as he‚Äôs been an acquaintance of my late father since their school days together. He‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve known all my life but only met him twice, very briefly, during my childhood and now have reconnected with him around 6 months ago.  He was suggested to me by my step mom after my previous place of work closed down and I was left jobless and broke. 
So N took me under his wing I guess and had me working on projects for him. This was back in October last year. Nothing odd happened up until near Xmas when he asked me what I‚Äôd like for an Xmas gift. Accepting a gift from my boss and only after a few months of really knowing each other... I didn‚Äôt think it right or appropriate, since I always feel very obligated to buy in return and I just didn‚Äôt have the money to return the favour.  I kept declining. He kept insisting and asking me over and over what I wanted. He said he‚Äôd just go ahead then and buy me a nice dress to go to my family‚Äôs Xmas get-together in and kept asking for my measurements and style of dress I‚Äôd like so after getting tired of him asking, I gave him my measurements.
Fast forward to Xmas day and he dropped a gift off with me in the morning but told me to ‚Äúopen it in private‚Äù.  So I opened it in private. Was it a dress ? No. It was lingerie. A very expensive, full lingerie set. Bustier thingy/corset, garter belt, suspenders, stockings... you get the idea. Now, obviously I‚Äôm confused at this point. There were a few other practical items in there.. a scented candle.. a book on something I‚Äôm interested in, but still... lingerie. 
End of the night I text him thanking him and made a joke about how he should get a refund because the ‚Äúdress‚Äù is missing a whole load of material. He replied saying ‚ÄúHa. Sorry it‚Äôs a bit naughty but I hope you like it anyway :)‚Äù 
It‚Äôs weird because I just can‚Äôt get my head around his motive for it. He never talks about the lingerie or never asked to see pics of me wearing it (which is absolutely what I thought he was going to do as soon as I saw it). We just carried on normal work related chat as usual and the usual ‚Äúhow are you today ?‚Äù kind of thing.. up until... 

A few weeks back,  he wanted to discuss work things so invited me to meet him in the evening at his house and said that a co worker of mine would be there too. Long story short.. Co worker wasn't there and wasn‚Äôt even invited there at all. I was the only person invited. So N deliberately lied about that. 
So I was there, me and N did spend most the time discussing work things like said. He was drinking a lot all evening but he was never sexual/inappropriate with me. Although did seemed depressed and was ranting a lot about how his ex wife had had an affair and hurt him .. then (I‚Äôm not even kidding).. he went a got a bag of cocaine from somewhere in his house and started snorting it. Right in front of me. Cutting lines of it up on the table that I was actually sitting at. He asked me if I wanted any. He could tell by my face that I was upset/shocked/panicked so told me not to worry, that he did coke on a regular basis and he knows his limits. He said he wasn‚Äôt in a state to make sure I got back home safely so offered me to stay at his in the spare room. Obviously I left anyway once I knew he was ok. 
He phoned me the following morning to apologise and that he was drunk and all of it was the result of a crappy day. 


I just can‚Äôt figure the guy out or what he wants from me. His motives or the reason for the lingerie or the lying to get me to his house alone, especially when he seems to have no interest in acting upon his motives (like not seeming interesting in the lingerie he bought me) 

Any opinions/advice on this situation ? Thank you in advance.",07Mar2020,1
533,"Hi people of r/Advice! I am facing a life crisis and would like some feedback.

I graduated with a MA from University of Delaware back in 2018. I had intended on going for a PhD, but for various self-imposed reasons got sidetracked during my 3rd semester and never applied.

My first job post-graduation was in electrical engineering. This was a six month internship which was lucrative, but I found the work not to my interest. Furthermore, all the employees seemed absolutely miserable in their personal lives due to the job.

I next worked in municipal management for a 6 months in Prince George‚Äôs County, but was abruptly fired for ‚Äúinadequate work performance‚Äù. AKA, my boss waited 3 months to review a project I was assigned that I had no experience in, and had little time to complete because in that time I single-handedly had 1) increased tourism by 800% 2) won an international award for a business development project 3) managed and salvaged our trash collection agency because we received on average 100 complaints a month for missed collection 4) teach myself Spanish so that I could be the ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù to illegal businesses operating in town before the actual authorities went after them 5) lead a communications effort in town that literally never existed before and has since dropped 6) produced and managed the only programs my department produced ... meanwhile the Development Director took 8 hour lunch breaks and my boss seemed uninterested in her department.

Anyway. After that I (27 M) moved back in with my retired parents in rural Pennsylvania, which I very much appreciate. I struggled to find a meaningful, and even not meaningful, job until last week. In that time, I received a rejection notice from University of Nevada due to lack of funding and an acceptance without funding until ‚Äúmaybe Spring‚Äù from University of Hawaii.

My question is, should I take the PhD position at Hawaii? I am not sure if I should risk it for the biscuit and hopefully secure funding through a TAship or some other source in Spring. The program is great and specializes in what I want to do for research/career, but again, it is currently unfunded.

556,"This is long, TLDR at bottom, but would really appreciate advice.

So, my mother moved down to FL, a few months ago, from a small city in upstate NY. My sister and I also live in the same city, and my mother moved into an apartment complex, that my sister and I both have lived in prior. 

My mother is a wonderful woman, but she hasn't lived apart from my father in over thirty years in their nice upper middle class home. My mother is very reliant on my father to deal with finances, not that she doesn't work, my father just did it for their entire relationship. 

So, the complex she lives in is decent, mostly older folks, but about 25% younger people. Her neighbors seem around my age, late 20s early 30s. One has a son, and one definitely seemed like he was family(a fellow homosexual.) 

From the first week she stated that there was an argument, that she heard from upstairs, that was between a man and a woman and the man shouted ""she knows, and I want to know what she knows."" This where it all began. 

So since then, she was 100% certain that someone hacked her iPhone, which no offense, but she barely knows how to use. Constantly hitting the  wrong buttons and unintentionally opening apps, and saying the phone is broken type of deal. 

She then moved onto thinking they're breaking into her apartment, which went on for a while(technically still is), but that reached it's head like two weeks ago. I picked her up in the morning, and she spent the night, and when we got there the next morning she was freaking the fuck out about a chair that was moved into another room. I was having a heavy depression day the day prior so I honestly couldn't remember if the chair was there to begin with or not. However, later that day she remembered she moved the chair there to clean the blinds.

Finally, and most currently, she asked me to tape a piece of cardboard over the ac vent, and also over the little crack from where you hang vertical blinds, because people were looking in at night. She also thinks that the neighbors are basically putting a GoPro on a selfie stick down the ac vent. 

So, I really am trying to be supportive of her, because my sister basically got fed up with it and told her she's being paranoid and creating her own problems(Not speaking I'll of her, she's just an empath, shes a bit more sensitive to drama). I just can't honestly figure out if my mother is imagining it all though, truly not sure. Signs point to yes, but maybe she just has nosey neighbors, and it's not nefarious in any sense.

Bottom line, idk if it's just culture shock of going from small city to big city combined with living by yourself for the first time in over 30 years, also combined with living with upstairs neighbors instead of in your cushy home for over 30 years. Also potentially listening to Fox news and taking it's word as gods. Also from my experience in the community and from my past self, when you invite Tina to party, sometimes people get a bit paranoid. Paranoid that a Boomer white woman is going to call the cops on you. Just a personal theory.

TLDR: White suburban woman moves from small city to a large one. Thinks she's being spied on, possibly true, but not likely. More likely she's experiencing culture shock, but I'm(her son) still unsure if it's true.",07Mar2020,1

558,"I love her but she‚Äôs so rude sometimes.

Last week I accidentally gave my dog palm oil, and he had diarrhea for two days. That whole time she was yelling at me, telling me it was my fault. When I asked to take him to the vet she told me now that if he dies I‚Äôm the one who killed him.

Now today he peed on the curtains and trash cans. She threatened to kick him down the stairs, and she says she did that to my last dog (I never knew that?) I want to bring him to the vet since I feel like there‚Äôs a problem with his teeth but she keeps saying no that she‚Äôll leave him until he dies.

The problem is days later she always act like nothing happened. She never apologizes to me. I never ask for an apology either or continue being mad because she always tells me she‚Äôs going to die soon or something and I don‚Äôt want to be mad at her. Family is also important to me.

Idk what to do. I love her, but how can she treat a 4 pound chihuahua so badly?

559," My friend (19M) is also my ex. We remained as best friends until around two months ago, where we downgraded to being friends. For simplicity's sake, I will call him Bob.

I (18F) went to Bob for a lot of my problems with mental health and parents, and he's given me a lot of advice on it. I feel like I haven't really taken steps to actually take that advice and as a result, ended up mentally burdening on top of what he has to deal with in university.

Timeskip to last week, I was about to submit my additional information form for university (I will refer to it as ADF). My English tutor and I had spent a lot of time working on it and it was more or less ready to submit. Bob asked if he could take a look and I thought 'sure, why not' and sent it to him. He made some suggestions that I kind of disagreed with. 

We got in a discussion about the ADF and it spiraled down from there. I told him that I didn't want to continue on this topic because I was already stressed from schoolwork. It spiraled from the ADF to things like ""sticking to my traditional tutors and traditional parents until they have full control over my life"", calling me a coward because I continuously told him to stop talking about this topic, and saying how it's pathetic that ""I can't handle the truth"".

My parents are relatively traditional but I can tell that they're (trying) making an effort to not repeat past mistakes. My English tutor isn't really 'traditional' - I would say she's relatively 'modern' but more practical when it comes to writing.

The conversation continued to spiral down from there, comments about 'true love' and such. The thing that really drove me to block him was when he said that I couldn't look him in the eye 'because he was ugly'.

A friend of mine passed a message from him. It was about how he was done with the friendship and how I've only given him 'bad impressions of other people'. I admit that I have given him bad impressions of others and need to keep that in check. My friend thinks that it isn't right for me to blame him being blunt towards me otherwise I'd be running in circles again and again. She also mentions that I only care about talking to my friends about how blunt Bob is.

After that message, I said 'thanks.' and thought everything was done. I could go and improve on my personality and just move on in general. 

Recently I went to chat in a discord server and I found that he's made a post about me, saying similar things like how I need to stand up to my parents but in a more 'nicer-ish' way. At the beginning, he mentions about how I've blocked him and that he won't apologize for the things he said. He made no mention about the comments he made about 'true love'/looks and hopes that I have a good future and take the advice to heart.

I agree that yes, I need to stand up to my parents. Most of his comments are indeed true, but after seeing that post on a discord server, I'm becoming confused as to what is 'right and wrong' in this situation.",07Mar2020,1
560,"So this has been happening with me the last ~2months;

I set on my computer, try to find anything to just not get bored, play a little of Minecraft (with music 24h on)

After a while I noticed I feel shit, not sure how to describe this but my head feels... Compressed? And I feel angry, like if anyone annoy me the slightest I just rage but It isn't  physical or anything, just mental stuff, That's the closest I can describe it, the music is loud and is giving me headaches, I simply turn off most sounds, after that and play silently, and then I say ""should I play, or rather, **why** should I play?, No one gonna see my builds or anything (the game is offline), so I quit the game and then try to find anything else to play with or enjoy

Still the compressed head and sick feeling continues, when it happens I just want to rest/sleep, I snuggle into my bed and just sleep it off like always or browse some content on my phone, sometimes from the loud music my ears hurt a little

The problem is, while the headaches and ear ""hurtness"" are probably from the loud music, the compressed head and shitty feeling in my body (mostly around my stomach) is what I'm talking about... I just feel like shit, no problem actually with my stomach or anything

I noticed this happened after I stopped playing with my friends, I don't join discord rooms or anything anymore (in fact I haven't joined a single room in like 45 days) I still talk with them In real life and while texting in chats, I just don't feel like joining discord rooms, specially when there are a lot of people

This have been happening every weekend, the cycle loops

Anyway to help? Maybe stop using my PC, I have thought of that a lot, but I have **nothing else to do**

A shower sometimes helps actually, so I think this is mostly a mental situation (except for my ears tho)

562,"I have been with my fianc√© for 8 years now. When we started dating she told me she might not be able to have kids, due to a medical condition when she was younger. Two and a half years ago we found out she was pregnant. Gave birth to my baby boy. Then everything started to unravel. 
She went through postpartum kinda bad. She refused to admit it or seek help. I finally got her to take some supplements, which seemed to help, even if it was just a placebo. 
I work second shift, 1:30pm-10pm. So my time home with my family is small. This did not help the situation at all. She felt she was doing everything, and I was doing nothing. She would verbally abuse me at every turn it seemed. No matter what I did, or said, I was wrong. 
Last October I felt something was odd with her. She was acting like she was hiding something. When you‚Äôve been with someone long enough, you just kinda know. I waited until she fell asleep and went into her phone. Found out she was on a chat app, sending pics. The one I saw was of her naked breasts. 
My heart dropped. How could the mother of my child do this to me? Was it going further then this app? Every horrible scenario was running through my head. I woke her up and confronted her about it. We talked for 2 days about it, and we seemed to have worked everything out. 
I decided if she was seeking attention, it should come from me. I tried to pay attention to her emotional needs more. I tried to spice thing up in the bedroom by buying some lingerie for Xmas. Everything seemed to be getting better. 
Two weeks ago I noticed the ‚Äúsigns‚Äù again. Acting weird on her phone when I was around. I decided to talk to her about it. I told her if that‚Äôs what she needed to do fine. But stop sneaking around. Thats not how I really felt, but the sneaking around was killing me inside. I hate the unknown. Again, I waited and snuck into her phone several times when she was doing things around the house. She again had downloaded the same app as before. So I did more research. Apparently on this app you make ‚Äúcards‚Äù with your pics, name, age, location. Her card was made up of all the sexy pics she sent me of the lingerie that I bought her for Xmas. 
During the time from November until the past week, I have had to deal with this, her car having a costly repair that drained my savings, my mom has health issues, my uncle, who was like a father to me, had passed, and my truck blew out a break line on my way to work. So needless to say my depression and anxiety were through the roof. So I tried to find an easy way out. I didn‚Äôt want to confront her and have her make me feel like I was the bad guy, like she has so many times in the past. I didn‚Äôt know what would happen if we split. what would I do about my kid? Where would I move? Would she hold him hostage against me. Again, every horrible thought was just racing. 
Last Wednesday I confronted her. We were lying in bed. Not talking. My mind was going crazy and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breath. I finally rolled over and said to her, out of everything that‚Äôs happened over the past few months, you lying to me, hurts me the most. She asked what I was talking about. Told her I say her card. She promised me the last time that there would be no more naked pictures. Once again there were tears and apologies. After a bit, she got up and slept on the couch. 
We didn‚Äôt talk much the next day. But I thought a lot. And I knew that no matter how we worked this out, she would just end up back in the same situation. I actually convinced myself that maybe I should join her. It seemed like an easy way out. Maybe she would be more honest about things if we did them together. I was so afraid of her twisting it around on me, I convinced myself she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. 
So last Friday we both joined the app. Made a set of rules for each other. No nudes unless we are together. No PMs. And rules about usage, and that we were going to do this ‚Äútogether‚Äù. I kinda felt into it. 
The first few days were fun. We were talking more, at home and when we were apart. She would post just selfies mostly, nothing with skin, unless she knew I was on break at work, or we were home together. Even then it was just a couple of pics a day. Then things starting getting bad. Her posts were becoming more frequent. More skin. It felt like we weren‚Äôt doing this together anymore. That‚Äôs when it hit me. It‚Äôs never been about us. It‚Äôs always been about her. Last night she posted 7 pics, all risqu√©, and 3 videos, within a couple hours. I was at work, just breaking up inside. Then I felt dead. No more feelings. I was just a shell. I left the groups we were in together, and deleted the app. 
She texted me immediately, and I told her straight up, we have nothing to talk about. It‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt care. I got home from work, she tried getting me to talk, but I wouldn‚Äôt let her have it. I just kept a calm voice and insisted we had nothing to talk about. That we are fine. I couldn‚Äôt talk to her about it. She has made me feel bad 3 times over the same thing. As if I was in the wrong. 
Now what do I do? I gotta leave her right? I don‚Äôt know how the courts work with custody battles. I don‚Äôt have much family here, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going to move too. We live paycheck to paycheck now. I just really don‚Äôt know what to do and I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to any family or friends about it. I‚Äôm afraid of what she will do if she thinks I‚Äôm going around bad mouthing her.

567,"(sorry for formatting)

Some important things to say before I start is, im (F20) and have a bf (m21). Been together for 2 years. Left my abusive home to come live with him and now have no where to go. I'm dependant off him in the way that he provides a house for me, and human connection and contact as I have no friends or family either if I may add. I'm his first ever partner and sexual partner and we do everything together. Im not in college, and can't drive as I'm beyond terrified to drive and I wasn't allowed to in my abusive family.

 Today as I was laying down in bed, I went to look through my email. First thing I saw was ""Dear (boyfriends name) your (girlfriends name) engagement ring project is on the way, tell us more about her!"" Let me tell you that I instantly started crying and felt a knot in my stomach, not in happiness.

I need to add that me and my boyfriend have not been doing so well. Terrible finances, can't stand being near him, me doing everything under the sun while he sits and does nothing. I feel like I'm being manipulated to stay with him. I'm always sad all the time, he's always sad, no one's really happy. 

We both aren't in college, I only have job as he doesn't wanna work. I clean and cook, because he doesn't want to, and he's depressed as I try to help him maybe get therapy but he doesn't want it.

I can't tell if it's because we are both mentally and physically struggling with life right now and I tend to flee from those types of situations but I can't as I have a partner and I'm not used to that type of hardship, or if it's because I actually hate him or maybe it's because I feel in debt to him for helping me escape an abusive home. We do have good times alot but it's overwhelmed by the negativity in our life. If we had more money I feel like maybe our life would be better. May I add that I have a problem with saying no, no matter how sad I am?

The advice I'm asking if I should just take the ring but not get married and try to fix our problems, breakup with him but be homeless,  or just get married anyways. 

I just feel so lost as every way our relationship has went has been so hard. I don't feel ready and I don't want him to kill himself if I do leave or for him to be homeless. I genuinely care for him and want him to be happy. Just from afar maybe. Im trying so hard not to fall into despair, but it's getting harder everyday. The only thing that keeps be going is knowing that my life won't always hopefully be like this and I have the chance to thrive if I keep living. I have talked to someone about this problem. 

I'm just so lost in life. Words encouragement, advice, anything is helpful on what you would do or how I should go about this.",07Mar2020,1

Today, I go into work, and on my To-Do clipboard there was a note about a motor missing. I finished all my other tasks, got done early because there happened to not be much to do today, so I spent the rest of my time looking for the missing motor. I looked for about two hours, moving boxes, taking pallets down from the upper shelves with a forklift, and searching every single possible area.

I then get a text to see my boss in his office. I go in, and he has the cameras up. I sit down, and he says he‚Äôs been watching me, and wanted to know what I‚Äôve been doing. I told him I finished everything on my list and was searching for the missing motor. He then tells me **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure putting a lot of effort into finding it, aren‚Äôt you? Why should you care so much about if you find it or not?‚Äù** I told him that ***it‚Äôs literally my job, and that I‚Äôm working hard for the company as any employee should do.*** His response was **‚ÄùNonononono.

Goodbye.‚Äù** I just stood up and left. Fucking asshole.

Anyway, is this legal to do? Just fire someone without any proof or reason to suspect of theft? I live in Florida if that helps. I have a child on the way, and had just gotten a $2.50 payraise. I feel like that has to do with it. What can I possibly do if anything?",07Mar2020,1
570,"Hi, I am 21F and I go to a small community college. Yesterday I was waiting outside for my ride when this guy I had never met came up to me and started to engage in conversation and ask me questions. He was incredibly awkward and asked me weird things like my age before he even asked my name (he is 27, he does go to the school). It was weird but I am nice so I tried my best to talk to him even though he was struggling with conversation. He asked me multiple times for my phone number and I refused, until I eventually pitied him for having no friends (as he said) and I gave it to him. I was very happy when my ride came as I could leave the situation, I was very uncomfortable. 

A few hours later and I already recieved 2 texts, a call, and a voicemail from him. Today I have gotten 2 texts where he asked me to meet him on Monday (we spoke for only about 4 minutes). I do not wish to know this man at all, I should have stayed strong and refused giving him my number. I am unsure of how to proceed with this.

I'm going to see her tomorrow, and while I know she doesn't want sex, she wants to take turns making out while on top of each other (I do too, we're both very vigilant about consent and stuff). While not actually sex, it's still very erotic.  
I'm insecure about a lot of my body, and I'm trying to be confident and she's trying to be confident. But we've only kissed a few times, and neither of us are very good at it. I want to be good at it for her, but I know I won't be.  
Another thing I'm worried about is that every time we cuddle, I get an erection. (To re-iterate, I'm a transgender girl, so I have a penis) I'm not horny or anything, it just happens on its own. But this time, considering our positions, I'm sure she's going to see and feel it. I've already told her that I'm almost certainly going to get hard and asked her if she was okay with that, and she says its fine even if she feels it, but it's still really embarrassing.

576,"So, to start, I graduated in dec 2019 with a PhD in biology. For several reasons (my own health issues, my son is special needs and has been on a waitlist for an inclusive day care for months), I've not done anything with it yet in my field. 

Now that my husband has left and decided he doesn't actually want to be a parent (literally told me he wasn't ready WHEN OUR SON WAS ALREADY A YEAR OLD, met me while I was in grad school, thought he could gold dig), I don't set me being able to return to research and still be there for my son (think expected to work 50-60 hour weeks + be on call always). Even the day care he's waiting on is only part time. 

While it is humiliating to have this high degree and try to get into something entry level in another field, I don't think I have many other options right now. I need to be able to provide for us while also giving my son the parenting time he needs. In addition, academia is just extremely toxic. If there is a God playing a hand in this, I think the whole reason I have a PhD was to be able to spot stuff in him early and to be able to figure out (through extensive experimentation) how to reach him.

578,"So I've always known my boyfriend is depressed, and it usually shows in days where he's not working/going to school. Thing is, he doesn't get help. He has tried to many times but never managed to get anything out of it, so he has lost hope in the system (several GPs, several psychiatrists). Never once gotten antidepressants perscribed which he wants to try, so he copes by smoking weed (which I generally don't mind, I just don't want him to feel like he has to). He says the only way to really get them is to admit you're suicidal but he doesn't want something like that on his record. He's not admitted to me that he's suicidal, but he does ask a lot of existential questions when he's in one of his depressive moods.

The main issue is that he self-harms infront of me a lot when he's in these moods. It's nothing permanent or that's visible for a long time, but he slams his head into things (sometimes repeatedly) or pulls his hair really hard so some of it comes out.

583,"Our meeting was straight out of a film. We both silently observed each other in class and secretly admired one another. I remember I wanted to speak with him intensely just because of his mind. I loved how he was so smart (we met in a school setting), and I loved that about him the most because I was an erudite individual as well (we‚Äôre both engineers). We had similar unpopular niches we both liked and we became wholly connected in that way.

However, I remember not finding him that attractive. He was of a slimmer frame and he was about my own size. I was conventionally more attractive than him - I have been hit on ever since I remember - and I think that was (is) one of the main reasons he is still so deeply engrossed in me. Him, on the other hand, never had much experience with girls and he was more than surprised when I reciprocated his feelings. 
The attraction at first that I felt solely came from the fact that he was smart and that sparked our relationship the first year.

Now, four years later, I realized that we are fundamentally very different. Even though he is still so smart and the best person who is compatible to me, he isn‚Äôt the same person I envisioned him to be. In the relationship, I‚Äôm very independent and confident, where he is unhealthily attached to me and quite easily sensitive. I thought my initial attraction would stay but unfortunately it did not; I feel as though I‚Äôm the dominant one of the relationship, that I‚Äôm controlling the flow of things, and I‚Äôm taking care of everything. He is just following suit. I realized he is lacking a part which I craved: the manliness and initiative. 

That is one of the reasons why I am not attracted to him that way anymore. I find myself wondering what‚Äôs wrong and a voice in my head just says that I am aching for something more. I never got the feeling of being ‚Äúimmersed‚Äù in him and how he looks, but I find myself that I am capable of that feeling and I just don‚Äôt feel butterflies with him. Whenever I envision my future, I see a shadow version of a man in my head, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be him. And the feelings I feel for that imagination is too real, and something I never felt with him. 

Now, I know that attraction is super important, but one thing to note is that I am highly compatible with the guy. He has provided me with everything I‚Äôve ever hoped for - he helped me in every way, walked me home everyday, he showered me with gifts, never once looked at another girl in those four years. He‚Äôs basically the perfect boyfriend, straight out of a romcom. But he‚Äôs also very submissive, insecure and unhealthily attached to me since he has no other friends and his family isn‚Äôt the best. 

Part of the reason why it‚Äôs so hard to talk to him is because he takes everything so personally and he gets depressed easily (with no one else to support him - since I‚Äôm the only one in his life), so I‚Äôm afraid to even talk to him about it. And due to this submissiveness and his physicality, I don‚Äôt just feel attracted anymore. I am craving a more steadfast and strong connection with a someone confident who knows himself and I can feel safe with / not have to take care of all the time. 

I don‚Äôt know if I am being an asshole for feeling like this, given how good he is in every other area. I don‚Äôt know if I just am craving it now or if it‚Äôs going to be a constant forever. I just want some advice on how to deal with this issue, because it‚Äôs really affecting my mental health. I just don‚Äôt want to hurt him, but I know this is going to destroy him.",07Mar2020,1

586,"I am moving out of my little apartment because the building I live in is being remodeled so they paid us all to move out. I brought a friend to help find me an apartment and we found this dream apartment in an area I wanted to move to. I would not even consider any of the apartments because this one was newly remodeled, all stainless steel and had a dishwasher and it was at a pretty okay price. Besides, I just received a good amount of money to move out so there was no doubt in my mind I was moving there. My The really nice landlord showed us two apartments and my friend out of nowhere decided she was moving to the building too. We‚Äôre gonna be neighbors, something we‚Äôve dreamt about for years.
However, we put in an application which the landlord forwarded to the management who denied my application but approved my friends. We were devastated. I had 33 points less in credit than they wanted. I offered to pay the full years rent and they didn‚Äôt do that. I offered co-signer and they said no. I then asked if I could reapply when my credit updates in a couple of weeks because I knew it would gonna go up to their desired score they wanted. They said ‚Äúonce we‚Äôve denied someone it‚Äôs in our system so he can‚Äôt reapply!‚Äù

As a last desperate try, I asked the landlord if I could put in an application in the name of my other friend who has a fantastic credit score and I‚Äôd live there pretending being him. My friend had suggested this herself. The landlord said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt say anything if you don‚Äôt‚Äù. We put in an application and got approved and I‚Äôm moving in tomorrow. 

I ordered AT&amp;T in my own name, they‚Äôre coming to install it on Monday. Should I change it to my friends name? Would management somehow be able to see which names that have internet providers in their building?

How about regular mail? I first thought of setting up a mailbox at usps to receive mails to because I was worried management would somehow see an envelope with my name in the lobby. But then again, whoever that denied my application doesn‚Äôt live nor work in the building I‚Äôm going to live in. Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking all of this? 

One last question is, what if my friend who ‚Äúlives‚Äù there would add me on the lease in say, 6 months, would the management be able to deny me because they have in their system that I have already been denied because of my credit?",07Mar2020,1

591,"Late last year, a recruiter contacted me and asked if I wanted to apply for an internship opportunity with their company. After haphazardly agreeing to explore the opportunity, she then connected me with one of the intern managers in their company. I then told said intern manager that I would only be able to work in the summer, or on a part-time basis. 

Unfortunately, due to their company's policy, they were only offering a 6-month, full-time position. She did tell me that we could arrange an introductory call if I were interested in pursuing the opportunity after graduation. 

I wasn't very sure about whether I wanted to pursue that path after graduation since I had no experience in the field (my degree's not very relevant either), and I was also riddled with anxiety at the time, so I eventually never got around to emailing her back about the introductory call. This was December of last year by the way, so it has been about 3 months. 

Now the problem: I've only recently decided, after 3 months of trying out a relevant class, that the field of said internship was something I actually didn't mind pursuing in the long term. The company that reached out to me still has slots open for an internship, which now includes one for the summer. Should I email the intern manager back?

He didn‚Äôt really try to start conversations with me 1 on 1, he would include himself in a conversation that I was having with a different person but never really bothered to make a move. I assumed he was shy. I had to start the conversations but he seemed reserved, so I felt awkward.

Here's my, I will call it, problem: since I am extremely introverted, I have plenty of free time that I need to kill when I am not studying or doing something college related. I don't have any friends outside of college (I will call them here friends in need only) and I don't practice/train anything.

I was thinking recently how to kill my spare time, esp during weekends, and after seeing some paintings tutorials on the youtube I thought to give painting a try. My current idea is to follow some tutorials in the beginning, and if prove good in it, I will maybe devote some serious time to it (for example becomeing street artist, creating my original paintings etc).

Partly why I want to try this is because thanks to my introversion i don't bloody know what to do with my life after I finish college, which is very soon...

So, if you have some experience with paintings or with being street artist (i actually think this won't work for me, because i have a real problem of being seen in public), any advice would be welcome. Or if you have some other advices, for ex. about what else I could do apart from painting, that's also welcome.

Things I would like to be adviced on painting: what kind of brushes or colors to use, what kind of surface to paint on (for ex I saw on yt some guy that is painting on something that looks like styrofoam, but I am not quite sure), etc

615,"Me and my siblings all grew up in a small boring town and food has always been unhealthy choices and our days revolved around what we were going to eat next. 
My sister though was the only one to grow up some what overweight. The rest of us had super great metabolisms I guess. 
In her 20‚Äôs she was around 200lbs and married with 2 daughters to a man who also was very overweight. They‚Äôre lives revolved around junk food, fast food and delivery. Just constantly eating bullshit. Her first daughter now 5 lived off macaroni. Would eat an entire box on her own. 
Since the age of 2, I could tell she was weighing more than the normal 2 year old. Not because she was just a bigger 2 year old but because she was eating far too much and far too unhealthy. I did many times try to talk to her about it but in all reality she‚Äôs just a lazy parent. She loves her babies to death but she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the crying of them wanting certain food. So she gives in . Her marriage went downhill, she left him and starting working out. Constantly. She looks amazing now. Her days consist of healthy foods, vitamins, working out and calorie counting. We have very few fast food places here so McDonald‚Äôs is her go to for her girls. Her children LIVE OFF McDonald‚Äôs. It‚Äôs absolutely awful. Her daughter weights 80lbs. She‚Äôs almost 6.

618,"I get into a lot of arguments with my mom and this is one that happened yesterday.

I have to get all of this done in 2 days. My mom decided to plan a movie night on a day I told her well in advance that I would not be free on. I let her know in advance that I was very busy this weekend. What does she do? She schedules another thing on top of that, and that thing  will take hours that I do not have. I explained this to her and she was just yellingat me saying stuff like‚Äúwhy are you getting all defensive‚Äù,‚Äùyou need to be honest with yourself‚Äù,‚Äùyou shouldn‚Äôt pressure yourself too much‚Äù(she‚Äôs the one who tells me to always do my best and that I need to try harder because I‚Äôm not doing well enough), ‚Äúthat‚Äôs very rude to not be here when guests are here.‚Äù Those are all the exact quotes I remember (I‚Äôm kind of heated if you couldn‚Äôt tell).Anyway I was like I‚Äôll probably be sleeping or really tired and stressed out but I‚Äôll let you know if I‚Äôm not. Keep in mind this was only about me warning her about the fact that I MIGHT be tired. Then she tells me we might go to a movie theater,she never asked me, just said that it was happening. She never gave me the option of not attending and got mad at me when I told her I might not be able to go. Earlier she had asked if I had plans for this weekend and I told her that I was busy with flute,school,and preparing for indie, she asked me like 4 hours ago, can she not remember my answer. I wasn‚Äôt even being vague about having plans and specifically told her I couldn‚Äôt even hang out with friends this weekend because I was so busy with stuff. 

Sorry if this sounds like something a 5 year old wrote, I‚Äôm just really tired.
Idk if this is the right subreddit to post this on, if you think there is a better one for this post tell me.I just needed to talk about this because it pissed me off even though this is not a big deal.

620,"So, for a good portion of my young adult life. I've basically, been smoking everday since i was 16 till now (21m). When i started smoking weed, i would smoke at parties. It curved my anxiety, and i was able to talk to girls. Now fast forward to now, i smoke once in a day. Then i get so panicy, and my anxiety skyrockets. It's so bad i can't even make a phone call, i basically become a vegetable! I've been a functioning stoner, for 5 years going on 6. 

As of recently, i've been trying to quit. But it's really hard, i live in a small town. I don't have many friends to keep my mind off of smoking. There's not much to do in my small town either, i've tried going to the gym! I've tried doing chores to occupy myself. But with all this extra energy, that i have now i could probably tear down a house and have it rebuilt in under 12hrs (over exageration but you get my point). Everything is organized, and i'm just bored to death. 
All of the positives from quitting, outweigh the negatives from quitting. I get more energy, my memory is better and my speech skills go from a 20 to a 100. But the boredom, the boredom alone is going to break me! If anyone went through a similair situation, share your stories. I'd like to hear them, and maybe use that to help myself out.

622,"so i‚Äôm in my freshman year of high school and i just moved to a new town. i was on a nature hike with my friend, A, and we decided to do a little photo shoot. first i‚Äôd take pictures of her, then we took a couple together, then she took a couple of me. as she was taking pictures of me, she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre almost as pretty as g- oh my god, A ‚Äòalmost as pretty‚Äô. i mean you look like G! (this girl at our school)‚Äù, when she said ‚Äúalmost as pretty‚Äù it felt like she did it on purpose, how do you accidentally blurt that out. it did kindof hurt my feelings and it pretty much ruined the hike for me. 
another thing A did was, at the beginning of the hike kept talking about this guy who i had a thing with and asking questions. i tried changing the subject every time he came up but she always got back to talking about him. at a certain point she said ‚Äúhe invited me over to ‚Äòwatch a movie‚Äô. and i was like no, because you know what that means haha‚Äù, even though he literally hates her, he never invites her to any of his parties, and once him and his friends tried to tp her house because they think she‚Äôs annoying. he only invited her to watch a movie with a bunch of her friends to set her up with his friend, D.
the last thing A did was, basically force my friend O to goto a school dance with her, and then tell her friends that she ‚Äúhated me and him‚Äù because she thought i was flirting with him., even though O, his friend, a bunch of my other friends whom were also girls, were all hanging out in a group and A didn‚Äôt even hear what we were talking about. to her defense, she could‚Äôve thought i was flirting w him because i would cup my hands and put them up to someone‚Äôs ear to talk to them because of how loud the music was, but i was doing that w all my friends, not just him. 
anyway, the list could go on but those are some of the main reasons i think A might be a toxic friend. her and i have good times too of course but i just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth being friends with her anymore, what do you think?",07Mar2020,1
623,"Sorry if this ends up being super long, I just learned of all this info and I'm totally taken aback by all of it.. 

So, I (26f) live with my boyfriend (23), and my best friend/roommate (25m). My boyfriend just moved in recently, and I'd say that's about where all the visible tension from my friend has started. I knew that he wasn't having the best time, as he expressed early on in the talks of boyfriend moving in that he didn't want to feel like the third wheel in our relationship. Okay, understandable. We toned down our PDA a TON and invited him on every event we went to except for date night, because we wanted him to feel like he was still part of the friend group we had. 

So, for a little backstory, roommate relies on me (and now my boyfriend) for basically everything. He just got a fulltime job, which is awesome! But he can't drive, has never had a license. So before he had this job, I basically paid for everything and took him anywhere he wanted to go. I admit I've offered to teach him to drive, but haven't been able to follow through because I work 12+ hour days of manual labor and I'm WIPED when I come home. I since resolved to teach him on weekends when I wasn't working, and he wasn't either-- but so far he's been working every weekend. He's complained to my boyfriend that I don't keep my promises, because I haven't taught him to drive. 

I actually bought a second car with the sole intention of letting him drive one of them when he gets his license, use it for his driving test, etc.. But it's come to light now that that's not good enough for him. My boyfriend and I recently took him to a dealership at his request, so he could look at a car he wanted. We were puzzled by this, explaining (gently!) that he wouldn't be approved for a car because 1. he doesn't have a license, and 2. he has no credit, because he's never had to pay any bills, installment loans, credit cards, etc.... But he insisted we go anyway, so we did. 

I felt guilty about letting him go through the process despite knowing the answer, but I figured this would be a good learning experience. He ended up with exactly the answer we thought he would... but said that the dealer told him he could get approved with a cosigner, and they were ""willing to work with him"" on the down payment. I felt like he was implying one of us cosign for him, but he didn't outright ask, so I just didn't say anything. The same time this is going on, I'm looking for a cheaper alternative to the car I currently own, and my boyfriend and I worked out a financial plan to cosign on it and make it more affordable. This is apparently when my roommate decided the situation was bullshit, and confided in my boyfriend that me looking for cars when he just got turned down for one is like rubbing salt in the wounds. 

On top of this, he told my boyfriend to be careful, because I scammed money for a down payment on a previous car from our previous roommate (??????? what), which was entirely untrue. He also said that this previous roommate was my ex, and that he just ""didn't want to see (boyfriend) get fucked in the same way."" This absolutely blew my mind, because I NEVER was in a relationship with our last roommate, and I hadn't scammed money from anyone-- because the roommate didn't have money to give!! We kicked him out because of the fact he was freeloading off of me for almost 2 years. No job, no help on bills, couldn't drive either... I have de ja vu. 

So this information completely threw me for a loop. When my roommate and I talk face to face, it's always laughs and a fun time. I have no idea where this sudden animosity would possibly come from. When my boyfriend asked why he doesn't just talk to me, roommate apparently said ""I'm a pacifist."" Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. I've always preached open communication in my house-- if there's a problem, I want to see it fixed before it gets out of hand. I told my roommate we need to talk the second he gets home, but I'm scared it will just end our friendship and he'll move out. This is someone I thought was my best friend.

628,"Hi! This has been eating me the past few weeks and it's getting worse. I will try explain it best but it's very difficult to pour my emotions and thoughts into these words.

Some background:
I started an engineering-competition club at my University in 2017. We have been quite successful and this year we are competing in a new and more advanced category in the competition for summer 2020. It is a big club and due to our success, we have a decent amount of funding. I am still the President of the club, but I plan to officially step down this summer. Since September 2019, I have been dating one of the committee members (Emily 'fake name') of the club. Recently, one of the committee members (different person) has been voted out of the club due to inactivity. 

So yeah, after 3 years of leading this club, I'm starting to feel very tired and numb. There are some major internal problems and I'm no longer confident we'll meet our goal to compete this summer. We have a lot of funding and support which is great, but the engineering designs are not ready and with the current state of motivation and work ethic, I don't think they will be ready. Because of the funding and support, it is too late to back out and we're fully committed to our path. 

My girlfriend Emily is also on the committee that manages the club. However she has been inactive lately due to stress and because of this I am carrying out her duties. Normally in this situation (a member becoming overwhelmed and stressed), we would encourage, assist them and take off some of the load and this way the person remains engaged. But Emily hasn't done anything over the last 3 weeks and last time this happened within the committee, the person got voted out. I am feeling some pressure that she needs to be replaced, but no one is saying anything since they know we are dating. I agree that she needs to be replaced because this is causing a lot of stress for me. I haven't pushed her about it, and we try to avoid talking about the club outside of college hours. She avoids the topic when I try to bring up her activity.

Our members are struggling to balance college work and the club, and this is hurting our progress. We have survived the last two years but this year it's the worst its been as there is more work and responsibility. The past few weeks the workload for me has increased a lot. Honestly I can't wait to stop doing this, despite it being my baby in the University. 

I was thinking of resigning, but if I do that, then the club will 100% fail this year and we will lose our supporters. I can't force myself to push Emily to do things, I cant' stand seeing her stressed and depressed. The only real option I see is to have a 'shakedown' at the next club meeting and to reorganise roles and reaffirm critical deadlines - but then everyone will think the club is disorganized. 

Any advice?",07Mar2020,1

630,"I live in New Jersey with my narcissistic mother. Last night I had abdominal pain and other symptoms, I wanted to call an ambulance. My mother is a germaphobe, and refused to call or allow me to call anyone despite me pleading with her. I live in her house and depend on this house for a roof over my head for the time being.

I called the police, the police came and talked to both of us. She told the police that if I went to the hospital that I would NOT be allowed back in the house. Her reasoning is, she is very sick (she has a hernia), and if she caught the coronavirus she would die, so I wouldn't be allowed back in the house if I went to the hospital. One police officer seemed to agree with her, and he said that if I were choose to go to the hospital then we'd have to figure out what to do with me after that point. By this time my symptoms were better and I was extremely tired, so I said I wanted to go back inside.

I'm having trouble eating and I fear I'm gonna have to go to the hospital or some doctor, and she won't let me back in the house. However, I have a flight scheduled for a job interview with a good company next week. I'm trying to hold out until then. I had already rescheduled this trip before because of my mother interfering, so I can't reschedule again. They are paying for my flight, it's from NYC to Chicago. Is it safe to be flying domestically right now if I have too?

 But then, I will likely face homelessness as my mother has threatened to change the locks if I leave the house for almost anything. I wouldn't get back to the house until around midnight after my flight back home after the interview next week, and so I would be exhausted (and probably sick with whatever abdominal issue I have) and I will definitely need a place to sleep.

633,"I‚Äôm an autistic young adult stuck living with abusive parents. 
My biological parents are separated but each one of them have their issues so choosing one to live with is like choosing between walking barefoot on broken glass or barbed wire. I won‚Äôt go very far into detail because it‚Äôs a messy rabbit hole. 

I work part time trying to pick up more time with what I do currently, trying for a second job if possible, and I run a few online storefront things for a bit of extra money here and there and I finally had my escape planned.

My good friend of many years offered to let me stay with her several times and I finally asked if I could. She agreed and I told her I would pay however much of my steady income she wanted me to to go towards rent, would help keep the house clean (I‚Äôm a housekeeper, so it‚Äôs not a problem at all), cook because I cook a lot for myself anyway, and polish up my container gardening skills so I can help lighten up everyone‚Äôs individual grocery expenses a little bit when it comes to produce.
Best of all, I can make myself disappear. I told her she wouldn‚Äôt really see much of my while I was at home unless she wanted to because I spend the rest of my time making things or playing games. I also have my own car and won‚Äôt be bumming rides and such.

She said all was good and I could move in so I started organizing everything and getting rid of things I couldn‚Äôt take with me and such.
Then I asked when I could start the move and she blew me off.

We both have depression so I thought okay, she doesn‚Äôt really want to talk right now so I‚Äôll leave her alone.
Well it‚Äôs been nearly two months of me trying here and there to talk serious talk about when I‚Äôll be able to move because my situation isn‚Äôt great and she knows I‚Äôm eager to leave and be free.

Still nothing.

I‚Äôve since given up and I don‚Äôt know if she doesn‚Äôt want me there or if her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt get the house together or anything, and I‚Äôm not sure he even likes me or our other friends. I don‚Äôt know what goes on behind closed doors there, but I know he has guilt tripped her into staying home from concerts or her family events because he didn‚Äôt want to be alone. it makes me think something‚Äôs up but I could be very wrong.

Now she‚Äôs talking about how she wants to be a entirely alone in her life. So I guess it‚Äôs way off the table now. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about this too but I don‚Äôt know how to approach her where she‚Äôll openly talk about it. We‚Äôve both gone through some shit and still are, but she‚Äôs never been open and won‚Äôt talk about it. our other friends and I have told her it won‚Äôt bother us (she‚Äôs worried about being annoying) but it doesn‚Äôt help. I figure it‚Äôs best to just not bug her about it but on the other hand I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll be even worse if she keeps it all in.
I feel better by ranting and crying and letting it all out but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be any better for her to let her feelings out too.

I don‚Äôt know what to really do now. I currently don‚Äôt make enough money to get an apartment on my own, and don‚Äôt have any friends who can currently get an apartment or rental house with me because they‚Äôre all full time students or already renting.

Anyone got advice for me for housing? Section 8 housing was unavailable the last time I checked, and disability will be hard for me to access while receiving mail at my home address because my parents don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in financial help or accessibility or whatever else exists to help people. I had to get my diagnosis alone because they disregarded it my entire childhood which effectively made me feel broken and weird when I really was just an autistic kid who was struggling to be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want things handed to me, I don‚Äôt want to cheat the system, but I need help transitioning into adulthood while simultaneously escaping abuse because I‚Äôm in a bad situation.

642,"okay i already feel dumb for even typing this because we're in high school and it's probably not gonna matter in a couple years but i don't know what to do so üòÇ

we've always been kind of flirty but it came to my attention within the last year that he had legitimate feelings for me. he's never acted on them before and he's had other romantic interests within the 3 ish years we've known each other. our friendship has fluctuated as we haven't always been extremely close with new friends and such but even then i've always had a high level of comfort with him which is strange seeing that i'm a very closed off person and also usually female attracted. 

the night he kissed me we were often very physically close but i think part of it had to do with the fact that we are both usually rather touch adverted but comfortable with each other. i haven't hung out with him outside of school since we were 13. i'm not very good at recognizing romantic/sexual attraction so when he kissed me it kind of came as a shock. it wasn't a deep kiss or anything, just a quick peck and i wouldn't have expected anything else from him as he's usually pretty repulsed by anything too explicit. 

i eventually ran off to the bathroom and texted my friend (16f) who met me there and had seen the whole thing. at this point i'm physically shaking and my heart is beating very quickly. thinking back, it's very strange that i'm reacting this way because i've never been quite so shaken up from kissing someone, and especially not from such a short quick kiss. 

my friend is trying to calm me down and i all i can remember is frantically repeating ""this is bad"" in varying tones of panic. 

he had texted me while i was in the bathroom asking if i'd like him to sleep in a different room. i responded that he was fine and didn't do anything wrong. when i went back upstair i found him sitting on the floor in a different room. i sat down next to him and told him it was unnecessary. i said he wasn't in the dog house and invited him back to where we were before. 

when he stood up, he hugged me and whispered ""i'd been waiting so long to do that."" 

at which point i decided i'm a terrible person because i knew this wasn't going to work. i have terrible commitment issues and a fear of intimacy and he knows that. we later discussed how he took such a gamble going for it. 

anyways. things are fine now, but i'm still internally panicking because i know i have to find a way to tell him this can't happen. 

eventually i get him outside to talk about it as i didn't want anyone else around. he knew exactly where i was going with it immediately and apologized but i felt he had done nothing wrong and it was just my fault that i can't handle emotional connections. he said he would be inside in a second and i went back in feeling terrible. when he came back up he slept on the floor in another room which i said he didn't have to do but he insisted. i passed out between two friends and he left before i was awake. 

we texted a little but not much and not in-depth. we sit next to each other in one class so monday was somewhat stressful but we got through it fine.

he got me a valentines gift as a last ditch attempt and i declined. it had some of my favorite things in it with a letter and a guitar pick w a cheesy pick up line he's used on me since 8th grade. i cried and stuffed the box in my garage and haven't taken it out since. 

he's continued to make flirty jokes and such and part of me feels like that means we're going back to normal but another part of me thinks he's still trying. i never had a serious discussion with him about boundaries so i didnt blame him for anything that upset me but eventually he asked if we was pushing his luck with it or not. i tried to explain that sometimes it bugged me and others it didn't so it wasn't his fault if i became upset about it. 

the thing that's really tripping me up right now is the fact that i think i may also have some sort of feelings or at least sexual attraction to him but i absolutely cannot act on it and i think it's because i was in such a bad place when we met and i still associate him with that and i've come such a long way from that emotionally but also SOCIALLY so any sort of physical affection or knowledge of a relationship between us would make me highly anxious and it's WILDLY unfair to tell him ""hey you have a chance but let's keep it a secret :)"" 

i feel like a terrible person because he's genuinely so sweet but i cannot fathom anyone being aware of me having any sort of attraction to him. 

alternatively i can't tell if i'm sexually attracted to him or just very comfortable with him because i'm terrified of taking off my clothes in front of people with makes me weary towards sex but i feel like i could potentially have a sexual relationship with him. though he's uncomfortable with most sexual things so it's unlikely that he would want that anyways. but i cant seem to understand his intentions if he doesn't want sex. where would he intend to go with it ? 

he wants to hang out again but it'll be the first time we've hung out outside of school since then and i don't know if he plans to make a move but if he did i would probably go with it so i'm afraid of interacting with him unless we're in a class room where i can avoid any type of physical affection. 

so basically what i'm getting at is my friend is into me and i might be into my friend but i'm a shitty person because i'm also kind of embarrassed of him which is HIGHLY unfair to him because he's only ever been good to me. great. it's just great. 

sorry this is so long. someone PLEASE help me. if you couldn't tell i genuinely need it. üòÇ",07Mar2020,1

I‚Äôm not depressed, I have great friends, doing great in school, fun job. I have no problem expressing feelings and I have a bunch of hobbies.

My problem lies within the fact that there have been now 3 instances where I or someone I care about have either died or been close to death and I just haven‚Äôt cared.

The first instance was a car crash I was in where my uncle died either on impact or shortly after. He was very close to me. My entire family was grieving but I was relatively unaffected. During his funeral I understood that it was sad but I don‚Äôt remember crying or feeling sad at all. 

The second would be when I had an allergic reaction to something and ended up being flown in a helicopter to the ER. I apparently wouldn‚Äôt have made it if my friend hadn‚Äôt checked in on me in my bed that night. After I felt better and got discharged I was back to normal. I didn‚Äôt think anything about it just carried on.

Third and most recent time would be last month when my friends and I were having fun on a ropes course with harnesses. At some point my friends started yelling at me while I was on a rock wall telling me to not let go of the rocks I was on. Apparently the clip/harness I had wasn‚Äôt on right and I very easily could‚Äôve fallen and died. 

Both of my friends were beyond panicked but I was just kinda thinking about how good my climbing skills were that I didn‚Äôt fall for so long. (Probably I bad mentality I know)

670,"I‚Äôm sorry for how long this is! This is a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want my girlfriend to see this, and none of the names used are accurate. This is mainly about me (21M), my girlfriend of 3.75 years(21F Jessie), and my wealthy parents (48m, 46f). Also, I‚Äôm going to mention political views in this post, but I don‚Äôt want any political comments in the comments. 

Growing up, I had ADHD and several speech impediments that made it difficult for me to do well in school and take part in social interactions. My sister (currently 23F), was always the popular kid in elementary-high school, and my parents loved her to death. My parents never gave me the attention that I needed inside/outside of school because I was too much work for them. I got the belt when I acted up (which happened frequently due to the ADHD), my sister always got the newest razor/sidekick phones and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get a phone. However, I loved my family to death because I was didn‚Äôt really know how parents normally treated their kids. Since I didn‚Äôt have many friends, all I knew was my family and how they treated me. My parents pretty much stopped providing for me when I turned 16. They forced me to get a job one day after my 16th birthday, and I had to buy a car after riding my bike to work for a full year, and my parents never went grocery shopping for me or bought me clothes or anything like that. (I know many people have it much worse, but I think it‚Äôs important to include that part). 

Fast forward until after high school graduation. My only friend from high school had a graduation party at a restaurant and I sat across from the most gorgeous girl. Fantastic energy and personality, and I could swear it was love at first sight. I got really close to her during that summer (2016), and asked her to be my girlfriend. She is super important to me and has literally turned my life around because she was the first person to ever believe in me. My parents absolutely despise her (to this day) because she‚Äôs liberal and they are very far right, and she encouraged me to be liberal. She also taught me how poorly my parents have treated me my whole life, and encouraged me to distance myself from them (which improved my life so much more, and made them hate her more)

Prior to meeting Jessie, I wasn‚Äôt planning on going to college. She motivated me to go to community college and try and pursue something that I was interested in (my parents didn‚Äôt want me to go to college because they thought it was a waste of money because I wasn‚Äôt smart enough). In high school, I had a 2.5 GPA, but in my first year of college I had a 4.0. After that first year, my parents started to become more interested in me and would get very upset if I would visit my girlfriend instead of them. After that, I joined my girlfriend at the university that she went to and pursued a major in Economics (parents were way more against that due to cost of university). My first year in economics, I had a 3.5 GPA. Now all the sudden, my parents were in love with me and were super involved in my life. They started randomly buying me gifts, shipping me clothes and other items, a new laptop and TV, etc. These items meant nothing to me because I saw right through their BS. My dad even hugged me for the first time in 17 years, 5 months ago. My parents have started to do so much for me and have helped with rent, got me a new car, and have offered to fly me out to Hawaii as a graduation gift. It has felt completely amazing to be supported by my parents and to feel loved. 

Two years after going to the university, and 2 internships later, I am now in my last semester of college and I have a fantastic job offer with the government that is 5 hours away that my dads brother (45M) helped me get. Let‚Äôs call him John. He is the closest thing to a father figure that I have, he has done so much for me, and I love him dearly. However, my girlfriend suddenly decided that she didn‚Äôt want to move with me because she wanted to pursue her masters. As a result, I don‚Äôt want to take the offer because I want to stay near home where my girlfriend is. This makes my parents livid, and they keep attempting to guilt trip me. My dad says that he won‚Äôt speak to me ever again, and that I won‚Äôt receive any graduation gifts or wedding funds for when I marry my girlfriend. Last time I was home, he didn‚Äôt even look at me. My mom constantly reminds me that my Uncle John worked so hard to get me the job offer, and that I would make him very disappointed if I don‚Äôt take it. They also guilt trip me by threatening to take away the car and laptop that they bought me. 


So, do I take this job offer and make my parents happy and guarantee 6-figure success in my career, or do I stay home with the love of my life, while risking having struggles in finding a job and making a good career, but also losing my family for good.",07Mar2020,1

676,"Some background info: my parents separated 9 months ago after a few years of back and forth separating/getting back together. My mother had a close ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô with a guy and we‚Äôve all been aware of it for a long time. When her and my father finally separated, lo and behold, she got into a relationship with him and when he left his family he moved into the new house she secured for herself. My family were disgusted at what she did to us and his family and she lost a lot of friends over the situation. On top of this me and my siblings hate this guy (he broke up our parents) but we now can‚Äôt even visit our mom because he‚Äôs there.

A few things happen along the way, including her new boyfriend attempting suicide. From our perspective, this guy is a jerk who is battling his own demons and is dragging her down with it. She is in no way perfect but she basically dropped everyone in her life to care for him. After his attempt, he was still living in her house and she was caring for him 24/7. 

He is an awful man, one evening he locked her out of her own house at 2am and she called me in a complete panic and he yelled at me down the phone and basically berated me for trying to calm the situation. He treated me like dirt and as if I was trying to plant seeds in her mind that he was bad for her. He most definitely is not stable and is not someone I want around my mom as she tries to find some happiness within herself etc. 

After that evening, he leaves her - cold turkey, moves everything out of the house as quickly as he arrived. Following this, one week later, he attempts suicide again, this time nearly being successful if he hadn‚Äôt been pulled out of the water by someone in a boat. He tells my mother he did this because he regretted hurting her, and that he couldn‚Äôt live without her. Class A toxic relationship sh*t, guilting her etc etc. 

They are now talking again as he recovers and I fear they will get back together again soon. Since they broke up her relationship with everyone has improved. Her family are speaking to her again and offering her support, me and my siblings feel like we can come round her house again, even my father and her are getting on amicably. We are all looking at that period where he was with her as a mistake and are trying to support her through it. She‚Äôs having none of it. Convinced we are all trying to convince her we were right all along (which no one is doing). She wants him back 100% and I‚Äôve seen her texting him every day.

My mother is devastated for him and really misses him. Even though she insists that nothing happened while she was with my dad, she will tell me that she loved him dearly and she misses him and everything was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù when they were together. This was even after his first suicide attempt. I am mind blown that she cannot see how mentally unstable he is and how much of a burden he is on her.

I told my mother today that I don‚Äôt want her getting back together with him. My basic reasoning above everything else is that he clearly needs time to recover mentally and she also needs time to recover. The woman is barely out of her marriage: she needs to spend some time with herself. My mother has no ounce of self love and I think this time would be perfect for her to really discover herself and work on loving herself. He ruined this for her, in my opinion. I understand my anger comes from a place of love, but in being with him she is isolating everyone around her. I am constantly worried and stressed that she is a liability. My mother also has a history of suicide attempts and in my opinion being around him is genuinely the worst thing for her right now. She so badly needs to work on her own mental health, she does not need to be worried about this man and his mental wellbeing. 

My aunts and some of my mothers friends know him quite well and warned her from the beginning that he was not a good man. I can‚Äôt blame her for falling in love. What I am beginning to blame her for is going back to him, ignoring advice from her loved ones, and putting him before everyone else around her.

When I talk to her and try to reason with her, she yells at me and tells me I don‚Äôt understand. I am a constant worrier but I can see them spiralling together and she continues to isolate herself further until I no longer want to be around her. 

I have told her that if she gets back with him she doesn‚Äôt have my support. She doesn‚Äôt confide in anyone. My father and everyone else who knows he‚Äôs gone think it was an amicable mutual decision. Only a handful of us know about the suicide attempts and only I know about the awful night he locked her out.

I‚Äôm young, I‚Äôm only 21 and this is a huge burden on me. I‚Äôm constantly stressed and worried about her and it hurts me that she chooses to confide everything in me and then does not take my advice or my opinion on any of it. 

I need advice. She won‚Äôt seek medical help. She won‚Äôt understand that I am her daughter first, not her friend, not her therapist. And even then, when I do give her advice, she bites the head off me that I don‚Äôt understand. I am so worried about her and he needs to get out of her life but I have no control over that. With him around, she is a ticking time bomb. Her mental health is deteriorating and it is a huge burden on me. Any advice appreciated.",07Mar2020,1

 Whole time I can‚Äôt help but to get over how good this feels, like DAMN THIS FEEL GOOD THAN A MF I‚Äôve never felt so powerful in my life, the act of getting revenge putting a gun to his head and making him plead for his life, making him wish he never crossed that extra mile, make him regret even meeting you. The thought that I put enough fear in his head him and his girlfriend are just crying the feeling of knowing everyone in that room knew that I wasn‚Äôt to be fucked and that I was gonna get mine regardless was a high itself, it‚Äôs hard to explain I legit feel like it released dopamine in my system, the more scared and the more he cried I swear it made me feel on top of the world I never intended hurting him but the high this was giving me mixed with anger I swear I just wanted to blast him right then and there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i spit on him stomped on his head like 3 times grabbed him bag and ran out the room he just laid there curled up the whole time scared go even move... the whole drive home I felt high I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking how good it felt.",07Mar2020,1
681,"I took a mortgage out so my Mom could have a place to live. Agreeing that she would just pay the mortgage. 

She's 3+ months behind. I pay it to prevent my credit from dropping whenever it's needed. 

I've finally worked my way into a place in life where I'm ready to buy a house for myself. So I told her I wanted to sell the house. She was really upset and blocked me from communicating with her. Eventually I listed the house and my realtor was communicating with her. She puts a polite front on but as soon as the house is active she declines all showings and talking through other people to me she told me to learn land lord tenant laws. 

So I've decided I'll legally evict her. It's not being behind on rent that bothers me. It's more the attitude.

I definitely think once I file for eviction there's no going back. Is it worth throwing this relationship away? I've kinda made my peace with the whole situation. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle or am I seeing this whole puzzle correctly?",07Mar2020,1
682,"I've been talking to him since October (took a month long break in between). He said he doesnt want to commit until he knows for sure he can keep his job in the area. I have tried to end it before but I got too anxious and didn't. I told him I am having issues getting feelings for people lately, which is true. I figured he would take it as a warning and be careful with his feelings. It is becoming more apparent his feelings are pretty deep for me, while I am still just chilling. I think I am seeing now I just don't think I can see myself with him.

I really don't want this to end up like last time when he walked me to his apartment and I acted normal but quiet, then we watched a key and peele break up skit and I chickened out. So I mapped out what I am going to say and I am going to try to wait until someone opens the door for me. i just don't know what to do while we walk to his apartment, i always feel too awkward not to hug or kiss him and ask him how his day was, then that sets a super relaxed mood and I don't want the breakup to come out of nowhere as I read it shouldn't. Then i will knock on his door, use my normal awkward body language to avoid a hug, go into some rambling maybe ask him how his day was as i make my way to the couch. i sit and wait for him to sit and as soon as he does, i start. So anyway i have a short and sweet speech:

""I've been thinking, I really do enjoy spending time with you especially since it's been a while since i felt like i had a genuine friend out here and i care about you but  because i care about you i don't think it's right for me to continue to go with the flow and wait for whatever feelings i feel i need. since it it hasn't come along within this time it's probably rooted in some issue i need to work out in myself and it's not fair to you to drag you along in that kind of journey. So i think it might be best if we don't see each other.""

If he asks to stay friends I'll say ""maybe in two months if you still want to be in contact we can try, but i think it's best we take a break."" I've tried being friends with exes before and it always ends up in us back to where we started. This way we can remember what it's like to be without each other.

It's just hard because he is so mushy. He texted me two days ago say ""do you miss me?"" I still haven't answered it. I don't know if I'll pretend i didnt see it or what, but I need to text him today because we planned to meet up (i told him to meet this day to ""catch up"" we hadn't talked in a few days). I don't want to lie but I don't want to be a dick and say no. He constantly says he cares about me and will ask if I feel the same. And i do, but not in the romantic way he does. I need to hit him up soon.",07Mar2020,1

I have the opportunity of going to a community college in Florida or Arizona, should i move to a friendlier environment or stick with what i got here?

Even though only 7% of the population have bank accounts, there's no online payment system and no infrastructure, Iraq's GDP is about $200bil and combining that with very low competition there may be a chance for people like me in this, am i delusional?

Then again arizona alone has a GDP of $267bil and Florida has a GDP of nearly a trillion. 
If i make the move to the states I'll attend community college and work part time to survive and pay the yearly costs on a student visa (25hour of work per week) will i have enough time to study programming and improve my business skills? I don't have to work here in iraq and can work on myself as much as i want at the cost of shit education and environment.

i realise college is not gonna make me successful, i can only achieve a high level of knowledge with self learning which is what I'll be relying on to start my first business.

My question is which choice seems more reasonable? Staying and trying to build something in an environment that's constantly trying to tear you down or going abroad somewhere new and relying completely on myself to survive WHILE trying to build something for myself. Which is more rewarding in your opinion? Thanks",07Mar2020,1
692,"I had a long term relationship and we recently broke up on good terms.

This has recently evolved in to something more problematic where I could only get hard when a relatively high pitched bell is rung, I‚Äôve tried everything you can imagine to get hard over the last month except drugs as I‚Äôm 22 I shouldn‚Äôt need viagra to get hard. Around this time my long term partner of 3 years broke up with me. So here I am single and unable to get hard unless a bell is rung.

699,"Someone Please Put Things Into Perspective

I am not a hypochondriac. I am definitely a pessimist, which is something I‚Äôve been working on for a long time, but I also feel that I‚Äôm a realist. I am not afraid of going out and living my life, but what I am starting to be afraid of is the fact that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any real answer. Everyone is deciding how to handle this based on what their bubble is telling them. What articles they are seeing posted. What the WHO is saying versus what the CDC is saying versus what the National government is saying versus what the local government is saying. 

We currently have an administration that is highly anti-science that are completely contradicting what our own countries health organizations are saying, let alone the worlds. The czar is a man who once, and probably still, believes that homosexuality could be prayed away. It‚Äôs insanity. 

There is no definitive voice, and definitely no definitive voice that is in everyone‚Äôs bubble. 

My wife is a hair stylist who has a lot of clients who are doctors, biochemists and pharmaceutical people. Everyone is basically telling her that everyone is overreacting and that there are thousands of undiagnosed cases where we live. But to still not worry about it. Meanwhile, established countries like Italy are seeing massive numbers, growth and deaths. It‚Äôs spreading faster than the world, let alone the US where obviously the government is fucking everything, can keep track. 

I am also a type 1 diabetic. My wife is a cancer survivor. We have a 3 year old. So all of that combined with all the above has me on high alert. 

At the end of April and early May, my family is taking a trip to Seattle and then Vancouver. Obviously Seattle has been hit fairly hard. We are not planning on cancelling our trip unless we are forced to or if it is blaringly obvious that it is not in our best interest to go. Is this a stupid decision? It‚Äôs impossible to tell because everyone has different answers. 

It seems like the most consistent answers are as follows:

Get a mask. That is until you see the other articles saying to save the masks for health workers, or ones that take it even further saying that a mask isn‚Äôt going to help you. 

Make sure you‚Äôre sanitizing your hands after being in a public place or really touching anything. That‚Äôs all well and good till you go to buy some at a physical store, or even amazon, and see that either the price has been gouged or they are completely sold out, like all the Targets in my hometown. 

Toilet paper. What in the actual fuck is going on with this? There was a line out the door of a Costco in my home town for people just buying hundreds of rolls of TP. What am I supposed to do when I actually just need toilet paper to shit normally?

And the one that gets me every time. Don‚Äôt touch your face. Lol ok bro. 

Wash your hands. A LOT. Well that is a normal human being thing that I have been doing consistently since I was 8. Is that the final gate keeping to keep this virus, that it still doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone knows anything about, out of my body? 

I don‚Äôt know what it is I am looking for from Reddit. Likely nothing. Maybe just venting? I don‚Äôt know. But if I continue going down this route, I know it won‚Äôt be good for myself. 

TLDR: I am starting to spiral about the ramifications of everyone freaking out instead of the actual virus. Help?",07Mar2020,1

701,"Okay so I'm in a bind and dont know what to do. I (F20) lived with 2 other people (M25) (F28) who was a couple but were just ""friends"" in an apartment together. My name was only one on the lease. I didnt put them on at the time due to constant fear they'd leave because one (F28) did move out for a minute. 

Back in January I left due to my best friend dying and his roommate needed help. Both of my old roommates have bad credit so I told them as long as they pay the rent and electricity they can stay in the apartment after I left (They had no where else to go.) 

When I left they started acting rude with me but I let it go due to them probably being stressed. Fast forward to this month and rent still hasn't been paid (it was due on the 3rd and it's now the 7th), the won't answer my phone calls or any text messages, or even respond to me at all. I get email updates when the electric gets money put on it (we have a prepay plan) and they put money on that but they still haven't paid the rent. 

The kicker about this is on the 4th, at like 12 AM M25 called me and asked if I know anyone who was able to get him drugs but he cant answer my calls about rent?

However, this is not me. I have never done anything that goes against what they say since they are anyways fairly understanding and reasonable.

Some elaborations:
 my piercing: I got it 2 weeks ago, intending that my parents find out on our school graduation where we have to wear a belly-showing cultural outfit in about 3 weeks from today.

712,"It's a bit long and kinda repetitive but I appreciate it if you read the entire thing.

I don't talk much to my neighbor but I see him around from time to time and he's always normal. Talks clearly, doesn't seem like he's on drugs or anything. But the other day I saw him coming around the corner and I waved at him then he waved to me. When he made it to where I was I said hey and He just stood there and looked at me, didn't say anything. I said if he came back from work but he never said anything, he made a weird face and made weird hand movements, like rolling his hands over one another like when you sing the wheels on the bus go round and round, that kind of movement. I knew something was up so I asked if something happened and he just sighed and rolled his eyes back and stared at me angrily, with his nose raised up. He put up his sleeve and showed his tattoo that had a star and was going around it like if he had a string and made a tying movement on his arm. Then looked back to me and I said I don't know what that means. And sighed again, rolled his eyes and just looked at me. 

The whole time he was making weird movements like that, it wasn't erratic but like how sign language is. When he wasn't doing that his one index finger would bend like a hook and point straight. He was looking around angrily and would stare at me angrily or make a sad face or with a poker face. When people passed by he'd try to act normal and even got out of the way so they can pass. A lady said hi to him and he smiled back then looked at the floor with a blank face. I tried talking to him but he would respond with those movement and when I told him I don't know what that means he'd sighed and make an angry face or a sad face like if he was sad or about to cry. Then make a blank face. I asked him if he was alright and it's like he was lucid in the moment and said 'yea, I'm fine.' And I said 'you sure?' And he nodded his head then went back to what he was doing. After a few more attempts of me asking him something he went to the stairs leading to his building took a step, waited a few seconds, then another two steps, and turned back to face me. I asked if he was doing drugs, he sighed, rolled back his eyes, put out his hand like if he wanted something and I just looked at him clueless. A person came out of the entrancs and passed us and he said 'rugs, rugs, rugs, rugs,' quietly like 4 times then said nothing. There were 4 or 5 other times where he whispered something but I couldn't hear and when I asked what he said he just looked at me angrily. He stepped down and was standing next to me and I think he whispered 'I'm in danger' i tried asking him about it, but he just looked at me with a confused face or angry, I cant even tell, but made some more weird movements and just stood there. I was trying to figure out what to say and he said 'the way to travel and communicate' and I thought he meant my phone so I asked if he wanted my phone and he sighed, rolled back his eyes, looked at me angrily, then sad, then poker face. 

The entire time whenever I asked something he'd do that, sigh or grunt, roll back his eyes, look at me angrily, or sad, or with a poker face like if he was frustrated that I wasn't understanding him. When he was looking around he wasn't doing it erratic but how you normally look around or check an area. 

After he went back up the stairs and sat down. Minutes passed and I was just standing there wondering what i was supposed to do. I asked if he wanted me to call anyone but he'd do the same thing. Making hands movements like if it was sign language or naruto ninjutsu type of stuff. So minutes would pass of silence between us. Two people passed by, one exiting the entrance and the other across the street who wasn't even near us and he pointed to them when they weren't looking. When the guy that exited came back, my neighbor turned around and pointed to him and watched him the entire time. Throughout this sometimes he'd do the same to me. When I was trying to figure out what to do he'd point to me and my dog. Then just go back in his head. It's like he was thinking because he would make movements and it's like he was trying to figure something out. 

He got up and took a step down, waited, then took another step down and after he sighed or something said 'what do you want to do' and I said I just wanted to make sure you're alright before I go. He'd just do his thing then made weird movements like if he was trying to say something. He'd point to his apartment building then to him and then to me and do some sign language and look at me. He said it again 'what do you want to do' and I said the same thing. When he talked he wasn't slurring or anything he spoke clearly and he seemed lucid in those moments like if he was aware. Other than than it's like he was unstable or something. But he wasn't erratic like how most people think of it, he was irrational and odd but it wasn't full blown craziness. That's why I'm not sure. I asked him if he knew who I was and he looked up with his eyes like if he was thinking about it but he never said anything. I got out of there because my brother drove up to where I live and I told my neighbor I was gonna talk to him. I got there and told my brother about him and I looked back to my neighbor and he was looking back at us. He stood around for a bit then went up the stairs and it seemed like he was angry and I guess he went to his place. 

I don't know anything about drugs, I know he used to drink but no way he was drunk, it was too weird for it to be. I dont know if he's doing drugs. He never told me anything about it if he was. He's told me he's had anxiety and has medication for it but wasn't taking it. He just got out of jail a year back I think, don't know what he did, my brother tells me he stabbed a guy but he seemed like he wanted to get his life back together. I'm afraid that it's not drugs but he's got something else going on like schizophrenia or something. I just don't know. If I see his mom or brother I plan to tell them about it but I just want to know if anyone knows what's up with him. I'm not saying that he will but I'm afraid that he could do something and want to know if there's something I can or should do?",07Mar2020,1

716,"My apologies if my English is bad.

I've got a situation with a girl, and I don't know what to do.
A little background story :
About 6 months ago I ended a relationship with a girl. She had been cheating on me for a verry long time and I knew she was doing it but I didn't want to lose her. It was weird.
A few months later I met a girl at school.
We got along and our relationship kept on growing and growing. We've been sending hearts and kisses for a few weeks.
Last week  she had a party, she was really drunk and texted me the entire night saying she missed me, that she loved me, that she wanted me, that kinda stuff.
The day after the party I asked her if the things she said were just drunk talk, and she told me that she said it because she was drunk, but that it was the truth. 
Yesterday she had another party, she told me the same things when she was drunk and the bext morning I wake up and read the things she send me.

She had kissed another guy at the party, and she apologized and said that she dissapointed me and herself doing that. She also said she didn't know what she was thinking.

It kinda hurt when I read those messages but ofcourse I immediately forgave her.
I told her that I loved her and that I won't let something stupid as a drunk meaningless kiss come between us.

She said that she doesn't deserve me and that she is a bad friend.

I tought everything was fine and when I ask her if shes okey she says yes.
I don't want to keep asking it because she might find it annoying, but she has been really cold and distant today.
I havn't seen her and we only spoke trough snapchat but something really feels off.
She doesn't says she loves me and doesn't send x'es anymore.
I really don't want to lose her because we go perfect together.
Anyone know what I did wrong. Or how I can fix it?",07Mar2020,1
717,"So, I'm in a pretty good spot in my career, I'm Linux engineer for a large retail company, make great money and I have great benefits.

My wife has been pushing me to go to college ""because I'm smart and need to be recognized for that"". Honestly, college has always been something I've always wanted to do but it was never stressed in my family. All of my experience in the tech sector has been self taught and my current role was achieved based on my experience which feels good.

However, my company also offers a host of tuition reimbursement programs. Personally I would like to go for some bachelor's level degree in Software Development but my company has partnered with a couple colleges that completely pay for MBA programs. I'd be an idiot not to consider an MBA but it honestly isn't the degree I want but I realize the benefits of having one.

I'm not yet sure if the program includes undergrad classes (I have no college experience at all) but one of the colleges offers a ""Self Designed"" MBA program which I'm hoping could have some tech elements to it but that might be a pipe dream?

Would love some advice from people whom have started college so late in life, has completed a degree online, or gas experience with an MBA with a tech slant? (If that's a thing).

719,"So the situation is that I'm no longer able to live in my previous place of residence. For a while I've wanted to move in with 2 of my friends for about 2 months. If I did the rent would come to be around $300+ a month. The downsides are that I will probably be jobless for sometime or I will have to arrive at my job really early (around 3 a.m.). 

Another option I have is to move into one of the many trailers my dad owns alongside my brother. We work together so I dont have to worry about getting to work. The downsides are that I just flat out dont like my brother and dad at their worst. At best they're fun to have a casual conversation with but I dont really connect with them. Along with that my dad is really controlling. He only seems to pay me when he feels like it. I feel like my mental health degrades everytime I spend time with these two. I cant go into more depth or this thread will start to be long. 

The real problem is that my friends think I'm moving in with them while my brother thinks I'm moving in with him. The reality is that I havnt made up my mind and I'm only days away from moving. It feels scummy at this point to decline one over the other because of the time remaining.

Some other relevant information.
-I have some money saved up. Around enough for 3 months of rent while my friend could probably get me a job where he works.
-if I move in with my brother I'll probably still have to pay utilities. Either electricity or wifi.",07Mar2020,1

722,"This is going to be a longer one so I‚Äôll put a tl;dr at the end. I‚Äôm also not going to give out super specifics because I don‚Äôt want the people involved to find this or get doxxed. 

Basically, it starts with a close friend of mine telling me that he was forced to kill a man in self defense during a robbery at a restaurant where he worked. And even at this point, something felt off. The way he was telling it he never hinted to killing the man himself until the very end, so was kinda just assuming the cops killed him until that point. He also left out a lot of details which is fair according to him this just happened and he just got done talking to police so I didn‚Äôt want to push and make him relive that situation again. 

So at this point, I wanted to know more about the situation to just get a better understanding of everything that happened to help support him. Figured the best way to do this was to look for news articles about it so I don‚Äôt have to force him to think about the situation more than he already is. The thing is though is that there are no reports on it. None at all. Which at the time I thought was fair. One of the few details that he did give was that the robbery happened at 6 where he worked and it was currently midnight. So I was like ok sure maybe it hasn‚Äôt been reported on yet I‚Äôll wait a day. Next day still no reports. Which is super strange normally there is a hint of something happening by this point it was a robbery/shooting. I can see them not giving full details but just a ‚Äúhey there was a robbery on X street‚Äù is what normally happens. 

This is what really started to get me looking into it more. I looked for any reports in that area that might have been it. The only thing I found was a robbery at the restaurant next door the day before. Apparently what happened was at night when the store was closing some people broke in demanded money from the workers and left no one was hurt and only money was taken, police are still looking for the suspects. Which then got me thinking about the details he gave me. If everything happened the way he said the timeline would be: some people rob a restaurant during close, get away. Police investigate, find some clues but are looking for the suspects. Not even a full day later the place right next door gets robbed at 6 which is during the middle of a dinner rush. Get shot and killed that‚Äôs the end of that. 

So I‚Äôm like ok something is definitely off either he‚Äôs not telling the full story, this didn‚Äôt even happen, or the people who tried to rob the restaurant are the worst robbers I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs now been 3 days since this happened still no reports. I‚Äôve taken to looking to social media found the restaurant's Facebook/twitter posting as normal. Also, feel it‚Äôs noteworthy to state that (not going to go into very specifics for location reasons) there was a big shooting in an area somewhat close to that a few weeks prior which the Facebook did respond to in one of those ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù type of ways. So you‚Äôd think that if their own store got robbed they would mention it? Also should mention he apparently went back to work the day after? Shouldn‚Äôt it be closed? It was just robbed and a man died in there you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd take a few days off? But whatever shitty business sure it‚Äôs opened. Still, there are absolutely no hints of anything happening in that area other than the actual robbery the day before. 

So I took to police reports. Found the police incident reports in that area found the exact one for the restaurant that got robbed the day before but still no report on the one my friend was in. According to the website they post noteworthy reports at the end of each shift and the one for the actual robbery of the restaurant got posted about 7 hours after it happened. So it being day 3 and still no report is definitely strange. 

Currently, I have no idea what‚Äôs going on and just need opinions. It is now day 4 nearly day 5 and there are still no reports on this robbery. Nothing from small shit on social media, to news reports, to actual police reports. Nothing. If it did happen then what the fuck why is everyone at every step garbage at their job. And if it didn‚Äôt why? Why would he make this up? I don‚Äôt want to ask him and accuse him of lying because what if it did happen? 

tl;dr - My friend told me he killed a man in self defense after a robbery. Looked into it found no reports at all even after 4 days. The entire situation surrounding it all is very bizarre and just need opinions on the situation.",07Mar2020,1
723,"So I live in a very old apartment complex, the walls are extremely thin and while this is something that used to bother me, I notice it much less now. So anyways. I have pretty bad anxiety/panic attacks and last night at 2 in the morning I started feeling extremely anxious. In this mode I can be kind of snappy and and my energy level can get pretty high. I was kind of arguing with my partner? More so just being difficult to calm down due to my anxiety and was a bit loud. This resulted in good ol pound the wall when your neighbors are being loud technique. I felt TERRIBLE. Now to be fair, I believe my neighbors work very late and often times I hear them playing with their dog until 3-4 in the morning (it sounds like they are playing fetch). It is a lot of thumps across the hall way like their dog is running. At first this bothered me and while it is sometimes still annoying i have learned to live with it and have never complained because the walls are just extremely thin. 
Anyways, despite their noise level, I never wanted to be that neighbor that was obnoxiously loud, and being called out on it it‚Äôs making me feel very nervous to run into them. I am thinking about leaving some baked goods and an apology note in front of their door along with my number to text Incase I am ever loud in the future.

We are both broke and not moving out anytime soon

I‚Äôve posted about her before and was told to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù ‚Äúget over it‚Äù but those were the first few comments and her behavior has gotten worse so I‚Äôm once again asking for ur advice 

She was copying my behaviors (buying my hygiene products), recreating my videos that I made with my friends with hers in real life, copying the things that I do with my boyfriend with hers (songs I made up for him, saying the project I was telling my bf about that he helped me with was something she‚Äôs doing herself, holding her bf the way I hold mine), and my friends say she copies my voice 

It only rubbed me the wrong way before especially because my bf at the time broke up and she was still copying the things we‚Äôd do and because growing up (we have a very mentally ill family) my parents allowed her and her sister to beat me, not give me blankets, pick on me while their parents actually protected me. The one thing her parents did that bothered me was say that I copied her so this *really* touches a spot now that I‚Äôm an adult and have that creeping back up on me.. especially since her parents are the only ones who don‚Äôt say anything about it 

**It‚Äôs gotten more serious lately because:**

1) I think she‚Äôs moved on from using the copying thing with just her bf, but to catfish strangers online 

2) she‚Äôs faking illnesses which has my family and I bringing her back and forth to the hospital which costs her family (who live in near poverty) money. 

*Not to mention that when it started, I had to wait on her for 5 hours after she‚Äôd just finished her food and I was in the middle of cooking my first meal of the day and was exhausted from work

When the nurse came in and told her she was all clear she told her family (and mine) that the nurse said she couldn‚Äôt find anything. The nurse gave her her description of treatment she tore the part that says she‚Äôs clear. (Like there‚Äôs a hole in the middle of the paper) 

I saw her snapping pictures of her hospital band and she‚Äôs been walking slow, limping, talking raspy, and claiming she can‚Äôt do ‚Äòthis‚Äô or ‚Äòthat‚Äô all week  

There was no apology after the nurse said she was all clear. She just acted like I believed the same lie she told her family as if I wasn‚Äôt in the room when the nurse said she was fine.*

3) she keeps going outside pant-less and gets an attitude when I tell her. She even said that I‚Äôm not wearing a bra under my hoodie (something I‚Äôm sure that most girls do but my mom is old fashioned) really loud so that my mom would hear just to get back at me. 

My neighbor is my ex and our other neighbor is hot. 

Idk if she wants their attention but it‚Äôs really embarrassing. Not to body-shame but she isn‚Äôt in shape (not even an unfortunate out of shape, like she eats strictly frozen/fast food and gets mad and doesn‚Äôt eat it when I want to cook for dinner) and my neighbor/ex and his friends are definitely the type to make jokes about her (and I‚Äôm sure they have)

744," I just wanna preface this by saying I'm new to reddit so I'm not sure if I'm gonna do all this reddit stuff right but anyway...

I (22F) am still living with my parents. I was previously working at my old university as a supervisor. My mom hated that I was working there simply because it was ""too far away"" (around 45 mins). She demanded, and demanded, and demanded that I quit until she had eventually worn me down to the point that I couldn't think of anything to do other than what she wanted me to do. It's not like I wanted to keep that job forever, and I was looking for employment opportunities closer to home, but 1) my previous job had extremely flexible hours and opportunities to clock in at home and get additional hours without ever having to GO on site, 2) I don't have my degree yet so employment opportunities for me are kinda few and far between at the moment, and 3) I live basically in the middle of nowhere so any actual job I could get is 30+ mins away anyway. I was adamant about working because I really do love working and being a reliable employee to MY supervisors, and being a reliable supervisor to the employees I'm in charge of. And I was gaining supervisor/management skills that I felt would help me in future jobs/careers. Lastly, I'M 22 YEARS OLD. I would prefer to not still be living with my parents at this age, and moving out requires a good amount of money. Not only do I need to be able to support monthly rent, but I will need to buy myself a car before I can move out. On top of that, I'll be graduating with SO MANY STUDENT LOANS to pay off. At this point in my life, it is very very stupid to be unemployed. Everything I'm telling you about this is what I explained to her time and time again, yet she could not take no for an answer. There was really no way around it. Now I'm a couple weeks into unemployment and job hunting, job hunting, job hunting, JOB HUNTING...and nothing. Now I'm flat f\*\*\*\*\*\*g broke not a dime to my name, no job, still living with my parents and NOW my mother is going to accuse me of being lazy and not doing anything because all I do is sit on my room on my computer (applying for jobs). I've tried so many times to talk with her but she doesn't listen All I'm asking is for a little help with what I can do or say to her because I am at my wits end. She's got her wish and I'm unemployed and broke,",07Mar2020,1
745,"My husband (M, early 30s) and I (F, early 30s) need some advice. We are in the midst of a life transition and we are feeling confused. But we also feel lucky, because we understand that we are incredibly privileged to be considering all these options and having this freedom to choose. Here's some background:

\-I just graduated from school and am making a career change into a therapeutic career.

\-My husband has his AA and has always wanted to go back to school for his Bachelor's. Currently, my husband works as a laborer with federal agencies.

\-We are on a long road trip and are camping in our car. No apartment, no major expenses.

\-Financials = \~$170,000 in cash savings, \~$187,000 in a brokerage account (mix of index funds) and \~$30,000 in IRAs

Here's the source of our confusion. We are weighing various job offers, as follows: 

1) I have a great job offer in the Midwest. It's in my field, it's in the setting I prefer, the pay is good, benefits are decent, I'd have lots of autonomy and I'd work with the population I'm passionate about. There's also a large college nearby where my husband can go to school and finally earn his Bachelor's degree. He is interested in studying geography and philosophy. I am prepared and totally willing to support him 100%. Because he'd need to gain residency for in-state tuition, we would be there at least three years.

Problem? Neither of us particularly want to live in this area, especially my husband. He loves big mountains and wilderness. Though there is National Forest, rivers and lakes, well, it's just not the same. Access to remote wilderness and less remote areas are very important to us, especially my husband. 

2) He just got a job offer on the Southern coast for a permanent federal maintenance job with benefits at a small park. He has been in federal service for a while and has had multiple permanent federal jobs. This would be the first permanent position with the agency he wants. The job is a few hours from his family, it's close to the beach and could lead to a better job in a more desirable location. 

Cons are wear and tear on his body after many years of heavy labor, operating loud equipment, etc. He is already experiencing health problems from years of physical stress. He often doesn't find this work very fulfilling or engaging. Additionally, he is on the Autism Spectrum. He experiences extreme mental and emotional fatigue and discomfort from the social interaction required with this work and the sensory stimulation (loud engines, chemical smells, etc). 

I also managed to get a job offer in that same location, though not with the job description I prefer, not with the population I prefer and not in the setting I prefer. Essentially, not my ideal job, but it's a job in the same location as my husband.

We could save quite a bit of money and be that much closer to retiring early, which is one of our goals.

3) We could pass on the Midwest and the Southern job offers and I could continue looking for jobs in areas where he would like to go to school and where we'd both like to live, primarily the Pacific Northwest. He'd be able to start sooner, since we are Washington state residents.

so i work at retail place.  it‚Äôs in a plaza with a bunch of other stores. 
about two weeks ago i went out to my car on my break to vape (don‚Äôt judge me ik it‚Äôs bad). and i was just chilling in my car and this car pulls up in front of me and back in next to my car. he beeps for my attention. it was a black guy, that had a jamaican accident or something. and i roll down my window and he was saying stuff like ‚Äúi saw u on my facebook recommend friends a few times and i saw u walking in the parking lot and i just had to see you‚Äù , ‚Äúi saw u vaping u should come in my car and vape‚Äù, i know this is weird i‚Äôm not gonna kidnap u or anything‚Äù(which is super sketchy to even point this out). he just kept saying stuff to try to get me in his car. and i didn‚Äôt know what to do so i said i need to get back to work. i was just so freaked out. he also asked if i had a boyfriend and how he thinks he‚Äôd be with me than my boyfriend and it was fucking creepy. i just wanted to chill in my car man. so i get out of my car to hurry in my work but he gets out of his car and went up to me and said at least shake my hand. i did. just to end the encounter (but regret it so much bc it was so wrong). i told my manager (let‚Äôs call her mary) and she said he probably was just a confident guy trying to take a shot but if i needed someone to walk to my car with ask her. so i tell my parents about this and they freaked out and called the cops. my parents thought he was a sex trafficker or something. all the cops said if i see him again call the cops. so i think i will never see him again. 

NOPE. i was cashing someone out today and i overheard my manager bob talking to someone about a application and i look and ITS HIM. my heart drops. i ask Bob if Mary was working today bc she knows what happened before and he said no and i can tell him whatever i can tell Mary. so i go to the office and tell him everything. he said ‚Äúout of the few times that he called the store and talked in person, he doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad guy and not a person that would be in the kidnap business‚Äù ( in my head i was like have u heard of ted budney??). so he said if i don‚Äôt feel comfortable with him working there they won‚Äôt hire him. it just made me so mad that every manager i tell they try to not make it a big deal. like it‚Äôs weird how do they not get that. i was telling a coworker and she was saying it seems like the guy is obsessed w me and it‚Äôs hard to believe. just i feel like i‚Äôm overthinking but it is weird that encounter happened and two weeks later he‚Äôs trying to get a job at my job??? huhhhh",07Mar2020,1
747,"Hell, even being asked to stand up and introduce myself freaks me out. I have beta blockers where taking a super small dose eradicates any of my default panic symptoms, but deep down I feel like that is cheating.

I had about a 4 month span where I thought I cured this anxiety. Though I got sick, blanked out during a meeting due to my fever, and reverted right back into that anxious mindset ever since.

Sometimes I can keep my cool, other times my mind scrambled and I start shaking.

Maybe volunteering as a tour guide at a museum may help shake the nerves? The only real practice I get is at meetings at work where stakes are high, so I feel that I can never make mistakes. Maybe a low stake scenario like a tour guide could help me practice.

750,"Hi

Basically I‚Äôm incredibly confused about where I stand with a friend from my university.

I‚Äôll start at the beginning 

We met on the uni group chat before attending and formed a little group with other newbies in first year. Over the first few months I developed a crush on her, told her after about 3-4 months of knowing her and she told me she wasn‚Äôt into guys. I was crushed because I really liked her, but fair enough and we remained friends.

We would text all the time, pretty much every day. She‚Äôd call me her best friend, say she loved me (as a friend) and would tell me things and ask for advice. 

Yet whenever we were in person, if there was anyone else with us, she would just barely speak to me. It made me feel super isolated and confused as to why I seemed to only be relevant in text. 

Granted, it‚Äôs a slight bit of jealousy, but it‚Äôs more confusion as to why she seems to not want to engage with someone who she regularly calls her ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù but then when we are no longer in person she will be texting me.

I would completely understand if she just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable anymore with me because I used to like her and it feels awkward, but if that‚Äôs the case then surely she wouldn‚Äôt want to text me ALL the time. If we never texted I wouldn‚Äôt expect us to talk much, but we did, a lot. 

Anyway, this lead to me getting annoyed a few times and after me trying to cut down on texting her multiple times and trying to cut short text chats we were having she would always seem to message me asking what she‚Äôd done to annoying me and that since I wasn‚Äôt texting her and being blunt she was getting down and sad about it. 

It seemed every time I thought to myself that I wanted out of the friendship because it felt too one sided she would tell me how sad I was making her by not texting her or by being blunt and that I was being selfish.

I really don‚Äôt get what I do because it‚Äôs at the point where I hate being around her because I know she won‚Äôt talk to me much and it makes me feel like a mug if I still text her. Yet if I stop texting her or ignore her she tells me I‚Äôm making her depressed and being a dick. Side note, whenever I try to make plans with her she‚Äôd always cancel the day of or the day before, known her two years we have hung out twice when not at uni because she always cancels.

Any advice on how to deal with someone like this or if I‚Äôm in the wrong here?

Sorry for the long read I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions",07Mar2020,1
751,"Long story short, my parents are fucking morons, they have ruined themselves financially, and now I practically have zero way of making a life for myself out here. They live in a pricey house out in the boonies and are so goddamn stupid that everything they fucking buy they get taken for. I'm not fucking kidding. And my dad's business failed because he was shit at keeping his business afloat but absolutely great at giving deals to people that his business couldn't afford because he is an idiot 

Alright, now that I've gotten that off my chest, what should I do? I can't just join the military or go to school right away for various reasons.  I don't have much money but I do have some. I don't have a car. I'm wondering if I should strike out on my own. Now, I know how hard it can be to be homeless, but if I choose this path, do I have a fucking chance? I'm pretty sure upward mobility exists (in the U.S.). Should I relocate to a city so I can access everything on foot? I don't have a solid plan. It just feels like my only option for now. I have to wait to join the military because I probably won't pass a drug test for a couple months (I've smoked weed forever).

753,"My dad (52M) and I have always had a very on and off relationship. My parents divorced when I was 6 due to his alcohol and drug problem, as well as my grandfathers anger when he found my dad had children with a woman who was not Arab (my dad is Algerian and my mom is Salvadoran). When my parents divorced, my mom took sole custody of me, my brother, who is on the spectrum (24 but 8 at the time) and my half sister (30, then 14) who is my mom‚Äôs child from a different marriage. 

My dad gave up custody without a fight, and disappeared for a few years. My mom took sole responsibility for taking care of us on her own, we moved towns and worked 2 jobs and that was that.

When I turned 9,  my dad came back into my life randomly, and things became...hectic. My mom was not happy he was back in our lives but she didn‚Äôt want her kids to grow up without their dad, so she complied. He got a stable place to live as court ordered and we (my brother and I) began having weekend visits.  Thus leaves us with a handful of bad decisions on his part, some including having us kicked out of 2 separate Ikea‚Äôs for him starting fights, being arrested at a Costco for pushing a woman and having his kids wait in the lobby of a police department, pushing me off of a curb while walking because I was ‚Äúbeing annoying‚Äù and breaking open my lip, and leaving me (at the time 10) at a gas station after getting into a high speed chase for flipping off a cop. Long story short, my dad has made some bad decisions. He was always very verbal and physically abusive to me at the time, it partially being my fault because I wanted to protect my brother from hearing this things so I would instead take the blame for everything he did in order to protect him, whether that meant physical or verbal punishment. I still suffer a bit of trauma from this and have scars from where he has put cigarettes out on my wrist or when he has hit me with a belt on my back. 

After these several things happened, my mother obviously began to tell us we couldn‚Äôt see him and we moved and changed our numbers so he wouldn‚Äôt be able to find us again. 

But yet, when I turned 13, he came back into our lives and into our new town we had settled into. At that point I was old enough to make  my own decisions and decided I would give him a chance, after all he is my dad. Fast forward through the years we have been doing fine, his behavior is better and he has a few slip ups but otherwise fine; nothing that can affect me directly at least. We maintain a healthy relationship, he calls me once a week and I see him on holidays so all is well. 

Now, two days ago I receive a call from a number in UT. I live in New York, he decided to retire in Utah. It‚Äôs him calling me from the County Jail, telling me he‚Äôs been arrested for a DUI, Hit and Run, carrying an automatic weapon in the trunk, as well as having pill bottles that aren‚Äôt under his name. Obviously I call him a bond person (legal jargon isn‚Äôt my thing) and he handles it from there. 

He is released the next day, doesn‚Äôt call me. I message him, still doesn‚Äôt call. I call him again, and he simply tells me I don‚Äôt need him anymore and that no one cares what he does. 

I care about my dad, genuinely because he‚Äôs my father and I don‚Äôt want to see him get hurt, but I am quite literally the only person in his life who has not cut him off. His father, before passing away, cut him off and in a letter told him he is toxic and detrimental to his family. His own sister doesn‚Äôt speak to him, my siblings do not, and most of his friends that I grew up around do not speak to him any more as well. He works a well paying job but typically works alone so there isn‚Äôt much contact with anyone else. He just recently broke up a long term relationship with a woman. They have all tried several times to make him understand his emotional and physical abuse drives them away but yet he still blames everyone else for the problem. I tried to ask him to get help and all it resulted in was me being called a whore and that I don‚Äôt need him because I have my new stepdad, and that i‚Äôve always been against him. 

I don‚Äôt know why I feel such a compassion towards someone who has hurt me and my family several times. I don‚Äôt know why I feel the need to save him constantly and whenever I speak to family or friends that understand the situation I am just made out to feel silly for not getting rid of him when I was a kid. I know he is a good person deep down, I believe we all are. And I genuinely want to get him help, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that without getting hurt.

How can I make him understand i‚Äôm only here to help? Am I wrong for trying to salvage this relationship?",07Mar2020,1
755,"Okay so, I'm having a minor problem and there is this one person that I know could help me. I know that person and we talked a little and we seen each other often (on trials, training etc.). So I decided to message her on facebook and ask for help and advice. First of, she replied a month later, but ok, didn't think anything bad of her because of that. She asked me what's the problem (she is a known coach), and I described problem that I have. I never got a reply. She didn't even see the message. So i thought that she doesn't want to help me at all and I forgot about that and I told myself I will never ask her for advice again since obviously she doesn't want to help (and she's always online).   


Few weeks pass and we both attend a competition held in town be both live. We passed each other a few times but never actually talked. At the very end of the competition, she approaches me and says: ""You sent me a message? I'm sorry I didn't reply to you, I've been busy and I get dozens of messages daily and your message just disappeared and that's why I didn't reply. So please, if I don't reply again, just send me a lot of messages and ""spam"" my inbox."". So, I believed that and once I got home I reminded her that she needs to reply. She saw that message few minutes after, BUT again never replied. She's constantly online, and I've heard from other people that she replies them normally and quickly.   


So, do you think I was right the first time and she only said that to me out of decency? Should I just let it go and forget about it, or should I really send her a reminder again? I have a feeling she is intentionally ignoring me, and I feel so stupid.

Before I begin, I have been a over thinker all my life. I have been suffering from anxiety for the last 3 years.

Seems like the negative energies outweighs the positive ones by a country mile for me. This makes me  just scared of life. I have my goals and ambitions; I think about it and work on it towards accomplishing it. But sometimes(most of the times) life just throws me to the bottom of the totem pole with negative thoughts. As a result, I get way off track of my goals, or what‚Äôs important in life. 


The last few years didn‚Äôt t help either, from bad dating life, no work life balance to family problems that resulted in crippling anxiety and abysmal confidence level. Now everything is amplified now. I get sad even on the silliest of things. Thoughts could be as silly as someone being rude to me for no reason and I would think about it all day to as to why the person was rude and why I couldn‚Äôt defend myself. 

I am just scared, I do get my good days where I am laser focus but one bad thing just throws me off track. It feels like if I take one step forward, life puts me three steps backwards. I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs the chaos in my mind which convinces me that I can‚Äôt actually make it out on life because whatever I do, it will impact me negatively one way or another. 

I sincerely apologies for the rant, I just needed to let it out. I feel helpless most of the times, I am scared of trying new things now. I feel like I am in a cage. I wanna get out but I am scared at the same time. I had therapy, it helped a lot. People suggest me to do meditation which I am trying to practice but not successful yet.

770,"The other day in school I got in a fight with this girl and she beat me up pretty bad. I‚Äôve had issues with her for a while because she‚Äôs in love with my bf and always flirts with him and is basically obsessed with him. Well the other day things escalated in the hall, she was smacking my bf‚Äôs ass and saying all these inappropriate comments to him so I stood up for him, she started yelling at me making a big scene and it led to us fighting. I hate fighting I would never do it but I got so caught up in the moment, I was so mad and didn‚Äôt want to look like a push over in front of my bf and everyone watching. We were pulling each other‚Äôs hair and next thing I knew she was on top of me hitting me in the face really hard. My bf eventually pulled her off me (although he took a long time to do it I don‚Äôt know if he enjoyed watching me get beat up or wtf his deal was). I was so mortified. Getting beat up is the worst feeling, you just feel lesser than the person who beat you up. And getting beat up in front of tons of people and my bf makes it unbearable. Everyone is talking about it and there‚Äôs videos and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a black eye and swollen lips and I‚Äôm dreading having to go to school Monday.
How should I deal with this? Has anyone been beaten up in school?
Should I be embarrassed?

771,"So me and my friends are all sophomores in college. We met in freshman year as they were on the same floor in my dorm. Early on in the year my roommate at the time invited them to hangout and watch a movie in our room since they weren't doing anything and seemed like they were struggling to meet people a bit. They started coming over more and more as the year went on to the point that they would come over for a couple hours every night and we kind of became a group of friends consisting of me and my roommate, these 2 friends in question, and 3 others who in one way or another just got integrated into the group. I have always been a bit more introverted and kept to myself so it was a bit weird for me at first but overall I grew to enjoy the company for the most part and made some good friends. Although we hung out a lot, pretty much everyone else in this group had other friends they would hang out with except for these 2 really.

So now we are sophomores and we are no longer living in dorms. I ended up dating one of the OTHER girls in the group, it lasted for entirety of first semester, didnt work out, it is what it is. As a group we didnt hang out that much first semester but my gf lived with these 2 girls so I would see them whenever I went over there. Now after me and my gf broke up, I have been hearing from these 2 friends a lot more and its been getting pretty annoying.

I have always been friendly and nice to them, but to be completely honest, I never really had that much interest in really being good friends with these 2 in particular. They are not bad people but there were a few things that always bothered me about them. These 2 are best friends, but I personally dont really have anything in common with them. It's also hard to have a conversation with them and they dont really ""contribute"" to conversations much. tbh when it was just me, my roommate and these 2 originally it always felt to me as the dynamic would be me and my roommate having a conversation and trying to get them involved but they were just kind of ""spectating"". It always seemed like they didnt really have much of a life outside of this group in terms of real interests and hobbies and other friends. I would sometimes see them around campus and they would be weird and embarassing in trying to get my attention (and not in a funny way) and would get mad at me later and tell me I hated them if I didnt say hi back. They would get mad when i hung out with other friends instead of hanging out with the ""group"". One of them confessed they had a crush on me last year (which I CLEARLY knew and i had 0 interest in and, without being mean, tried to show i had no interest) and I strongly suspect the other did to.

Now a lot of this i didnt have to worry about when i was with my gf, but since that ended it has gone straight back into it. They have tried to text me and hang out with me a bunch of times which i reluctantly oblige to because i feel bad if i say no. It is pretty damn clear they both have a thing for me and are pretty touchy when they are around me and I do not reciprocate at ALL and sometimes literally ask them what they are doing. I really do not enjoy the time i spend when its just the three of us and feel like its awkward and that they dont really know how to have a normal conversation. My friends outside this group see it too and have told me and asked me like what the hell is up with them. When I'm with them I actively try to make it seem like im not interested but they just do not take a hint. I will sometimes go get food or do things by myself or with other friends like watch a movie and they will get mad I didn't invite them if they find out.

Recently at social events ive been really annoyed. I will show up and try to have a good time and they just follow me around not really doing anything and it makes it weird to talk to other people. I've been trying to get out there a bit and meet new people since my break up and it feels impossible with them there. I will try to go around and talk with other friends too and they just stay by themselves not really talking or mingling with people and then they get mad when they see me again and tell me I keep abandoning them. It makes me feel like they want me to babysit them.

I have always been nice and friendly to them but I don't really have an interest in being friends with them, or at least not that close of friends. I'm empathetic to them because it feels like they do not really have many friends but it's been really bothering me lately and feel like they have been dragging me down. I guess what I am asking is; how can I tell them that I don't really enjoy/want to hang out with them that much, that I am NOT interested in either of them, that they make me uncomfortable sometimes, and just that they can be annoying and clingy?? Should I say something or just avoid them or just keep dropping hints without saying anything explicitly?? Sorry for the length, I kind of needed to vent about this

TL;DR: How can I tell my 2 friends (who are pretty clearly into me, but not explicitly) that I'm not interested in them, don't really want to be close friends with them and that they can be annoying and make me uncomfortable at times?",07Mar2020,1
772,"The company I work at hired a business consultant three months ago to help us build structure since we grew so fast over the past year. I‚Äôm the office manager and have been with the company for two out of five of its years. 

I‚Äôve always had good feedback. I have received a promotion and three raises since I‚Äôve started. I‚Äôve made few mistakes and have never had any disciplinary problems. I work 40-50 hours a week and manage two admins. 

The day I met this business consultant I knew I didn‚Äôt like him. He brought me in a room and grilled me on what I‚Äôm going to do once I get married and start having kids. I said that I already am and have kids.. he responded by saying ‚Äúback in my day they hired them old so they can‚Äôt bear children.‚Äù Unbeknown to him I‚Äôm pregnant. With twins! I haven‚Äôt told the company yet and after that comment I was planning on waiting until he left to tell them. He also referred to my other admin as the ‚Äú pregnant one‚Äù because she is currently pregnant too and due this month. I‚Äôm not due for a while so our leaves won‚Äôt over lap. 

Anyways, I eventually had to tell the company sooner than I thought because I‚Äôm showing and wanted to prepare since twins can be high risk. Literally a week before I told them one of the owners told me ho they want to invest into me and put me into financing and he classes to help me grow with them. I was excited and felt valuable at the time. Well a couple days after I told them I was pregnant I received a call from the same owner saying that they decided to just hire a finance manager because they don‚Äôt have the time to wait on me. I understand and that‚Äôs okay with me. I was admittedly disappointed but we are a small company and we are growing so more opportunities will come up in the future. 

Since then I have also been forced to reduce my team during all of these policy changes and system changes which has led me to working more hours. One of my admins is on military leave and we still have my other admin for about a month. But it will be just me eventually. I asked the business consultant what we should do to prepare for these leaves and he said we would hire a temp. Great. I‚Äôve been very overwhelmed at work and some days I cry on my lunch because of my work load but I‚Äôve tried to stay positive and power through it. I do love the company and have always been treated right by them.

Well the owners call me and want to meet with me yesterday. I come meet with them and they blindside me by saying the business consultant thinks I‚Äôm a zero on a scale of one to five. I asked what the scale was and they said they didn‚Äôt really know but that he suggested letting me go. They refused to do so and instead chose to talk to me. I asked why he rated me a zero and what I need to do better. They said that I should be working 50-60 hours a week when the workload is high. I‚Äôm fine with that but nobody ever gave me these expectations which they agreed with. I asked if there was anything else and they didn‚Äôt really have anything else to say or any more constructive criticism to give me at all. I also informed the owners how I felt about the consultant and they asked me why I didn‚Äôt come to them before. Honestly it‚Äôs because I did come to them before about his comment about pregnant women and they just laughed it off. I wish I told them this yesterday but I was at a loss for words and just trying to hold back tears and asking what they needed from me. 

I‚Äôm extremely upset and hurt that I‚Äôm graded a zero on a scale of one to five. It‚Äôs a huge slap in my face because I feel like I‚Äôve been busting my ass off. I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt fire me but now I feel discouraged and embarrassed. I‚Äôm going to start going into work at 5 instead of 7 so that I can rectify the hours situation and show them that I‚Äôm taking this feedback very seriously. Other than that I‚Äôm not really sure what else I can do? I should also mention that I usually do work 50 hours a week anyways but I took two days off last week because we closed on our new house (I actually ended up going into work one of those days because they needed me.) and I gave them a very in advance notice. I took two days off in the beginning of February for bereavement, my grandpa passed ( however I still worked while I was at the hospice from my phone and took work calls.) and I took two days off in January because my kids had the flu. Obviously those three weeks I didn‚Äôt work 50 hours but I still worked 40. 

Our finance manager starts on Monday and I will be reporting to him instead of the owners from now on and the business consultant leaves Friday. I‚Äôm worried he is going to paint me in a bad light to my new boss. I‚Äôm also very worried about losing my job now out of nowhere since we JUST bought a house and I‚Äôm expecting twins. I can‚Äôt stop crying and feel sick about all of this. I plan on tracking my hours now since nobody was before and I wish I was so I could have a case about how hard I have been working.

774,"I'm a 23 year old woman who has been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I initially thought that I might be on the autism spectrum (a thought that was also shared by my counselor, especially since I have an autistic uncle), though I feel like I might have a borderline intellectual disability.

I feel socially incompetent, and I feel like I can be easily taken advantage of as a result of said incompetence. I can also tell that people's voices change whenever they talk to me, as though I were a small child or animal. I know my voice is considered weird, so maybe people think I'm I'm mentally impaired as a result.

I do live on my own and use SSI to pay for bills, toiletries, and other necessities. I also earn food stamps since I'm on SSI, so I don't have to worry about going hungry. I've relied on SSI since I was 12, though I'm just now learning to take the responsibility of being my own payee after having my mother as a representative for so long.

I want to be independent and live a decent life, though I feel that I'm unable to fully do so due to not being able to understand how to effectively do so. I don't want to be seen as a child in an adult body, though I can't ignore the fact that I am delayed in some aspects compared to peers within my age demographic.

I don't want to be taken advantage of by others or not be taken seriously because I don't seem neurotypical, and I sometimes wonder if I would be better off institutionalized as opposed to living with the general public. At the same time, I enjoy having freedom even with the risks such freedom has.

If anyone can help me figure out what's wrong with me, I would be so grateful to you for said assistance. I know I'm mentally ill, though I'm unsure of the severity or how to go about lessening the intensity of my illness even with counseling and medication.",07Mar2020,1

I've possibly been over thinking this, but here goes:

At summer ball last year, I was sitting down next to my friend. We were talking for a bit, just before dinner was served. (I am so shy!...)

After we had finished speaking and dinner was served, she then stroked my arm, but not just a little touch, she stroked up and down a total of six times.

None of my other friends have ever stroked my arm like that - is there any significance in it? Is it a rare or common thing to do, and why would you stroke someone's arm six times?",07Mar2020,1

My boyfriend of 5 years just broke up with me last week after taking me on a vacation during which I thought he‚Äôd propose.

I have a dog. She‚Äôs two and is about 30 lbs so she would pass most apartment restrictions. She‚Äôs the absolute most important thing to me and I will not consider getting rid of her.

791,"This might be a long one... 

So, for some back story, I'm pregnant so there is a certain amount of hormonal influence in how I'm feeling. My husband's family is very loud. They are friendly, and mean well, but every conversation is yelled and it's just always been that way. They get so engrossed and engaged with what they are saying, everything always turns into everyone yelling over each other. Not really aggressively. Just loud. Every. Single. Conversation. They could be talking about the weather or politics, and the intensity is the same.

So, I have never really been into these conversations. I'll listen, and sometimes the content is pretty interesting, but I dont feel like getting yelled over so I keep most of my opinions to myself. This hasn't really bothered me much, and doesnt seem to bother them, so long as I laugh or react at the right times. But I am getting kind of sick of it. 

We are moving in with hubby's parents in a few months when baby comes to catch up on our financial sittuation as baby was a BIG surprise. Theres already a ton of little things that will put strain on our relationships, but that just comes with moving back home. Nobody really wants the sittuation. 

How do I go about being around them all the time? I feel like I will wind up hiding in my room all the time. I want to interact, but I literally have to yell for the simplest thing to be heard. It's very annoying. For some reason I never cared and found them charming. It was nice to sit with my thoughts with them, but now I feel like I just want them to shut up. It's not entertaining anymore. 

I guess my point is, how do I decompress and deal with them being overwhelming all the time? I know when I have a newborn, things wont be easier. I want to find something to help me cope with my frustrations before I'm sleep deprived, ha!",07Mar2020,1

795,"Hi everyone,

I have found over the years that I have an issue with self-betterment and overthinking. I feel like I have a hard time trying to improve things in my life, particularly being less judgmental and more empathetic to other people/less selfish, not because I can‚Äôt do it but because, every time I try, I end up overthinking it and becoming incredibly anxious. 

So, as an example, if I want to be more empathetic, I will end up constantly overthinking every single thought or feeling I have towards someone or overthinking everything I say to someone because I‚Äôm  constantly like, ‚ÄúIs this a kind thing to say? But what if it gets interpreted in this way? But what if it‚Äôs actually mean because of this?‚Äù and so on and so forth. I end up getting into this huge, perfectionistic spiral where I desperately need to to make sure every little thing I do or say fits this idea of perfection in my mind. 

Because this is obviously so exhausting, I tend to always give up on my self-improvement endeavors and go back to just ‚Äúletting myself be‚Äù and not overthinking about every single decision I make. The problem with this, though, is that I don‚Äôt really change any of my toxic behaviors because I just choose to not think about my behaviors too much since it sends me down a perfectionistic spiral when I do.

804,"Ok so quick back story. Met this girl at a party last Saturday and we hit it off extremely well. I got her number and we've been texting all week. She seems super cool and I'm really into her. We made plans Monday to hangout today. On Thursday we were talking and she said she wanted to come to my fraternities party that night and we made plans to meet up there. They were more last minute and she didn't get back from another event until super late so she asked if we could raincheck to Saturday and I said yeah no problem. Today an hour before we were supposed to hangout I texted her confirming where we'd meet and she texted me saying she forgot and just realized it's her best friends birthday and she has to be at her place but asked if I'm free another time soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

How should I read this situation? I really like talking to her and when I saw her she was awesome but I've been looking forward to this date all week and I'm pretty pissed off that she cancelled such last minute, especially because I had to text her before anything was said. Do I give her one last chance or what is the best move in this situation?",07Mar2020,1

808,"Almost 2 years ago I went to study abroad, and as the year ended I got into a group chat with some of the guys. It was a snapchat group, and back then I used to text with them so much. Slowly, I started leaving snapchat to the point that I barely ever entered the app. Today, I decided to enter the chat again and just talk for a while. I entered the chat, and the first thing I'm greeted by is a message saying ""leave"". I'm honestly not sure what to do about them. Someone please help, because while the answer might be to either talk it out or do something serious, I really cherish the memories and the people who I lived with.",07Mar2020,1
809,"I‚Äôve been considering moving to a different state and not sure the best way to go about it.

I‚Äôm 24 and not in any kind of desperate situation but I want to experience something new/get a change of scenery and I feel like it would be better to do while I don‚Äôt have anything really tying me down to my home state. 

I work an office job but for a small, private business so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to relocate and stay with the same company. I‚Äôm currently living with family, so I don‚Äôt have a lease or anything to worry about. 

I know it‚Äôd be better to find a job first but will places hire me if I don‚Äôt actually live in the area?

I have plenty of savings but almost all apartments want to see paystubs/proof of employment before renting.

It just feels like sort of a catch-22 if I can‚Äôt get a job unless I live in the area but I can‚Äôt get a place  without a job. 

So far, it seems like the most realistic option might be to stay in a motel or AirBnB for a few weeks while I find a job in the area and then move into an actual place once I‚Äôve been working for a few weeks. 

Any advice/input is much appreciated - thanks!",07Mar2020,1

812,"Let me start by explaining that im not from USA, im from pretty conservative country. I have been living with my cousin for sixth year already. We both live and study in different city from our hometown. Its easy for our families to finance us together hence we are forced to be roomies. We are both studying. 
She is few years older than me and she is oke of the most old fashioned persons i have ever encountered, she is strict, afraid of a lot of things, including drinking, walking in the evenings or even having sex (yeas, you read it right? Shes 26 years old virgin)_ she is considered a good girl in my country_ its taboo here to have sex before marriage so shes just highly influenced by society _ anyways thats not the point. She has boyfriend, she has been with this guy for 6 years already and they spend ALL THEIR TIME AT HOME WATCHING STUPID VIDEOS OR MEMES ONLINE.
Its not that im sexblocking them or sth i give the plenty of time and space _ because im so sick of seeing them alllll the time everyday im forced to go out a lot. My cousin hides her bf from our family so in my family im like dark horse?! Idk, im one who spends her time outside partying, drinking, walking late nights or idk_ someone who cant stay at home. Its not like i enjoy being on the street wandering around with nothing to do _ im just so damn tired_ i had some time off from uni two years ago, and i worked pretty shitty job just so i coukd stay out of the house and not watch them all the time. Our apartment is also very tiny one bedroom, kitchen and living room in the same space. You might think they want to get laid and im one disturbing them but trust me thats not the case. I stay at my friends house a lot, i go on hiking trips, they have a lot of opportunities to have sex but they dont _ they dont go out they always order food at home and just lay around where they please. Im just so sick of it - i need some alone time, i need to walk around naked once in a while, i dont need to worry about her bf all the damn time. Now hes great guy, im lucky enough to call him my friends but im sick of looking at him 24/7 for past six years. 
The worst of all, uni is canceled for few weeks because of coronuvirus and my family is going crazy every time i go out so for two weeks im forced to stay at home and look at them and i cant even use my damn laptop cause my cousin literally hijacked it for her studies ( long story short she didnt buy laptop herself cause she doesnt want anything other than apple i settled for sth cheaper so i got my lenovo and now she uses it for her work). Worst of all my family doesnt get why i NEED TO go out. Anyways how to force my cousin to come out and tell everyone ghat shes got bf. I think everyone would understand my struggle ?! Am i being selfish?! Also her mom visits us once in a while and stays here for some time, so its never just two of us its either her bf or her mom and this damn apartment is tooo small for so many people. Im going crazy. It may seem like the first world problem and imay come of as selfish idk but i just needed to rant for a while and get fresh perspective",07Mar2020,1

814,"I need to decide whether to switch programs in my college. Both are computer science, but differ in the types of classes you take. If I stay in what I'm doing now, I'll have to take more technical classes like linear algebra, technical communication, and other cs/technical classes that I'm not really interested in. The main reason I want to stay is because I would get the opportunity to take about 4 elective classes, like writing or art classes. Or I switch and take more humanities and social studies classes instead of the technical classes, but I only have room for like one elective.

815,"Should I (30M) allow my ex (26F) back into my life? And if so how do I go about explaining this to my current (51F) gf?

This girl who we‚Äôll call Marie, she and I dated on and off throughout 2015. Not sure I can call her an ex because we were never official but we did go on a few dates. We ended up cutting contact because my feelings for her were much stronger than hers were for me. Plus in early 2016, I relocated clear across the US  a new job. 

In 2017, I became involved with my current gf. While things have been great, she‚Äôs terribly insecure and has accused me (falsely) of cheating countless times

Anyways 3 days ago Marie reappeared on my social media (she took a long hiatus from it) and the last few days we‚Äôve been catching up via text. The texts have been completely platonic (ie just updating each other on how our lives have turned out since we last spoke) and Marie is extremely happy for me and my current gf who we‚Äôll call Mercedes. In a text earlier tonight Marie said she hoped Mercedes was ok with us texting. I told Marie I hadn‚Äôt told Mercedes because I‚Äôm not sure how Mercedes will react. 

I have a few female friends (all of whom I‚Äôve known since childhood) who Mercedes has met on trips back to my hometown and enjoyed their company and frequently asks me how they‚Äôre doing. I told Mercedes about Marie when Mercedes and I first got together, so obviously this situation is different regarding Marie

I don‚Äôt have any romantic feelings for Marie and I see her purely as a friend. When I told her I hadn‚Äôt told Mercedes about us texting Marie said

 ‚ÄúI respect your relationship and if she doesnt like it, as much as it would make me sad to lose connection with you if she feels any type of way I'll back off. I would never create problems for you Jason‚Äù

Anyways should I allow Marie back into my life? And if so how should I handle telling Mercedes about it?",07Mar2020,1

818,"     Im always looking for somebody too kick it with, and usually that works out for me. After work, ill find a freind who isnt busy and bool with them. If i cant find a friend who isnt working, ill go see my friends at work and sometimes ill travel quite a ways to do it. This is my daily routine. To clear things up, im not bothering my friends. We mutually enjoy eachothers company and i always respect their bounderies. 
 
     But, man... when i cant find somebody to hang out with, im just miserable. Like this weekend, all my friends are at work. Im not interested in going places alone, though i make myself so bordem doesnt kill me. I dont care for playing games or watching movies for too long, theres only so many house chores to do. I just lay in bed and vegitate. This is what happens everytime im alone pretty much. I just hate being alone. 

     I value my friends above pretty much all else, and im not sure thats a good thing. Often, i bend over backwards and sacrafice all my resorces for an escuse to hang out and its ussually worth it to me. I hate where i live, but i couldnt imagine leaving my freinds and places i think about moving too are places my individual friends want to go. It feels like ive lost an individual drive.

819,"I, 23/F, have recently joined hinge out of loneliness and boredom. I am freshly single but that‚Äôs another story. I matched with this guy Nick, 27, and hit it off immediately. He even asked if he could call me sometime. The next day he called me and we talked for two hours! We were vibing and I started to develop a crush. He texted me everyday and he was so funny and cute. He asked me out and we made plans for Saturday, Feb 29th. Our plans were to go to this dive bar in hollywood that I love and to eat maybe. So I drove to his place and he helps me find parking. By the way, he‚Äôs so much hotter in person that I wanted to scream. He‚Äôs tall and he has the nicest teeth and his hair looked so good and his clothes-ugh! You guys get it right? I am feeling him. I thought we were going to uber to the place from my car but he asked if we could go to his apartment first before going to the bar. I was a little nervous because I didn‚Äôt expect that but we walked there and he changed his shoes. He told me he asked his roommate to stay somewhere else for the night. I was like whoa! There‚Äôs a chance we might have sex. I didn‚Äôt bring condoms because I knew if I did I would try to have sex with him and it‚Äôd be too soon. Meanwhile , he doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going through my head. We ubered to the bar and talk about weird shit and I guess the driver didn‚Äôt like what we were talking about and he turned up the volume of whatever he was listening to. I thought that was funny. We get to the bar and he buys us drinks and it‚Äôs a small bar, kind of intimate so we have to sit close to each other. I was kinda scared to make a move but I made it obvious I was into him. We were swiveled to the point where we were directly facing each other and our legs were clasping each other‚Äôs. As we progressively got more drunk our faces were so close that I wanted to explode. Our chemistry was so intense and the sexual tension was too much for me to handle. We smoked a couple times outside and I think we decided we were good. He asked if I wanted to eat but I didn‚Äôt feel like eating. I wanted to rip his clothes off! We call an uber and get back into his apartment and he asks if I want to smoke a spliff. I say yes and he rolls it up and I sit on his bed. I try to find something good to watch but we all know we‚Äôre not going to watch it. We‚Äôre both very drunk and giggly. We start to cuddle and I made my move and we start making out. One thing leads to another and I ask if he wants to have sex. He says yes. I‚Äôm so happy. I like him so much. But then he seems to be going through it. He tells me if he has sex with me he‚Äôll feel like shit in the morning. I ask him why, and he tells me, ‚ÄúI used to be an asshole.‚Äù I‚Äôm too drunk to understand his rambling and I‚Äôm so horny I‚Äôm like please have sex with me ü•∫ü§≤üèΩ. He says he‚Äôs in therapy for this(I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthis‚Äù is) and that he‚Äôs currently working on it with his therapist. We ended up messing around for a little and he passes out before the condoms arrive via postmates. I pass out for a little and he wakes me up to mess around and I undress and falls asleep again. I tell him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm naked‚Äù and he just grunts and rolls over. It‚Äôs 6 am at this point and I have work at 8. I don‚Äôt know whether to stay and go straight to work or to go home and shower because I felt the alcohol coming out of every pore in my body. I quietly change and accidentally knock over my redbull. I clean it up don‚Äôt worry. By the way I drank a ton of vodka redbull and that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt sleep until after 2 am. I kind of wake him up and tell him my ubers here to drive me to my car. He asks me if I‚Äôm okay to go and I say yes and I kiss him on the cheek. I drive home and shower and go to work. Around 9 am I text him sorry that I had to leave so early but I had to go to work. I tell him I had a good time. He doesn‚Äôt respond for several days. Finally, I just text him hey Nick, just wondering if we can talk, been thinking about you. He texts back immediately saying, hey is everything okay? I say yeah everything‚Äôs good how are you? The texts are so dry, I know he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. He stops responding after I ask him if he‚Äôs seen my fenty lipgloss in his apartment. I just bought it the same day! Now it‚Äôs been a week since our date and I‚Äôm wondering where it all went wrong. Obviously it‚Äôs the part where I tried to have sex with him but can you guys try to help me to get him back?

This ended up coming back on L because he is now forcing her to move out of the halfway house today.  First he accused her of using all of her money to buy drugs when she couldn‚Äôt pay x amount of money to someone and had her drug tested, which she passed.

He takes a few minutes to go to the app, and I thought to myself, why is he going through the trouble of getting me directly to the app. So of course, I looked at his texts to see what hes trying to hide. I find a text from tinder for a login code. So I searched his phone for the app but it wasnt there. Next I go to the play store and sure enough, in the search history is tinder and a search for an adultfriendfinder app. So I asked him about it. Of course he plays dumb and looks shocked that I'm even accusing him of this and starts asking why im going through his phone, starts calling me psycho, starts saying im just like my sister and her crazy husband who dont trust each other. Then I let him know that I looked in the play store and found his search for tinder and the adultfriendfinder app. He fessed up and says it's to look for porn. I dont believe him. He says the guys at work told him there's porn on there so he went on to look for porn. 
He wont admit what he was using the app for. I dont use tinder myself so I dont know what all is on there. So tinder users- is there actual porn on there? Or is it strictly used for the intent to meet people? Is there any advice anyone can give me about what to do? He wont admit to things hes done until I have concrete evidence, to which he then will fess up,but i dont have evidence of him cheating. As of right now it seems he has the intent to cheat. It's not as simple as leaving him, we have a 1 year old and I'm currently 2 months pregnant.",07Mar2020,1
835,"So there's this cute girl I sometimes see on the bus after work. I think she goes to a dance school in my town in the same building where my friend and I have a little bandroom. The first time i saw her we both looked at each other for about 5 seconds straight, before i looked away, but every now and again our eyes met (which might've had to do with the fact that we sat a few rows apart facing each other but I could be wrong). I kinda feel like she might have had an eye for me too and maybe she was giving me signals that i was too dense for to see. Did I maybe blow my chances?

I really want to get to know her but I can't.

The thing is, that I have social anxiety problems. Even after those 5 seconds and every other time I saw her, I got very nervous, my stomach ached and I got a lump in my throat (is that how you say that?) for no reason. Even when I just THINK about talking to her (or anyone else for that matter) I get really nervous. (But I do have medication for these effects, so i could pop one or two pills the next time I see her.)

The other problem is, that she's never alone. There's always at least one other person with her. Maybe if she were alone, i could get the guts to talk to her.

Which brings me to my last point: What the hell would I say? ""Can I have your number?"" or ""what's your name?"" would feel way to direct, while ""nice weather we're having"" and ""quite a few people on the bus today"" seem just awful in general.

I've been single my entire life, and it's getting tiring seeing all my friends so happy without the chance to feel that too.

I think I have a good personality (and am not the ugliest fool on the globe) but as of yet I have succeeded in staying alone and lonely. I have been to a psychiatrist to help me with the anxiety (and depression that came with it), but after she moved to another place, I decided to cancel my appointments with the new psychiatrist to focus on my finals. In the sessions we always just talked about how I feel and what's been happening. I won't ever go to one again, because we never got any real, helping solutions from just that. (Don't worry, I got over the depression part.)

I'm sorry if this is in the wrong sub, and that, compared to other posts on here, it's a rather mild problem, but any help is appreciated! :)",07Mar2020,1
836,"Hey everyone I'm in a bit of a sticky situation and I'm looking for some advice. This might be a tad bit long. 

My friend texted me about two hours ago that she needs me to take her in tomorrow. She turns 18 tomorrow and I knew she has some issues with her mom but this was a shock to me. I love her a lot and want to help her but I have a few reservations. Before anyone asks we are at least taking her in for the next week. 

Her dad doesn't live her and her mom anymore. Parents still married but dad had to go to a state across the country to start a new job. They were going to follow him eventually, once she graduated. Her mom is insanely controlling and verbally abusive. I knew this and offered my help if she ever needed it but didn't expect her to need it. Now I am by no means about to go back on that promise, she is staying with us. 

Her mom has very little interest in her, she's okay if she leaves so we don't expect any issues from her mom, but her dad is protesting it. For some reasons her dad can't come and get her and is telling her to tough out two more months (until the end of school). Her mom has taken away her car and has cancelled her data plan as well has relentlessly bullied her. It's gotten bad recently so she has contacted me. 

Now in a perfect world we would take her in in a heartbeat and let her stay until she was on her feet again, but my mom is a mandated reporter and could lose her job if she doesn't take the necessary actions first. My friend has agreed that it's okay for my mom to let the counselor at school know and see how the school can handle it from their end. But my question is since she is 18 (tomorrow but whatever) how involved can the school truly get? I can't imagine they would be able to get social workers involved since she is 18, so I have no clue what else they could do.

Also we are concerned her dad could call the cops and say we are harboring a runaway even though she is 18. She is still in highschool so I know in some states the laws can be a bit wonky. 

Idk, would we be okay if we took her in? If not what else can we do? 

We live in Georgia for anyone who is interested about informing me about the legal side of things",07Mar2020,1

838,"I lost my job one month ago. I was there for one year, the longest I‚Äôd lasted at any job due to my mental health issues (severe depression, social paranoia/isolation, eating disorders). The past 6 years have consistently been a few months of keeping it together followed by months of everything falling apart rock bottom and repeat. I have essentially been running in circles and made no real progress in life.

I‚Äôve tried talk therapy (still doing), medication, and will be starting CBT therapy next week.

Since graduating high school I‚Äôve had many basic jobs from office work, call centers, restaurants, retail, whatever you can get without a degree. I have yet to find a career path that I am remotely interested in.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm missing, and I haven‚Äôt found that thing that makes me want to look forward to the future and I don‚Äôt know how to find it. I am not opposed to a college education assuming I can find a way to stabilize my mental health, fix my finances, find some kind of interest.

I keep picking myself back up hoping at some point things will change, but I am not sure what, when or how that will be. Everything in me wants to just give up, but I won‚Äôt.

I am lucky enough to have a place to live right now without paying rent which is the one saving grace right now.

I want and need a job, any job, and am confident I can get one soon. But I don‚Äôt know if I can afford to have the cycle repeat again, or what I‚Äôd be working towards other than paying off the credit debt and providing food/shelter, which must be done either way. I have no idea how to get out of this hole I‚Äôve created for myself.

It seems all of these things are interrelated, and whenever I start working on one, the others kick me in the ass.

Sorry this is disjointed. I haven‚Äôt figured out a way to describe all these things without starting in one corner and just spewing out all the issues.

I‚Äôm just reaching out for some form of advice or help, in whatever form it may take.",07Mar2020,1
840,"about 4 hours ago, my best friend (whom i live with) texted me with a picture of two birds in a cage in the back of her car, and she said ‚Äúi got birds‚Äù. i was helping my sisters get ready for a wedding at the time, and it shocked me so much i had to sit down.

i have no experience living with birds, however, i find them annoying. my other best friend has an african grey and i find him horrendous, so i don‚Äôt want to own a bird based off my experience w them. i think that if you are the right person for a bird, go you, but me and my best friend (will call her sam) are NOT the right people for a bird, let alone two.

we already have four dogs, and a cat. i have stated multiple times to her that i don‚Äôt want a bird, don‚Äôt like birds, don‚Äôt find them cute, would never own a pet bird. she knows this, however, she got bored this morning and got two birds.

when she came home i was sat in the living room (where you walk into when you enter our apartment), waiting for her. she was super excited and clearly thought of this as just a fun little thing she did that had no consequences. i told her that i didn‚Äôt appreciate her coming home with more pets than we already had. i told her that i wanted to rehome them because they‚Äôre better off anywhere else than here. 

sam got really upset with me and told me she didnt have a problem with me purchasing a borzoi puppy last year, i retaliated with the fact that i‚Äôd done my research on borzois and asked her multiple times if she was okay with me purchasing a puppy, and she was. me purchasing a dog after months of research and making sure it was ok with her and her impulsively going to petco and buying two parakeets are not the same.

sam currently isnt talking to me, she knows i‚Äôm upset at her. i don‚Äôt want these birds because i know we arent good prospective owners for them.

should i rehome them? should i compromise with her and take them back to the pet shop and instead buy another pet that we actually can take care of (ex. fish, hamster, even adopt another cat or dog)? should i keep them against my will to make her happy? i don‚Äôt know what to do, i don‚Äôt want these f*cking birds.

846,"My Mom has a bit of a reputation for being the drinker, she started drinking wine when I was a kid which turned into a glass every day to a bottle everyday with my dad and now my Dad is no longer around up to 2 bottles of wine per night. It's starting to get worrying and I dont know what to do, me and my sister are trying to get her to cut down subtly but she won't and when we try to bring it up in a worried way she just gets really angry and defensive and starts insulting us and trying to compare her problem to minor things we do that really have no comparison. She keeps saying she's not an alcoholic because she doesn't drink all day, I dont know what the official diagnosis for an alcoholic is but she is more than certainly dependent on wine, she's tried cutting down before and its lasted a day before she goes back again, she's tried only drinking one bottle but then she will ask one of us to drive her to get more and if we refuse she tries to drive herself sometimes succeeding which leaves me and my sister at home terrified she wont come back. Ive tried telling her to just drink until she gets the buzz she desires then stop but she seems to just drink until she goes to bed or passes out on the couch. Not only am I worried about her but she's also putting a lot of stress on me and others, not only that but she is a nightmare to be around when she's drunk, she talks endlessly and the second you show a slight sign of irritation she gets all offended and starts yelling at you, today she picked a fight with me and brought up to separate events that happened during the day and combined them together thinking that they happened at the same time making her memory of the event seem a lot worse than it was, when i tried to explain that what she was talking about happened hours apart she accused me of trying to make her feel stupid and like she was an alcoholic. I have barely touched alcohol in my life, i've been drunk 3 times and have only had other drinks when they were forced into my hands at parties or social events so i dont know what the acceptable amount of alcohol is per day but friends and family tend to comment and joke about the amount she drinks as though its considered a lot for them. I understand there are reasons why she drinks and i've tried to approach the subject lightly with consideration towards her but i dont feel like she has repaid the same thoughts towards me and my sister, she's quite happy to allow her self destruction to affect everyone else and refuses to admit that it does when we bring it up.

I don't want to end up like that and ruin my life. I want to have free time and enjoy life. I'm currently 24 and have a full-time job. I'm also working as a freelancer on the side and looking for a new remote job so I can start pursuing my dreams of living in different countries. As you can assume, money is needed though so I can't just live without a job.

I was thinking of getting a part-time job and just enjoy the rest of my days. I don't want a family or anything like settling down so I'm ready to just put my whole time into living life to its fullest. I am a career-oriented person in general but I find that working for 14 hours each day to maintain my job and side passions is just too much and it's definitely taking a toll on me. So I decided to give up on the ""build a career"" thing and maybe just have a regular job. People never really brag about their work achievements when they're old and instead state that their regrets are mainly related to not following their dreams so I'm super cautious not to end up that way.

My mother thought I was overreacting, but I took her to the vet anyway. She was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Shes been having allergic reactions to her medication, so the vet wants to take her off the meds for 2 weeks, and then put her on a diet food, but that apparently doesnt work with most cats, so the next option would be if one radiotherapy, with a very high chance of curing the hyperthyroidism, and givin the cat another 4-5 years of live.

Normally, she works her hardest and produces a high standard of work and I tell her it‚Äôs amazing. However, she handed me this and it was pure crap. A number of the sentences were copy and pasted direct from Wikipedia (which the assignment criteria said specifically not to do). Not only that but the stuff she did paste didn‚Äôt even make sense. It was a lot of drivel and very little substance. 

So I asked her about one part that she claimed she wrote herself, Googled it and the exact paragraph came up. I told her it didn‚Äôt make sense and she could do far better and it was honestly terrible. I didn‚Äôt make her redo it, but she chose to, although she was annoyed with me. I explained how to write a good paper. I told her that she clearly didn‚Äôt understand the material and suggested she read about the topic and watch videos until she fully understood and then start writing.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

I like a lot when he sometimes tell me that I'm bad or naughty. The thing is I'm not bad at all so when we play this little game it doesn't make much sense to me since I did nothing wrong. It feels like I can't fully enjoy it because I know I've been a ""good girl"".

Sooooo, I was thinking, maybe if he went back to his place one evening after work and I made a total mess I would be more likely to feel like I deserve a punishment. I would be just unapologetically chillin there and acting like a brat (Yeah, I got bored so I trashed your place. What you gonna do about it?). He knows I like a hint of BDSM from time to time and he also enjoys it, but is it just a crazy idea? If you're into this kind of stuff, how would you feel about it? Would it cross your boundaries?

And if it's not that crazy and I should try it, how can I make it look like a tornado crossed the kitchen, bathroom and living/bedroom? It's a small studio apartment and I can use the things I brought too (mostly clothes &amp; a lot of drawing brushes/pencils).

In fact, my life is perfectly on track right now. But even though I know it's fine I feel like something is just wrong.

Overview: My parents are unfailingly supportive of me. I'm from a really competitive place where people talk about grades and college a lot, and although my parents would love for me to be an engineer or go into CS or something I told them I didn't want to and that was the end of it. Guaranteed, I want a degree in applied mathematics instead, so it's not like I'm completely disobeying their wishes, but even if I told my parents I wanted to be a history major they'd be there for me.

We're financially upper-middle class -- my dad used to make 300k+ a year but he stopped to pursue his dream of creating a start-up at home, and my mom runs a clothing business from home. My extended family is loaded and we're all very close and put-together so money has never been an issue. It gets to be a little much with my entire family always at home all the time (I have two younger brothers too), but we've had family discussions about work/life balance and my parents respect the fact that I don't always want to be around them. They trust me a lot -- I can send them a quick text saying I won't be home till ten and they'll just let me be. 

In terms of school and friends, my life's going relatively fine. I have a 4.0 and am in the top 1% of my grade. I used to have friend issues due to frequent bullying in elementary school due to a speech issue, but I was put into therapy and the issue is mostly resolved. Ever since that finished itself up I've never had any problems with making friends to a point. Basically, to this point, on paper, my life looks good. I'm an extroverted person, am pretty confident about my intelligence and how I look.

Except I'm starting to think I'm a bit of a workaholic. Maybe it's kind of easy to tell, but I have a little bit of problem with trying to be successful. I feel like I spend way too much time talking about college and money and the future. Maybe I'm over-obsessed with college -- I'm taking all weighted classes, am president of four clubs, volunteer in all my spare time, run two non-profits, etc. When I'm not productive I slip into a cycle of self-hatred. If I sleep more than eight hours a day all I can do is think that I'm wasting time sleeping.

I love my parents but they've always drilled this simple thing into my head: ""you should always be productive"". And that stands at any level. If I hang out with my friends, it's productive because I'm fulfilling a social quota. Studying for school is productive. Watching TV is only productive if it's something to watch for culture (ex. watching TV in French or some other language, or watching The Irishman because people talk about it). Family time is productive. Not that I don't watch Disney Channel reruns to chill sometimes, but I always feel incredibly guilty when I do. I feel like this has completely warped how I act towards everything and everyone. I'm afraid I've started to see people and relationships in my life as checkmarks rather than actual people with real emotions and situations, if that makes sense. 

I don't enjoy what I do for fun. I write a lot, it's my major outlet -- on sites such as ao3. I'm a gigantic Star Wars nerd, I like fashion, etc. And I read a LOT. Mainly philosophy and sometimes fics on ao3 lmao. But I don't get enjoyment from it, I just feel guilty, like I've said. I'm trying so hard to get back into writing but every time I feel like I should be doing something else and just leave my story half-finished.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder a couple of months ago. I went to the doctor, had a random attack, and she felt my heart rate and freaked. Ever since we've gone through standard procedure. My parents aren't okay with the diagnosis. My dad straight up told me that anxiety was just another way for people to justify being weak and unproductive. We've been silent about it from then on. They've been supporting me -- they encouraged me to quit caffeine, work out more, and always give me time alone when I'm having an attack. But they don't really talk about it. It's kind of one of those unsaid things.

I'm constantly anxious, all the time, and I'm just now realizing it. Maybe I've internalized the idea that my life is supposed to be perfect? I'm working 24/7 to get that Wall Street job, I scroll through LinkedIn sometimes just to look at people's lives and network, and I'm just working. All the time. Or I'm guilty. I have two settings: guilty or exhausted. I was talking to one of my friends the other day and she told me that ""everyone aspires to be me"" or some bs -- I spilled to her about my insecurities and told her my plan for my junior year -- I'm dual-enrolling in college, taking an all weighted courseload at high school, still keeping up with all my activities from this year, adding some more, and trying to publish the book I've been working on. She chewed me out, told me that instead of dealing with my issues I keep throwing more stuff onto myself to deflect the issue.

And she's right. Except I can't target exactly what the issue is and/or how to fix it. Are my parents a problem, is the reputation I've built up for myself a problem, am I just a problem? What should I fix? I'm going to start going to a therapist but I'd just like some preliminary help on sorting myself out because I just feel like a privileged asshole talking to people in real life because my problems are so superficial. I'm so privileged that I probably don't have a right to complain about anything -- and I probably come across as a gigantic spoiled brat, and I'm sorry for that.",07Mar2020,1
872,"So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now. I would say our relationship is a good one. It‚Äôs filled with love and we understand each other. She‚Äôs studying computer science at the moment and she‚Äôs supposed to be going away to another state to finish her studies. Currently she only lives about 20 mins away and I don‚Äôt see her as often as I would like already.

I‚Äôm 20 and she‚Äôs 19. I don‚Äôt own a car but she shares a car with her sister. So yea, we barely see each other. I‚Äôm just worried that when she goes away that we‚Äôre gonna drift apart or she‚Äôs gonna find someone better than me. Or she‚Äôs gonna naturally fall for someone because she‚Äôs spending time with them at school. I want her to go, but at the same time I don‚Äôt. What should I do?",07Mar2020,1

876,"I‚Äôm a bi guy who grew up in the rust belt and raised by conservative parents. Because of this raising I am pretty up tight about personal responsibility. Up at college I made a bunch of bi friends and it‚Äôs nice being able to be open about it, however they‚Äôre spoiled and dramatic and it drives me up the wall. But I came home for the first time in months and I‚Äôve lost my thick skin for the conservatism... unfortunately I didn‚Äôt know that until I drunkly went off and said some pretty terrible things to an old friend who was defending their homophobic pastor.
So this is my life my liberal friends lack responsibility and my conservative friends are homophobic. I need to learn to deal with this and need advice
(P.S theres no point in me trying to avoiding homophobs or trumpers because I‚Äôm in construction and it comestibles with the territory) 

TLDR 
I get bothered by things too easily and need advice on how to be one of those people who can look past the worlds flaws",07Mar2020,1
878,"I never had any healthy coping mechanisms, and shit's been hitting the fan recently.

How tf do you cope with things?

I just wanna repeatedly smash my head into a wall, though I wouldn't consider that a healthy coping mechanism.

879,I was talking to my gf and she told me that some old co workers of mine thought I came off douchy. She told me they said it was my tone and that I can sort of sound disengaged when talking to people. What do I do? I thought I was polite and easy going and I try to be funny and nice with people. How do I know if I‚Äôm actually like that or people just don‚Äôt like me?,07Mar2020,1
880,"I am in my early twenties and have been recently coming to terms with my alcohol problem. I had been in denial about this for months until it interfered with my work/financial situation. At the time, I was very depressed and hadn‚Äôt experienced such heavy depression that lasted for weeks. While I know now I should not have been coping with alcohol, I made the dumb mistake of drinking a few hours before work. I always think it will just be one drink but it never is. I did have about three hours before my shift but then I got asked to come in earlier. Again, I had a false sense of judgement and thought that I would be ok to work. 

Well, I wasn‚Äôt. I worked the first hour of my shift intoxicated and tried to sober up. I chose to go to work bc I figured it was too late to call out. I drank water and ordered some food and did my best to hold myself together. My manager wasn‚Äôt around and frankly this would never happen I was just so fucking depressed that rock bottom felt like the only road. I couldn‚Äôt care at all for weeks and I got so scared (well we scared as you could when you don‚Äôt feel anything). I never felt so numb or careless. 

Unfortunately, a customer informed the manager I was incredibly intoxicated. 

I had to go in and have a conversation about what occurred and I just had no point in arguing with him about anything he said because I really enjoy working there and I fucked up and I was just thankful to still have a job. He told me that he was incredibly disappointed in me and that he expected more from me as I have been part of the opening crew for the store. I honestly was disappointed in myself because I let down the first manager I actually have ever enjoyed working for. I let my team down and put my coworkers in an uncomfortable situation. By choosing to work intoxicated, I was very selfish and in retrospect wouldn‚Äôt have done that if it weren‚Äôt for the combination of weeks of depression and my binge drinking. I told him there was no excuse for coming in intoxicated and just owned up to the whole situation. I was written up for eating when I wasn‚Äôt on break, intoxication, and excessive phone use. 

And ever since I have been trying to prove that this was a mistake and it would never happen again. But now I just feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells at work. 

All my hours have been cut, I have the least amount of shifts and hours. I asked for more one week and I got one less shift. I ended up getting called in on a day I requested off and I decided to show up because I figured I have so much ass to kiss I have to just agree to helping out. 

Next day I ended up getting a text message from my boss letting me know that FOH and BOH informed him that I didn‚Äôt do anything last night and I was also on my phone more than I was working. He then sent me a 30 second video that the head chef took of me while I was on my phone in the back of the house. 

And I haven‚Äôt responded because I don‚Äôt know how to approach this at all. In terms of my responsibilities at work, I am shocked that anyone said I didn‚Äôt do ANYTHING last night. I wiped down EVERY table, restocked and wiped down all napkin holders, restocked in general, swept and mopped, threw out all the trash and I literally got told that I chose to not do anything.

I am trying very much not to be upset about this. I want to tell my manager to show me in the cameras last night where I didn‚Äôt do any of those things. But I also just don‚Äôt want to have to work in a place where I do everything just to make sure I don‚Äôt get told I don‚Äôt do anything because I fucked up ONE time just to be told I don‚Äôt do anything. 

I have no idea what to say, I don‚Äôt know if this is too much information. The biggest thing for me though is that I just feel like crying (well I am now) and I would just appreciate something from anyone. I do want to note that I am taking steps towards sobriety and for anyone reading, alcohol/substance issues are no joke and honestly have only led me to having more problems in my life and so much unnecessary anxiety. 

I‚Äôm super sorry that this post is all over the place, I just don‚Äôt know if I should respond to the text messages or just talk to him in person or just keep on trudging forward or fucking quit. 

I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. I have an insane amount of anxiety even posting this.",07Mar2020,1
881,"Me and my best mate have known each other for 7 months now. We both agree like our friendship sometimes feels more than just best friends, more like we‚Äôre dating. The hard bit is that I have feelings for him (he knows) but he doesn‚Äôt have feelings back, and says that he doesn‚Äôt like the fact it feels like we‚Äôre dating. What do I do? Any advice? Thnx",07Mar2020,1
883,I know this can come off as dramatic since I‚Äôm just 17 but honestly now everybody around me has had some sort of experience with dating. I just haven‚Äôt connected with anyone and believe me I‚Äôm not going to date just for status but sometimes I just feel hopeless and to be honest the advice I‚Äôve gotten sucks. Yes I have hobbies yes I have good hygiene. Now I still like girls and still will but I just feel down in the dumps sometimes.,07Mar2020,1
884," My friend is also my ex. We remained as best friends until around two months ago, where we downgraded to being friends. For simplicity's sake, I will call him Bob.

I went to Bob for a lot of my problems with mental health and parents, and he's given me a lot of advice on it. I feel like I haven't really taken steps to actually take that advice and as a result, ended up mentally burdening on top of what he has to deal with in university.

Timeskip to last week, I was about to submit my additional information form for university (I will refer to it as ADF). My English tutor and I had spent a lot of time working on it and it was more or less ready to submit. Bob asked if he could take a look and I thought 'sure, why not' and sent it to him. He made some suggestions that I kind of disagreed with. 

We got in a discussion about the ADF and it spiraled down from there. I told him that I didn't want to continue on this topic because I was already stressed from schoolwork. It spiraled from the ADF to things like ""sticking to my traditional tutors and traditional parents until they have full control over my life"", calling me a coward because I continuously told him to stop talking about this topic, and saying how it's pathetic that ""I can't handle the truth"".

My parents are relatively traditional but I can tell that they're (trying) making an effort to not repeat past mistakes. My English tutor isn't really 'traditional' - I would say she's relatively 'modern' but more practical when it comes to writing.

The conversation continued to spiral down from there, comments about 'true love' and such. The thing that really drove me to block him was when he said that I couldn't look him in the eye 'because he was ugly'.

A friend of mine passed a message from him. tldr, it was about how he was done with the friendship and how I've only given him 'bad impressions of other people'. I admit that I have given him bad impressions of others and need to keep that in check. My friend thinks that it isn't right for me to blame him being blunt towards me otherwise I'd be running in circles again and again. She also mentions that I only care about talking to my friends about how blunt Bob is.

After that message, I said 'thanks.' and thought everything was done. I could go and improve on my personality and just move on in general. 

Recently I went to chat in a discord server and I found that he's made a post about me, saying similar things like how I need to stand up to my parents but in a more 'nicer-ish' way. At the beginning, he mentions about how I've blocked him and that he won't apologize for the things he said. He made no mention about the comments he made about 'true love'/looks and hopes that I have a good future and take the advice to heart.

I agree that yes, I need to stand up to my parents. Most of his comments are indeed true, but after seeing that post on a discord server, I'm becoming confused as to what is 'right and wrong' in this situation.",07Mar2020,1
885,"We all signed a co-lease and moved into a 4 bedroom house. Then things got out of hand. I have anemia and one roommate wanted the house to be 62 constantly because he sweated at night, I would wake up in the middle of the night with heart palpitations. Also, they would come home, eat fast food and then just leave the bags and wrappers lying around, half eaten food still in them- for days, weeks even. Anyway, I complained about this when I invited a friend over for a weekend because I didn‚Äôt make the mess so I wasn‚Äôt going to clean it myself anymore after I had been doing so for the first two months. They said they were depressed. I tried being more assertive and said it was unfair to expect others to live in their mess. They told me I was a dick.

I decided I would show them what a dick I could be.

That‚Äôs when I decided to keep to myself and avoid them at all costs. Only clean after myself. 

Then they started to steal my food. I insulted them and called them all fat pigs, then moved my non perishable food to my room and kept it in a tote. I didn‚Äôt care about calling them fat or pigs, they shouldn‚Äôt steal. 

Then they started to bug me and make sure I was paying rent, I told them to fuck off and worry about themselves. They expected me to keep helping them buy groceries and I told them to feed their fucking selves and that I‚Äôm not responsible for them. 

They spilled drinks on my ottoman which my mother gave me, I didn‚Äôt retaliate I just felt super annoyed and disgusted that they have no respect for other people‚Äôs shit.

One of my roommate‚Äôs dog always shit in my room or my bed, so I then threw the shit in her room. 

Then, probably the worst part, because they kept leaving out food and never taking out the garbage- we got roaches. They infested my PS4, which I took apart myself and put back together and cleaned. I called them all trailer trash and complained to the landlord who totally sided with me and threatened that if they did not clean up after themselves they‚Äôd have to pay for the exterminator. 

They retaliated by saying it was my fault because I still kept food in my room, but I keep it all wrapped in grocery bags and in a sealed tote. I was so pissed I screamed at them and insulted them in every way possible and blamed them for the roaches because they were not there when we moved in. 

And before you say- well, maybe you‚Äôre just the bad roommate? I‚Äôm Switzerland in all of this. I have kept to myself. Only when they tread on me, do I bite. 

I just do NOT understand how they can be so filthy and disrespectful but then somehow find a way to argue about it. It‚Äôs like they think they‚Äôre too good to be blamed for what they do, yet they can‚Äôt stop doing it. I just do not understand.  It‚Äôs not like I come out raging at first, I approach with a civil manner and then they want to turn it into some dramatic episode- which I do not entertain. Idgaf about hurting their egos, they‚Äôre filthy people. This house was beautiful, and now there‚Äôs shit stains on the floor, hair dye on the walls and in the shower, mold on the base boards in the bathroom, roaches in the house, etc. there is literally nothing special or good about them, they‚Äôre all fat, dramatic, unattractive, think life is unfair because all they do is lie around and feel sorry for themselves and refuse to take any criticism or improve and they they just think they‚Äôre so self righteous in everything they do. 

I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end, of course I‚Äôm moving out soon, but I still have two months left here and it‚Äôs been incredibly EMBARRASSING and DEPRESSING. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",07Mar2020,1
887,"This may sound like I just don‚Äôt understand his situation, but believe me, I do; he‚Äôs one of my best friends, so I can assure you, he‚Äôs not gay. He‚Äôs had two girlfriends, and in the past, has also proven to me that when it comes to girls I like, I can‚Äôt trust that he doesn‚Äôt like them, too. There was once that I took a girl to homecoming, and because he liked her at the time, and she could tell, hung out with him the whole time, instead of me. They ended up kissing that night, and when I talked to him about it, he refused to believe that he did anything wrong.
Because of his feminine side, he seems much better at connecting with girls...almost always girls that I like. The girl I like seems very touchy with him, in a way she just isn‚Äôt with me. (Or rarely is with me) and I want to believe that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs like a girlfriend to her, but knowing how he really feels about girls makes him genuine competition...and I feel like because of the way we‚Äôve bonded over the years, and because he knew he hurt me that night, he wouldn‚Äôt do it, again.

888,"TL;DR My husband (Army) drank an entire 12 pack in his barracks room alone because he‚Äôs been working nonstop for 2 weeks straight, 13 hours or more a day and if it wasn‚Äôt for his roommate, he could be dead right now. We live in Korea but I‚Äôm not on orders so I don‚Äôt live with him. The base in quarantined and he‚Äôs not allowed to leave and I‚Äôm not allowed to get on base. How can I help him when I rarely get to talk to him or see him? 

My husband and I live in South Korea. I‚Äôm not on his orders so I don‚Äôt live on base and we don‚Äôt live together. The base is under quarantine and he‚Äôs not allowed to leave and since I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmission essential‚Äù I‚Äôm not able to go on base. We have an 8 month old daughter that I have been taking care of on my own since he got to Korea in January and that‚Äôs been stressful by itself. 

He works in the S1 (HR) and so as of 2 weeks ago, he‚Äôs been working every single day (including the weekends) 13 hours or more due to the base being on lock down. 

Saturday (yesterday), he finished another 0:00-08:00 work shift but didn‚Äôt get off until 1pm. He messaged me at 2pm and said he was going to get himself something to eat and maybe go to a cookout his buddies were having and then to work at 12am. 

The entire day went by and I didn‚Äôt hear from him by 8, so I messaged him and then again several times after that. I was worried. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from him until 3 in the morning when he said that he was up and getting ready for work. He told me he drank an entire 12 pack by himself and passed out. 

I am infuriated and extremely upset. I‚Äôm mad that he would do that, I‚Äôm angry that he didn‚Äôt think to message me whatsoever the entire time he was drinking by himself, I‚Äôm freaked out at the fact that I could have seriously lost him, and I am upset he‚Äôs going through whatever he‚Äôs going through and that I can‚Äôt help him. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt help him, I can‚Äôt see him for.. I don‚Äôt even know how long. I rarely get to talk to him already. 

I begged him to put in for a day off and he said he will, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll grant it. I asked him to not buy anymore alcohol and he said he won‚Äôt. 

I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice on how to help him without being able to see him, and how I should act right now given the situation.",07Mar2020,1
889,"Okay some quick backstory*
I have been very overweight and insecure my whole life. Always. I almost want to say I have 2 personalities in a way ( I hope to not offend anyone by saying that) but I do. At school I get to be who I want to be. Loud, funny, loving, and caring. But at home it's different. 
My mom and I have never been overly close, but due to some very hard and bad choices on my end. We have gotten closer....so I guess a blessing in disguise. I don't know why but I have always felt bad for asking my mom for things. Always. Looking back and thinking about things, my mom at some times would tell me if it wasn't for my brother and I she would be in a different situation. She used to call me selfish, and inconsiderate a lot. I remember those things very clearly. Therefore I do feel like I'm sort of a burden. I try to stay out of her way, not ask her to go out of her way much for me. Or have to do anything that will take away her time if that makes sense. I know she will more than likely complain even though she has gotten a little better over the years.  Also, we have always been without, we have always struggled financially and emotionally with one another. But things have seemingly gotten better though.  Even though I have left some info out, that is basically a little info behind my mom and I. 
The issue: I want to do cheerleading. Insecure, overweight, and preppy me wants to do this. I never go anywhere, I never do anything, I've never played a sport. So it may seem very out of character for me, which it is. But I want to grow some confidence. I am one out of the 2 black girls in my high school, and I'm overweight. But I feel like doing this will help me get out of my shell. Sounds crazy, but I want to push myself to have perseverance and do work for something for once. Bullying will not be an issue or anything along those lines. 
I'm absolutely petrified to ask my mom, tryouts are coming soon. I'm so fearful to ask her to commit to something like this. My mom acts/models for fun...she travles for all of these things. 
I'm starting to become a little resentful because my mom has always gotten to go out and have fun, in her teenage years, her young adulthood, and even now. 
I want to do something. Just one thing. But I'm so afraid to ask. 
Cheer is a big commitment. But I feel like in the end it'll help me to stop being so insecure. Advice on how to ask or how to be okay with her saying no and not be a little resentful.",07Mar2020,1
891,"Hi guys.

I‚Äôm looking to work at a concert next fortnight, and the organisers put out an opening for ‚Äústaff required‚Äù, this was for all positions. You could be working the taps, manning the gates, waitering VIP stalls, Working the kitchens or moving equipment. 

The straws were drawn and I received an email today telling me I had been picked for the prestigious title of janitor. It‚Äôs my job to pick up the litter from the feet of the singing drunks. 

I don‚Äôt mind menial work. I understand how humbling hard dirty work can make somebody. The problem is that I would much prefer to spend my time doing things that would boost my learning. Since I have no experience in any of the roles, I would love to get hands on and put some commitment into it. I love a challenge and i think i have the drive to put my willpower into making anything work. In this case I feel like it‚Äôs wasted.

It‚Äôs like a chicken and egg problem. I think I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do X role due to lack of experience, but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get experience unless I had X role. 

So now that context is given, I‚Äôd like to ask for some advice:

What would you do in position? 

What would you expect the employer to say if I requested a switch?

Do any of you have experience in this type of position?",07Mar2020,1
892,I cheated (i only made out)two weeks into my relationship my excuse is my bf didnt want to date me when i asked him out sorta 10 ish months back. my bf's excuse was that he wanted to meet more girls. well he turned around later and asked me to be his gf and showers me with lots of love. the first 2 weeks i was kinda unsure even tho he really didnt show me any sign of dating other people or anything like that. i got kinda mad that he was with girls physically just a month back were werent dating then so its not his fault but idk im just mad so i made out with a guy when i went to paris for work. then i started getting really guilty bc he just started showering me more love. he allowed me to check his phone even tho i dont show him is. he shows me a lot pf affection in public and is serious about marriage with me. it really hit me that i fucked up when he started having tears in his eyes when i was crying about how my current situation about how i was considering suicide almost. when i mentioned suciide he almost started sobbing but couldnt bc his roommates were in the room. but anyways i feel guilty and i will never cheat again as long as he treats me like this. i wont tell him bc i got a gem and im too selfish to let it back.,07Mar2020,1
893,"To start, I‚Äôm 23. I feel like this is young to be spazzing about such a subject but hopefully someone will set me straight. 

Since I was in grade school, I always felt lazy. I would never keep my room clean, do my own dishes, get a summer job, I wouldn‚Äôt even study tests or final exams. 

‚ÄúLazy‚Äù is a character trope I have that seems to be progressively getting worse and worse. In my adult life, I‚Äôm too lazy to cook so I buy fast food, I‚Äôm too lazy to go to work 5 times a week so I call in sick at least once a week, I spend the little money I have on useless things, I‚Äôm barely making my bills on time, I don‚Äôt shower for a few days at a time and I‚Äôve got 4 cavities filled since I was 18 because for as long as I can remember, I‚Äôm too lazy to stand there and brush my teeth! 

I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me, I want to be able to take the hard road that is more rewarding rather then someone who takes shortcuts and gets nothing as a result. 

When I was 16 I broke up with a girl I still love to this day (We‚Äôre still close friends). I broke up with her because of family drama - parents got divorced, I made things a lot worse; that‚Äôs enough to share. I strongly feel that if I got over that rough bump in the road then the two of us would not only be together now but look at getting married. I‚Äôm seeing her less and less now and last I heard she found a new girlfriend.

3 of my friends are getting married, I‚Äôm a bridesmaid in all of them. 4 friends are waiting for the right moment. an here I am single since high school.

I moved in with my grandparents when I was about 7ish. Give or take a few months. I watched abuse happen for years and I just grew up in a bad home when I was living with my mom and dad. That has affected me now too. I don't want to say I have depression because I always feel dramatic but I do. I have social anxiety and I sweat like crazy sometimes because I'm around people. I used to be overweight and I lost it very unhealthily. I didnt eat and I exercised a lot. My grandparents now bug me ALL the time about eating and make so many comments on it. Always tell me I'll die if I dont start eating (I have) they think I'm now ""fixed"" because I had therapy. In reality I'm worse than I ever have been. They make comments on how I never do anything and I'm lazy. Recently I have gone through an episode where I don't really shower much or clean my room or even come out of my room much. I don't shave or anything. I sometimes eat but sometimes I decide I just dont feel like getting up. 

That's a big confusing mess, I'm sorry. I just feel as confused with myself and my feelings and why I feel hurt by what they are saying. I'm asking for advice on how to deal with the comments and self confidence.  If anyone has been through any episodes like this, how did they get out? And could you give advice on how? I'm honestly as much of a mess as this post.",07Mar2020,1

The arguments are sometimes my fault and sometimes her fault but they usually end with her blocking me and me being miserable until she reaches back out to me a day later. My depression has gotten so bad that I just stopped going to my college classes and did nothing but stay in my room. 3 days ago I was on the phone with the girl and we had a huge argument and that argument mixed with my fear of what my parents would say when they found out I was failing school drove me to the point of saying some suicidal stuff. The girl ended up calling the police and then blocking me on everything. I went to a rehab facility for a bit and I'm on some new medication. My parents were very loving and welcomed me back at my home (I'm 21). I know that I need to cut her out and I mostly have but I'm still leaving strings attached and she's on my mind all the time.

She was just in an extremely abusive relationship. We moved to a different province with this guy and when they broke up we had nothing. My mom got us out of that relationship and we are in a new house and have cut all ties with him. I feel like recently her depression has been getting worse. She is on medical leave right now because of the medication she has been taking and she‚Äôs been off work since June. Because she‚Äôs not working she‚Äôs making 67% of her income. Barely enough for us to get by. She doesn‚Äôt have the money to see a therapist. The only reason she can see a psychiatrist is because GWL is paying for it. The last 4 weekends in a row have gone horribly. Something bad has always happened. The last weekend was the worst. I walked out of the house. I left it and went to a friends for a few hours. I called her mom, my grandma and asked for help because I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I came back and we seemingly made things ok. Now today she asked for some help around the house. Ok easy. I cleaned the cat litter, cleaned my room, dealt with the front mat, emptied the dishwasher and offered to do the dish rack and take out garbage and she said no it‚Äôs ok. So I did the sweeping. At this point all that‚Äôs left is to sweep and deal with bathroom stuff. So she goes up to help my sister and I start sweeping the house. I finish upstairs and am working through downstairs. I‚Äôm half done the living room when she gets mad at me for going too slow. So I speed up and try and go faster but because I‚Äôm trying so hard to appease her by going faster it doesn‚Äôt get done as well which pisses her off even more so now she‚Äôs like fuck it just just fuck off you never help anyways as usual I should‚Äôve just done it myself and she goes outside to smoke. Ok fuck whatever. I finish sweeping the kitchen but it‚Äôs still not good enough. She comes in and starts freaking out about how I‚Äôm never helpful and all I do is take the easy way out and I‚Äôm trying to stay calm but all I think is she‚Äôs overreacting. But I know saying that only pisses her off so I try and stay calm. Eventually I say I know you‚Äôre upset why don‚Äôt talk about this later in a calm matter where you aren‚Äôt so angry. ‚ÄúSure whatever fuck off‚Äù so I leave and she comes up saying how I broke her and have stripped her of all hope and i betrayed and then she leaves and I follow her trying to fix this mess and she goes outside and I try and help but now she‚Äôs getting really depressed saying how she‚Äôs worthless and she has no reason to live and I treat her like a doormat by not appreciating her. Eventually we go back inside and she sits on the couch continuing to be either depressed or angry. She goes back and forth saying how she‚Äôs worthless to I‚Äôm a horrible kid. Then she gets up to do laundry and starts crying saying she‚Äôs totally alone and nobody cares about her and this whole time I‚Äôm trying to be calm and say I appreciate her I do care I‚Äôm not trying to hurt her but it does nothing so eventually she tells me to go so I go upstairs and I‚Äôm now on the verge of crying because I don‚Äôt know what to do about this.

My friends are all moving and I wonder if we are close enough as friends to continue talking/hanging out after we graduate and move. I fear that soon after graduation they will continue being close friends without me because I have some different interests and can't really be bothered with social media.

i‚Äôm a 14 year old girl, my step dad is 40. he married my mother when i was 9. he‚Äôs been making inappropriate jokes when we‚Äôre alone, he‚Äôs always been doing that ever since i hit puberty.
-
 just a few examples: a week ago or so i was laying on his bed watching tv with him and i was trying to do yoga poses, and my legs fell down and i was laying on my back with my legs slightly spread, and he just said ‚Äúthat pose is good for going in deep‚Äù and i was just like oh. i was kinda creeped out but all i did was laugh
-
he always makes sexual jokes or talks about sex but i go along with it and i think that‚Äôs the reason why he won‚Äôt stop, but i am honestly kind of creeped out at this point..
today he told me he had a dream about having sex with someone, and i asked him who, and he said ‚Äúa woman‚Äù and i just went out of his room.

yesterday i used my electric razor thing to shave my eyebrows, and the bottom part vibrates when it‚Äôs on, and my step dad jokingly said ‚Äúyou could use that to masturbate haha‚Äù

909,"I would post this in the actual subreddit for my disorder, but I do not want to hear ""quit immediately"" or ""get out of there"" . I do not need to be coddled.

Not even sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes.

I'll be as blunt as I can; I have dissociative identity disorder. Put simply, multiple people with their own consciousnesses, thoughts, and feelings all live in one body together. We switch between personalities based on certain triggers, and on good days we can control who is controlling the body. I am only one of 32 of these people, and I am not even the 'original' one.

Anyway.

At my workplace, we have autoplayed ads between songs, for promotions and policies in the store. Usually they start with music or a jingle, then the dialogue plays, then the next song plays.

Recently, the old ads we have been hearing since our hire in 2017 have been replaced by new ones. They're mostly fine, but there's this one that always causes us to switch, and I mean every single time, because of its loud and abrupt doorbell sound at the beginning. We don't know why it's causing us to switch, but it is and we can't stop the ads from our position.

These ads have been playing for one week, and still we are finding ourselves switching whenever the ad plays. Some of us have tried shifts where we force ourselves to not switch, but forcing it like that is causing major headaches, disorientation, and general confusion. In other bad cases, we have gone unconscious or otherwise unresponsive due to a forced switch. We obviously don't want that to happen to us...

We are working as a store supervisor. It is a permanent position and we otherwise like this job. It isn't easy to just up and walk away from this position. Our work performance hasn't suffered yet from this constant switching, but I'm sure it will start to soon if an alter (person within the body) who does not like to be in control, is suddenly thrown into the drivers seat.

We just don't know who to contact, what to do, or how to strengthen our resolves. We aren't even sure if this counts as a medical issue or a personal issue. What can we even do in this situation? Who do we complain to? Would we get fired for even having a disorder like this, in our management position?",07Mar2020,1

 The first year of school, I didn't have to care about what subjects there were, simply because I couldn't really fail. This year came with ""harsher"" teachers, that literally boast about failing students who didn't lick their asses or were obsessed with the subject. Now I am far from any of those two types of people. But I've learned to separate school and myself, so I gave myself the goal to complete it but not do anything more than I have to.
 And here comes the problem, I don't exactly ""click"" with one of my teachers and I can't really talk to him without being nervous or generally just not myself and completely braindead. That wouldn't be a problem, if he just gave us tests and graded us by them, but he grades us mostly by vocal exams, which were always very difficult for me, and with this person, they are impossible to pass.
 Even if I fail, I couldn't avoid this teacher because he is the only one that teaches that particular subject.

We started our relationship about two years ago when she was very desperate to find a friend because she was alone. In the beginning things were great but with time when  she got more comfortable she started to show her worse sides that I knew nothing of, like racism and homophobia. Those are things I don't want to have anything to do with, but everytime I confront her about these issues she says she doesn't want to talk about them and that she knows they are bad but that's just who she is (???). Apart from that she is also the biggest pessimist I know like literally she will see the negative side in everything, I don't think there is a thing in this world she won't find a negative side of. Many people have told me that they don't know how I manage to deal with her because she just ""spreads the negativity all around her"". But on the other side I know that she is a good person inside and the reason she acts like that is because of her abusive parents and the fact that she hates herself. When she has a good day she can really be amazing but sadly most of the time she has bad days. I try to help her and I have suggested that she could go to  a therapist and at first she said that its lame and only losers who can't deal with their own shit go to a therapist but then she changed her mind and gave it a go, but no one can help someone who doesn't want to change.
