4,"This is a long post because it’s very multi-faceted, but I will separate it into sections for ease of reading.

**Background**

I’m a 22M, turning 23 in May from the United States. I typically avoid casual human interaction outside of my three friends I made in high school and my girlfriend, due to a collection of negative events that have happened to me in the past. I don’t really have any hobbies, outside of gaming. A year after I graduated from high school I moved out of my guardians’ house to a cheap apartment and attended our city’s community college. I graduated from this college with Associate’s degree in 2018. Near the end of this year I ended up quitting my job due to a suicide attempt and had difficulties finding another. Couldn’t afford to renew my lease for 2019 so I had to move out and live with my girlfriend and her family, luckily they were so gracious. That’s basically where I’ve been up until now. I found a job that I enjoy that doesn’t make me interact with people as much as my previous ones...doesn’t pay enough for me to live on my own, or get health insurance.

**It started with Calculus**

It started with when I started college. I chose my major as Computer Science because I’ve had exposure to computers since I was 4, so I thought it’d come naturally to me. I didn’t know what career I wanted just yet, but I thought id figure it out eventually.

First semester went fine, did pretty well in my courses, especially Trigonometry. But then my next semester came, and this is when disaster struck.

Next semester I had to take calculus, which as some of you may know, is required for computer science...three years of Calculus to be exact. On top of that I also had to take a physics course that used calculus. Anyway, I thought: “no big deal, Math was always my strongest subject, and I did well in Trigonometry.”

Well, I ended up failing my first test. I was demoralized, this was my first time ever failing a test. I didn’t realize how much I was misunderstanding the material until that point. My aversion to human contact made me scared to get tutoring, so I persevered and just thought “maybe I didn’t study hard enough”.

Failed my second test, and at this point I lost all my energy for that course, and stopped going.

I switched majors to Information Technology so I wouldn’t have to take Calculus anymore and still be able to get a job with computers.

**Then I gave coding a shot**

Near the end of my associate’s courses, I had to take two introductory programming classes. One was with Python and the other with Java. I really enjoyed these classes and did very well with them, so I decided that I think coding would be a great career for me.

Until I realized...computer science is the major that prepares you for a programming career. 

So I read some places that you can learn to code and get a job without the degree, and I started going that route.

Then I realized that...what I learned in my courses wasn’t enough to make anything. I couldn’t navigate libraries or codebases, I couldn’t even figure out how to make a damn pop-up window. Tutorials were filled with so much tech jargon I couldn’t follow them, and programming communities that I joined were so caustic to newcomers it seemed, and got upset with me for asking “simple” questions.

It eventually got to a point where I lost all energy and interest in working on coding, even though I had enjoyed it so much up until that point.

**What now?**

Now I’m aimless. I hate my life, I want to die every other week, and I know I can change it. 

I’ve made so many changes in the past like trying to learn a second language (an endeavor that ended the same way the programming one did...losing energy and interest), I don’t eat junk food anymore outside of occasions. Never drink soda, have never done drugs. Don’t watch porn. Started exercise routines that’d only last a few months before I...you guessed it, lost interest and energy 

I’ve made a couple attempts to rekindle my interest in coding and German, but it always ends up resurfacing those same negative emotions I felt from before.

I’m at my wit’s end. What should i do?",03Mar2020,1

I have only been snapping with her for about 4 months. She goes to my school. I don't want her to become a bad druggie, it hurts me to know there is a chance she could lose her beauty and become a hard core druggie. And get taken advantage of. I just want to help her.

I don’t know what too do and I hate it. I don’t want to go my whole life being able to do a lot of things but not being the best. I’m really tired of it at this point, and I’m only 15.

I know I want my career to help people, but how will I help people if, once again, I’m not very exceptional at much? I’m pretty darn smart, but I won’t be valedictorian, and I might need the scholarships that being valedictorian could provide.

There is no doubt in my mind that I am in a tricky situation which is why I come to you, friends, seeking counsel.

We sometimes walk together on our way home, about 1/2 a mile for me, 3/4 for her. On these walks it's become clear that we are very alike, and get along quite well. She is going through some very specific things that I dealt with at her age and am now questioning whether or not I should engage her as a friend, rather than coworker, going forward. I certainly have no intentions of anything beyond that, just want to see her succeed in the ways that I wish I did at her age.

Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, if it is I'll delete it ASAP and find a different thread, this was just the closest thing I could find for what I was looking for. 

Okay so I(20f) am turning 21 on sunday. I'm not doing anything major, I am very big on family and couldn't imagine anything better then celebrating with close family members at a nice restaurant with brunch the day of, and then a few friends will be joining me the next day and we will be hanging out and playing tipsy laser tag at main event. I was going to do something just with my friends but it's also spring break and most of my friends are from out of state (and going home) or are coming home from out of state (and won't be back until sunday night which is why I'm celebrating on monday with my friends, but I wanted to do something on my birthday so I'm hanging with family)

I'm not big on large parties or going out but I do want it to be memorable so I may go out with my cousin and some friends sunday night since I've never really been to a proper bar or club, just college parties.

Both my parents and my younger sister think I'm making a big deal about this. I haven't really talked about it up until these last couple of weeks because at this point if i didn't get the brunch reservation what little plans I had would be ruined. I try to involve my parents/sister in the planning not because I need their help but I like keeping people informed and I want feedback on my ideas but everytime I try to talk to them about this they kinda laugh at me? Like they think all I want to do is drink but I'm just excited for my birthday and that I get to spend it with them.  When I try to explain why I am so happy they just kind of roll their eyes at me.

This is big for me because last year there was a point in my life where I thought I wouldn't make it to 21. It was very tough for me, to the point I moved back home and now commute to college. My family don't really know why I moved home but I think my mom may suspect it.

Am I doing to much for my 21st? Should I dial it back some or is my family overreacting?

18,"(All I ask is that you please read the entire story before placing judgement...)

I have never really felt different or out of place. I’m a somewhat quite, perhaps shy guy but I’d like to consider myself a pretty normal person out in public. I work a decent job and have a small group of guys I hang out with. I’ve always found girls around my age to be attractive, but I’ve never pursued a relationship. I’ve actually always pictured myself ending up with a slightly older woman if anything.

I have never had an attraction towards minors of any age until this. I suppose that I may have unwillingly found an older teen (16-17) to be ‘cute’ or good looking but that’s are far as it would go. If I knew or assumed they were underaged, I’d automatically back off and resist at even looking at their photos. 

I don’t really know how to describe what is happening. I discovered this 5 year old girl on Instagram (account is run by her mom) and didn’t think much of it at first. The account is very popular with a few million followers, they appear to live a very public life. Some mutual followers had liked her posts and I would always see them. 

Over time, I gradually realized that I had developed an attraction towards this young girl. I was thinking about her at night, I was dreaming about her, I just couldn’t get her off my mind. I got off Instagram for a while in hopes that it would clear my mind but I continued to see visions of her and eventually came to the realization that I was attracted to her. I was just disgusted with myself when I realized this but I couldn’t stop thinking about her no matter how hard I tried. 

It has gotten a lot worse over the past several months. I ended up getting back onto Instagram and I’ve resorted back to the young girls page. I’ve become infatuated with her. I check everyday for new pictures of her. I’ve tried everything - deleting my Instagram, blocking her profile, ect. I just cannot resist.

Despite my growing attraction towards her, I remain to have no feelings towards any other minor. I feel so odd and almost wish I did have an attraction to other minors. At least then I’d have a more clear answer on what is wrong with me. Even if I tried, I couldn’t find myself to be attracted to another five year old girl. She’s the only one who makes me feel this way. 

I want to make it clear that I would never act on my emotions. I have clearly never watched any sort of child porn and never would. I’ve never felt any sort of urge to sexually assault anybody, adult or minor. I am not a predator.

Obviously I haven’t told anybody of this publicly. I have already ruled out going to counseling. I understand that they are held to a confidentiality agreement, but it would still be far too painful and humiliating for me to reveal my dirty laundry to someone face to face. Regardless of confidentiality, they would always put my face and ‘guy who’s attracted to five year old girl’ together. I just cannot find myself doing that.

I recently found an anonymous support group and perhaps I will find the courage to interact with some of the people over there. At this point I feel it’s my only true hope.

All that being said...

What has happened to me? Am I a pedophile? How can I get help without physically having to talk and reveal all of this to someone? Please don’t judge me too hard. I already feel like a disgusting pervert writing all of this but I had to let it out somewhere and hope that maybe someone could help me out, if even in the slightest way.",03Mar2020,1

26,"It's one of those emotional days for me. Sorry guys or gals. 

BG info about me: 

\- Never been in a relationship. (currently 19 years old; female) 

\- High school friends were toxic; excluded and left me...I should of picked up on the obvious clues   
before but...when you really have no one you'd rather have anyone.  

\- Have been hit on before but eventually got the ""She's boring"" ""I only like her because she's   
pretty"" ""Maybe she's actually a trans""  comments or ""She looks like a virgin"" ""She's a golddigger""   
from random passerbys...which tbh crushes my heart and soul atm. 

\- Most of the guys who show interest in me just want to hook up...lol even my crush which tbh   
appalled me at first b/c I think I thought too highly of him at the time (he asked me for a ""fucky   
sucky"" on his friends insta story with a smirk)...or already have girlfriends (which I DO NOT want   
to be a part of after finding out + this fact hurts me even more)

TL;DR:  I don't know my worth anymore...will hooking up validate me or make my confidence feel a bit better? AND do guys gossip about hooking up/slander the girl for giving it up...I don't want to be hurt any more.

Also, any advice when you're a quiet and relatively conservative girl who has recently developed a high sex drive? 

Sorry, I'm really lost and confused rn...I probably sound very contradictory rn. I need guidance. F@\*K 

Note: Please don't send me to a guidance counselor...I had a bad experience where I tried to open up when I used to feel like I was depressed/socially anxious; I am not ready to give it another shot atm.

42,"Hello! Sorry to be posting about something quite small when many here are asking about life-changing scenarios. I am just feeling a lot of weird, mixed feelings. 

TL;DR signed up for 3 downhill skiing lessons with a handful of coworkers. The first one was okay, they just had us on the little bunny hill and i was very nervous but not scared. The second one, they forced us to go on a ski lift and down a much steeper hill, I was scared and upset the whole time, cried at multiple points, and wanted to leave. I kept telling myself ""just this one thing, then I'll excuse myself and go wait inside instead of participating the rest"", except I would always chicken out and do the next thing too, and then the next, and the next. I'm thinking of just skipping the third lesson though.

Pros of going: It's a sunk cost (probably can't get my money back), it will probably be the last time I ever ski in my life because like hell i'm going to pay $80+ to go on even steeper slopes at a real resort, facing fears can sometimes be good, I'll get better by practicing, one of my other coworkers is also nervous and we can be buddies.

Cons of going: Probably stress and embarrassment, could spend the day with another friend instead, facing fears is only good if it's about personal growth and since this is not a skill I care about building, it will basically just be 2 hours of unnecessary discomfort, they might want us to do even scarier things this time, and when its over i think most of the group wants to buy a full day pass (you get a discount when you ""graduate"" the lesson program) and go on the real slopes, which I definitely won't do.

We closed a small business we owned and moved to China. My wife received a great job opportunity and we are now in Shanghai, China.  As you know, the Coronavirus is halting normal life as we know it from going back to normal after the Spring Holiday. We are now counting a month of quarantine and except for the few opportunities to leave the apartment, we are stuck in here.
WE came here with 2 dogs and we somehow managed to get stuck with 2 adopted cats we found (separately within a 2 week period) and rescued from a sure death. Right before this Coronavirus started, we brought in 2 foster cats (Awesome cats that are looking for a forever home-if anyone is interested) and so we are stuck here with 4 cats and 2 dogs.
So the bottom line (before you even ask), we cant (or won’t) leave here without the animals and because of the situation, we just cant leave.

The advice...
My wife is going nuts in here. She is somewhat claustrophobic and to add to that, she gets very frustrated with here work situation. (To long to explain here) She is losing her mind and I try to do what I can and know to help her mental situation but it seems like a lost battle and it effects her, me and the animals.
Does anyone have a good solid advice or even a suggestion of what can I do to help alleviate her stress and anxiety?",03Mar2020,1
46,"Hey guys, I know this is a touchy subject for some. 

Let me start by saying this is not an easy thing to even CONSIDER. I don’t have a support group. Both of my parents are dead and my sister passed 2 weeks before my wedding. 

My husband has a very bad habit of putting more of himself into his job than into his family, so I am often very lonely and I am very isolated where we live. We moved for one of his job promotions and I am not one to go out and seek friends. 

I’ve gone days without hearing/seeing from him. I’ll cook for him so he could have a meal when he comes home and he doesn’t eat it. I’ll make sure he has clean work uniforms (work requirement) and he never says thanks or does it himself. 

I think it is also important to say that I work full time myself. I’m a corporate accountant. He wants kids, but I don’t want to do all the work. I’m getting my IUD put back in because I refuse to be a single mother. 

Personally, he’s a good guy, he’s a good guy who’d give you the shirt off his back, but that’s the problem, he gives more to work and friends than he does to himself and his marriage. 

It’s been like this for years and he refuses to acknowledge it. He just goes silent and leaves the room. I don’t know what to do.",03Mar2020,1
47,"Last year around October me and my very close friend stopped talking ever since she met a new person. Ever since her new friend and her started talking, she ignored me. This girl and I go way back, ever since I loved here we have been best friends. So she started ghosting me. I tried to talk to her but she became so distant it was hard. This school year we only had one class together. And she switched out randomly and then after that we stopped talking and we were assholes to each other. I don’t know if she’s exactly happy or anything but I just want her and I to be friends. We both are so stubborn. We’ve had fights in the past and I’m always the who has to make up even if she’s in the wrong. Anyways I don’t know if I should make up with her and if I do I wouldn’t even know how to start.

49,"Heyo.
My friend recently got out of a relationship. He’s a gay male and he’s 18. 
They were together for a couple of months. 

Now... my friend falls too hard too quickly and often expects too much from his boyfriends which leads to arguments. Friend complained about the boyfriend a lot. He was worried the boyfriend was “emotionally cheating” on him by spending more time with his lesbian best friend. 

Boyfriend broke things off by explaining he was going through some things at the moment and needed to work himself out. He initially said he didn’t want to end things but they agreed to anyway. 
My friend is crushed. Recently, I think he’s suffering from depression. It’s been a couple of weeks since they broke up and friend still isn’t doing any better. He’s going to college but he’s falling behind in work and has told me he’s unhappy all the time. I don’t know what to tell him since I’ve never been in a relationship. 
He’s also begun smoking weed and wants to get my name tattooed on his arm and get lip fillers. I think he’s going through some post-breakup meltdown. 

What do I do? I want to be a supportive best friend but he won’t see a therapist and I fear his depression will escalate. His family aren’t very supportive.",03Mar2020,1

But yesterday she got asked to prom by another guy. I asked her if they were dating or talking or something along the lines of that and she said they're just going as friends, with a group of other people. I asked if she was sure and she said ""I wouldn't be talking to you if I were dating someone"".

I know it might seem obvious to someone else, but I genuinely don't know what to do or how to react. Is it okay for me to still ask her out, like on a date, if she's going to prom with this other guy just as friends and in a group of other people?",03Mar2020,1
54,"My parents have been together for years. They had two children: my older sister (21) and me (18). They used to be very close and would often do lots of things without us kids. Every other weekend they’d go out for a date night and we would watch movies or play games with a babysitter.

When I was 10 or 11, my father was laid off from his job. My mother was and is a SAHM so we had to cut back on restaurant meals and other events. This also meant that their date nights were put on hold. While my dad wasn’t working, he spent almost all of his time at home. At first, my mom didn’t really mind it. But she began to complain to me about his behaviors at home. She said he was always cleaning things if she walked away for even a second, always asking what she was doing or where she was going. She said she knew he was just being inquisitive but it was “driving [her] crazy.” 

Well, my father found another job around a year later. We started going out to restaurants a bit more, we were able to go to the movie theater, and we started going on occasional vacations. We were never in financial danger, but now that my dad had a job again, we had a lot more wiggle room than we did before. But they didn’t resume their date nights. I thought nothing of it. But I did enjoy having nights just with my sister, so I was a little disappointed. Again, didn’t really think anything of it at the time. 

My dad started out his new job by going to an office building every weekday. 9-5 job, standard deal. But after a while he started working from home some days. He would have back-to-back conference calls in the morning, so driving to the office building wasn’t practical. At first, it was only a couple days each week. But as of last year, he no longer goes to his office and works at home every day. 

My mom still complains about his questions and his “obsessive” (her words) cleaning habits. But it feels like it’s gotten worse. They argue quite a lot, and I know it’s normal for couples to fight, but it feels like they argue more often than not. It’s always over trivial things, such as my dad turning the TV off without asking my mom if she wanted to watch anything. She acts really annoyed with him and gets a very cold tone in her voice. I don’t know if she actually is annoyed at him in these situations, but I know that he feels like she’s annoyed (he told me when I asked him once). She complains to me that he never takes her out on dates. When I suggest she ask him, she says that he sounds reluctant and she doesn’t think he wants to go, and then says he and I should go out for dinner without her. If I suggest that he ask her to go out by themselves for dinner, she once again thinks he doesn’t want to, or she thinks it won’t be fun since all they will do is go out for a meal, sometimes go see a movie at the theater, and go home. 

I don’t feel like my parents are always fighting, but it feels like things have gotten worse. My sister goes to university out of state, and I’ll be moving away for uni in the fall as well. I’m hoping they’ll be able to enjoy their time together but I can’t help but worry that they will only continue to argue. I don’t know if I should tell them how it feels like they are arguing consistently. I don’t want to make them upset. But it’s uncomfortable to be around, and it happens most nights. My mom tends to yell (not always on purpose, she is a VERY loud person by nature) and my dad gets a bit huffy and goes quiet. It’s tense and I can’t sit there while they act like that to each other over what feels like trivial things. Part of me worries that it will only get worse when they have no kids in the house as buffers. I don’t know if I should talk to them, and I need some advice.",03Mar2020,1
55,I met this guy a short time ago. We would flirt everytime we saw each other. Eventually we found each other on social media and then started talking. For the first few weeks it was great and we would see each other through work and text a lot. Then he started to get distance and stopped coming in. I would reach out which would lead to a small conversation and him eventually just leaving me on read. He still follows me on social media.

56,"On mobile so sorry in advance.

A bit of backstory, my dog (8lb min-pin) goes to a dog sitter 2 days a week. Boyfriend drops her off in the morning and I pick her up in the afternoon. We only have one car and he needs it to commute so I take the bus.

I was taking Pumpkin (the dog) home when we get off at our stop. This particular stop tends to be crowded due to it being a ""Junction"" so there is about 3ft of walking space between the street and people standing waiting. We get off the bus and start walking when she paused for a moment and this guy said ""Get that dog away from me or im going to kick it.""

What was I supposed to do? I pulled her away from him and asked him wtf was his problem was. I was upset but I quickly got away and didn't know how to react.

Fast forward to today, that jerk got on the bus one stop before I got off. I know he recognised me, he did all he could to not make eye contact and I had daggers in my eyes. Then I got off the bus.

Should I confront this guy if I see him again? I thought about taking his picture and posting it somewhere, I live in Seattle and people love their dogs. I don't know, im not much for confrontation and I don't take this commute unless im with Pumpkin and I don't want to chance her getting hurt.

59,"I know this sounds weird, so bare with me.
I (23F) grew up pretty poor and I remember being made fun of for it. My mom worked really hard and my dad blew through all of her money, even opening up credit cards in my sisters names and destroying their credit before it was even established. 

Anyways, I didn’t grow up with much but my mom always did her best. I’ve worked since I was 17 and have paid for everything myself since then. I moved about a year and a half ago, and I work in a veryyyy affluent area, but I don’t make very good money myself.

I often find myself thinking very ignorant thoughts towards people with money or who appear to have money. For example, if I see someone driving an expensive car or who lives in million dollar homes, I think “oh I bet they think they’re better than me because I only drive ___ car” or “they’re probably rude”

I realize this is a very toxic and ignorant way of thinking but I know a lot of it stems from jealousy and I don’t know how to stop.

**Everything is great on paper.** So many people would kill for what you have. You were brought up in a wealthy household, with a loving family (imperfect but loving), in a beautiful and safe place, but you are still so unhappy. 

You’re living among the top 0.01% of the world. You have all your needs met and you’re on a path to having fuck-it-money in Southern California, but you’re still unhappy. 

You have an amazing girlfriend who moved across the country to be with you. She takes care of you and makes you swoon, but you’re still unhappy.

You have amazing hobbies and this helps you keep your mind off of your unhappiness. You have become proficient in martial arts, become a diligent student of yoga and meditation, run a marathon, helped others reach their goals, volunteered, created music, made friends, visited beautiful places, but you’re still unhappy. 

You’re diligent and disciplined in your day to day routine. You take exercise, diet, sleep, and study very seriously. You try to treat your body like a well-oiled machine, but you’re still unhappy. 

No combination of hormones, pheromones, or oxycodone could make you feel more alive. 

You sit in a cozy office every day and run reports for your bosses. They expect results and you don’t mind, because you’re tough, but after a few years, it’s starting to wear you out. 

You feel as though you lack purpose and that most of your days are just part of a long slog that will eventually give you the freedom to do what you really want to do, which is \_\_\_\_\_(really, who the fuck knows?)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_…. 

You sit frustrated because you don’t feel good at what you do and everything is a struggle. You’re tough as nails, but you can only fake liking something for so long. Eventually, you get worn thin. You won’t be able to focus and you will fail. You’re starting to fail even at your best effort. Your heart isn’t in this. You hate the process and all the people involved. Money doesn’t excite you, making a difference does. You want to be the person who gives and expects little in return, to set an example for others that that is the way they should be. 

Your stuck feeling is what makes you want to blow it all up. You want to demolish your life and start from square one in the hopes that you’ll start doing what you like and not what is expected of you. You’ve built up these ideas for yourself of what your professional life should be and it’s causing you to lose your shit. You stay at your job because you believe it’s right, but you need to grow. You need not latch onto people the second they become interested in you. You need to be so bad that you’ll end up around unsavory people at times. You’re scared to break off relationships. You’re not scared to try new things, but you’re scared to end old things. 

You don’t like giving up. Maybe it’s the ‘ole “Anons never quit.” line that’s been ingrained in your head since you were a little boy. You’ve tried to do the “right” thing all your life and it’s made you miserable. Maybe it’s time to do something more unconventional? You’ve always loved improv, acting, radio, and comedy. You’re in the best place in the world for it. You can always fall back on finance, but it’s time to stop wasting your life in something mundane when you can do something extraordinary.. 

**On top of all of this, you’ve got a sexuality problem.** You’ve been in a straight relationship with a wonderful girl for a few years now. You just finally put the pieces together and figured out that you like guys too. She’s sacrificed more for you than you ever have for her, but you feel things dwindling. You want to find out who you are and you need to be sexually free to do it. It feels manic-like you’re burning all the bridges in hopes that the ashes will sprout flowers. 

You don’t want to hurt her, because you love her. There’s a sense of comfortability you get when you’re around a person you truly enjoy. I feel totally judgment-free in almost any conversation that doesn’t revolve around our religion or my sexuality. Unfortunately, that’s going to be a problem if you decide to get married. This is the part of your want to change that makes you feel downright evil. You’re resenting your sexuality and adding shame back into your life because you feel beholden to her because you love her. 

Unfortunately, it isn’t fair for her either. You can’t keep faking this either. Faking your emotions to do the “right” thing is not productive or good at this point in your life. There are no children involved so you almost have a responsibility to change your situation before anyone gets more hurt.  

You’re scared of judgment. You’re scared of judgment from your peers, from your family, from your colleagues. If GF's family knew you were a bisexual, they would hate you. To be honest, you don’t really think gf likes you that much because of it either. You’re terrified your grandparents will not understand and view you as selfish, disgusting, and hedonistic. You’re scared your friends will think you’re weird and hate you. 

You’re also scared of the way you’ve thought about and treated gay people in the past. You’ve dismissed those who have been vulnerable to you and thought of them as dangerous people who could turn you into a socially unacceptable queer person. You felt uncomfortable around them and tried to keep interactions short. You diverted your eyes at any notion of gayness because you were scared of it. 

Those were your thoughts and look where you are now. For those that don’t believe that universal punishment exists, take heed. I’m not sad about the discovery of my sexuality but shocked at how I acted before. I can easily explain it now, but it doesn’t make it okay. 

**Even if all the bad things become realities, it’s not the end of the world.** You will have new love. You will make new friends. You will still force yourself to be around your grandparents. You have an obligation to them “as a grandson” and you will fulfill that obligation. You will never cut the family out because they have always been there for you and you will always be there for them. How I chose to conduct my life does not mean our relationship should be any different. If they love me conditionally, then I shall kill them with love and kindness. I will be the friend, grandson, peer, they don’t deserve but is there anyway, to be an example of what is right. 

**You’re scared of judgment from yourself.** This is probably the worst one. You are your own worst critic. You’re not often willing to give yourself a break. You need to understand when you don’t like something or are being walked on or taken advantage of. You must advocate for yourself respectfully and frequently if you have proof you are being done wrong.

You are teaching those around you valuable lessons. You will do it with love. You will not leave people out to dry.

77,"I am a young adult wanting to go into the veterinary field. I have had 3 jobs in the field, the first two lasting about one year each, and then the one I'm currently at.

I am not going to focus on what happened at my first two jobs, but rather what's happening at the current one because history seems to repeat itself.

I recently took a job as an assistant having no real tech experience yet. I told my employer this upfront and she was fine with it. I try very, very hard at this job because I enjoy the work and want to be in the field. I got about a week of real training and then was pushed out on my own. I thought things were going great my first two to three weeks, but suddenly during week 3 it seemed like no one liked me and I was being banished to doing all of the cleaning tasks. 

I did the tasks with a smile and never complained about it. I was still friendly with my coworkers and backed off of talking to them as much because I thought maybe I was being annoying... Every mistake I made started getting publicly yelled out at me, but I would apologize and explain why I had made the mistake (if applicable). Then I started getting yelled at for things that I hadn't been correctly trained on. I said I wasn't correctly trained and apologized and asked to be shown correctly. I would immediately be asked who taught me, but couldnt always remember because I had had so many people teaching me so many things. I was later accused of lying.

 Now I am being accused of doing things I did not do. When I defend myself I am lying. I have been chastised by the boss for it now. I have explained that I have been trying my best but I am being asked to memorize in one month what people go to school for two years for and that I am frustrated.

I don't really care if they like me... I just want to not feel like my job is in jeopardy all the time. What do I do?",03Mar2020,1

79,"The title says it all. I'm a female about to turn 30, I'm having the usual pre-30 freak out but mine is a bit more loaded than many as I have spent the majority of my 20s unwell and they've been the hardest years of my life, *by far*. People around me are entering new phases of their lives, having kids, getting married, buying houses - none of which I particularly want, but I feel like I haven't had a chance to be 23 yet, let alone feel ready to be so ""grown up"". 

On top of all of this, I have *crippling* nostalgia/Peter Pan syndrome. The older I get the more I long for the 13 year old girl I once was, so full of hope and excitement for what life ahead might hold. I had no idea how horrible, painful and difficult life would turn out to be. I wish I could go back to that. I've been re-watching my old favorite TV shows and listening to my old music from that age. I constantly long for the old friends I had, places I went, things I did, the person I was. I just cry, ALL THE TIME, for that little girl, and what I would tell her to do differently. I'm still unwell now, have almost no social life and I'm really lonely. I recently tried to reconnect with my old best friend from when I was around 12-13 and she didn't reply. People have moved on. Everyone seems to find it so easy to just grow up and let go. I really don't. I really, truly still feel like a teenager. It's embarrassing to say it, but it's true. I can't even imagine my personality, the things I like, my hopes and dreams and the way I look translated into adult world. It just feels wrong. Sometimes I wonder if I should just duck out altogether, so I can be forever young in peoples memories and never have to face more of the cruel ravages of time. Hell, perhaps I'd get a chance to be 13 again. 

Is this really abnormal? Does growing older ever get less... sad? It's just constant heartbreak. What can I do to accept the progression of time? I feel incredibly alone. I used to be so wise beyond my years as a teen. Illness really fcked things up for me. Thank you for reading.",03Mar2020,1

so i want to come out as bi to one of my friends (a girl) and don’t want her to feel weird around me (i’m a girl too.

in my friend group of all super straight girls (who i have not come out to) there’s an inside joke where i’m a big flirt and “flirt” with one of the girls (i do a lot of winking and make flirty statements) there’s no feelings involved.

so we were playing a game of truth or dare and i was asked if i liked someone on campus and i said maybe. everyone was like oooooo and was trying to get a name out of me. i gave them the first letter of her name and they were all guessing guy names. i wouldn’t budge. they’re all religious (my parents are religious anti-lgbt so i’m scared of being out around any religious people)

when we all separated for the night, the girl i fake flirt with kept pestering me for the name and why i was afraid of telling her, asking if she knew “the mystery guy”. i told her i’d tell her later. i want to tell someone but i don’t want her thinking i’m coming out because i have feeling for her and for her to view me differently. i REALLY don’t want her to tell anyone else or for her to feel uncomfortable around me.

how do i go about telling her or should make up a lie?",03Mar2020,1

91,"I'm 16F and I live in the US. I met my friend Q through a school program and she 15F lives in the Netherlands. A couple of months ago Q told me she was starving herself and refused to admit that it was anorexia. 90% sure that it is as I had another friend get hospitalized from it and have seen plenty on it in news and interviews with people who had it and she was saying all the same things. Q said she could eat and chose not to and that she felt better when the numbers on the scale went down. She also does this when she gets overwhelmed with school for control.

 I suspect Q told me because I don't have the name of her school or her parent's numbers so I can't tell anyone there about what's going on but am her friend so she would have someone to confide in. She's naturally skinny because she's tall and like most dutch people bikes everywhere. \*I'm positive about her identity and trust her, we've met in person once and our friend group met through school

\*\* By met through school I mean my german class got penpals and these girls already were friends with my penpals previously

I'm afraid to tell anyone because then she'll hate me but I can't not do anything and let it get worse.  I don't want her to get hurt but this friend group is the only one I've had that hasn't become abusive and I know it's selfish but I don't want to risk losing it. So far I've been trying to get her to open up to this to her therapist and I've talked to Q about what is going on.

98,"I am so tired. I will try to make sense, things will be skipped and a bit jumbled, I'm physically and emotionally exhausted. 

Started dating a woman, adjacent town. Things were always rocky, we got into fights and arguments constantly. She is a victim of terrible things in her childhood, has problems now as a result in some ways. I only want to be supportive. She ""broke up"" with me many times, always something about what I said or did that was never intentional but somehow set her off in a certain way. Extremely emotional and gets angry easily. Always shouts her anger at me, very free with her emotions that way. Me, I'm mutable, I'm always talking her down, trying to put her at ease and reassure her, explaining how all of the challenges we've faced and made it through only make us stronger. 

I pushed to keep us together. Because I do love her. It's just that now I think we really are incompatible in some ways. Tonight, it seems we are sexually incompatible. Before, it was just the level of emotional stress, and the imbalance in the relationship. Rules don't seem to apply to her, if she's pissed she's allowed to do and say whatever she wants, but not I. There is much incongruence.

Tomorrow we're set to move in together in a new place. She has a young son, who's very fond of me. I know I make them both happy, and I try very hard at that. But I'm dying inside. I think I've somehow ended up lying to myself. Lying about being able to do this with her, to withstand the harsh disparities in the name of love and being supportive. Lying about us getting stronger. I really believed those things at first, but now I'm just all doubt. I hate myself, for what I've done if I can't somehow pull myself together, figure out how to be happy again with this. Because I will have destroyed their happiness if I fail, if I can't go on. But I'm already unhappy, I'm already wishing little moments that pushed us together hadn't happened, wishing I hadn't convinced us both we could make it if we tried. Shame and regret and pain. I'm hoping the morning brings something new. But she's already broken our agreement, she's gone off to sleep in the other room. We'd promised that even if we're fighting, we sleep in the same bed and we sort it out. But I was upset and didn't want to talk right away, and she stormed off. 

I think all this needs to end, but everything's so entangled now. My apartment contract ends this week, we're signing contracts on the new place tomorrow, everyone's expecting things, it's just awful. She is so looking forward to living with me, leaving this terrible old apartment of hers, giving her son a better place, and so on.

99,"So, to understand all the drama, I have to start from the beginning.

One day, the three of us was reunited in a bar, it was the first time she and my gf see each other, we were not in a realtionshitp yet, just going out a lot. Mostly of the conversation was just small talk and rarely we all would talk about the same thing, normally the conversations were going with just me and my best friend or me and my girlfriend on some subject, very awkward tho. 

So, they started fighting about music and languages, and that escalated very quickly, to the point of my friend sending my gf home, telling her to go away and stuff. Both of them get really pissed, my gf just stood up, and walked to the cashier. I followed her and started apologising, she just told me to shut the fuck up, then pay for the beers and ran away. I came back to the table and my friend was having an anxiety attack, it took half an hour to calm her down and shortly after a friend of us showed up on the bar.

Since this, they didn't talk to each other, have never met again and my friend keeps ranting about my gf. Keep saying stuff like ""what a pitty you're going out with her today, so we can't met"" and always saiying shitty things about her. 

My gf don't talk bad about her and has nothing against her, even willing to try to talk again with her and etc.

Fast forward to last week, me and my gf are now living together for almost 4 months, after I hosted a dnd session at our place, we decided to hang out with some friends, including the barbarian of the campaign, just going from one bar to another and drinking on the streets. At some point in the night, we walk pass a group of friends, including my best friend. They change the direction they were going to walk with us, everybody said hello to me, except her, because I was with my gf.

I posted about it on social media and she just said ""You didn't like it? Just cry"" and we haven't talked since this day.

I never liked any boyfriend of hers, not a single one, and never did such a thing, didn't even say something about the people she were dating at any given time, and this behaviour really piss me off. What should I do, redditors?

100,"Firstly I must say this story isn’t recent. This happened several years ago but still has always been in the back of my mind. I received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder when I was 20. I would go through these periods where I’d do really well and excel at things and have a sudden boost in confidence. I just thought I had great energy that day and I was gonna get stuff done. And then once energy started wearing off I would sink into a deep depression. I wouldn’t shower, wouldn’t change my clothing etc. I would take my medication and then both of those episodes stopped but I felt like a zombie and I gained a lot of weight. So after a while I would forget to take my medication once and then twice...till I started feeling my “energy” coming back. During this time I would go out with girlfriends every night. We’d go to the bar, get shit faced and then go to work the next morning hung over AF. I did this for about a year. I was also very promiscuous and would date a lot of guys. Met a lot of guys at the bar. Also met a lot of guys online. But during this time *queue sad story* I also met a guy....for the sake of the story we’ll call him Brad. Brad was different. And good looking. I kept waiting for the red flags to show up but he was really cool. When we met it was instant attraction on both our parts. We hung out all the time. He’d drive 2 hours to see me after work and we’d just walk around. Star gaze. I know it sounds super cliche but we laid in the middle of a football field at a local high school and just looked at the stars. He stayed so late with me that his mom called him to see where the hell he was. Anyways during this time I did have a lot of feelings for this guy and I was severely manic at the same time. I felt great, I was on top of the world. I said “ I love you” once and he said “Baby I think I love you too but I’m scared of getting hurt” I wanted to have sex ALL THE TIME. and talk about it all the time. He enjoyed it for a little while as any guy probably would but then he started to be like “Well don’t you want a relationship with me? All we do is f$&amp;k all the time” which looking back now we did do that a lot. We’d spend ridiculous amounts of money both of us till it got to the point where the whole relationship was toxic. He was also two hours away and we would text and call each other mostly when we didn’t see each other. He’d text me “don’t you care about me” and started asking me if I’m seeing other men. Sick thing is is that I really think at the time that I was doing anything wrong. I thought he was being a dick. So he became distant. Looking back also being medicated probably now is that I really hurt him and I feel terrible about it. More so because not only did I have feelings for the guy too but that I was sick at the time. Timing was wrong. After we broke that off I sank into the deepest depression I’ve ever had. After about two years and a few suicide attempts I got help. Got the meds I needed to become a functional person again. A year after that I met my boyfriend that I have now. We’ve been together 5 wonderful years now and I’m really happy. Over the years this “Brad” has randomly reached out to me by random Facebook message to liking random photos on Instagram. Nothing more than that though. My question for advice would be should i reach out to brad to apologize for breaking his heart and that I was ill and I’ve since gotten help?

Im a junior in high school, 16 years old, and for the better sake of everything in a born female. (I identify as gender fluid).

Theres a group of freshmen boys in the lunch room who sit at the table in front of me and they've been Bullying me and my friends all year.. It started with them throwing food, to water bottles, anything they could, hitting on teachers, but most recently they tried to blow up the microwave in the cafeteria and then a few days later spat lugies onto the table.. I tell the principal, assistant principal, teachers, anyone! But only recently (last Friday, its Monday now) they got in trouble and moved for spitting on the tables. They taunt me, insult me, make fun of me and more.. Ive told anyone who can do something but today I almost couldn't take it.. They sat at their normal table because the assistant principal wasnt in the lunch room today. They kept laughing at me at everything I did.. I got up and bought a snack at one point and I think they called me fat, (im 5'6 and weigh like 117lbs, and i have a past with eating disorders and body shaming.. It doesnt take much to throw me back) im not really sure.. I dont know how much longer I can take this.

What do you guys suggest I do? No one at school will help me or actually do anything.. I really dont know how much longer i can handle this..",03Mar2020,1

109,"She saw it and looked through for a bit in front of me one day. Its not like a diary but I just dont want her to see it. Today after cooking and coming back upstairs I cant find it and searched my room for usual spots i May put it if i wanted to hide it. I texted her if she took it and haven’t gotten an answer yet, then i sent another accusing her because Im mad.

Im so Tired of not having privacy in the house, im an adult in my early 20s and I live with my mother, step father and his step mother.

111,"Throwaway account just in case.. 
On my first day of my internship in a well known company, as soon as i reached the place i was sent to my supervisor, he gave me a quick tour of the place, then we returned to his office, he left for minute and when he returned, he closed the door and asked me ""did you shower today?"" I answered ""yes"". Then he asked ""did you wash your clothes before coming'"", i also answered ""yes"".He started saying that other people have complained of my body odor, he then said ""maybe you put some spices in your food so that's just a natural smell."" I was in shock for a couple of minutes, i always took care of my hygiene and for years i trained/worked with people with no prior incident of someone complaining of my odor. I asked if he does want me to leave so i can clean myself and just come tomorrow, he said no it is not a problem. I spent the whole day trying to smell myself if there is any weird smell but there was nothing. At the end of the day, i returned to him, we had a little chat and i asked about my performance, at the end of it he laughed and started making a ""moving toothbrush"" gesture and then said, ""use a mouthwash"". Again i brushed my teeth and used a mouthwash before leaving, i was embarrassed when i left the building, i thought it was my fault for real, then i called my GF and told her everything, she said maybe he was just trying to show you ""who's the boss"", she also mentioned that it could be a race thing. After that i started thinking about the details of the day and everything i remembered (from interactions with colleagues or
customers)was a proof that i smelled okay, i even remembered that my supervisor kept saying that he is sick and he can't smell a thing (so how did he find my breath repulsive if he can't smell well.) But i don't want to be the kind of person who absolves himself from any wrongdoing and blame others. On the other hand i would swear on my life nothing he said was true and it is really affecting my mentality because i have been thinking about what he said all day. I really don't know what to do, i will be meeting him almost daily for a whole
month,and i have no idea if he was really trying to help or he just want to insult me to show superiority. Any idea how to deal with the situation beside making sure that ""i have a good body odor and use mouthwash""?",03Mar2020,1

115,"Okay so I'm pretty sure chances are if I'm asking this it's probably time but I'm still not really able to cope. I guess I'm not really ready to get patronized by relatives and or strangers because for the most part, my disability tends to be relatively invisible unless it's a bad week meaning I literally can't get out of bed or do anything involving walking for longer than 3 minutes - this gets perceived as me just being a lazy piece of shit. My gait itself is also fucked regardless as to whether or not I'm having debilitating muscle spasms. This happens frequently and lasts anywhere from 10 days to three weeks so needless to stay, it's affected my quality of life severely. I spend most of my time in bed. 

I'm scared that by getting a wheelchair I'm probably going to come across as attention seeking and taking something away from someone who actually needs it even though I know deep down it's probably time but I still can't really come to terms with it because I'm scared of the reaction I'm going to get.",03Mar2020,1

For example: right now my school is on winter break and I wanna stay up late and play some video games on my PC. She won't let me do this and says ""it's bedtime"" at 9:00 and she won't let me stay up later on a video game, she says the only way she'll let me stay up late is if I read a book instead of games.

So I never thought I would post on here, or talk about this at all.

 When I was around the age of 11-14, I had the app kik. I’ve deleted it by now (mostly cause it’s full of human trafficking and catfishes I learned the hard way.) And around this time I was struggling with my sexuality, I was arguing with my family a lot, and I was still coping with the loss of my father.
I talked to many people there, random people girls boys it didn’t really matter to me but most were girls. And it would get flirty and sexual very quickly and being A LITERAL CHILD I believed that meant they liked me and they wanted to be in a relationship with me. They would ask for nudes and I would send them mind you 11-14 under the age of consent, they knew my age. This went on for years and by the end of it I was taking full on videos (masterbating but Was a child I didn’t really fully understand) I was showing my face. And most of not all of the time I would receive videos or pictures back. 
Now the thing that still terrifies me to this day is the last person I talked to and did the kind of thing with. She was a girl (so I believed) and she had a girl as her profile picture and she was really cute. And I started talking to her, I sent pictures and videos and waited for her to send some back. I had asked if she was going too. To which the person running the account told me that she was a he, and the girl in the picture was his ex. And that he had her pictures as well and was using them to get other girls pictures like mine. He told me he was over 18 and that if I didn’t send more pictures he would post them.
I don’t know where he would have done it, but he told me I had 10 minutes to send them. I told him to go to hell and blocked him and deleted the app and at the time I was fine I thought that was final and that it was over. But they was not the case.
 I’m 18 now and I understand I was wrong and that it was a stupid thing to do. I never should have taken the pictures my anxiety has been spiked. I’m always scared that when I go somewhere new someone is going to recognize me from being a child and doing that sort of thing. That it’ll stop me from getting a job and living my life. Nobody in my family knows I don’t think, but my mother and my cousin have both hinted that they know something related. I’ve never talked about it with anyone, and I don’t know if I should. Writing this now is making me tear up because I was a child and I didn’t know any better, because of this my thought process of sex if completely warped and I don’t know what to do. I’m about to graduate high school and I want to leave this in the past but I don’t know if I can.

Though I don’t know the mans name or any of the real names of the people, and I’ve also deleted the account that I used for said purposes, I also don’t have the phone anymore. Is there anything I can do about this? Should I do anything about this? I want to move on with my life but maybe I should figure this out first. Maybe this reddit can help, maybe not, but it feels so much better to actually talk about it. 

Thank you for reading and have a nice day/night.",03Mar2020,1
119,"I really don’t know how to start this off. I have been told that the way I feel was incorrect for years by my mom and I don’t know what to think.  Growing up my mom would never say anything nice to me. Anytime she talked to me it was always about how wrong I was doing something or how much of a fuck up I am. Her favorite line was “ Op, are you an idiot? Ya I think you are because smart people wouldn’t (insert some random thing I forgot) . Everything I did was under laser focus. The way I eat, my walking, you name it. And it wasn’t just criticism it was her mocking the way I was doing something in front of people. She would use the fact of me remembering small things and a say I was choosing to forget things. When I recently confronted her about the fact that I have an actual mental issue per several physiatrist of me having a memory issue she said “Wow so you’re going to use that one now?” I tried to confront her about this in the past and she made me feel like nothing  I was saying was true and made the entire thing as if I was out to get her.

121,"Hello all. I (17M) and my sister (11) ride the bus to and from school every day. Throughout the year, she has been sitting with this new guy (17m). I have had some bad feelings about him recently, so I decided that they should no longer sit together. I think it's strange for a 17 year old and an 11 year old to be hanging out like that. I told him in the nicest way possible ""hey man, I am not trying to be a dick or anything, but you sitting with my sister is making me really uncomfortable and I am just looking out for my sister, but I dont want you sitting with her anymore. Nothing against you, it's just that I dont know you and I just wanna protect my sister."" He was kind of upset about it because my sister is the only one he sits with on the bus. This happened on friday. This morning, I was talking with my friend (18m) as we were getting on and he was just staring at us. We asked him what was up and he was like ""you guys should be sorry. Now I have to sit in the back cause of what happened."" And he argued with us most of the way to the bus hub. He said some stuff like ""you know I'm a psycho right?"" And ""I am not afraid of you, I have been stabbed and shot before,"" which really creeped my friend and I out. At the end though, we came to an understanding that we would all be fine as long as he left my sister alone. I dont want this to get more out of hand than it has already. Then we ride the bus home and he doesn't talk at all to us. About half an hour later, he sends his SISTER (like 12 I think) to my house when I'm out doing chores and she says ""My brother is going to sit with your sister whether you like it or not,"" and I said ""this is between your brother and I, please stay out of it."" She then runs home and sends messages between him and I. I eventually say ""look, if he wants to talk then he can come talk to me himself,"" and she says that he will talk to me again tomorrow.

I will be the first to admit, I should have stopped this way sooner, but it's too late for that now. I just wanna look out for my sister and have this dude leave us alone. I've already told my parents about it but they haven't given me too much advice on how to go about it. Please help me protect my sister.",03Mar2020,2
122,"Hey guys
So a little background info: All throughout elementary and high school I have always had friends. It wasnt until high school that i had a circle of girls, 4 of us and we did everything together. Up till mid grade 11 tho where we had a falling out with 2 of the girls and grew closer with 2 other girls. It was some nasty high school shit (we thought we were better then the other 2 bc we started smoking weed and they didnt want to. catty shit lol) but point being i always had a close group, and we went on yearly trips and whatever.

After hs i had my group (plus 1 or 2 girls) and we would go to the bar, get drinks food go to raves and adventures. Looooooong (and i mean long) story short, my best friend who stuck w me throughout all this and I became different people, 1 got a bf and 2 others moved to Van leaving me with no friends. At around this time i also got kicked out of university for too low grades (i didnt tell anyone) and lost my job due to the company shutting down (i loved that job!)

So here i am 4 years out of high school, and 8 months since my last 2 friends moved and i find myself declining invitations from new people to hang out and overall isolating myself. But i want social interaction! I am just so afraid or something... fuck. what is it?? I'm going to try some free therapy sessions starting tomorrow i just dont get it im introverted as hell but i wanna go to the bar with a nice girl group so bad.. but when opportunity strikes i just cant get myself to

im thinking of re connecting w one of the girls from out old hs group (the og group) we kind of reconnected when i forced myself out w some girls in december and with our shared past i felt close to her... any tips on how i can make and stick to plans that i wanna attempt to make&gt;

To preface this; my father owns a company and I (23F) work for him. 
I am an incredibly nice and friendly person. I am happily engaged (37M) and we are planning our wedding. He might see this, but he already knows this shit keeps happening to me so...
I tend to get along better with guys, I was always a daddy’s girl - played video games, preferred dressing like a boy, etc. Girls/women always tended to not trust me. This continued well into adulthood and I’m still not positive how to handle their judgement. 

I’m 23 now and I am happily engaged to the most amazing man I’ve ever met. I would never betray him or his trust and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I worship the ground he walks on really. My coworkers question EVERYTHING though. They are all older than me by at least 15 years and apparently have nothing better to do than gossip about me and how I (or my little sister) act around others. I’m not super close to my female coworkers -I have nothing in common with them- but I am really close to a couple of my male coworkers (M34 and M50+) plus a couple other male coworkers but not as close. It’s not a flirting thing, it’s not even an interest thing, just friendship with people I have things in common with. But all my female coworkers continually gossip about it. “She’s flirting with them” “she spends too much time around them” “she should know better” etc. 

I won’t say they are wrong because I almost feel naive in this, which is why I decided to put the vote to you lot. Is it wrong to be friends with my dad’s male employees? Or should I just continue on course and figure out a way to confront my female coworker’s judgement?

It's my mom's birthday and my parents are visiting Playa del Carmen in Mexico. They are seasoned travelers, so I usually don't fret about them too much, but I texted my mom tonight to ask what her plans were for her birthday dinner. She's not a great texter, so I didn't expect to hear back right away, but I happened to look at my phone about an hour later and realize that the text had never sent. I share location with both of my parents, so I checked and it said her location was not available.

I thought maybe her phone was dead, so I texted my dad. It delivered the message, but when I checked his location, it says it's also not available. I called him and it went straight to voicemail. Then I called my mom and I got a message in Spanish saying something about the phone not currently having service (I only remember my Spanish from high school). I thought that was weird.

I'm basically posting this because I realized that in the case that they don't end up texting me back soon, I'm not even sure what to do. Anyone from Mexico or have any experience with the police in Mexico? Who do I call? What should I do first?

130,"I have really cheap rent because I live with my brothers and my dad is the landlord.  Probably 1/4 of what the rent would be for the cheapest good quality apartment in town.

But I think I would be a lot happier living on my own in a 1 bedroom.  

I really want to move out because:

1. One of my brothers is a hoarder, not biohazard level but almost.  He hoards groceries and produce and often keeps it after it has gone bad, sometimes forgetting, sometimes thinking he can still use it.  His stuff is slowly taking over the house and encroaching on common areas. 

 He overpacks areas with stuff to the point that it is precarious.  At one point the fridge regularly had food falling out of it whenever we opened it.  I think he actually broke our fridge because one of the shelves caved in from his food (a shelf designated for his food).

It wouldn't be as bad if he truly thought he had a problem but he constantly gaslight, denies and shifts blame when we confront him and I'm tired of fighting.

2. I used to not be 100% on this until I started really paying attention but now I realize that he gaslights me and my brother a lot.  He manipulates us in other ways as well like the cold shoulder, guilt tripping, straight up lying, screaming at us, shifting blame, false equivalency, distracting from the argument, threats to take away things, cleaning things up to gaslight us (then next week it's messy again), lots of different stuff.

3. I do most of the cleaning, even with a chore schedule in place.  They do some but I do the majority and I don't have the energy required to clean an entire house most days so our house usually is pretty messy and disgusting in some areas.

4. We have it set up where I pay the utilities and for things like laundry soap, toilet paper, etc and I keep track of their share/what they owe me.  They pay me back very slowly and now owe me at least $1000 each.

5. Not as big an issue but the gaslighting brother deliberately makes really loud noises doing dishes, stomping around, slamming doors, etc.  He has decided to mostly work out at home by running up and down the stairs and doing crunches/squats in his room, all the while making really annoyimg and cringey grunting and panting noises.  

He also has really bad Bo and breath and it is really hard to convince him to shower and wear deodorant and brush his teeth unless he feels like it.  

He also like to only wear underwear a lot of the time at home which is fine except he picks really tight underwear where I can see the outline of his dick and he doesn't change when I say it bothers me. 

 I feel like he enjoys annoying me.  I am starting to feel utterly repulsed by him.

6.  He regularly finds boundaries to push and paints me as a villain when I stand up for myself.

7. He sometimes insults me especially when I don't stand up for myself and he says I need to be less of a pushover so I've stopped mentioning those sorts of situations to him.

8. My other brother is easier to get along with but he is pretty messy, minus the hoarding.  At least he can deal with people pointing out his messiness.  Still not my dream roommate.

I'm just not sure if the benefits outweigh the costs.  I'd be able to do it but it would be tough to do without dipping into my savings or selling my car, even if I budget a lot.

I feel really trapped.  I really crave a clean house where I can do what I want when I want and not have to get in arguments all the time but goddamm is it expensive.

Is it worth moving out or is it my price to pay for cheap rent?

Tldr: deal with manipulative hoarder brother and messy brother for cheap rent or tighten my belt and live peacefully alone?  Is moving out worth it?",03Mar2020,1

So for context basically my dad is a recovering alcoholic. I’m really happy with the progress he’s made so far but he’s still got a long way to go.

Today we were hanging out and it was one of those bad days. We started a conversation and it pretty much ended in us both in tears. We didn’t exactly have an argument but he said some stuff during the conversation that made me doubt if he’s going to get better.

137,"Hello there. Here's some background.

I'm 22(m) currently going to school part time and worrying full time. I'm a draftsman for an electrical contractor, but I really dislike what I do. It's extremely boring to me and I have trouble focusing at work, but it pays enough to cover bills and hobby's. It's just not what I want to do for the rest of my life, I know that much. I'm currently taking a Gen-Ed poli Sci class right now (I kinda like it) and learning a drafting program called Revit, which will be useful for potentially moving to a new employer and for my current position. I like to play competitive fighting games/ video games in general, watch anime, and various other things in my spare time. I'm also currently getting into streaming the games that I play. 

My dilemma: I have no idea what I like enough to reasonably pursue as a career.

 Before I took classes for computer drafting I went to school for computer science. I had to drop out due to mental health issues and I tried to to continue at my home community College but I couldn't handle the physics at the time. Fast forward to today and I'm just going through the grind while not having a goal. It's demoralizing as hell, and I don't know how to proceed. Another issue I've realized is that I frequently get really interested in something and then a few weeks to a few months later Im not interested anymore (I was planning on going to school for architecture but I'm tired of my current job and I was never really artistically talented to begin with. I'm a very science oriented person). I'm planning on taking a chemistry course in fall (I had a knack for chemistry in high school) but I guess I'm just kinda lost right now and so I'm asking for any wisdom from the internet.
If I didn't have to worry about money, I'd probably try to help my local fighting game community grow (Super Smash Brothers Ultimate) and travel for tournaments to compete. If you have any advice or wisdom, please enlighten me.

Thank you.

I'd consider them more acquaintances). To make matters worse, I went to a small private elementary school and had a very small class who were the only kids I really interacted with. As a result of these things, I've had pretty poor social skills and anxiety issues which I've been trying to overcome lately.

This particular insecurity I believe developed in middle school. Because of my poor social skills, I was often called weird or creepy. I've since grown then, but I'm still extremely self-conscious about coming across as weird, or being a burden on people, or that people only keep me around because it'd be rude not to. 

It makes it very difficult to make friends or reveal much of my true self, because I'm constantly thinking ""What if this person doesn't want to talk to me? What if I'm just taking up their time and they want to move on?"". I'll not share my feelings with people because I don't want to inconvenience them. 

For a more recent example, there's a girl I became friends with around half a year ago. Since meeting her, I've asked her numerous times something like ""If you don't like me/don't want to be friends/don't want to talk please just tell me"". Everytime, she tells me that we're friends, that she doesn't dislike me, etc. 

Yet, I always feel on guard and paranoid about ""She might just be saying that to be nice and doesn't want to hurt my feelings"". Notice how I've asked her this numerous times, because for a while it works and I feel more comfortable. But it inevitably goes back to me doubting myself. 

Logically I know that there's not really a reason to suspect that she dislikes me, or that she'd be lying. I know that people aren't going to despise me for talking about myself, or that I'm coming across as weird in everything I do. And yet, I can't seem to shake this feeling. 

How can I overcome it?",03Mar2020,1

141,"My mother has always been kind of hard to talk to and it shouldn't be because I'm almost 21. However, I am living under her roof and often have to tell her things especially if I want to do something. She always told me never to talk to strangers online, but as I got older changed it to I shouldn't tell them anything personal unless I know them. Despite that I know she still doesn't approve. In late December, I decided to try a dating app. I had been on them before and nothing had gone anywhere. After going on and off for a year, I decided to try a different one. Through this app, I met a lovely boy who was my age. We had and instant connection and while not all of our views were the same, we still listened to the others opinion and kept an open mind. We talk everyday and I truly care for this person. He respects me and genuinely seems head over heels about me. For reasons I won't get into, we’re finally going to be able to meet in March/April. He'll be coming to my town and my biggest hurdle is telling my mom. My mom has always lectured me on what I do on my phone and I fear the second I tell her she's going to disapprove completely. Ask me things like ""why would you do this?"", ""how do you even know this person? Can you even trust them"" or ""what if he's a murder or kidnapper?"" etc. 
I know this person is who he says he is because we have video chatted and I've met a few of his friends as well. He's shown me family pictures and based on everything, he's shown me that he isn't lying to me. I know I'm going to tell my mom, I just don't know how. How do I word this so she trusts me? How do I say this so she won't immediately disapprove? I really like this person and want to pursue a relationship with them. I don't get opportunities like this, and this boy is not someone I want to pass up because my mother doesn't approve and will do anything to possibly guilt me into not doing it.

143,"Hello all. 34 year old male in the Eastern United States. I'm not sure if this is the right place to frame this question, so maybe if someone thinks there'd be a better avenue, please let me know. I will try not to be too long winded.

I've never had hoards of friends. I have several amazing friends and a great group of amazing acquaintances. The problem is, they're all somewhere else. I relocated a few states away two years ago for my wife's work and so now my closest friends are eight hours or so away. A couple of my best friends struggle with being very sociable, so sometimes texts and phone calls net a decent conversation, however most of the time I feel like I'm just reaching out and we exchange messages for a few minutes and that's that. I've been able to see a few of my good friends on one or two occasions since I've moved.

I haven't really made any friends since we've moved and it sometimes gives me feelings of anxiety thinking about the loneliness and whatnot. I do have a few acquaintances through work, but our interests very too greatly to see me spending too much time with them outside of work.

I came to think about posting this because I just came back from spending a residency weekend on campus at my school- I'm working on an Online MBA (mainly because of my work schedule, not because of any particular anti-social reasons or anything). I had an amazing time with the whole experience. With what little downtime we had, two of the guys in my group and I went out and had several beers, bonding for 6 hours or so before calling it a night. We exchanged numbers, and I connected on LinkedIn with several people I met over the weekend.

When I got home and had a chance to wind down, I couldn't help but notice my first feelings were of overwhelming loneliness, missing the connection with the guys I met over the weekend too. Is this a normal feeling? Do other people experience these miniature existential crises? It's frustrating. I just don't really know how to process feeling like this, but I do feel like it would help if I could establish a friend group where I am now.

I'm not really sure what I hope to achieve by putting this all out there, beyond confirming my questions I guess. But any insight, or hell, even the conversation would be appreciated.",03Mar2020,1

I came in before class like we agreed and he didn't show up. When I pressed him about it, he apologized that the printer wasn't working. He promised to open the test for me as open book (I assumed meant at home) and gave me five days. I checked for the tests on friday and couldn't find them. I asked him what was going on and he said I had to go to the testing center to take them, which is not what I remembered. So I went to the testing center (which is really far away) to find out that he had closed the test, even though he said it was at the testing center. I asked him about it and he told me I had missed my opportunity. I'm not sure if I misunderstood something. Should I go to a supervisor because he won't accept my doctor's note? What should I do?

upon turning it on it would push the dog back form pressure \*defies physics as it would not be strong enough to do that\* he did this to 3 dogs, the third one didn't move however on the underside of it's body a Hi point Pistol emerged slowly from the water pressure, ik remember

grabbing it and it would fire fine without any hassle, the bullets appeared to work normal in the dream world, i remember having trouble using the trigger

i couldn't get a proper grip on the trigger. i remember firing about 15 rounds in random directions and 1 round \*were in the outdoor area now) towards a group

of people walking in a long line, they didn't care or show any reaction to live rounds being fired at them. the dogs appeared somewhat skinny and strange looking

i killed one of the dogs with a bullet and handed the gun back to the demonstration guy he gave me a strange confused look. the dream ended

152,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit!

I will go ahead and say that, as of this post I am not getting married. I don't even have a girlfriend at the point, though I am interested in someone. I'm completely aware that marriage is something that I most likely won't have to worry about for a while, but I'm a very future-oriented thinker and this has been seriously picking my brain lately. 

Long story short, I have been thinking about the very thing that people imagine when it comes to marriage: wedding rings. Why is this a problem, you might ask? I'll explain.

I am what many people would consider a ""religious"" person (I'm a practicing Christian). In the particular denomination that I am in, neither the men nor the women wear any jewelry. While there are differing views when it comes to this matter, many of the couples that I know don't even have (or at least wear) wedding rings, my parents included. I myself don't plan on having a ring.

That being said, I have been trying to think of creative ways I could propose and pledge my love the woman I will spend my life with. I have an idea for the proposal part (I'm an author and thought about carefully placing the words ""will you marry me?"" in my next novel). The part I'm unsure of is the wedding part. I've heard of wedding watches (which is generally ok in my religion), but I'm not sure I would really want to do that. 

I'm not going to lie, to my own shame, I've wondered how non-religious people would react to the fact that I didn't have a ring. I could imagine it going something like this:

Coworker: ""Congratulations! I'm so happy for you two! Where is your ring?"" 

Me: ""Oh, I don't have one.""

Coworker: ""Oh... you don't have one?""

Me: ""No.""

Coworker: ""Did you get one for your wife?""  
Me: ""No.""

Coworker: ""Oh."" *What kind of guy doesn't buy a ring for his wife? He must be a cheap husband!*

I've thought about secretly buying rings and hiding it somewhere in our house just to say ""we have wedding rings,"" but then again I wouldn't want to be hypocritical and go against my beliefs. Honestly, I personally need to stop worrying about what people think about me personally. As long as my girl and I agree and are happy, that's all that should matter. People can just keep their noses out of it. 

Anyway, I would really like to be able to come up with such an awesome wedding idea that a ring wouldn't even matter. Any advice or personal experiences are much appreciated. Thank you all :)",03Mar2020,1

156," i remember being in a extremely futuristic skyscraper that was at least 1km in the air, this was massive

and i spent sometime in a shop buying food inside with lots of people around, after i was ready to buy the food i went and placed it in the bin

and left. after leaving the shop \*which was on the the 3 to top floor\* i remember than appearing on the top floor with great immense fear of the height and falling

to death, some man that appeared to be corza drug dealer by looks, came up to me after he noticed i tried to thhrow a bike off

but the bike rolled towards th edge and bounced after it touched the wall and stopped, he came up to me and said so ya wanna see what it looks like from up here

he than grabbed out a large white sign and walked to the edge and threw it up, i did not move and didn't walk any closer to watch it fall, after 10 seconds he walked back

to me and said, bro the wind is what ya gotta watch out for up here, it will throw you far off the building.

Next i remember being in gawler with james, we were walking round williston area, and i started to get immensely lost and scared

i repetitively asked him for help but he didn't seem to want to say much, he seemed to ignore it like i'd be fine, eventually he walked up to a house with

a front side foor open with a light inside and the shadow of people chilling (he was going to his mates) i stopped him before he went in and asked which way i go

he ignored it and quickly walked inside as i turned around to look where i was again, i noticed this so i walked away down the street, which appeared to go to a big roundabout

upon walking down to the end, i walked on a side walk which was in the middle of the road, the side walk got thinner and thinner, noticing this i turned around

and there was a hold up of cars behind me, i walked left towards the real sidewalk, and without noticing hundreds and hundreds of people appeared as if it was rundle mall (Adelaide, Australia), at this point i repetitively remember falling over and not being able to walk, it felt like i was in rag doll mode, my legs were all wobbly

and i couldn't' stand, i tried to get up multiple times, passes by would glance at me with confusion on there faces, few people tried to grab my arms and pull me up but than let me go

and i'd fall back to the ground. at this point it was looking like i was in a city area with trams going by and heaps of cars. than 3 old old man walked up to me and

grabbed me, this time it pilled me up and i was slowly walking with there assistance, i looked at the man holding me and he remained dead silent without speaking a word

not one person in this whole city spoke to me at all, they were all silent it's like the system was owning them and the future was sad and cold, i looked at the man

holding me and he was wearing a black hat and glasses, i looked into his eyes and he appeared to smile briefly but than went back to his silent emotionless state

than i felt a sharp pain across my wrist, upon glancing at my wrist i noticed the man had his thumb over my veins in my wrist that hard that it was crushing them

as soon as i flinched in reaction to this he let go of me, and i didn't fall but kept moving with him. i looked back at his face and my whole vision turned into

a red screen monitor. which said his name and details ( i couldn't read any of his name or majority of the words) but a few of them said this man is a smoker

and each inhale of the cig clogs his heart more and more, he has a package if health problems and will most likely die in the next few months. that is all i remember and it ended

i also remember at 2 points throughout the whole night being in a dark city at night that was completely dessertred with no lights, i was being chased by a man with

a beard, i do not know who he was or why he was chasing me, but i frequently remember being somewhat scared and running and jumping on roof tops and hiding in bins.

he never caught me but i never figured out who this man was or why he was chasing me

TW: child neglect/drug abuse/DV/child abuse. 

TL;dr: MIL &amp; SIL have cut Boyfriend off and we are expecting twins (5months preg) I feel like it’s my fault and idk how to help him. 

B: brother, M: brothers ex, N: nephew, FH: boyfriend, MIL: FHs mum, SIL: FHs sister. GM: FHs nan. 

I’m sorry this is so long and so rushed! And also probably quite confusing! There are many other things leading up to this, but this happened over the weekend. 

Tiny bit of backstory, my brother has 2 children. 1 12G &amp; 1 8M. 8M is autistic, and has been raised by me and his mum due to his dads issues. There have been periods of time where I have solely looked after him. His mum struggles, I understand, social services are involved to keep an eye on him etc. My brother HAD a significant drug addiction, he has now been in recovery for almost a year. When my nephew was 3, B (living with us at the time) discovered that M had a Male around, a lot. (They are separated) this Male had been released from prison months prior, for severe DV (broke his ex wife’s spine etc). B was not comfortable with this, made M aware. M ignored this, and put N (and niece) safety at risk (they later needed therapy for his behaviour around them such as how if he could do it again he’d finish it and the incident) B decided that the kids would stay with him, until M kept said man away. Massive incident w/ police, social services, etc. N would have meltdowns and panic attacks if he heard a loud noise, and would have night terrors for MONTHS after. This is the incident that lead to me being a guardian of N. This incident, frankly fucked N up for a long time. M is now a good friend, and we get on well to co-parent N together. 

Now, I’m currently 5 months pregnant with twins. FH is EXCITED. However, all we’ve done for weeks is argue because every time we make a decision (or even if it’s out of our control) MIL TANTRUMS. And I mean, full toys out of the Pram “you’re pushing me out” tantrums. She did this with baby shower, scans, chairs (!!!!) this is the 4th incident. 

We explain we want to wait until the day after they are born for visitors. (It’s a complex pregnancy with potentially life threatening complications for me) she agrees and says she’ll bring herself, SIL, GM up. 
We look at visiting for the hospital, 2 per visit. Shit. 

FH conversation w/ MIL:

FH: just to let you know, it’s only 2 people per visit. 
MIL: SO I CANT BRING GM?! 
FH: what? OP has family like her own mum she would like to see 
MIL: we’ll just come a different day then 
OP: No. this isn’t cause for a hissy fit. This is just how it is. There’s nothing we can do to help this one. 
Admittedly I lost my cool, but after 5 months of feeling like I am nothing but an incubator for her baaaaaaaabies and FH not defending me I snapped a lil. 

MIL relays the phone conversation to SIL as “FH said he doesn’t want us to visit” what the f?! 

SIL messages, asks why she can’t visit. 
Says it “makes her laugh” because when she was pregnant she had XYZ waiting while she gave birth and I don’t want that. 
“OP isn’t the only person whose ever been pregnant” 
“It doesn’t need to be a military operation” 
Considering the previous 5 months of shit, in which SIL has agreed MIL actions were disgusting. (Story for another day) i was upset. FH is too. But doesnt defend me (he’s trying, his best, we end up having another argument) He tells her, that she upset us both, she just argues the point with him. Also tells her we’re not having visitors till the next day “that’s weird. I hope OPs family are getting the same treatment” (SIL has already said I’m isolating FH, I’m not but her opinion I have to respect it) 
FH also opens up to MIL, pours his heart out to her, the only thing she cares about is that he called her a name. 
Both of them are saying I’m “feeding him shit” and “this isn’t like him” and I’m “playing the victim” wtf????? 
FH tells SIL that this behaviour has made me not want contact with them. 

SIL responds by kicking off, saying I’m doing XYZ, feeding him shit, I’m being pathetic etc etc. and (SIL &amp; M used to work together) 

“Bare in mind I was there when her mother KIDNAPPED Niece&amp;Nephew” so I told her to F off. 
I then told FH she was not welcome at the hospital. I do not want her near me or my children if she disrespects me that much to use something so traumatic to wind me up. 

I also say I want NC with MIL for a while. I need to avoid the stress. 
FH passes the message along to both. 

MIL states :”SIL just told me she is banned from the hospital. You’re on your own. Good luck” 

They’ve blocked us both. I’m relieved I can enjoy the rest of my pregnancy. FH is, very clearly distraught. He only wanted an apology, and he says he isn’t mad with me, he says he’s not upset with me. I feel AWFUL. I’ve been thinking about maybe stopping the relationship so he can have a relationship with them. (yes it’s THAT bad) I love him SO much and seeing him like this is killing me.

164,"Hello guys👋 

I’d like to start this off with the fact that it is currently nearly 2 am and I cannot sleep due to these thoughts running through my head. I’m seriously bothered by this so I’d like to ask you guys to be serious and genuine with your advice. I’m out of ideas of how to rephrase my google searches at this point and I need real genuine human advice. 

I nearly have no clue where to start. 

As I was growing up as a kid and through most of puberty I knew I had more in me than my peers, I earned good grades and I was very knowledgable and mature for my age. As cliche as this sounds, it was a fact backed up by my parents, peers and teachers. I had confidence in what I was doing, I might have even been a little cocky with it. Perhaps this is what started it all. 
I felt pretty much superior in most ways up until I was about 17 years old — I spoke two languages fluently while most people around me barely spoke their mother language properly, I had an idea of what I wanted to do with my life and what I was good at. At about my late 17 this all started to go down as while I had an idea of who I was and what I wanted to achieve I had no clue how to get from point A to point B. I studied graphics design in an arts high school. As it’s essence is creativity I cannot really backup that education ever did much for anyone as in the end of the day it came down to creativity. In my final year most people were really confused with what they wanted to study, while I was confident  that I’m not going to continue education as of then. 

High school ended and everyone split up. Within a month or two everyone around me signed up for university, moved to another city, etc. I felt really stuck. It actually tormented me so much that I didn’t sleep for days, feeling like I’m wasting time and oxygen and that I’m doing nothing with my life. Thinking “I have more” I felt like I was letting myself down by doing nothing to progress with my life. 

I knew I had to make a change as I couldn’t continue like that. I tried working at several places but never felt happy. I always wanted to move out as living in a conservative Eastern European country always made me feel trapped. 
So with that mindset, Within two ambitious weeks full of torture anxiety and sleepless nights, I scheduled moving out to England. 
(This was at the end of august 2019) 

Initially I worked in a big warehouse, in an inbounds sector. I was promoted to administration as I spoke English unlike most people there. The pay was good, and the job wasn’t hard. My problem with it was the people I worked with and the shifts - I’ve always had poor mental health. I’ve dealt with anxiety all my life but I never realised how much worse it gets when you don’t sleep. 12 hour night shifts caused my mental health to get worse and worse and occasionally I’d even hallucinate!
That was, of course, combined with many Eastern Europeans (some even from my home country) occasionally torturing me and being homophobic and abusive towards me during shifts. 

Within 3 months of doing that I felt stuck. I felt like my life was an endless loop. Days melted together as my sleep schedule was non existent.  I felt like I was going insane as I woke up in panic occasionally thinking I fell asleep during work while at my own bed, sleeping midday.  

Eventually I met a guy, who I fell in love with. 
Finally things were different and made sense.
I quit my job impulsivelyand moved in with him faster than expected. I was now in a new city, without a job. Things were exciting but very scary. My anxiety prevented me from applying for jobs. As the thought of going to an interview and getting used to a new work environment petrified me. I couldn’t sleep well. I was going weeks and weeks on my savings knowing that if I don’t find a job soon I’ll be forced to go back to my home country. 

Eventually I found a job at a local pub, which has been, and still is an interesting experience. Its only a part time job and the pay is minimal wage which in my case is £6 per hour. As you can imagine, I’m not earning a lot at all. Things were okay though, I learned a lot more about this new city and I learned a lot more about English culture. Unfortunately I never felt like I fit. I always stood out as a foreigner in what always felt - a bad way. 

At the minute I still work in this place and I feel like my life has no direction. I’m definitely not getting a promotion despite my effort as I’m inexperienced but then again the motive of progressing also doesn’t feel right as this is basically considered a starter job, has low pay and it’s assumed that most people who work this cannot do any better. A lot of customers have even been amused by the fact that I’m not studying (and using this as a part time job) as to most people this kind of a job is a waste of time.

I feel awful for all of this. I cannot contribute equally to the bills with my boyfriend as I’m not earning enough. I feel like I’m living off his back for months now. I obviously would like to change that but I need to find a better paying job. 

I feel stuck. I struggle to find motivation to apply for new jobs. In most cases I know that my name stands out to the person going through the candidates as “does this guy even speak English” 

and so I cannot get a normal job, unless it’s another pub, or a similar underpaid job where they just don’t care. 

This obviously has brought me down daily. I don’t know if it’s the people around me treating me badly or my mental health being poor. I constantly feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me.

My life feels like a loop again, go to work, be unhappy, get minimal pay, survive until next week and so on again. 

I have no clue what to do. My anxiety is so bad. I’ve lived here for months and I only know the few shops around me. I’m actually scared to go explore. The thought of being in new places is off putting. I’d rather just stay in the apartment for 3 days straight and wait for my next shift. 

I’ve not done anything related to graphics design in two years now. Mind you, this used to be a passion of mine. Now I can’t even get myself to try doing something related to it.
I’m afraid to do anything as I know I won’t be creative and I’ll be rusty in terms of skill at this point. 

There are very few things I enjoy in my life currently. Food, playing video games, and watching Netflix. 
I feel like my existence has no point. 
I still think highly of myself in terms of my capabilities. I know I’m smart and charismatic. Yet if I don’t have the confidence to put my skills into use it’s about as good as none. 

I’ve had very depressive and suicidal thoughts lately. I don’t actually have a drive towards suicide, and I’ve discussed this with my boyfriend (who’s obviously very upset about it) but it feels like my life is so pointless that if I died it wouldn’t matter. I would not be upset if I died in a few minutes. I feel like I lost the worth in my own life. Sure, I love him, and I love the very few people I consider friends here but if we excluded everyone who’d be affected by my death, I personally don’t feel like I’d stand up for myself in the face of death. 

I feel so tired all the time, yet I’m doing absolutely nothing. It is so incompatible and doesn’t make sense, but it’s what life feels all the time. I feel stuck. I have no motivation to do anything. 

But I’m not happy with my life. And I’d  to change that. I’d like to value my life more. I’d like to have confidence in myself and what I do. Normally years ago when I felt like this it wouldn’t be so bad. It would be to a degree where I could help myself get out of the hole but right now I feel so depressed and suppressed by anxiety that I cannot begin making a positive change. 

What can I do? Where can I start? 
I am desperate. Please.

166,She has not responded in a few hours and has experienced depressive symptoms in the past. I have texted her parents but they have read the messages and not responded. Many of my friends are scared and we don’t know what to do.,03Mar2020,1
167,"I’m not even sure if I’m in a mental state to accept advice, I just don’t believe in posting even cryptically about the way I feel on the social media platforms the my friends follow me on because I know its out of attention or in hopes they contact me.
I have been feeling so immensely disrespected and uncared for in general by my friends, two in particular, increasingly for the last month and a half. One I feel only cares about the sentiment that we used to be really close and another I feel only really wants me around when she thinks she needs me.
I’ve got a decent sized social media platform where the focus is wellness, so I have been transparent that I’ve been down, in a rut, not feeling amazing mentally and I’ve not heard from either of them. Especially the one I’m closer with. I even said to her last week I had been feeling depressed for the last two weeks and she glazed over it, not acknowledging it. If she ever posted something eluding to her having a rough time or better yet TOLD me, I’d immediately talk to her, ask what I could do, check up on her.
I’ve just been recently realizing I’ve been doing for them what I genuinely feel they’d never do for me. They are my closest friends...somehow. Dropping them doesn’t feel like an option but I feel so strongly they don’t respect me or genuinely care for me.
I used to somehow communicate with one every day. Whether it be text, snapchat, sending a meme. I’ve sent 4 things in the last week with no response. 
The last exchange the three of us had, I turned down a last minute dinner invitation from them because I had plans with another friend. They wound up showing up at my house, all but barging in, completely ignoring my other friend, disregarding that she was my guest and just “hung out” for about 10 minutes because they “missed me so much” and “if I couldnt come see them, they’d come see me” 
It was very odd, extremely disrespectful, and rude. On top of all that, it felt calculated, like they thought they would be catching me in a lie as if I didn’t have plans. 
I told them both the night before on top of just plain not being available- that I felt overwhelmed with my responsibilities as well as trying to give attention to my friends and family and that I felt I needed to step back and take care of myself. No response- just a home invasion essentially. And then no conversation after that incident either. I was so baffled I didn’t even know how to react.
I’m not whatsoever at the point of being depressed that I’d consider killing myself ever, never ever ever, but it makes me sick knowing they’ve basically ignored me after being so rude to me after continually telling both of them how I’ve been feeling depressed and down lately and they’ve not acknowledged it. What if I really was that low? How could you not check on someone you claim to be your best friend?",03Mar2020,1

I didn't mind that much until last time, while we were with other friends, he touched me inappropriately on the breast and laugh about it, like he was kidding. I was honestly speechless and when I confronted him about it he didn't take me seriously. Why this? Did he seriously think this is not a big deal? Am I exaggerating things?

170,"Hello

Tricky situation. I’ve (F24) reconnected with an old friend (M27) and we’re now dating. We were all in the same friend group and hung out when I dated my abusive ex when I was younger (14-18yrs old). A family member of my abusive ex who happens to be my boyfriends best friend and someone who was like a brother to me and still is, is having a gender reveal and invited us. This all happens to be the same weekend I’m flying in to visit my boyfriend. This cousin is happy that we are together. It has been explained to my old ex that we are together and he’s just said that it irritates him.
I am nervous about seeing the entire family and the ex. They knew the entire situation when we were younger. It was a very bad falling out. Recently though some family had reached out and wished I was well. I want my boyfriend to attend and I’ve said I don’t mind staying behind for the day, but he’s insistent we either go together or don’t go together. 

Knowing this family they are crazy and may make it about something other than what it should be. 

What should I do? I’m going to feel awkward and I’m sure everyone else on that part of the family aside from his cousin will too. But I also want to see my old friend and support his newest addition to the family. I also don’t think it will trigger me in any way.. I think I’ve come to terms and moved passed that part of my life.

Hellppp.

I attempted to smash my hand today with weights but just as i would be ready to smash on 210 pounds i would pull my hand out. I notice that my hand starts to subconsciously move towards the weights and idk what to do. ( today was the first time I’ve went to the weight room in two weeks since its started ) and i cant talk to my parents cause they’ll either think im faking or make a big deal about it and if i talk to my school guidance they’ll do the same and so on and so on.

My mom was super worried, telling me I needed to eat more and that I looked terribly skinny. I thought she was exaggerating so I ignored it. 

But I just threw up. After eating. I didn’t want to, I just felt the urge and basically vomited all of the food I had in my system. I’m shaking right now, I think because of weakness, and I’m not sure why I vomited. 

I think the habit started since I’ve been drinking a bit too much and constantly throw up when I get too drunk (sometimes even willingly to get rid of the alcohol in my system).  

I’m not sure what to do. My throat burns, I feel weak, and I have no interest on eating again to get the food back in my system. 

Also, it wasn’t the food that made me sick. It was a sandwich I eat pretty much every couple of days and it has never made me feel sick. Ever.

Naturally, she asked me where I had been all day, I said at her house because the truth was the majority of the day I was.

179,"For some back story, my parents divorced 6 years ago. In the divorce, my mother got the house even though my dads name is still on it. It is a duplex. My partner and I have lived in the lower appartment for three years, while my mother lives in the top apartment. The apartments are completely separate. Our apartment has three bedrooms. About two and a half years ago, my father moved in with my partner and I. I pay rent to my mother, and my father does so separately. At the time, we did not have kids and did not plan to.  Now, we have two daughters, 22 months and 7 months. We currently share a small room with our almost two year old, and my younger daughter sleeps in my partners office. My father has the largest room to himself. This living situation obviously presents some issues. For one, my partner can't work on projects when the baby is napping or sleeping. The other is that we do not have our own bedroom, which is obviously a problem for our relationship. Not just physically, but in general, it's hard for us to maintain our relationship with zero privacy. On top of this, he sits in the living room when our daughters are asleep during our only alone time even though he has his own room and we have nowhere to be. Another issue is that our oldest daughter is getting too old to sleep with her parents, but our baby refuses to sleep if anyone at all is the room with her which is why she does not sleep with us and why they can not share a room. My father also makes awful messes and does absolutely nothing help. 
It's gotten to the point where him being  here impedes on our life as a family so much that my partner has been talking about leaving me and my daughters to escape him. It's ruining our relationship. 
Problem is, he has mentioned causally that he will never be able to afford moving out, and has even asked what we plan to do about sleeping arrangements and even warned us not have more kids because there's no room. I do not know how to bring up to him that I need him to leave without him flipping out, and in a way that he will actually listen. I fear that he will feel entitled to staying because he feels like he owns the house, even though he really does not. I also feel like he won't see the severity of the problems he is causing us.

180,"Recently I’ve been noticing the lack of interest I’ve had writing a story online. Two years ago I used to have a lot of fun writing and continuing the story as it played out in my head and writing about how each event occurred. My writing flowed from scene to scene and I would even have trouble exiting the app. I would naturally go on scene by scene to no end until I was satisfied for the day. But nowadays, I’ve noticed that I only dreadfully enter the app in order to type what needs to be typed; fulfill the 500 or more word limit per day that I assume began this loss of enjoyment, and exit the app from time to time before forcing myself back in because I just simply wasn’t motivated to go on for much longer. And then the next day I do it all over again.

I dunno what’s gotten into me. The story means so much to me all these years and yet I can’t seem to grasp the thrill of writing that enticed me so much years ago. This routine has been going on for about a year now and I’m trying to find a different approach, like going at my own pace instead of cramming in 500+ words per day in order to get the story finished as soon as possible. But as of right now I still don’t feel a difference in feeling when I’m writing. I don’t know if it’s because I also happened to stick to this routine when studying abroad last year, which robbed me of the opportunity to make friends around the year, thus likely leading me to despise writing (it was my fault tho; I just wish I realized it while I studied abroad.). But it’s not like I completely despise it. Something just changed about my enjoyment of writing, and I want to regain that thrill and passion.

Any advice on methods and approaches to spark that thrill again?",03Mar2020,1
182,"This is going to be a long one so bear with me...

I (26M) am turning 27 in a couple of months and I am coming to the realization that I have done absolutely nothing with my life and I’m running out of time.

I have a lot of demons that I’m not ready to talk about that are probably the causes of some of my anxiety, but I’ll start with what I do know...

I come from a very born again Christian family in Northern New Jersey. My parents were not always like this, in-fact, through old pictures and stories, I know they were “wild child’s” in the 70s and 80s. Somewhere along after I was born in 1993, they found Jesus. Growing up was very strict for me. No secular music, no secular tv, church twice a week, super conservative views, the usual white Christian family stuff. I always knew or at least always felt like this stuff was just not for me. I remember in 1st grade I got suspended for drawing pictures of naked people in class because my cousin showed me porn and I wanted to tell my friends. That’s my earliest memory of me rebelling against the way my family wanted to raise me. I definitely was always a bad kid, getting into trouble, being a brat, lying about EVERYTHING, screaming and yelling. I had a baby brother when I turned 5 and I never remember being nice to him until I became an adult. We always fought and argued growing up and I know I often hurt his feelings. Thinking about how mean I was really makes me upset to this day.

Growing up in the church is where a lot of basic knowledge came from. I went to Christian school my whole life so everything I learned was faith based. The biggest thing that effected my life negatively from that time was being told “if you don’t follow xyz you are going to hell.” That put the initial anxiety in me.

To briefly jump forward, I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. This all stems from my fear of dying. Everything freaks me out, I avoid tons, and it’s just ruining my life. I’m so afraid to do anything that might cause me death and every single day I add another thing to my list that I avoid doing. It’s beginning to turn into me avoiding most things and staying inside most of the time. I feel like I’m becoming agoraphobic. Like the Nick Swardsons character in Bench Warmers lol. I have talked to professionals but it gets expensive and I try to self cope by avoiding everything and just hanging out with my friends.

Going back to my younger years, being a teenager is when I really turned away from my foundations. I started to not believe in any of the religious stuff, I started smoking weed, and drinking/partying. Then I became so sexual because I was told to avoid sex at all costs. Being the rebel I was, I did the opposite. I lost my virginity when I was 14 and became obsessed with sex and porn since. 

Since I can remember I always hated working, I have no work ethic. But I have a taste for an expensive lifestyle. A lot of my friends were wealthier and my teenage jobs never paid enough so I started stealing. Stealing from my parents, stores, etc. I did it for years no remorse. The first time I got in trouble for it was 16 shoplifting at the mall. No charges but my parents were obviously pissed and at that time our relationship was shit. I hated them, they knew it, they told me to go back to church. That was the argument cycle. I lived in the house a few more years and then I really started to get in trouble.

I’ve had so many jobs in my life. I never went to college after high school so I have no degree. But from the time I could start working I never spent more than a year at a job. When I was 18 and all of my friends were in school I decided to try and join the workforce myself. I got into sales like my dad and did well until I wanted more money and what I was making wasn’t enough. After I had emptied my parents jewelry boxes over the years, I needed a new way to make an extra buck. That’s when I started doing fraud. I don’t remember how I learned but I found out if I mobile deposited my paycheck and cashed it at the same time, a few days later I would have double the money! Now this would only work for about two pay periods per bank account until they drew back the double dipped funds, so I kept opening new accounts at different banks. Now I felt like I was making good money until I was so fascinated with doing that, I stopped doing my actual job and eventually was fired due to poor performance. The banks were the only people who lost money and the employer never found out I was double dipping the checks but now was 20 years old and not working again. 

At this point my parents clearly knew I was a fuck up who left the religion, was clearly a trouble maker, and just wasn’t nice to them in general. The final straw with my relationship with them was pulled after they found out I had been taking their gold over the years. Broke their hearts and lost tens of thousands of dollars. I ruined the only unconditional love I ever had no matter our differences. And I was kicked out of the house at 20 years old. Homeless and alone, I actually had a mental breakthrough and really wanted to better myself. I found a love and passion in cooking. I had a good friend who managed a restaurant and he put me on the line in the kitchen. I absolutely loved it and found happiness and meaning in what I thought I wanted as a career. For a year I did really well and even tried to rekindle my relationship with my family. This all changed when I turned 21.

The owners of the restaurant were typical NJ Italian mob guys who loved all kinds of debauchery. The biggest being poker. I developed a close relationship with them being the only white guy in the back of the house (kitchen) and they started inviting me to their poker nights. God I fell in love. That’s when my gambling addiction started. I won $1,500 the first night and that was it for me. It was the easiest and most not technically illegal money I’ve ever made. From then on, all my paychecks went to the casino and that poker room. There I was with a good job, a good opportunity, hooked on this new thing. I put all my time, money, and effort into poker because I thought this was the way I could make easy money. Of course the house always wins and then wins again. Until I’m out of money. So what do I do? Fraud. I remember this kid telling me one time he literally paid for a car with a check and drove off the lot the same day. I was like “they didn’t wait for the check to clear?” he told me “no I looked trustworthy.” So that’s when I started writing bad checks. For everythingggggg. Cars, clothes, apartments, and jewelry. The key was look like you have the money. That’s it, it was easy. And that’s what I did for the next 2-3 years with a whole lot of gambling in between. (Yes I got in tons of legal trouble and that’s what I mentioned all the way at the top of this thing on how I’m not ready to talk about that.) I lost most of my friends and definitely my family in that time so I just moved away during that time and went MIA for like 2 years to upstate New York. Also don’t want to talk about that time but I did a lot of soul searching and stopped doing illegal things and stopped gambling and got back into sales. 

When I was 25 I popped back up in everyone’s lives with enough time to pass where people could hopefully forget how much I hurt them and try to be a new man. I came back to NYC and got a job as a recruiter after lying about having a degree. I worked there for a year getting some experience and early this year I was offered my first big salaried job where I am working now. I finessed my way into this position with no background check but a ton of great references from my former employer. Feels like I’m playing con man again and it’s affecting me mentally. I don’t care that I lied to get these jobs and put into this nice positions because I just outsmarted everyone else. 

That’s not what’s bothering me. What’s bothering me is all of this is bottled up inside of me and I can’t tell anyone, my girlfriend, my new friends, who I really am. I built a great life for myself now but nobody knows what I did to get here. 

Should I just continue on and use this opportunity to be a successful young man?

Help me.

And when I told my mom I didn’t want to go to church she said she failed as a mom and I have no idea what to think because I’m in a state where if I believe in religion I will go to hell and if I’m an atheist I’m scared that there might be a god and he will hate me for not believing in him and send me to hell.

I was pretty popular in high school but I never really pulled through with actually hanging out with other kids. My home-life was rough but being surrounded by “friends “ really motivated me. Now I don’t have any friends I would call close. Not even close enough to know how to start up a conversation without a “what’s up” or “we should hang out soon”.

189," Hi Reddit..

Little bit of context I sublet a room in a 3 bed apartment. I was told before i moved in I'd be living with 2 other girls (I was pretty adamant I didn't want to live with dudes) but on move in day the dude i was subletting from had moved into one of the other rooms. Now there's another dude in the 3rd room. Its been generally frustrating as they don't clean up after themselves and use my kitchen stuff and don't wash it but other then that ok.

The roommate in question asked if his buddy could crash for around a week which was fine with me. Our apartments quite small but it was just for a week so why not.

Well now we're coming into week 2 and no sign of this dude leaving. Its really bothering me at this point cos not only are they noisy but i really dont feel comfortable living with sone random dude whos not paying rent etc. Am i overreacting? Any ideas how to approach this?

190,"Apologies in advance. This is a long post.  
Last Tuesday, my fiancé and I travelled to our ceremony venue to finalise the inclusions of our wedding package. We were both ecstatic because it has taken us more than a year to get to this point. This was mainly because I didn’t know what I wanted. Ultimately, I decided that spending more than 10K on a wedding was not worth it and wanted to put more money towards our honeymoon. As a result, my fiancé and I agreed our guest list will consist of our immediate families, grandparents and close friends.  
I live with my parents, so obviously when my fiancé and I arrived home I told my mum straight away about our wedding plans. She asked who I was inviting. After I answered she responded along the lines of, “show me your guest list. I’ll invite who I want, and I’ll pay for them. I want my family to be there”. I understood this as her paying for my entire extended family which is 16 people. This made me upset because I want to have an intimate wedding.  
I went to my room to breathe and talk to my fiancé about the situation. He suggested that instead of them paying for 16 people, they could organise an engagement party for us and it would cost less as it would be like one of our typical family gatherings where everyone brings a dish or 2. I liked this idea and spoke to both of my parents. This is how the conversation went down:  
Me: Hey ma, instead of everyone being at the wedding, would you consider shouting us an engagement party?  
Dad: What?! No! That’s too expensive!  
Me: Huh? Wouldn’t that be cheaper than paying for 16 people?  
Mum: If our family isn’t there, your nana won’t be there, and I won’t be there. I’ve supported you long enough and I won’t be there if you don’t invite my family.  
Me: \*starts crying\* Well if that’s how you feel then maybe I don’t want you at my wedding!  
After that, I accused her of not being comfortable with just my immediate family there. My mum has poor social skills and can only talk to Filipinos (I am half Australian and half Filipino). She then accused me of forgetting my culture and catering to my fiancé who is very introverted. She also accused him of manipulating/controlling me into choosing an intimate wedding. Furthermore, she says she is going to expose the “truth” to my extended family that I don’t want them at my wedding.  
My fiancé stepped in to try and explain to my mum that we are trying to work with the budget that we have since we are paying for it. During this time, my dad was rubbing my back and explained to me that they were only going to pay for my mum’s 2 brothers and wives. So, THIS ENTIRE FIGHT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF MISCOMMUNICATION and I recognise I could have clarified before suggesting the engagement party idea. This fact along with her threatening and shaming tactics has gotten me down for the past week.   
My friend suggested to write her a letter about how I feel, but what do I even say? I’m still so angry. She is the cause of all family fights because she wants to control what we all do. My brothers and I have been disowned before for not complying with her demands She dislikes my sisters-in-law because they “manipulate” my brothers, or they’ve ‘changed’ my brothers. All I want to do is teach her a lesson and not allow her to invite my uncles and aunts. I feel like this would be unfair to my fiance's side as well as my dad’s sister and husband.   
With regards to the wedding, I just want to elope now. I never had a dream wedding and if I was asked before getting engaged what kind of wedding I would have it would have just been a simple wedding with just parents and grandparents in a chapel or on the beach.  
I guess I’m asking is how do I move beyond my stubborn feelings and try to reconcile with my mum, but also make her understand that what she did is not okay in a way where a huge fight won’t happen between us again? If I do write a letter, what should I focus on? More importantly, how do I promote good communication between us?  


Also, what are your opinions on eloping although you know your family will be sad not witnessing the wedding? I want everyone to be happy, but I keep forgetting that this is my wedding and my happiness matters most. Any advice would be appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
193,"We had been dating for 4 years and it was great but in recent months she became unhappy and she dumped me but it was more of break telling me she needs to work on her own happiness to be happy with me which is fair enough so I said I’d wait for her to be happy but she says to keep my options open. Skip to a month later she asks to see me so we meet up for lunch to talk. She says she wants to get back together in a few months after she’s hooked up with other guys at clubs and bars (not sex) she said I should to but I don’t want to at all I just want her back, but I said if she wants to do that I don’t wanna be with her anymore at all because I can’t look at her without imaging her doing it. She cry’s cause she wants to get back together eventually and she wants to do that, I ask why but she just says she feels ugly and I didn’t make her feel pretty enough and she wants the experience. So I gave her a choice that life or me, she pauses for a really long time and says can we still be friends, I say no because I love her to much she cries more we hug and I say bye, she chases me and says she promises she won’t hook up with other people and if she does she’ll tell me and I said okay but I don’t know if I can’t trust her now because of the fact it took her so long to reply I’m so confused everything is screaming leave her but I can’t, I’m just waiting at the moment for to message me back.

195,"two people are arguing, and things get scary, so i tell them i will call the cops if one of them doesn't leave. this works and things calm down, but then a third person gets involved and starts belligerently hurling abuse at one of the other two. i gently pull the belligerent person out of the room, he stops yelling and the situation is now in a place i feel comfortable leaving well enough alone.

so, even though things worked out this time, i have 2 points in this interaction where i don't know if i did the right thing:

1) was it right to insert myself in that situation to begin with? should i have just called the police without warning them? to be clear, i know all these people personally.

2) should i not have physically moved the 3rd person? in the past i've done that, and it only redirected the person's anger at me. also, i feel uncomfortable with the idea that i physically removed someone from an argument when i could have used words. the issue with that is the person was belligerent and wasn't listening to anyone. i feel like i should have called the police at that point.

199,"On mobile. Sorry for format. 


I am mostly venting here, but it does give some context to my situation. Anyway, TL;DR at the bottom. 

I (20f) need help deciding what to do. I made the biggest mistake of rooming with two girls who I roomed with last year. I'm in a non-traditional dorm on my college campus. Now this dorm is full of 6 girls total but there are two bathrooms and we all have our own little rooms (with paper thin walls and loud banging doors). It's three girls on one side and three on the other separated by a kitchen and small living space. 


Now here's where I'm at a loss of what to do. I live next to these two girls we will call Jade (18) and Amelia (19). Jade has her boyfriend, we'll call Grant (19), over literally every single night and during the day as well. Now Jade and Amelia lived across the dorm on the other side last year. And given what I went through last year with my other roommates, I decided that Jade and Amelia were the less of the 5 evils and that I would room with them again this year. Somehow living with someone across the hall is different than living with them next to you. And see, I didn't notice as much that Jade had her boyfriend over every day last year, too. But I was busy last year and not at the dorm a lot. 


This year, I have an early morning class and have to go to bed at 9 or 10 pm unless I want to be a grumpy mess the next morning at 7 am. The two girls and Jade's boyfriend are apparently late sleepers. As in they get ready for bed at 11 pm. I have noticed that whenever Grant is over (literally every night), the girls and him talk outside my door where the three bedrooms intersect. His voice is loud. They laugh, laughing is loud. Okay, whatever. I buy some sound proof tape to put along my door jam, play some music and white noise at night, put a door draft cover at the base of my door, and do everything I can to get to bed before they all congregate in the hall outside my door. Most of the time that would work, but sometimes it didn't. I would peak my head out the door if they were being exceptionally loud and tell them to be quiet. Most of the time they would get a bit quieter. But it's like they have no control over their vocal volume, because it would just go back up to the volume it was at before I told them to be quiet. This has happened every night since the beginning of the school year in September. I came to the conclusion based on the few nights that Grant wasn't over at the dorm, that Grant makes the two girls loud. It's like they talk over him since he has a louder voice. Or maybe he talks about exciting and funny things when he is here. Whatever the reason, he is loud which makes the girls loud in turn.


Okay so let's back track a little. I used to eat breakfast and dinner with Jade, Amelia, and Grant. This went on for all of last year and the beginning of this school year. I realized too late that all they talk about it gossip. I find it ridiculous that they are still gossiping in college, but whatever. To each their own. Except,  in addition to gossiping, they would all make stupid little jabs at each other and at me, all the time.... Talk about insecure. It took me back to the horrible friend group I had in high school. To top it all off, in the first few months I knew him, Grant made many comments about how SMALL my BOOBS are (WTF, tho?! Is that even okay to say?!) . (I assume he said these things because Jade, his girlfriend is a little over weight and I'm sure she's insecure, seeing as I'm actually underweight for my height.) But regardless of the reason he made those jokes, it made me uncomfortable. And from then on I felt uncomfortable around him. He was always giving me unsolicited advice about what I should eat and how I should work out. He would act all toughguy and explain to me what a term from football meant even though I had told him MANY times that I DO NOT LIKE OR CARE ABOUT FOOTBALL. Of course, it wasn't just me he was telling this stuff too. There were times I noticed he suggested Amelia do something, but Amelia seemed to like him, so she would either say a smart remark or just roll with it. She is also the most emotionless girl I have ever met, so Grant never gets an emotional rise out of her. But me? Yeah no, I'm emotional. It's in my genes.

So this goes on for a whole school year and then a few months into this school year. I finally get the guts to tell them I'm not going to sit with them anymore. I told Jade that I didn't like her boyfriend. And that was that. I stopped eating with them and hanging out with them in the main living space. Things were great for awhile. I didn't feel gross about listening to all that gossip anymore, or having to endure Grant's unrelenting advice. I thought my mood and overall mental health was getting better. Until I realized how much I hate Jade and Grant. Apparently I've bottled up a lot of hatred for them inside my head. I finally figured out that the reason I hate returning back to school on the weekends after I visit my parents isn't because I hate my classes, or that I have anxiety about being at school. I realized none of that was true. What was true, was that I hated returning to my LIVING SPACE because of them. I wasn't anxious about the school, but the dorms. 


I realized that I hate these two girls and Jade's stupid boyfriend. Because Jade is a spoiled brat and makes Grant do her chores at the dorm. Because Grant is practically a 6th roommate since he is over every single day. Because Amelia has no back bone and won't stand up for herself when Grant makes a stupid comment towards her. Because Jade will not respond to any type of assertiveness when being reminded to do a chore, or to be quiet, or to share the living space for the rest of the 4 girls who live here. Because Grant has this unrelenting need to be liked by everyone since he is so insecure about himself. Okay, maybe that last one is just an assumption based on a year and a half of keen observations. But look, I think y'all get the point. 


Most importantly, I think I hate them, because I've set my boundaries. I've set my boundaries and they keep disrespecting them. And I feel like whenever I stand up for myself and try to demand they respect my boundary of quiet hours, or of cleanliness, that I'm suddenly the bad guy. I'm the Debbie downer. I'm the DORM MOM. Seriously I feel like I'm the only one who cares about this shit. About adulting. The three roommates on the other side are a bit better with cleanliness and quiet hours, but they don't like confrontation as much as the next gal, and they won't have a roommate meeting to talk about these issues. About how often Grant is over here because they don't want to ""make Jade feel like she's being attacked"". Okay, whatever. I can't make people confront things that make them uncomfortable. I can't make anyone do anything.


The fact that I can't make people change is something I'm well aware of. But it made me think, does this mean that, even if I do confront Jade and have talk about boundaries and how Grant makes me uncomfortable and should be limited on the amount of time he spends here, will she change anything?


Because of this I've highly debated moving out. My spring break is coming up and I've already met once with the housing director. She wants to have a roommate mediation meeting with us roommates and a few RAs, but seriously is it really going to change anything? I think I'm at my breaking point. I've realized that my mental health and feeling of security is number one on my list now. So, I think I want to move out. My housing director is making it hard for me to do that though. And to make matters more complicated for me, one of my roommates from the other side told me that she would confront Jade and see if it helps. But she also said ""you've only got three more months left in the semester"". What I didn't tell her is that I want to move out. But now what do I do? She's right. It's only three months left of this horrible living situation. Should I tough it out and just stay here? Or should I move to another place where there are two other people living there with their own rules and routines already set...? I feel like I would be imposing on their living space. But I also think that I would be betraying my own values and boundaries if I don't move.

I'm at a loss. I feel like no matter what I do, there are consequences.

What do you think I should do? 

I hope I don't have to add an edit asking everyone to please be kind, as I'm already hating on myself for not realizing all this sooner. I also feel that, because I am a woman, this decision is even harder. I'm constantly worried about being labeled a bitch since I'm more assertive than other women around me. Regardless, I would appreciate some uplifting advice. Or even a cute picture of some doggos. Thanks for reading this far. I appreciate it.

TL;DR: I hate my roommates and a boyfriend of roommate who is over at my dorm all the time, being loud and making me feel uncomfortable. I have the option to move, but have three months left of school. Should I stay or should I go?",03Mar2020,1

201,"I apologize in advance for this being so all over the place.

I have a friend that we'll call Oscar. Oscar and I were on the track team together in high school, and he was always super nice to me, even though we weren't very close friends. Oscar was supposed to graduate this year (I graduated a while ago), but he got diagnosed with chondrosarcoma in December, a type of bone cancer. It's super rare for his age group he was set to get his leg removed since that's where the main tumor was located. He's been undergoing chemo ever since. 

The cancer ended up spreading, and the doctors decided to try a different type of chemo. Now, the doctors have realized that the chemo isn't shrinking the tumors like it's supposed to. They decided there are no other options, and Oscar has decided to spend the rest of his time seeing everyone before he goes. I found about about this today, and I can't really express how I feel. Like I said, we weren't super close, but to see him and his family in pain makes me beyond sad. I'm not sure if he even considers me a friend, though we did talk at school and I brought him a gift to the hospital after he got diagnosed.

My question is, how do I tell him goodbye without making him feel like I'm being fake or pitying him? Is it appropriate to get him a gift or something? I feel like I should know how to act in this situation, but I don't, and it makes me a little bit ashamed. Oscar is such a good person, and I know he has a lot of other friends to keep him company. He's the first person I know personally that is going through something like this. He's been fighting for so long, and I'm having a hard time imagining him being gone.",03Mar2020,1

203,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm in highschool right now.
So like, recently things have been kinda weird for me I guess.
Early in February of this year I ended an 11 month long relationship with my ex girlfriend after an admittedly rocky patch in our relationship that helped me realize that I wanted something different out of a partner. I don't regret my decision in the slightest and I am happy with my decision.
But I feel like I've noticed something with myself? Something that I don't really remember being there before. Like I'm constantly looking for a loving companionship to fill this like hole of loneliness in myself.
Very soon after my breakup I started talking to this other girl who had also gotten out of a break up and we were just kinda bonding over that and I guess we both got kinda caught up in eachother because we kind of developed feelings for eachother.
That only lasted about two weeks tho, after we had already started dating I realized that I didn't actually have feelings for her and I kind of just used her as an outlet for romantic feelings. So I broke up with her.
This has left me in a really weird position right now because I really feel like I'm just searching for something that I don't actually want but just feel like I do want and it sucks. It also doesn't help that I've kind of developed feelings for a guy this time, and this is like the first gay crush I've ever really had which is also kind of screwing with my head.
Like I really don't even know this guy too well as he's just part of a mutual friend group and we haven't directly interacted with eachother very much and I'm not even sure if he is into guys.
But I feel oddly attracted to him? It's really out of nowhere and i don't get it?
My guess is that I'm just searching to fill this previously mentioned void and that's scaring me from trying for another relationship right now.
But at the same time I do feel attracted to this guy? Like in ways I haven't really felt towards another guy before? And that's kind of scary to me too. Because if the implications I guess.
I've gone through shit before that's wound up with people thinking I'm gay and it really isn't a pleasant thing to deal with, especially when people just want to use it to demean and make fun of you.
I live in a more sub-urban midwestern area which really doesn't have the most progressive or accepting people and it's just kind of scary to think about the kinds of things I would have to deal with from others because of that. Like what would my parents think? Would it affect how my friends see me? What about the people who dont even give a shit about me? How would that affect their regular interactions with me?
Its weird.
I don't know how to feel about all of it.
It's really kind of a lot.
And I'm just really scared of myself and the future right now. I just don't want to mess up anything or hurt anyone or hell myself because that would just suck.
I know time and everything will help but right now I just want at the very least something to help me not stress out about this as much.

Thanks if you read this, sorry if it didnt make sense, or was hard to understand. I'm not the greatest at writing.
But if you have any questions or advice feel free to leave any I'll be sure to engage with as much as I can. Thanks everyone.",03Mar2020,1
204,"Throwaway cause this situation is uniquely shitty and I just want it separate from my other account. This is going to be long cause I need to get some stuff off my chest. 

**TLDR** Life is going to shit, broke ankle, got in car accident, losing friends. Have zero coping skills, send help?

I'm 24F, birthday is next week. 2.5 weeks ago I went on vacation to Italy with my best friend. We had amazing plans, a beautiful place to stay and holy fuck this would be the vacation of a lifetime. Day 2 i broke my ankle. I tripped in a pothole that was deeper than I thought. Suffice to say it absolutely ruined our vacation. Day before the last day I manage to set up a wheelchair rental. I did NOT want to miss our colosseum tour, that's the thing I was looking forward to the most. 10 minutes away from the Colosseum the wheelchair got stuck on a cobblestone and it broke. **I. Was. Devastated.** Once we got back to the Airbnb I went straight to the bedroom, closed the door and cried for about 5 hours straight.

I live by myself on the second floor. No elevator. And i broke my right ankle (I've got an air cast &amp; I'm non weight bearing for 6 weeks) So leaving the apartment is extremely difficult. And getting around my apartment is super difficult. My mom works in the medical field and had set up doc appts for me right when i got back to the states, cause she didnt trust the Italian healthcare system. She ended up going full karen on the innocent xray tech and crossed a LOT of boundaries with me. I've been pissed off at her since.

Later that same day the guy I had been dating for the past two months showed his true colors and was extremely insensitive to me in regards to my ankle. I ended things with him. I don't regret ending it, but I'm sad that he turned out to be an asshole. 

Couple days later I really need to go grocery shopping. Family members are busy, i ask a couple friends. They don't feel like it. Legit said they don't feel like it, so no. What the fuck? Neither one has apologized to me yet, i doubt they will. I've been reconsidering the friendship. I've considered them my best friends for the past 3 years and it turns out I can't rely on them at all. That's been particularly upsetting.

I was trying to continue on with life, stick to the positives, but it's really fucking hard. Getting around is exhausting, and I haven't been sleeping well. But I'm still managing to get to work every day. Except today. On my way to work this morning, I got into a car accident. I got rear ended, so it wasn't my fault. I spent the rest of today crying and napping. 

I was already extremely stressed before the car accident. And now i cant find words to describe how I'm feeling. I have the tendancy to bottle things up until i burst. So i'm trying to make things slightly easier on myself and find ways to cope now. But every coping mechanism i can think of, i cant do. I can't really leave the house, I'm pretty limited on friends right now, can't exercise, I'm not feeling ANY creative vibes so that rules out artistic expression, can't get myself to/from a therapist.

I don't know what to do. I just really want to stop existing for a while. I don't have any appetite, i've just been forcing myself to eat. My apartment is a mess cause cleaning is so fucking hard now and I'm exhausted anyways. 

What do i do to stop feeling so down?",03Mar2020,1

How can I not be so anxious and feel so dissasociated? Living without her is so hard. I know I probably need to just save up money until I can afford my own apartment or something. And for my anxiety, I currently take L-Theanine. It doesn't do too much for me though.

206,"Okay, so I really need some advice on this. I have four other roommates. One, A we shall call her, moved in in October. We quickly noticed problems. I live with all girls for starters. We had a regular sized garbage can in there, and before she moved in, it was filled with your typical girl things (pads and what not) along with the occasional tissue and empty toilet paper roll. Once A moved in, the garbage quickly began to fill with toilet paper which was strange. I brushed it off until I saw her fecal/bodily fluid on the toilet paper in the garbage. 

Unfortunately, there were other problems so all roommates met with our RA’s and it was brought up that we should flush our toilet paper. We all agreed and this blame wasn’t put on anyone specific, just stated very generally. This was in probably early November. 

It is now March and instead of a regular garbage can, we have a little one that one would just have in their room or such. Because of sanitary reasons, I do not want to touch the bag when it needs to be tossed out which is garbage.

My addiction started when i first played Minecraft and now I've turned 18 it has taken over my life, I have no close friends and I hate my sister. My parents are nice but don't understand my problems and i can't talk to them about anything personal. 

After 2 years at a new school, all boys again, as it has always been except for when is was under 12. I haven't made any friends and the loneliness really started getting to me last year in the summer, so I told my mum and we went to the doctor's and applied for mental health support.

Turns out I probably have high functioning autism, severe social anxiety (which I knew about), an eating disorder, insomnia (which is also hard to miss) and a load of physical health problems. Since asking for help I've had assessments with 3 different services and have been offered only 4 half hour sessions of therapy, 6 months after I asked for help.

What's more, my well meaning parents emailed my teachers and head of year about all the problems I have like, for example, how i can't pee at school because of anxiety. Now everyone at my school knows about it and doesn't speak to me. I get special treatment in everything, so at least i avoid public speaking, but i don't get any help in class because the teachers know not to ask me and I'm going to fail my a levels (qualifications you need to go to university). 

All this has increased my anxiety to worse than it was last summer and I cope by eating unhealthily and playing video games, both of which aren't helping my physical health problems.

Presently my main contact has been an American girl who is nice to me, but learning about how exciting her life is just reminds me how shit and lonely mine is. The only silver lining is that I am in a youth band, however I'm gonna be too old for it soon and then I'll finally have nothing to do, no one to love and nothing to look forward too.

I don't know what i expect posting here, but please don't suggest i 'get out more' my social anxiety prevents me leaving my house and sometimes talking to people altogether.",03Mar2020,1

213,"So I recently found a way to get in contact with a good friend I had when I was around 6-12. 

We both moved a lot and managed to stay in contact for a while, but I lost all contact with her when my family moved out of state. 
Recently I got a bit curious and tried to look her up, but I couldn't find any social media accounts of her. The closest thing I found to her is a musician at a Boston college (I'm going off a 10+ year old yearbook photo) and I'm not 100% it's her, but it looks a lot like her. 

After a while of looking around I was able to find her number from an old phonebook and found a more recent number. 
But based off her not having any form of social media, I'm not sure she wants to be found. 
Should I try and contact her or do you think she'd rather be left alone?",03Mar2020,1
214,"So basically, over the course of the last few weeks I’ve been trying to get a handle on this situation. Long story short, this girl from my class dm’d me over Instagram after searching for my name to ask a question for a test we had last week. I answered her question, but for there we started chatting and realized we had some things in common and have been messaging her every since. The test comes we write it, I then proceed to ask her if she wanted to be partners with my for a podcast you can do with a partner in class. She said yes, and we exchanged numbers and since then we’ve been texting daily . Last week I also asked if she wanted to come to an art show, and she came and had been pretty drunk beforehand and was being pretty flirty with me. I decided not to make a move only because I was sober, and I feel like it wouldn’t have been right to take advantage of her drunken state. She also invited me over to stay at her place that night, but I couldn’t since I had Work and class the next day and all of my things were at my place that I needed to pick up for a early morning, the next day. Since then we rescheduled for me to stay at her place tomorrow, to work on our podcast project, but since I’m staying the night tomorrow I feel like it’s bound something might happen. I’m a virgin and I’m quite nervous, on how to approach the situation tomorrow, so does anyone have any advice on what I should do or how I should proceed to try and pull a move without making things awkward?",03Mar2020,1

He always kept his family hidden (oh you would hate them) and he tons me his mother is an alcoholic, he would see her once a month to check on her or so, and I was totally fine with that. It wasn’t until last year where things got kinda bad. She lost her job and then it became seeing her every week to get her groceries and right before Christmas she got evicted, and he canceled birthday parties, work, holidays that he planed with me to help her. This is when I asked if he could set boundaries between her us and our relationship. On Valentine’s Day, he told me he bought the engagement ring I have been eyeing up, and that he would not invite his mother as an act of faith that he is working on his issues. Well, I started some planing, now his family doesn’t have money so my family will be paying for it all. My family is much older. So blood family I have about 7 and he has around over 50. I still have not meet them. He says I’ll hate them and truthfully says I would honestly think they would ruin our wedding in his eyes (super rowedy, a lot of drunks/drugs/ loudness) and like I’ll be honest. I’m really second guessing. It’s his family and I should see them as my own but as a family of divorce, with my dad’s family mirroring his.

221,"My spouse has had a pet dog since I met them. This dog has always been destructive and disobedient. Obedience classes don’t help, therapy toys, open spaces, closed spaces, treats, discipline, etc, etc. nothing works. This dog will pee in the house if our child gets more attention. Our kid is terrified of this dog. It’s a 9 year old dog. This dog has only ever obeyed my spouse and has caused me to have many panic attacks and to feel stressed and overwhelmed each day. I LOVE animals. We have had many other pets over the years and our other dog can be a handful but nothing in comparison. I’ve never felt so unhappy over an animal. I’m disappointed in myself for feeling this way. Anything you say about me being a bad person isn’t something I haven’t already help so please don’t waste your breath insulting me further. I love my spouse and never want them to feel the pain of having to give up a pet but I am becoming resentful to them. They know how miserable this dog is made me and our child and instead of doing anything they get mad that I am unhappy in the first place. I don’t know if I can take another few years of this dog. The dog is relentless. My spouse would choose this dog over family. I have had plenty of pets and I know adopting animals are a lifelong commitment no matter how tough but this dog has broken me.

Hello everyone,

Iam a 23 yo who graduated with a science major and got into med school.

I struggled in med school during the first year, and found out it isn't my calling. I withdrew, and Now, I am $50 000 in debt and don't know what to do with my life. My parents have stopped talking to me and are rightfully dissapointed since I should have never started.

I always loved dentistry, and I feel I could manage to study for the DAT (dental admissions test). But I am just sad due to how much money I blew in just one year.

Am I in a very bad position?",03Mar2020,1

225,"Sorry! My post is kinda lame, but I just need help with understanding PKD and the pathophysiology behind ADPKD and ARPKD. I am not sure why I am having trouble here yet I am, maybe it's bc all of the websites I find are ncbi and they are too advanced for me, and i am getting overloaded with all types of information and no way to organise or understand it all. ADPKD is caused by a mutation in genes PKD1 and PKD2 which code for proteins polycystin 1 and 2 respectively. These proteins help with cell proliferation and fliud secretion and the mutation inhibits them? I am not sure, same thing with ARPKD. If anyone can help me understand it'd be greatly appreciated, thanks!",03Mar2020,1

Hello! This is my first time posting on this sub but I’ve been looking through to see what fellow people do or think. But I’ve been having my own issues and I need helping finding out what’s wrong or what I should do. So, I have a girlfriend and we have been dating for a year and a half. But lately, I’ve been feeling weird about it, like I’ve been an introvert for my whole life and I kind of miss being single, being with myself was all that satisfied me and that’s all I needed and I miss being alone and being by myself. I know it sounds sooo selfish but seriously I feel this way, I hope people can relate. It is like this burning in my chest that bugs me every night and everyday. My gf is a clingy one who tends to stick with me every second she gets and it gets tiring, no time for my friends and they make fun of me for it. I feel like I’m not ready to commit to a full of relationship and idk what to do, I love her, sounds cheesy but I serious have feeling for this woman and wanna do the best I can to be with her but it’s draining me... I’m gonna sound like a douche but sometimes I lie and say I’m going to bed or have to do something but then I go lie down and watch YouTube or just sit and relax. I feel like a horrible person but I keep doing it. I find myself being attracted to other women but I’m not the type of person to do anything about it and cheat like some people. What do I do? I want to keep her but at the same time it drains me, it hurts me, it is taking time to build my character and to fix my grades and to focus on what I’m gonna do with my life. Is that just selfish?!

228,"I am currently in grade 12 and will soon graduate. I plan on taking a year off before applying to a college, (not university, I live in Canada) and want to join a sports team, specifically the volleyball team. I find volleyball the most enjoyable of all the varsity sports, however I have minimal experience with the game. I have only played volleyball in gym class for a total of a month and a half in my life (6 weeks in the span of three semesters). How realistic is it for me to make the team if I find a way to practice during the one year gap between my graduation and application for college?",03Mar2020,1
229,"This is going to be a long one.

I’m in an online relationship currently. Have been for about half a year. I’ve enjoyed it a lot, and she’s supposed to be coming in less than a month. But I’m having some really bad thoughts/emotions. 

First off, I live in Georgia and she lives in Canada. It’s not like she can just come down whenever and vice versa. Whenever we want to see each other, that’s about $1000 + for plane tickets, food, entertainment etc etc. I work a minimum wage job, and I’m pursuing a career in music so this is really hard to make doable. 

Secondly, I’m only 19. As much as I hate to say it, and as douchey as this might sound, I want to experiment sexually and have some fun before I get older. I just don’t want to trap myself in a relationship too early and then have regrets later in life, wishing I had lived a bit more when I was in my prime. 

Thirdly, online relationships are just hard man. It’s taking a toll on me. Every 2 hours I have to FaceTime her, I have to tell her everything I do, where I go. What my work schedule is. And honestly it’s kind of depressing me. I’ve lost a lot of my alone time which I love, and don’t have much of. Before I was in a relationship I was very content with being alone for most of the time, I need space to think and create goals and write music and I’m just not getting enough of that trying to balance talking to her and working. 

Lastly, she can just be too much for me sometimes. I really really don’t like saying this, because I’m all for helping people and I feel sympathy for everyone’s problems. But half the time she calls me she’s crying. Or midway through a decent conversation she has a panic attack and starts freaking out. And it is stressing me out. 

And this isn’t like, once a week or once every two weeks. It is every. Single. Day. She breaks down and I have no clue what to do or what to say or what the situation really even is half the time because I’m not there. 

She went to a medium recently and claimed that her mother (dead) spoke to her. I’m not a spiritual/religious person and I was basically just a sponge for her breakdown. I feel so bad but I ignored her for most of it. I’m just losing touch with this whole relationship. 

She wasn’t like this when we started. She was a very happy, fun, not super clingy person that I really liked and I think even loved. She’s an artist too and we made a couple songs together and I really love her voice and aesthetic and we really match up in those areas. 

But one day she was watching me play a video game, and then went on a rant about how scared she was to die and she hasn’t been the same ever since. 

This whole situation has been very frustrating for me, has taken a huge toll on my mental health and, essentially, has turned me into a pothead because I smoke way more now to tune out a lot of this stuff. 

I get being depressed, I get having panic attacks. I really do. But she is not doing ANYTHING to heal or help herself. All she does is call me, vent, cry, and then she’s fine for a day. Literally just goes back to normal, and then has a breakdown.

I feel like this is all out of order. I’m really just at a loss of what to do. But I haven’t even gotten to the advice part.

I can’t continue with this. I have a life to live. I have goals, dreams, all of that. And it’s just not going at the pace I need it too having to listen to her cry about fucking death for 4 hours straight. It’s just not healthy, for me or for her.

But I really have no clue how to end it. I haven’t given her any hints that I want to break up. It would destroy her. It seriously would. She’s way more in love with me than I am with her. She spam texts me so much, calls me 14 times over. She’s got a bunch of different nicknames for me, tells me she loves me and that she wouldn’t know what to do without me. 

I would literally destroy her life for a year + if I broke up with her right now. And I just don’t have it in my heart to do that to someone. But I also don’t have it in my heart to continue dealing with this stress. 

I really need some help dude. I’m just at a loss. I can’t hurt someone like that, and But I can’t willingly put myself through this either.",03Mar2020,1
230,"My wife and I have been married 21 years and we have a 14 yo daughter. I've always done the cooking, lunches and snacks, as well as groceries. I'm really tired of it but it's better than listening to whining. Problem is my wife doesn't do the dishes, or much of anything else. I get home from work and start supper right away, eat while we watch TV, and then I sit and rest from my day. Often I fall asleep for 5-10 minutes. We throw the dishes in the sink, and I will do them on the weekend or if I can't take it anymore.  

We have clothes in laundry baskets that has been there for a month, sitting in the kitchen (also laundry area) and living room. Laundry gets done when we run out of clothes.  My sunroom is full of recycling, probably 20 pizza boxes, a few bags of cans and bottles and a ton of cardboard. There's also about 10 large garbage bags. I either forget to bring them out or just don't feel like it. We had a fuckton of animals, 2 dogs, 2 cats and 3 birds. There's fur and birdshit everywhere. We always tell ourselves that we'll clean on the weekend, but end up playing video games or binge watching Netflix.  I want to clean but it's overwhelming, and my wife's lack of energy and will rubs off on me quite easily.  We haven't had company in years, except for my daughter's friend, but she's used to it by now.  

I like cleaning when they are out of the house, but they are never out of the house. Luckily March break is coming soon so I can get some work done. Any advice?

236,"My family is reeling right now. Yesterday morning my mother received an email from family that lives far far away that my uncle/godfather, her younger brother passed away. This was extremely sudden for us, and later we found out he was ill with cancer for 9 months, but his wife and daughter didn't bother to tell us. In fact, his wife didn't even intend to tell us, and my cousin decided to against her wishes. He didn't have a phone, and was the type to keep this sort of thing hidden. We assume that we were never told this is because his wife and daughters never got along with us, and because they wanted to keep the apartment they were all living in to themselves. More on them later. The dilemma I and my mother are wrestling with is whether to tell grandma her favorite son has died. Obviously my mother and I believe that she has a right to know but.... it might also be the most cruel thing possible, and it could, we fear, actually kill her. She is a very emotional, childlike person in a sweet way. She also has been having heart, and chest pains, and is over 80 years old. We're terrified that if we tell her, she will have a heart attack and die as well especially since he was basically the reason she lives for. She's had multiple clinical deaths, has passed out randomly in the street, and whole host of other difficulties in her life. At the same time, this is her child, and of course she would want to go to his funeral and say her last goodbye. The flight there is over 24 hours, and we think she could pass out on the plane there like she has before. My aunt is very likely to start a big scene and make it even worse for my grandma. The woman even sent an insulting text to my mother and told her that she didn't have the right to return to her home country and that her brother didn't want to see her and that she was an all around terrible person.

241,"Probably alot of you will think I'm in the wrong with this situation but here we go.

One month ago my mom was ""talking"" (I quote this cause she was whispering, so probably no one else hears) to her boyfriend. And I was walking by and heard. So later in the day I asked her about it. 

She was saying that her and her bf might go Newfoundland in October to go to his sisters (btw she hasn't met none of his family, and she told me she never wants to) wedding, but she said she's not sure yet (which in her language means no). Fast forward tonight.. I was in my room and I hear her go into her room talking about what days should she take her vacation days in October (so there going).

Now, the problem. We live in Ontario and she's going to Newfoundland, most people would take an airplane, right? No, she's wants to take the only car we have. She's going for 7 days.. but I doubt that. Since she's talking the car it will be way longer. 

So she's leaving my sister, (20) brother (13) and I (23) in Ontario without a car. Where we live the closest grocery store is a 45min walk. Bussing could take up to an hour (where I live the routes are weird). What happens if there's an emergency? 

I don't know guys what should I do? My siblings and I feel like 2nd place right now. I don't know why he can't go himself (oh wait, he can't cause he's a man child that always needs his hand held and my mom like worships him).

243,"So I need advice from someone other then my sister who is now like my second best friend. First and foremost I realize there are bigger problems in the world then these small teenage problems.... but that being said these problems constantly wear me down as I deal with a lot of mental tribulation.

Sooooo it all started when I first met my current boyfriend. At first my best friend also important to note she is my cousin (yeah haha sad I know) so I have always had trust issues especially with my cousin because she seems to think that just because the things I tell her aren’t a big deal to share.... they are to me. That being said I had regained trust in her up until recently.... 

In the beginning of my boyfriend and my relationship she liked him for me she was all for it. As my boyfriend in I got closer and my cousin and I got more distant I started to feel a shift in our relationship. She would constantly tell me my boyfriend isn’t right for me we’re not the same, I should just end it before I get hurt, etc.... I let these things slide without telling my boyfriend because I wanted them to have a good relationship I would always defend my cousin after my boyfriend would be rude to her and I just wanted them to like each other. NOW THAT THEY DO BOY I WAS SO WRONG.... they seemed to have formed a close connection over music and my boyfriend has offended my music taste and just constantly tells me how good her music taste is and how mine is “trash” and how he texts her lyrics and she finishes them off. I went to a concert w my cousin and some friends of the artist that my boyfriend and cousin bond over. She recently asked me to go to a festival for the same artist and I said no because I don’t have the money, time, or energy.  

I forgot to mention she told my boyfriend something personal about my family before I even found out and told my boyfriend not to tell me she told him. I did not confront her as I didn’t want to make it a bigger deal. 

Anyway back to the point.... Since I constantly tell her I won’t go to the concert my boyfriend told me she told him to go with her. I don’t know if her intention is to just go with him or making him go so I go. I don’t have any doubt in my mind she would be 100% ok to go with him alone. It kind of hurts knowing my boyfriend wants to go and would feel fine going and probably has considered it. 

This is my dilemma it hurts to see how close my ex best friend/ cousin and boyfriend are. I don’t know if that’s just me being a jealous psycho bitch or not. My cousin has always been a bitch to me and shit talks to me with my boyfriend and it just kind of sucks. I know I would never want to be as close to my cousins boyfriend as she is to my boyfriend. I have another cousin and I could never be comfortable having the same kind of relationship she has with my boyfriend. 


TLDR; my cousin/ ex best friend who is very judge-mental wants to go to a concert with my boyfriend alone...  

HELPP I left out so much but this is the gist of it I literally don’t know if I’m just being insecure and need to suck it up. I’ve talked to my boyfriend about the whole thing but I don’t want to annoy him about the same problem again. I don’t really want to talk to my cousin because she’ll just turn everything on me and say I’m being dramatic and turn my other cousins on me. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",03Mar2020,1
244,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a week. We are both new to dating. Being a bisexual female dating a female is tough. I’m in a small school and town where everyone knows everyone. My parents would not be supportive about me being in a relationship that is not with a person of the male gender. 

My girlfriend asked me to prom and we aren’t even sure if that is allowed in our school. But I’m not sure if I want to go. If I went to prom with her I would have to tell my parents about her and I dating. 

On top of those problems the entire school finding out is a big factor. Our school is the worst in the area for bullying. We have had countless suicides in our school because of bullying and sexuality. I’m not ready to be the one in the school taking all the bullying from dating her. 

I need advice on if I should go to prom? And how to address my concerns with her. Also prom is soon and I don’t really want to go. And I think she does. If anyone has advice please let me know your opinion.",03Mar2020,1

246,"Hi all, this is the only place I can think to post this, I need some advice. I'm a 25 year old woman living with my partner in an apartment. We have two pets, a three year old cat, who I'll call Pete, and a 2.5 year old blue-tongue skink, who I'll call Remy. I got Remy about a year before my partner moved in (18 months ago), while we adopted Pete together about six months ago.

While I do love Remy, our situation has changed so much since my partner moved in and, unhelpfully, he's gotten less willing to let me handle him and more likely to be aggressive. I do my best to provide a good environment for him, but I don't have reptile experience and I feel like I can't provide what he needs. Pete has been the opposite, warming up to us more every day, and it's been a wonderful experience for both of us. Because of this, we're discussing getting a second cat.

This is where we run into a problem. Three pets is more than we can reasonably manage, both in terms of time and finances. So, it crossed my mind that we could rehome Remy, hopefully with someone with more experience in reptile care. On a purely practical level, this makes perfect sense. Remy made more sense as a pet I had when I lived alone and my situation changed. But as soon as I started to consider it I started to feel incredibly guilty.

I'm worried that even considering rehoming Remy is incredibly selfish of me, it's not his fault he's not as affectionate as a cat and it was my decision to get him in the first place. I feel like following through taking care of him is the right thing to do. It's not an easy choice to make even if I do decide to rehome him, because I really do love him and am very attached to him, he just doesn't seem like the best fit for our family right now. 

What do you all think?",03Mar2020,1
247,"So randomly today she received a text along the lines of “I am a private investigator hired to investigate your husband (Man A) he has been having multiple affairs with Women A, B and C (sister). I have copied them into this text”.  The investigator doesn’t state their name or who hired them, but their phone number isn’t private.

So Woman B and my sister both haven’t had anything to do with this man, they are just loosely associated with man A through work networks. The thing is, woman A has had a long affair with man A. My sister is terrified she’s going to be implicated in something she hasn’t done, and have her reputation tarnished in the workplace. I am baffled at why a private investigator would text the supposed guilty parties, to me it seems like a scam but the fact woman A is actually guilty throws things off. 

What are my sister’s options? Call this “investigator” directly? Contact a solicitor in case of defamation? Write it off as a scam?",03Mar2020,1

249,"This might be a long story but I’m not sure how to concise it for now. Going to have to give some backstory on the issue. MAlso going to try and be as vague as possible when giving details about my job.

I work for a small engineering company and for the past few months it’s been pretty awesome. I’ve hoped this will be the job to finally help me find my footing and turn my life around. 

Sadly the office has a lot of drama. People either completely neglect their responsibilities and make more work for others or their malicious actions just cause a lot of trouble. Since I’ve been here I’ve heard several stories of past employees getting fired and so far one has been fired. 

I have a coworker (who also trained me) who is very close to one of the bosses and they always tell me about how they had issues with the people that were let go. Prior to the coworker that was just let go, my trainer spent a lot of time pulling the boss into a separate room to talk about them. I’ve picked up on this being the warning signs of something bad happening for whoever they are talking about.

Well now it’s my turn. 

My boss and trainer have pulled me aside into a meeting a week or so ago where I thought it was a discussion for a promotion but come to find was a discussion about how I don’t do my work and I’m too hesitant when helping clients (according to my trainer). 

I explained to my boss that I was not aware of everything I haven’t been shown yet. (I mean how would I know to ask what I don’t...know? Since my boss asked during the meeting “What do you feel you still need training on?”) 
I also stated that I wasn’t hesitant when helping clients, I may not always know the answer to their questions but then I redirect them to someone who does. 

Guess these answers weren’t good enough.

Today in particular really put me over the edge due to a couple of incidents.

1) I asked my trainer a question simply to verify that I’m doing something correctly because we talked about the special conditions of this particular client’s work before. But their response was to go off on me, condescendingly tell me what I already know and then answer my question. In short, I did it right.  They constantly respond with some form of an attitude or annoyance whenever I ask questions. Shortly after this they go to our boss to complain about how I don’t understand something we’ve already discussed... 

So I decided to keep to myself and focus on my work for the day. If I had questions I’ll just ask the boss. 

2) The boss asks why a particular assignment was still on our website and not completed and if there was something wrong with it. My trainer said no. Boss asks again “So why is it there?” My trainer decides to tell my boss that they should go into the break room and talk about that. In short, let’s talk about why I’m not doing it on top of the fact that I’m the only person answering the phone (because my trainer has decided that they will not answer as long as I’m there), trying to help clients, complete my own assignments (which I had at least 3-4 to work on today), and complete our web assignments on my own... that suddenly one company that my Trainer always takes care of is sitting there too long and now I don’t do my work. 

The fact that I’ve been pulled into a meeting for this and they constantly talk and whisper to each other about me only lets me know that it’s a matter of time before I’m on the chopping board. 

I’ve been incredibly stressed about it, on the verge of a panic attack all day, and I need to talk to my boss about this but I’m not sure how and I’m not sure if I should. One thing my boss has picked up on and stated is that I don’t stand up for myself enough and lack confidence. They probably expect me to come to them and speak up/tell my side of the story.

What do you guys think?

I’m sorry this was incredibly long once again... and I appreciate it for anyone that stuck around to the end. If need be and if curious I can add updates to this.

I’m maintaining my anonymity here because my wife uses Reddit. 

Here’s a breakdown of the situation:

My 13 year old daughter has an iPhone that my wife bought her. I was fine with it at first but I snooped one day and found some extremely racy pictures of my daughter that she had been sharing with some boys at her school. My daughter is more “developed “ than most of the girls her age. Needless to say, I was distraught. 

I mentioned this to my wife and she will not take the phone away because she feels more secure with her having it. I suggested that we buy her a flip phone without a high definition camera. It doesn’t make sense to me that a kid her age should have access to technology like that. 

My wife KNOWS what she’s doing and isn’t doing anything about it. She fights me at every angle on this. I don’t want her having that phone and potentially ruining her life at such a young age. I don’t know who else she’s sharing this content with and it scares the shit out of me.

What do I do?",03Mar2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 17 years old and recently moved into a house with a bunch of people I've never interacted with. I struggle with social anxiety and never really interact with people much outside of my family. This change was also really sudden and unexpected. It's not like I don't want to be here, this opportunity I was granted with was huge and a lot of people would want to be in my shoes, it's just I'm not sure how to adjust. I will have to work with these 10 people for the months i'm here and build a relationship with them and work with  them. It's just very overwhelming as it's hard for me to communicate when there's a bunch of people around me, as i'm used to being alone in my room. We have privacy and so forth, but during the day we are required to sit in a living room and basically work for hours around each other. To add on, I am new to the house and everyone already knows each other, so it's much harder for me to adjust.

&amp;#x200B;

I am unable to talk to others without feeling like crying. I miss having privacy and so forth. I feel like I wasn't really mentally prepared for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to seek advice on how to feel at home and adjust to this setting. I really want to be here, and it's my first day here, but honestly, if this keeps going on, I might break.

265,"I started to notice the following in my boyfriend and I want to know if he is just needy or if they are ""red flags"". Whenever I hangout with my friends (we barely hangout, maybe like 1-3 times a year) his mood changes because ""I'm not paying attention to him"", but what's the point of meeting with your friends if you'll be on the phone texting with your significant other the whole time? I noticed that somehow whenever I would hangout with my friends or visit my sister he would get ""down"" because ""his mom was blaming him for something or she was annoying him somehow"". If I told him I was going to visit my sister, he would often start asking ""until what time are you going to be there"" ""are you coming over?"" ""what time are you coming over?"" ""are you going to stay over at your sisters?"". It came to the point that I stopped hanging out with my friends and I even stopped going to my sister's house. When we made 5 months together, we made plans to meet in the morning but I had to cancel because my friend had an emergency. Her and her husband got into an argument, he was drunk and hit her and she was left alone in her apartment so she called me in the morning asking if I could go over to her house because she didn't know what to do, I did, it was around 7-8am when I went to my friend's house. I told my boyfriend I was going to be late because my friend needed my help and I even explained the situation to him. I noticed he became annoyed and said he had a ""really bad migraine"" and started asking if we were going to see each other and he even made a comment which really got me upset ""I started thinking, If me and your friend were in the hospital, who would you rather visit?"". Another time I was at my sister's house and he was at work, he started telling me that another guy started hitting on him and even gave him his instagram to follow him. A week later he continued with the story, saying that the guy came back and continued flirting with him and he even gave me the name of the guy. I trust him so I didn't make a big deal about it. Two weeks later, I was going to show him a page on his instagram and in the search history it was just usernames with the name of the guy so I asked him if he was interested or why was he looking for the guy? So he had no option but to tell me that he made the whole story up because to see if I would give him more attention. That gave me ""trust issues"" and I'm even questioning if there's something wrong with him? is he trying to manipulate me or if he is just needy.",03Mar2020,1

A bunch of the kids think that we are married and we always call each other husband and wife.  We sometimes like to keep up the joke even when we’re not around the kids and we have little story lines.

So I’m Jack, and I’ve been talking to my best friends girlfriend for about a week and a half now, I’m wondering if this is bad or not because we have stayed up multiple nights talking to each other via insta. It started when she messaged me about a post I made and from then on we have been having an ongoing conversation since. We have talked about a lot of stuff, animals, family, our drives in life, our background, everything, and all of it is very similar. Even our taste in music and favorite Harry Potter movies are the same. She has shared some personal info with me and told me not to tell her boyfriend. As I have caught some feelings I never intend to do anything with her at all that would jeopardize their relationship (unless messaging her is a bad thing in which case I mean anything besides that). I don’t know her feelings as she has praised and connected with both me and her boyfriend, though she does say that she loves him very much so that makes it pretty obvious.

270,"I went in for my first day today at a new restaurant job, and me + a couple other servers went out for a smoke break. We started talking about our old jobs, mostly about old coworkers and crazy stories we’d heard. I mentioned at my old job (a popular fast-food diner. I’ll let you guess) and then told a conversationally couple relevant stories about some of my coworkers (no names ofc) showing up on painkillers/meth/etc, as well as people stealing from the restaurant. One of the servers i had stepped out with then got close to me and said. “We’re much more white here. You don’t have to worry about that.” The other server was already departing and didn’t hear.

Ironically, I was talking about a few white people. In the moment I wanted to speak up and say “they were white actually”, but nothing came out. I just sort of stood there, kind of taken aback. 

I know it’s not violent racism or anything, but racism is racism. I’m familiar with management, and i’m fairly certain they would handle it well if i said anything. Right now i’m leaning towards not reporting it, since I don’t want any heat in my direction or any untoward drama, but what he said was honestly sort of awful, and just left a bad taste in my mouth.

To start with the trivial issue, I want to be left alone at school. I have an ex who keeps following me around, and he doesn't say a word. Being around him is uncomfortable and he won't go away. I've asked for space multiple times before, and he still didn't realize I was being serious. I don't know what to do.

Secondly, my relationship with my family is beyond repair. To give context on what my relationship with my family is like: 

I used to cut myself in 8th/9th grade, and my mom would always tell me my scars were ugly and she didn't give a shit when I told her why I had them. When I first told her I was considering suicide, she told me I would go to hell because suicide is a sin.
I'm also gay, and I don't plan on letting her know until I'm able to completely cut her out of my life.

My parents and I fight a lot. Mostly over comparisons between other kids, but anything goes. I don't like the fighting, I really don't. Whenever I try to compromise with them, they just pretend I'm not there. I suppose I shouldn't expect much from people with homophobic ideologies. 

Recently, it's been over walking to school. My new neighbors walk to the bus stop daily, and my parents have been constantly telling me that I should be more like them. 

To try and calm down, I decided to give myself an eyebrow slit, and I love it. It feels like something in my life I can control. My parents freaked out when they saw it. That I look crazy and like an abnormality. They said I'm a piece of shit and it's all the phone's fault. That their only regret is that they didn't beat me more as a kid. My mom prayed that ""hopefully someday I can become good person."" 

All I want is to cut them out of my life completely. Live completely alone in an apartment while I go to college. I don't have any money, and I highly doubt that's going to happen.

When i look at my accounts and how much i’ll be making each month, i can handle all the bills but i’m still nervous. is there anything i can do to make quick cash to help out with the bills? it’s too late to go back on any of these payments so i don’t know where to go from here.",03Mar2020,1
278,"I used to be a great student freshman year of high school, everything was done on time with high effort. Then I started slipping Sophomore year, little by little until my grades were A-'s instead of A's as they'd been before. I remember when I got my first B one semester, it stung a bit, but even more worryingly, it didn't sting as much as it should've. Now, Junior year, i have all B's. The school work has gotten easier, but I just can't stop procrastinating. Even now I'm sitting on a pile of stuff due tomorrow. And the worst part is I don't really care. Some rather emotionally and mentally damaging shenanigans happened near the end of Sophomore year and it's given me a lot of trust issues. I have no real friends other than my Girlfriend and my best friend who moved very far away a while back. My mother is getting increasingly annoyed with me but I don't really care about that either, in fact, the only reason I'm still living in this house is because it's free (though I'm sure as hell not). I'm slowly falling out of shape and I don't even have any drive to go anymore, even though I hate my body and myself in general.

Why am I like this? Why is it so difficult to do anything? why don't I care?

279,"I have been a perfectionist since I was a kid without knowing. I have always asked myself why am I putting this pressure on myself for no reason and why am I suffering? I just know today what it is I have been experiencing: perfectionism.

I have always tried to find the “perfect moment” to enjoy things, which is why I always avoid playing single player games. Now I can’t enjoy anything. I have to procrastinate and wait for the “perfect moment” and it never came.

Is it possible to overcome? Thank you.",03Mar2020,1
280,"The full story: About 5-6 months ago at the start of freshman year this girl (I’ll call her B) and her friend were asking me random stuff (do you like tats, I’ve never heard you talk, say something, etc.) I just thought “well social anxiety and awkwardness, is gonna make me look stupid again.” Surprisingly, although it still felt awkward, we eventually started to become casual friends. 

About two months passed and I wanted to think there could be something more but I said no don’t do anything stupid just stay friends, I got home from school and I was talking to some friends on Snapchat, I don’t remember how but eventually the conversation moved to people we like, everybody said who they liked then it got to me, I told them about B and the situation so far. They kept saying no way, you should talk to her and ask her if she likes you, I eventually gave in and texted “hey” and she texted “hey” back, but I freaked out and said “sorry I meant to text the group chat” she said “dang lol” ( I thought about what she said and kinda felt bad thinking that she actually might’ve wanted to talk) I went back to the group and said I froze up and nothing happened, they asked why I didn’t say anything and different stuff, I said I can’t do it I’m too scared to. About 5 hours later I get out of the shower and two of my friends in the group was blowing up my phone saying “hey I texted her and said you liked her, go text her she said she wants to talk to you” I had a heart attack so after I calmed down I said “hey” and she said “hey” I then started saying I’m sorry for whatever he said, and she never texted back. The next day at school at the end of third period she walked to her friend and I overheard her whispering to her what happened her friend yelled “oh my god!” And by that point I was ready to die, until I heard B say “idk I like him—“ then the rest of the conversation was cut off by the bell. 

About a month passed and I hadn’t talked to her, she kinda almost forgot me completely, until my friend (the one that told B I liked her) texted me and said “hey I noticed you’ve been depressed a lot, I’m sorry that I did that, it’s just I was happy that there was a chance for you to date her since she’s a once in a lifetime girl, if you want I’ll text her and explain that I was just screwing with you and it went too far and that idk if you actually like her” I told him I don’t care, do whatever he wants. He texted her and told her what happened, then the next day B comes and sits by me in third period, but she seemed different, she acted like she did a month before but almost like she was low key flirting. It confused me though since she seems like she’s more interested in the other guy at my table, but she doesn’t act the same, and she doesn’t look at him the same as she does me and it’s so confusing. Whenever I’m not looking (at our table, in the hallway, in the gym, etc.) she looks at me and smiles then acts like she wasn’t looking when I look her way, and occasionally she’ll say hey. 

She started sending me streaks on snap about 2 days ago, and she hasn’t been going home with her bf as much in the last week. 

The other thing that’s has me second guessing is her bf, he’s a junior about 6’4” kinda skinny built with some muscle,looks down on people outside of his friend group, and drives a new camaro probably an overall 7.5 out of 10 compared to most guys at my school.

I’m 6’3”, really pale, small beard, insecure as f***, average build, very little muscle mass since I lost 40lbs over the summer and haven’t been working out much, and I drive a older 1971 nova that I rebuilt over the last couple months. I’d say I’m maybe a 6 or 6.5 overall.

I just wanna see if I’m in over my head before I decide to do anything, the last/only relationship I had was 5 or 6 years ago, and she used me but I was to dumb to realize, I’ve had a hard time trusting/talking to people (mostly women) since.

I'm just worried that he's going to think that me being his friend and.. I don't know, doing friendly things is a sign that I like him back. I don't want to be *that person,* you know? I want to keep our relationship the way it is now: friends and nothing more.

285,"In highschool I was a huge gym freak. I would go every day after school and on the weekends. Definitely in my prime around grade 12 and college. During college I was going less, about 4-5 times a week. I was in a fitness program and I realized I enjoyed working out for sure but was not into becoming a trainer. After graduating college (2012) I hit a low were I was going 2-3 times a week. Was like this for a couple a years. After a while I was working a heavy job. Counter top installations and I was just to tired for the gym, I believe I haven't gone for two years. And then I picked it up again after getting laid off. As of now I go 2 times after work on the weekdays. And once on the weekend. It seems to be more of a chore. Something I need to get out of the way.

290,"So my friend (16f) and I(16f) have known eachother since we were kids and have gotten really close over the past 3 years, she would always tell me she considered me her best friend. Her parents to my knowledge have always been overly protective to the point of abuse. I’ve witnessed it firsthand and don’t really care to elaborate on that.

I’ve always known she’s had a lot of problems from them as she would sometimes mention it or freak out at the thought of going home. She would nearly always be grounded. 

Back in June she came over to my house and we smoked some joints I had so we could relax and she told me started to self harm. I didn’t tell anyone as she begged me not to and I wanted to be there for her. A few months later I started buying her weed as she kept having more problems with them and was always stuck alone at home. Eventually her dad found it and stopped allowing us to talk at all, if I did they would tell my parents basically so I didn’t see her until school started in August.

From that point until recently, we would sneak off when we could (she’d say she was with another friend) and just talk to eachother and drive around for a few hours, but it was getting really obvious she was getting worse. She’d start sobbing out of nowhere at school. Bleeding through her clothes, her mom even tore off her shirt to see where she cut.

So once school started back up in January, she didn’t show up. My friends actually called her mom but she told them to mind their business. For all we knew she could be dead we were at a loss and worried. 

Somehow when I went out shopping over an hour away from where we live she ran up to me and cried to me telling me that she got sent to rehab and still had another month there. 
That was a month ago now. 
Today I overheard our teacher saying one of her students was transferring to a homeschooling system after missing classes for a few months and I knew it was about her. 

I know her parents probably have her computer and therefore discord, but I’m dying to message her and see if she’ll respond now that I know she’s home. Should I risk it? I don’t want to get her in any more trouble, and I have no idea if she hates me now that things are different. Maybe I’m bad for her and should just let her move on?",03Mar2020,1
291,"Ive been looking for a local job for a while. Last Friday I had a phone interview with a company with a position that is pretty much a perfect job for my needs and lifestyle. The interview went great imo, but the lady interviewing me told me if i did not receive a call later that day, it means the company moved on to hire someone else.

So as you can guess I never received a call. Feeling bummed out, I look for more local job postings and my old mega carrier i worked for has a local dedicated position. Worse pay and its a night driving job which sucks but its work so Ill take it. I applied that Friday night, they called Saturday and things got rolling. I took a drug test on Monday and now all I had to do was wait for the background check to clear and take a road test the next week. After I took the drug test on Monday the original company I applied for gave me a call with a conditional job offer. I accepted it without letting my old company know I plan on taking that position. The reason for that is because if I failed the new company's pre-employment process, at least I have the job with my old company secured (local dedicated jobs seem to be hard to come by for me).

So with my old company I have a road test tomorrow, if I pass it im officially hired. I got a call from the hiring specialist at this new company today and they told me they are just waiting for ""verification"" from my old company. It's part of the background check, I assume they are checking my drug test history and my work history and then they will hire me (I already did a road test and drug test with them). This phone call came way late in the day however so I couldnt call my old company to let them know i can't attend the road test tomorrow. Part of me thinks I should show up and do the road test. Its first thing in the morning so either I show up and do it, or I skip it without a notice.

I am essentially just worried that I've blown my chances with both companies by leading them on, since the new company is in contact with my old one. Am I screwed?",03Mar2020,1

299,"Look, we both love each other very much. We broke up once but now, some two weeks ago, she asked me out again. I've been absolutely crazy for her since day one. Thing is, in the past relationship, she once ghosted me for a week and she still isn't active on places like SnapChat or WhatsApp so we don't talk much. Thing is, the first time we broke up, I went into a very dark place. This time, when she asked me out again, I was really happy - because I never stopped loving her but I also asked her if she would begin ghosting me again like the last time. She said she wouldn't because she was aware of the terrible mindset I was pushed into. 

Basically, it's all happening again. A few days ago, we had a HUGE argument on politics, and she said some things she shouldn't have, along with refusing to listen to my point of view. I kept on agreeing with her, but when I had to give my input, she just went on and on and on - never hearing me out. It is so FUCKING frustrating. Imagine if we had an argument on something personal. Shit would blow up. Then, we had a similiar talk  and she ghosted me for the entire day! We didn't talk that day - at all. Then, a few days ago, there was some violence outside my house - I consulted her and her reply to me saying 'there are riots going on outside' was 'ik same here a bit far away'. And that was a bit infuriating because my closest friends actually told me to take precautions and stay safe? I don't want to tell anyone irl about the issues with me and my girlfriend because I don't want anyone to judge her. She's a great human, loves hugs but then again, these problems are getting difficult to handle.

I love her. So much. And I don't want to have to pull the plug. We're both 16, closeted woman, and navigating through what teenagers call a relationship. I know if we break up again, I will go into a worse place. And before you say 'talk it out' - I have, as stated above, just when she asked me out again.

300,"Using throwaway for the same reasons everyone uses one. 

So after I had a string of bad roommates last year my friend and I decided to room together in a dorm room. It's a conventional dorm room, two beds in one room type set up. My roommate and I have gotten along really well because of our similar lifestyles. However, for the last semester she has really gotten into eating edibles every night. They help her relax she says, but when she eats them she gets really cranky and demanding. In general it makes me uncomfortable. It makes me sound like a prude, I know, but it just does. I can't explain it. 

Anyway, I have spoken to her about not keeping them in the room /doing them when I'm around, but she snapped that she had no where else to keep them except her bf's apartment or her backpack. Then she talked about her doctorate-holding mother doing them, yadda yadda, being super defensive so I let the subject drop. 

However, she continues to use them daily. I really like her as a friend, she is like a bff to me, but I really hate that she does this to herself. How do I get around this? 

TL;DR My college roomate/bff uses edibles to relax, but they make her really snappy and rude. I have spoken to her about not doing them /keeping them in the room and this was met with hostility. Is there anything I can do that doesn't include ending the friendship and/or moving out?",03Mar2020,1

304,"Hey everyone, as the title suggests I'm looking for advice on how to re-integrate into society.

The TL;DR is that I joined the military very young. Several years and deployments later I left the military and just went straight hermit. So trying to figure out how to be a person again.

Right. So I joined the US Army when I was 17 as a Combat Medic. Worked as a line medic in the Infantry, deployed to Afghanistan. X, Y, and Z. When I finished my contract I grabbed a ruck sack and just disappeared into the mountains. Spent like 3 years no bullshit just completely alone jumping around N. America hiking. No social media, no contact with friends or family. Outside of random chit chat with people while buying things like medical supplies, clothing, or the blue moon scenario when I would call my mom I would go months without talking to anyone.

I have made mistakes, i shouldn't have cut everyone out of my life when I left the Army. I understand that I messed up. As much as I want to make it ""right"" the more I fixate on it the more complicated it seems to get.

Ultimately, I just want to help people. For no other reason than because I feel like pretty much all life is more important than my own. And yes, I understand that that statement doesn't exactly make sense or whatever. But its what I feel, and I feel it very strongly. 

I would like to go back to helping people but I don't seem to know how to though. Every single time that I have tried to help people I seem to end up getting taken advantage of. Especially financially.

I am seeking mental health treatment. I also understand that it is not my responsibility to give people money or help them out of bad situations. But for some reason I keep finding myself in exactly those situations.

I have asked Google, my therapist, fellow/former soldiers, family members, everyone in any position you could think of that one would normally ask for advice.

I got rid of Facebook in 2013 or so. Have never had twitter or instagram or snap chat or literally any kind of social media outlet. 

Now, several years later, I have absolutely no clue how to get back to ""normal"" in a social sense. Part of me wants to just go back into the mountains. Another part wants to join the peace corps or something (I'm fluent in Spanish so I could probably get a posting somewhere especially already being a medic).

306,"Basically I am a paranoid little 15 year old who’s freaking out over the small stuff.. lemme elaborate

My paranoia stems from a lot of things such as relationship, schoolwork, friends, hobbies and sports.

Relationship: I always have this thought in the back of my mind that my girlfriend might be having doubts and stuff.. I know she doesn’t because I’ve confronted her recently if she’s okay and happy in the relationships we’re in and she said she was extremely happy despite having a few minor personality shifts here and there.. i just hope she isn’t lying..

Friends: I love my friends a lot but one of them in particular have so many mood swings that I don’t know how to approach him. One day in our group chat I sent a picture of statistics for a game and while everyone else was okay with it and some even liked it, that friend became extremely aggravated about it with no reason whatsoever. We’ve patched up our friendship since then but I am concerned about his well being.

Schoolwork: I like to consider myself as what a few people might call “the perfect asian kid”. Yes i’m asian and yes for the most part i’ve maintained a 3.8-4.0 gpa. The truth is even as a freshman my schoolwork is heavily prioritized to the point where i’m afraid of where i’ll end up. Teachers are already addressing school paths and higher education which scares the absolute shit out of me because i don’t know what i want to be. I’m in high school now and my parents emphasizes that fucking up will literally fuck your shit up. I’m also taking college courses to complete my lower GE every morning and the fact that i’m doing things that will permanently affect my  transcript is getting to my head negatively.

Hobbies: I’m stressed about the fact that i may not be able to pursue the hobby I want to get into. PC building sounds really fun and I want to get into it but the truth is my mom is strongly against it. A few months back i convinced her that if i earn it through a part time job it shouldn’t bother her, but she told me that she’d let me get the job under one condition - if i have a 3.8+ gpa. While maintaining my grades shouldn’t be an issue for me, I had a rough start for the semester that tripped over my opportunity to work. For starters I missed a few deadlines and my grades dropped drastically due to being sick and the first quiz i pretty much bombed on. All of my A’s are basically 90-91% and my math is an 87%. Furthermore my friend who got me into pc building is moving to Texas in August and if i do make it i can build the pc with him like we had planned, but it’s looking unlikely based on my grades..

Sports: This isn’t a huge stressor but it’s more of a crisis. Basically my swim team is split up between beginning swimmers and the more experienced swimmers, who end up getting in a mixed group full of different grade levels. I’m not sure if this determines who’s in Junior Varsity and Varsity swim but my teacher hasn’t really made it clear. I’m in the more experienced group but i still feel incompetent because most freshmen joining this year were extremely fast swimmers and i was just relatively average. I feel out of place but at the same time if i went to the beginning swimmers class I would probably outrank all of and create imbalance when we swim. I feel like i don’t have a place as i’m very meh. Also i missed a bunch of days for various reasons (picking up my grades after i fucked em up, dr appointment, sickness, etc) and i’m sure my coaches are fed up with my absences. I have 3 coaches and one in particular is extremely passive aggro and idk what to do anymore. 

Basically I overthink a lot. and sometimes idk how to approach situations effectively or constructively. I am as thin as glass some might say, and i wholeheartedly agree with them because the adversity that comes along with such a faulty mentality leaves me fearing for what to do with both my educational and social life. Do i need professional help? is something wrong with me? i just need answers.. oh and apologies for writing a lot. pent up emotions.. that’s all.",03Mar2020,1

I've stayed on the right path and I've always been (and still am) an all A student. The thing is, I'm just not satisfied and I've never been. I swear to God no matter what im into, there is someone who is always better. It sucks that I spend lots of time studying and practicing but I can't catch up. I've worked my way into taking precalculus in the 9th grade, I've skipped ahead two years in Chinese, and I'm trying to take physics over the summer to pull even farther ahead. I've put in so much work but it's never enough. There is basically one reason I'm doing all of this and it's just to try and feel like I'm worth something. There is this one guy I've spent my entire middle school life trying to catch up to, but I still cant. This dude is basically a senior in highschool but he's actually a freshman. He's two years ahead in science, two years ahead in highschool english, and three years ahead in math. I can guarantee he's done more, but he transferred schools for highschool so I wouldn't know. No matter how much work I put in, I can't catch up! Im already overwhelmed by the workload I have right now and I can't imagine trying to take even more advanced classes. I just don't understand what I'm missing! Why can he handle all of those classes but I can't? Why is there so much of a difference between me and him? I know I'm going to get the advice of ""ohh just don't compare yourself to other people it's not healthy,"" but how? What makes matters even worse is that there is another kid just like him at my school, but the only difference is that he is in my precalculus class. I can't even take 2nd place. It's getting harder for me to keep working but I know I have to. I need to study so I can get a decent job. My parents also keep putting on pressure and every time I'm feeling overwhelmed they just make things worse. I thought that if I advanced quickly in school my parents wouldn't bother me, but now they are giving me unrealistic standards. They think I'm some super human that can't get tired, so obviously I'm just being lazy when I'm unmotivated. Then I also have thoughts about being in a relationship but I know I wouldn't have time for that. I'm too busy with my sport and studies to give a relationship any effort. I feel so lonely and want someone to hug me and tell me that I've done good.  I want a break but I can't because I have to maintain my image of being one of the smart kids. I have to keep working so I can meet my parents standards. My intelligence is my only redeeming quality, but even then it's trash compared to others. Why do people think I have it easy for being smart? Why can't someone just say take it easy, you've done good. I guess I haven't done enough? How can I get rid of these thoughts? How can I relax?

Years went by, she and I didn't see each other much so my feelings died down a bit. When I was 15 I met my GF (13 then 16 now) who we'll call B, and we lived each other very fucking much. Puppy love shit, you know. A and I started to have classes together again, and the feelings started to arise some more, but they were significantly overshadowed by the love I had for B. 

About a year later stuff started to pile up for me negatively. Stuff with my parents and family health issues, failing classes, and B even broke up with me. It hurt then. I went by for 8 months all depressed, but A and I started being somewhat friendly. The feelings started to overflow, and I wanted to tell her. But I'm kinda fucking stupid, so I PMed her on Instagram confessing my feelings, and she was pretty reasonably creeped out. I had dumped a lot onto her

I fell back into a sad depressed state for awhile, and started dating B again. I love her very much but she doesn't spend time with me. Not really. B doesn't know about A, thankfully, but B won't spend any time with me so the feelings that should be building for her are building to A, who thinks I'm a creep and has no interest in me. 

But I can't stop thinking about her. I need A. I feel like I would die without her. When she talks to me to tell me, even to just say ""Shut up"" or something of that nature, my heart races. I get flustered when I'm around her, I feel empty when I don't see her, I feel like I need her. I know it's unhealthy as shit, but I don't know what to do. Do I tell B only for her to leave me so I can obsess over A on my own, is there some kind of secret to not be the creepy fucking weirdo I apparently am, what do I do man?",03Mar2020,1
312,"I am currently 15male. I go to a rougher state school then most. Fights, muggings and knives are not uncommon here. I don't carry a knife anymore tho . I just got out of school today. In period six my ""mate"" told me that there are some people planning to jump me. My friend is, by all means, a coward. He attempts to play both sides, talking shit about me to them, while talking shit about them to me and I can see right through it. But back on topic these guys, who he is friends with, asked him to me to frankston to ""hang out"" and then disappear while they jumped me 3 or 4v1. I've been in plenty of fights, group and 1v1. I have three years training in karate and mma. The people that are out for me, I used to be in that same ""group"" not eshay but all booze and fists. I left though, after my closest mates betrayed me. I have been jumped before, ironically while walking with the same friend, my ""closest friend of six years"" came up behind me and coward punched me. I hate that it makes him think hes tough, swinging against my head while hes behind me. He is a coward. So yeah, I have lots of experience fighting, but it has been a decent amount of time since a real one, I'm rusty in real fighting. I work out and am decently strong and above average height but these guys are all oversized kiwis and 16yr eshays. They offered to split my money with my friend and sell my shoes. Now i don't have a lot of money, and I'm not dumb enough to keep it on me. And I have never met them. I know it was him (my former ""closest mate"") he has been out for me for a long time now. He Knows them. He knows me. He wants me jumped and these guys are simply a means that insures i get my ass knocked while he doesn't get directly involved. My mate told me he told them that he would ""try but don't get your hopes up."" I understand that he would have been destroyed if he had said anything at the time (he is shorter and weaker than me and I could only take 1 or 2 before being overwhelmed) but he wouldn't even give me names, I had to do some digging on ig to find the main guy out to get me.

313,"I am a maintenance mechanic in the manufacturing sector. I have been doing maintenance for 4 years and also have only 2 years left until my bachelor's in this field. Ive been getring calls about taking a supervisor role. One starting salary is 65 a year with 15 percent raises every year and monthly bonuses as well. Sounds like a great opportunity. 

However. I am not the best mechanic, I'm not the worst either. I would say that people are not drawn to me but there are a few people that like to talk to me at work. 

I'm nervous about taking a role as a shift supervisor at this other plant because I dont have confidence in myself and I dont feel like I'm ready. I feel like school is such a basic way of saying heres several ways how things are done, in the occupation you want. But you might use one or none of these methods at all. And then they distract you with other courses like Philosophy of Law. That was a mini rant.

314,"(Sidenote: not gay or bisexual) I was thinking about this in the shower this morning that I have had way more men flirt with me irl than women have. I'd say atm, the tally is about 14 guys to 6 girls.

I remember a time I was in ny to see a concert (which just so happened to be pride month), I had 3 men flirt with me that night and another one straight up asked to take me home.

A possible reason I can see, is that when I see an attractive girl I steer clear (for a fear of sounding stupid), I make myself look like an idiot or sometimes it works out alright. And because guys are guys I'm more comfortable being myself around them and they like how I am. Or could it be the stereotype that girls want guys to approach them first? Idk I'm kinda spitballing.

316,"I (27F) started living with my parents a year ago, after being diagnosed with a serious illness. I knew living with my parents again would be difficult because they care my my sisters kids after school and on holidays. 
I have to be on a very specific diet to manage my illness, and I’ll buy specific treats, like certain types of ice cream, and such to satisfy my sweet tooth. I’ll eat junk food once every two to three days so a small box of anything lasts me a good amount of time. Now here’s the issue. 

My nephew (10M) is at the home 5 days a week. I’ve told him many many times what he can and cannot eat, and if he really wants something he should ask me first, and if the answer is no, he needs to be respectful of that. Well, his mom babies him, he’s her precious angel that can do no wrong. The past month he has been grabbing my food and eating it without permission, when I’ve scolded him, and asked him why he doesn’t ask first he says because I might say no. The past week he ate an entire tray of cookies, and today he ate more of my things. I’ve become frustrated because I bring this up to his mother (my sister) but she never offers to pay me back, or replace the food, she doesn’t even apologize. I texted her again today, and told her that she needs to start replacing my food if her son won’t fix his behavior, and she ignored me. Later I found out that she complained to our mother, and that she would pay out mother for the food. 

I need advice on how to approach my sister and her husband about how she needs to communicate with me not out mother, and how it’s not so much about the food, but the lack of disrespect. Also, am I overreacting? If I am, please let me know.",03Mar2020,1

Lately I’ve noticed she’s becoming super clingy to the point it’s annoyingly creepy. 
One thing that bothers me is that I can’t bring up anything without her taking over. Example, I’ve been with my BF for 4 years and he also works with us. She’ll always ask when we’re going to get married, I tell her i don’t know and then she suggests WE (her and I) start planning the wedding. 
Or I mentioned to another coworker that I’m thinking about having a party for my birthday in November, then she interrupts and says she’ll look up ideas and we’ll do it this way not the way I want. 

It’s really annoying and I’m the type of person to withdraw from people when I feel trapped. Like I said she’s very sweet and means no harm but I don’t know how to tell her she’s too pushy with her friendship. I don’t want to hurt her feelings.. but damn she’s suffocating me.",03Mar2020,1

I dropped out of college after my second year due to depression/suicidal thoughts.

Low and behold, I saw the girl that I was crazy over a few months before. I decided to not say anything to her as I was finally starting to recover from missing her so much and dealing with her rejection. She stopped responding to me in December and found her somebody else. It took me awhile to move on but eventually I started to get over her. Well as I was hanging out at the pre-game of the 21st birthday party, I was hanging out on the couch and she came and sat down next to me and told me about how much she missed me and that she made a mistake. She continued to tell me this continuously all throughout the night and so I decided to go out with her into downtown that night. I thought it went really well. She was holding my hand, we were dancing, and we even grabbed some late night food together. I stayed at her house on Saturday night and I texted her the next day and told her how I had a great time. She was slow to respond so I decided to text her again and essentially told her that I was getting mixed signals and I’m extremely confused how she could have told me those things last night and act like it never happened. I basically told her after a few messages back and forth that I was not going to tolerate being temporary comfort and that I would not be seeing her anymore.

334,"I was in a relationship for 4 years (from age 15). It was my first relationship and first everything. So I really just had no experience or any idea what I was doing but it all felt good and I was overall pretty happy, made some really great memories and experiences. I always thought my boyfriend was loyal and he was super attached to me and showed me a lot of love. Turns out he cheated on me. I think it was only during the last year of our relationship but I really have no idea. It completely blindsided me and totally shattered my entire idea of love and relationships and trust. I’m still very fucked up from it. 

Anyway, I met a new guy and somehow managed to pretty much fall in love with him. I have been extremely hesitant but there are moments where it’s just very natural and compelling and I can’t help but give in. He’s very sweet to me and everything seems good but at the same time, I felt the same way about my last relationship. There are definitely differences but I’m terrified of the same thing happening and that I won’t detect it. 

My ex hid it very well and didn’t show a whole lot of signs. I’m not being jealous or clingy in this relationship at all (I’m not really that type anyway) but I am being extremely apathetic because I can not afford to be humiliated again like that. So I keep myself very distanced in this relationship. And it sucks. I have these amazing moments with him where I feel very in love and it feels mutual and he tells me “I promise I’m going to marry you one day” and it feels wonderful. I’m so happy. But 10 minutes later I just think about how it’s probably not real or how one day it’ll shatter just like my last relationship. And then I feel stupid for showing emotion and for being vulnerable because I do NOT want to be humiliated again. Being cheated on like that for at least a year and not having any clue just absolutely embarrassed me. I feel so dumb and I do not want to feel like an idiot like that again. 

I’m just so hesitant to give any bit of myself to anyone again. It’s almost to the point where I’d rather just be alone than live in fear of having that happen again.

They used to live rent free with my aunt but to make a long story short, they got kicked out. I don’t really know what to make of them giving the dog up, since I know it would break my brothers heart. Here are the collective reasons people think they should: They are struggling to find an apartment that will take their dog and in an apartment she won’t have a yard/ free roam space. In an apartment and where they live now, she has to wear a zap collar for barking (she doesn’t bark much but she is very loud). The dog is alone all day for the first time in two years since my brother has to work now. She tends to act ‘depressed’ when alone all the time. But if we took in the dog she would have a yard, not be alone all day (i’m homeschooled, my dad works from home, mom is currently stay at home), not have to wear a zap collar and have another dog to play with + a shit ton of bones and toys because my dog is spoiled lol. And since my brother is tight on money, they have trouble affording extra toys, beds and bones, so we mostly buy them for them.

He has a post cutting service where he hires neighborhood strong guys to work for him, and it's a front for him selling crystal meth, ice, batu, whatever you call it. Shannon's biggest demographic of customers, as far to my knowledge, are his post-cutting workers. A lot of guys in my neighborhood who do jobs for him end up smoking that stuff, if they weren't already.

This is not a new thing, Shannon's been pulling this hustle for many years. In August 2011, when I was 9 years old and starting 4th grade, he hired my dad and older cousin to work for him, and right after that my dad got into that habit and went down that path, to the point where he quit his job, my mom left him that December, and he wasn't paying bills. He went to rehab in February 2012, and from then on I've only lived with my mom. My dad has since recovered and brought his life to a better place.

I am both worried and angry here. I'm worried about my brother, he has 3 elementary-aged kids and a girlfriend, I don't wanna see him go down the same path and lose his family. I'm also angry, at Shannon. He already got my dad all fucked up before, and now he's gonna do the same thing to my brother. I wanna see this fucking asshole drop dead.",03Mar2020,1
349,"i’m in a friend group of about 9 people. 4 of use are girls and the remainder are guys. I am a girl but i float around well between the girls subgroup and the guys subgroup. 

i snapped at two of my girl friends because i had a lot of pent up rage against them. they are constantly kicking me when i’m already down, are bad at listening to my issues when i will listen to theirs, and they generally just treat me like a child. they said something today, and it was the last straw on the camels back. I firmly told them i’m done with them treating me like i’m lesser and then stormed out of the room. 

i am really worried about how this may effect future dynamics within the group. my closest girl friend (the one i didn’t yell at) is best friends with the other two girls. i really do not want to be around those two for at least a few days...

I will graduate college relatively soon with a Finance degree. My GPA is 3.93/4.00 but I know that doesn’t matter for anything. I only mention the GPA because it shows that I tried... really hard. As hard as I knew how. I studied harder than anybody I know. I’ll never be able to find a job though. And I feel like I’m basically stealing from my parents at this point by living with them.

Originially, my mother didn’t have a close relationship. However, over time, we began to become close to eachother and I wanted to open up to my life about her more. I told her that I had lost my virginity to my current boyfriend. I’m 16. 

She is very religious and has wanted me to save my virginity until marriage all my life. Therefore, she got very very angry at me. She told me that I was no longer allowed to FaceTime him, to hang out with him, to go to his house, or have him come over to our home. She told me that if she found out that I had not cut ties with him, we would move to a new state.

This kid I had never really talked to that much was in my cabin, and he'd been going to my church for years, so I decided to try and connect with him and see if I could create a friendship. Him and I talked for awhile, and at one point he told me that he wanted to go explore the woods at night (we were in the mountains). So later that night, I got my flashlight, let our group know we were going to be out for a bit, and left. 
We went to the woods behind one of the larger cabins, and we walked around for quite a while. We eventually stumbled along a path that we walked on for about 20 minutes, where we talked about the various things that teenage boys talk about. At some point though, he admitted to me that he wanted to be murdered one day. He didn't want to live a long life at all, he wanted it to be cut very short by someone. He told me that it wasn't just being murdered that he wanted to happen to him, though, and that he wanted to be stalked and mentally tortured by someone before he was killed. I haven't told anyone else this yet, and I'm not sure if I can. He'd know that I was the one that told, and I don't want to know what would happen if he found out.

I work for a janitorial company at a very large factory so it’s not hard to just leave without anybody noticing, but I work 60 hours a week as I am in need for more money at the current time and I feel confident in my own work and take pride in working every hour and earning my money. I guess it just grinds my gears that this individual gets 2 hours of pay every day, especially since one of them is overtime pay, without even being on the property and our supervisors are well aware of what she does and lets it fly. Yet if it was me I’d be written up or fired. On top of this she’s been caught smoking weed twice inside the factory (by our supervisors who didn’t even care) twice when a simple lighter isn’t allowed due to very explosive chemicals and vapors that are produced. I have nothing against weed at all, just do it on your own time, and we get drug tested and that’s included in the test but they haven’t tested in the past couple years which is how that’s gone without notice.

361,"This is the first time I've ever posted to reddit. So I'm sorry for any formatting/etiquit errors that I may make. 

I am a junior in university,  dating a girl who is also a junior, and we just found out that she is pregnant. She is very consistant with taking her birth control, and knows for a fact that she didnt miss a pill or anything along those lines. 

We talked about it, and decided that neither of us are comfortable with putting the child up for adoption, or getting an abortion, meaning that we are going to keep the kid and stay together. Me and my gf have known eachother for almost 3 years, and were bestfriends long before we started dating. While the timing isnt ideal, I could see myself spending the rest of my life with this girl and starting a family. 

Despite this, I'm so scared I cant even put it into words. I'm still a teenager and while she is a little bit older and keeps promising me that it will be okay I cant help but be terrified. It feels like I'm still a kid and I'm already about to have one in 9 months and it just feels like too much. I would never leave her to take care of a child alone. I grew up without a dad and promised myself that I would never abandon my family like he did. 

Logistic wise we've talked about q couple things. For one, I wont be going to grad school anymore, and I'm going to get a job while she goes to med school and works part time. I'm going to be canceling my housing contract on campus, and move in with her starting this summer. Asides from that, it's just a bunch of adulting stuff like pooling resources, planning out schedules for classes/watching our baby, and just trying to come to terms with the dramatic life changing event this is. 

I'm sorry for ranting. I guess I just need advice on the situation in general. I feel guilty because I'm scared and angry and sad, but I'm also hopeful that maybe things will be okay. I'm a ball of emotions and wishy washy feelings towards the while scenario. I feel like I ruined her life because now things will be so much harder for her. And an irrational part of me is upset for the whole situation happening and that makes me feel like shit. 

I guess long story short, I need advice on coming to terms with this, and how to go forward emotionally/mentally. It still feels like I'm in shock from hearing this news,  and I'm scared that it hasnt even settled into my brains perception of reality yet.

362,"Im 19, live with my parents.  Between my depression, anxiety, and autism, I badly struggle with things I need to be able to do as an adult, such as making and answering phone calls and applying for jobs (or anything really).  I dont drive, I didnt realize how nescesary itd be in high school (but Ill be beginning classes next week).  All this has resulted in me being extremely dependent on my parents.

Theyre really controlling.  They give me very narrow choices when it comes to my future and/or independence.  Its like they subtly shoot down my ideas until all thats left is what they would be okay with.  They dont treat me like an adult.  Ive actually been told to my face that Im incapable of doing things for myself.

And in some ways, theyre right.  I have trouble taking my meds by myself, for instance.  I tend to forget and/or put them off.  And I dont know anything about how to be an adult.  I dont even know where to start learning.  What do I do about health insurance?  Bills?  What other adult things would I have to learn to completely detach myself from my mom and dad?

Theres a lot of reasons I need to detach.  Its actively hurting my mental health to be in this position.  For instance, my social life.  I have friends I met on the internet or via apps.  Some are in my state.  Im not allowed to see them bc what if theyre ~actually murderers/kidnappers~?  Yknow, not being able to see friends I met online would be something I could live with except I have exactly 0 friends who I can see irl.  Isolation is bad enough when you arent depressed and suicidal...

But about a year ago I started getting really frustrated after hanging out with her for longer than a day or two and I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

But lately it seems like every time myself or her room mates say anything when we hang out. She always has to correct us, or acts like we’re dumb. It’s nothing major. But it’s getting to the point where I’ve had to stop myself a few times before saying something or even sending a meme or article to her because I just know she’ll respond with “I don’t get it?” Or “yeah but... [correcting me on something small and trivial]”. 

I do know sometimes I can be a bit insecure so I don’t really want to say something to her incase I’m just projecting but I did notice that last time I was visiting, her roommates made a couple jokey comments about how she’s been snappy lately but then gave me a look as if to say “you know what I mean?”

Im a Junior in high school and for the past four years, Ive liked this girl. I would go even as far as to say that I love her. She does not feel the same way. I've had many classes with her and have gotten to know her well and from all my experiences, its hard to get over her. I suppose I should start from the beginning. I was in eight grade and nkt doing well. My family and friends had all but forgotten me (still have) and I had judt gotten rejected by my first big crush. I was not in a good place and this is when my depression started (still ongoing). I wasn't trying in school, really didn't care about myself, and started looking into drugs. I got into an honors english clash, god knows why, and there I met her. She was amazing. She was smart, funny, outgoing, beautiful, and was the most amazing peraon I had ever met. I had known her since elementary, but never really got to know her. Anyway, I fell in love. From that point foward I thought, if I were to have any chance, I would need to improve. So I started trting in school. I also started taking care of myself, improving my morals, and overall becoming a better person. I helped others even though I received no help from them, and was happy with my progress. I started doing things that I couldn't help like thinking about her all the time and she was always in my dreams. I took all AP classes just to see her. I worked night and day to have a chnace to be good enough for her. I didn't eat lunch and instead saved the money so I could take her out on a fancy date or prom or something. Then I was ecstatic. Sophmore year, we had a class together. I was a shy kid, but I talked to her everyday to get to know her better. On the last day before winter break I confessed my feelings. Things went worse than I couldve hoped. She said ""I think you're a really great guy and I hope you have a merry Christmas."" At the time, this was great because I didnt get rejected, but looking back, a no would've saved me a lot of pain. So I figured, I had a chance because she didnt say no. I kept working hard and investing more time on improving myself. It was a couple months later when I asked her out again. This time she said she just wasn't ready to date. I was down, but again, she didnt say no so I held on to hope. I told her I would wait for her when she was ready and then we parted ways. Its been a year and we haven't talked. We kind of avoided eachother out of embarrassment. I still like her and its killing me. I know she was probably trying to let me down easy, but I cant help but have a sliver of hope that she may just not be ready or whatever. I am depressed all the time because I don't think Im good enough for her. Im constantly in this state of feeling down and I havent honestly been happy in years. No one cares about me and she feels like shes my only chance at that. Ive tried to get over her because I honestly dont think she feels the same, but it never works and I end up liking her more than I did before the attempt. Ive tried literally everything and nothing has worked. My life is awfull and nothing works out, but she is the only thing I truly carw about anymore. Without her, I feel like a shell of a human. I dont know what advice Im asking for, but any would be great. No ones tried to genuinely help in ages. Thats why I came here. So If youve made it this far thank you for taking time to read.

369,Should I be mad? Should I feel as angry as I am? Sunday night my boyfriends cousin messaged the house group stating her friend T was coming over. My boyfriend had a defeated look on his face. We’d fought with the cousin the night before and we’re still drained from it. I’m not part of the group text as I haven’t moved in yet (but stay Friday-Monday until the 20th then I move in). The cousin had asked priorly two weeks ago if T could come over. But my boyfriend said no. She wasn’t to be in the house much less on the property. Well you see T is my boyfriends ex..... whom not only told his cousin not to tell him she was pregnant when they were together. But she’d faked it all along. I went downstairs shortly after as we were headed out to eat. Instantly this girl mean mugs me. Almost like she was ready to end me. I wasn’t intimidated. Just felt angry at the fact his cousin had disrespected him in his own home. I go outside and T had parked her car in front of the driveway blocking me in. (Possibly a spite move as we’d fought with his cousin the night before about this). I loaded up the dogs in the car and went inside. Stating “ whoever’s white car is blocking the driveway needs to please move it so we may leave” instantly I hear snickers and groans. I had to energy to fight and certainly not to argue. She huffed and puffed and moved her car. Only to drive forward now blocking the neighbors in. My boyfriend told her she needed to move to the other side of the street as he didn’t wanna deal with the neighbors since they’re on good standings and he’d like to keep that peace. She just stood on the porch like a deer in headlights. We left and cane back and she and her buddy were gone. But they returned about 15 minutes later. My boyfriend just came inside (McDonald’s forgot his burger so he went back to get it) and locked the door locking her out. I’ve been just so mad about it. Since last night. These past two nights have just been hell. Who knew one person can emotionally and mentally drain two people. It’s ridiculous. Thankfully he’d had enough and gave his cousin her eviction notice.

378," 

During the fall semester of my freshman year of high school (over a decade ago) the varsity basketball coach (and teacher) asked students who intended to try out for the basketball team to take part in an athletic monitoring program. The purpose of the program was to evaluate your physical baseline along with tracking your effort to improve before tryouts. This program consisted of a number of different elements from keeping a workout journal in the school weight room, going to open gym to play basketball, and being given a physical overview by the Coach. One specific component of the physical overview was a body fat test. The test involved going to the coach’s private office (which may have had a camera in it)\*, having the door closed, and removing all your clothes. He used a skin fold caliper to take measurements over your body including the upper thigh. To begin, like in a medical physical, he asked me to strip down to my boxers. From there he took the majority of the measurements. He then requested I remove my underwear and sit criss-cross on the floor while he took the upper thigh measurement. Even in the moment this felt somewhat uncomfortable, but as I was 14 years old I assumed the Coach was not doing anything inappropriate. I can recall joking about this with other students at the time and have talked with more students over the years who have also had this experience. It was not until I was long removed from high school when I was telling this story to a close friend who studied Kinesiology that I was informed that the upper thigh caliper measurement was almost entirely unnecessary (he said for kids in high school you could pretty much guess body fat just by an eye test, and if you needed to be thorough you could take skin fold measurements on other parts of the body - arms, back). He was adamant about the fact that there was no need for a Coach and teacher at the school to have kids getting naked in his office in order to take a body fat test.

I feel obligated to express that I do not feel as though I was molested or assaulted by this teacher. I wasn’t touched nor do I feel any trauma in regards to the incident. However, as I’ve gotten older I cannot get past how incredibly inappropriate it is for a Coach/Teacher to have had students getting naked in their office (especially one that may have had a camera recording in it.) I am worried that the Coach may have done more inappropriate things with other students or may even continue the practice to this day. I have no desire to be personally involved with whatever happens at the school and I have no interest (and feel no need) for any sort of personal recompense. But I worry about other students, about the immense inappropriate behavior by the Coach, and about the possibility of these incidents having been video recorded. 

I do not know where to go from here. Please share your advice. Some options I have considered are emailing the Superintendent of the school district, emailing an assistant-principal who I remember from my time at the high school, and emailing a teacher I had in school who still teaches there. My desire is to do this anonymously and have the Coach investigated for his behavior. There is some part of me that worries that he had no ill intention and I feel somewhat guilty about speaking up about something I do not personally feel violated by.

379,"How does one become happy? My girlfriend and I just broke it off after two years, and I'm falling into the pit that the relationship I had before her created. I thought it was gone, I thought I was fine, but I guess the only thing keeping me from teetering over the edge into the pit was my girlfriend. I loved her with everything in me. I still do. I dream every night of us getting back together and I wake up panicking when I realize what's happening. I miss her terribly. I'm going to counseling tomorrow, but I don't think it's going to help. There is no working our relationship out. There's nothing I can do to make her want to stay, and I have to live with that. But I just want to feel some sense of happiness. I went to a few stores I went to with her and felt my anxiety, blood pressure, and breathing all spike. Honestly, full blown anxiety attack type thing, if I'm being real.

380,"I'm currently on the fence about whether I should leave my position in my current job for something else or stick with what I have now.

I'm currently working as a stagehand and I'm in Oklahoma and it started out really promising and I really enjoyed some of it, but as time has gone on and I've climbed my way to the highest point I can reach with this company right now. For anyone that doesn't know, work as a stagehand involves setting up for all kinds of events, as this company would say the main 3 types are corporate events, trade shows, and of course concerts, but being in Oklahoma we don't see a lot of concerts, not that I like anyway or if you're really into country music, and the bigger shows aren't on the table since this company has roughly 40 regular employees year round. I feel like I don't really enjoy working for this company anymore, I love doing the work which for concerts and concert venues and such most of the time, I can hardly stand corporate event type work, and trade shows it kind of just depends on what specifically I'm doing, but anyway the company I work for pretty rarely gets work for concerts and if I express interest in doing something I usually get asked to do something else, and it seems so far this year that the company fucked up our major contract dealing with that kind of work where I live, and I struggled through the last half of January and most of February only making about $180 a week, while its started to improve in hours, the quality of work is on a sever decline and doesn't look promising unless taping down carpet and doing charity events sounds enticing to you. I've tried to look elsewhere for employment but the other company I applied for never responded to my application and my other options aren't too great. I'm just very frustrated by being in this company with low pay, struggling, giving my all, not having a say In the company, not being able to take on the responsibilities I want, always bailing my boss out when something goes wrong, and most of all doing all that just to pretend I'm working in the music industry in a way I'd like to.

Since I've been looking for a job doing stagehand work or at least some day labor somewhere else, I was browsing some job posts looking for something and a post for kitchen positions at a barbecue restaurant caught my eye. I've never had formal training but the job said that was okay, but I am a pretty good self taught cook, good enough that I was once offer a job at a fancy upscale restaurant based upon some food I had made a party. I've always been pretty good at cooking, and I like it well enough, but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do for the rest of my life or anything. But I feel like at this point it be more stable, less stressful, and I'd be able to do something I actually have an interest in instead of bending over backwards just for the chance to do something I like if it ever comes around, and even if that place doesn't give me a job I feel confident there are other places that would. But ultimately, I love metal and rock music and that's what I want to be a part of and would like to do with my life.

So the question here is, should I continue to stick it out in my current line of work hoping for something better to happen, or go try something else I like and maybe I can find another way to be a part of the music I like?",03Mar2020,1
381," I apologize for this wall of text.

  A lot of shit has happened that's tipped me. My dream school, the one that my aunt was trying to help me moves states to attend is closing down. This was to happen before my family and my grandmother cruelly attacked her out of spite and has been gaslighting me to believe it was her fault. Shes horrible.

 I know for a fact she took delight in knowing my dream school is closing down. I'm 24 with no job training and this was my shot. I've been as giving, as caring, and grateful as I could be for her taking me off the streets after my own mother and her husband almost killed me but this is it. Truth is I'm a gullible, spineless, doormat doofus and I've reached that point I'm ready to sleep in my car. I'm sitting here shaking with anger and a sickness deep down in my gut.

I almost have enough for both rent and deposit and I'm viewing a room tomorrow.

I go to practice and holy cow, it’s so competitive. Lacrosse is one of the biggest if not the face sport of my school. You can even tell the people on the team have played for a long time or since they were young. I literally just started. Hell, I didn’t even know what to do. The entirety of practice I sat down and did nothing. All I did was stretches. I was scared in a way. I didn’t know what to do, and they were already playing a mock game. Maybe I should’ve asked someone to catch with me or wallball, but I was too shy to ask. After practice was over I felt myself go through overwhelming doubt and regret. Should I not do this sport? Pick another like track and field? Or should I keep to it because I made a commitment? I was at a lost.  But then I got some encouraging words by friends. They basically said I need to stick with it and do my thing. I’m not gonna get good over night. And I really took those words to heart.

387,"Not sure if this is the right place to post but I’ll give it a go. The past 6 month, a lot has shifted in my life. My 2 best friends have either moved away or will be moving away and I feel my other friends overlook me/don’t take me seriously. I feel I’m on the back burner in life. I try to reach out and maintain a connection but none of them usually respond or take days to respond to the simplest text or call. Most of my friends are artists/musicians, and I know they’re busy and I try to give them space. I’m not saying “how dare they not respond to me” but I can see they’re always on social media posting about their artist/musician friends or posting sappy pics with their girlfriends, but I never get the time of day. Lately it’s just been feeling like I’m the defective one in the relationship because when I reach out they never respond but then when I try to give them space they never are the ones to reach out. I know the saying “nice guys finish last”, I’m starting to feel it’s true. I guess I’m at a “crossroad” because I don’t want to tell them that I feel left out and sound whiny but I don’t want to let it stew and let it effect our friendship.  The ones that moved away, obviously we don’t see one another, but the ones that live in town just seem to keep me on the “B-team” of friend level. I’m a complete introvert and only like hanging out in small settings, so I don’t know if it’s my personality holding me back or if they just pity me because I just stay quiet when they have parties/get togethers.

388,"I realize that all my life I have been a kind of person who always look up to people to inspire myself. Nothing wrong in it but I think this line of thought has grown roots inside of me the wrong way. As I do it constantly, I also lose this capability in me where I can introspect and look at myself and judge properly. I cannot. It's like I'm physically incapable of judging anything and making an original decision. All my life I have followed this path which people have followed in past to be successful. I am not in a bad situation or anything either. But this nagging void of indecisiveness comes a lot more nowadays compared to how it used to before. I guess it's because the time is calling me to be decisive. I never had a girlfriend. I have never been an attractive personality. Or to put bluntly, my conversation skills are very boring.

Recently, I have started to realise this thing. I think it's because I keep my attention more on what people think (about any situation) than I think about it myself. Feels like I have lost a touch or a sense, you can call it. Today, I got this realization that, more than deciding on how I need to plan my day so I can be more involved in things which are important and enjoyable for me, I tend to notice more on how others are spending their days. This is very frustrating.

My parents have done nothing to acknowledge that I'm struggling.

The biggest hurdle is that "" He just doesn't want to do any work"" . I am not gonna lie, he is a bit spoilt ( not really rich but still). But he has developed this attitude of not wanting to do any work. All he wants to do is roam, drink and miss every  single class he has. And if parents cut him off, he's solution, time's up.

392,"It’s very obvious who his favorite students are and it didn’t bother me too much, because I tried my best. A few months back I got together with a boy who turned out to be manipulative and toxic so I ended it last Friday. I’m relieved but still emotionally drained. I haven’t been to his math classes for a while cause my doctors actually thought I might had cancer, so I went to bunch of tests. Well luckily I didn’t, but I probably missed 3-4 weeks of math classes. I’m a bit of mess atm.

I come back and he’s joking with some students, laughing and what not. He says hello to my friend in the hallway every time they pass each other. Meanwhile the teacher can’t even look me in the eye. Yesterday I figured I had made it up in my head and I put my hand up and called his name to get some help. He walked halfway to me, without looking at me, and then he smirked, turned 90 degrees away from me and went over to another student. This student didn’t put his hand up and the teacher asked if he needed help. I immediately took my hand back down. 

Last night I felt sick the whole night and this morning I purposefully over slept. Then I bought something from the bakery that I’m trying to keep down while also trying not to cry. I know it doesn’t sound like a whole lot, but I’m nearly failing his class. I’m not bad a math, but it’s the highest level of math in my school and I hate attending his classes for these reasons. Missed attendance = bad grade. And I turned in a few tests that... well didn’t go great exactly.

I feel sick every night and morning before his class. I have no idea what to do. Usually I’m not this “weak” but when it comes to school I really have to motivate myself to go. Is there anything I can do? Will I just have to suck it up? I’m at a loss.

When I hit the glass ceiling, all of my passion evaporates. I just can't find the will power to continue. 

I guess that's where Darwinism or survival of the fittest comes into play if my understanding is valid.
We all need an external force. It's human nature. In modern times we don't need to find shelter or hunt or gather. We have modern medicine to fix broken limbs and save lives.

I understand what I must do to survive once I graduate highschool. I am not wasting time with college. I'm going straight into car manufacturing.

Since I'm conditioned with today's culture which isn't a bad culture, I just can't seem to find or focus on what I really want to achieve.

I hate writing music, I'd much rather freestyle lyrics. I hate the tedious parts of editing or making videos and the way I run out of content in short bursts. I don't like learning songs on the guitar, I always make up chord and power chord progressions, or solos by myself. 

I used to be able to smoke weed and drink like many other normal people my age but ever since I was randomly drug tested I have no way of not feeling this wishy washy mantality.

407,"TL;DR basically the title. My apologies for any typos I'm using mobile at work while I'm pooping.

I think I want to move back into my car.
Why? For many reasons:

1) the cost of living
   a)if I lived out of my car my my total monthly expenses would
 be over halved. My rent is 710 
After utilties it comes out to
Between 850 &amp; 900 a month.
Rent for a small storage unit
Is at most about 90 a month. 
That is nearly an 800+ 
difference a month.
b) why should I pay someone else's mortgage? Especially since
My landlord is old, he dies
 I may end up with no place
To go someday anyways. I
Need to be able to save.
c) its cheaper to save money to get ahead in life if you're 
Not paying 800+ a month 
In bills. Its cheaper to buy
A house in some small town
Like Taylorsville/Edinburgh than it is to pay rent. You need to be able to save money to do that.
d) I can afford to pay all my bills(also i have medical debt that mskes it even more difficult) with 1 job but itd difficult
And it means I have to live
 Paycheck to paycheck. And 
2) With 2 jobs im tired all the time i dont have the time for anything and I dont even really like one of my jobs and i eventually am going to want to switch to a different shift, this would ensure that I could afford that or go wherever the job is.
 Columbus' job variety is great if you want factory or labor but I feel like theres more to life than that. Yes it's where the money's at buttheres decent paying office jobs or other kinds of jobs (I.e animal shelters, state parks) in different areas and id eventually like to find a remote job anyways. 
3) I love my car, i would like to fix her. I can not at my current rate I cannot afford to do so and even if i lived in a van I'm sure I could find some way to keep it at the end of the day (probably my moms. Shed be happy to use it I'm sure) since the gas is so much better.
4) I want to move into a van eventually i feel like this would make great practice for that, and actually start working on a small set up that can be transferred over to a larger vehicle. 

There are some current drawbacks of course and i am taking those into consideration and working on solutions. 
1) my sweet lovey baby doll cat. I adore him he adores me and i would never give him up. The van would be best for him once I get to that point. I know my mom would take care of him for awhile if need be tho. This is a whole array of heart breaking even if its just a temporary separation. But I'll be able to visit and take him out some and if i get ahead in life so can he.
2. Summerheat 3rd shift, rechargeable brix and the arctic air thingy and reflectix/black out curtain rig
3)food, cooler/ food that will last cook stove/parks to grill/cook mom said shed give me some cast iron skillets eventually lol so don't have to really worry about tearing my regular ones up
4)hygiene, i already pay for a gym member ship. Might as well get my moneys worth plus they have Wi-Fi. Open 24/5.",03Mar2020,1

Normal sex just doesn't do much for me, and that's pretty much all he's been up for recently. I think another problem is I really don't like being on top. He wants me to take control a little bit, and I've done it occasionally, I just really don't enjoy it and it makes me super uncomfortable. He said if I were more comfortable with it we'd probably have sex more but that won't be happening for a while at least. I'm not very good at compromising when it comes to sex, but I'm trying.

On the other hand, I love travelling and while struggling financially stresses me out, I've seen and done so many things that my parents never got to. I can pack up and leave whenever I want to and there's so much more I want to see before I settle down into a life of my own.

I cant breathe through my nose as its very loud and because of my wheezing i try to hold my breath because everyone will hear. Also, if i breathe in too much i cough so i have to take short breaths to avoid coughing all the time. This is all made worse by the fact that a few cases of corona have developed in my country so everytime i cough everyone looks at me and i get really nervous.

also i berated some casino staff and management about how things were ran it is their fault i lost in short. because i wanted to play poker because it's a little bit more slow paced in losing money you can wait for a hand to wager so there is a bit of skill to leverage. well they had a huge waitlist and instead of starting a second table in getting me going they make people wait around because its better them wait get bored and start buying drinks/playing other games where they make more money off them then have them sitting playing poker. which is what happend to me i got very drunk and then people started buying me drinks then i spewed the money.  


like i said reptileddds they prey on people like me who cant control their emotions. im down to my last 200 dollars and have a motel room for the rest of this week. i thought about trying to chance the 200 dollars at casino but i know ill 80% lose it then ill be really bad. so i need to either try to get a job by the end of this week and start living in my car again or something. i will try to get to dscf to get food stamps or something tomorrow and see if i can use that for food to help preserve the 200 until i find a job.",03Mar2020,1
417,"USA 20s Male here. So for background, last Friday morning I decided to get on a hookup app and had sex with this person without protection. 

It’s been three days and it’s now Monday morning (a few hours past midnight). I was peeing and it burned a bit. I felt too suspicious and I tried to inspect more by squeezing my penis a bit and saw that a cloudy liquid came out. I’m panicking. I looked around on my phone for nearest hospitals and they were either closed or weren’t accepting appointments until 8AMish.

I’m really fucking scared. I want to get rid of this now. My fear is that if I go to a medical building about it, they’ll want to do STD testing before they give me medicine, which I think can take a business week. I don’t want to suffer days of squeezing puss and painful peeing. I might also have to wait more than a day just for the closest appointment time.

I have insurance, but I’m worried that it would still be expensive out of pocket. I’m okay with paying  a few hundreds of dollars to fix this, just as long as I get rid of this fast!

* **My take home pay after the government takes their share is about $2120 per month.**  
* My rent is only $400 a month (benefit of my employer being my roomate/friend)
* I spend about 75$ a month on oil. 
* $101 a month on my phone and plan--2 year contract.
* About $250 a month on food.
* About $80 a month for electricity.
* $50 a month for Cable/wifi.
* $206 a month on car insurance where I live.
* About $80 a month on gas.
* $75 a month in credit card payments.
* Hulu with add-ons about $25 a month.
* Oil change - 35$ a month
* Home toiletries, etc. - $30 a month

**My monthly bill minimum is $1407 a month.**  ***These are minimums and I like to give myself a little bit of leeway for food/electricity depending on the time of year, so lets call it $1507 to 'play it safe.'***

***2120-1507=$613 (This is mainly for necessities and does not include going out or emergency situations.  I also love weed, but I only tend to spend what I think I can afford, and sometimes that's noting).*** 

***After paying important bills only, I'm left with $613 per month.***

***If I spend extra money on hobbies/entertainment, I'm left with around 153$ savings per month.***

***Background***

I live on the same street as my year-round place of employment, about a 20-30 second drive.  

I have a bicycle and I want to get in shape.  

I drive a shit box car that has a Kelly Blue Book value of around $1200-1900.  I think the lower end of that $1200-1500 is more realistic. Last time I went to the mechanic they said the I might need a new timing belt soon and it seems I have to keep on putting more and more money into unexpected repairs.  I constantly have new problems with this car.  It currently has about 183,000 miles on it.  I 

I have friends who love Wal-Mart (I don't understand this) and would be more than happy to take me grocery shopping once a week for a tenner.  

**THE QUESTION:**

Should I sell my car if I live on the same street as my work? In my opinion this would be the perfect time to sell it if I were to go through with it because the whether is getting a lot nicer and should continue to be bearable for bicycling until the beginning of September.  Should I sell my car, save the money and buy a new car at the end of the summer? I will be limited and won't be able to go wherever I want whenever I want. That is my only concern.  I currently only have $500 in my savings account and BAD credit that I am slowly working on restoring.",03Mar2020,1

426,"Hello
So I'm 19(f), and I'm currently living the stereotypical ""basement dweller"" life. I spend basically every day (with very few exceptions) doing literally nothing by myself. Right now, I'm taking a semester break from college (which will become important in a moment). So basically, the problem that I'm facing is that I'm really bored and lonely. All day, everyday. It's not really because I can't go anywhere. I do have a car and I can drive, but I just don't know where to go or have the motivation to go anywhere. My justification to myself is that going somewhere alone without friends would be just as lonely if not moreso than just staying at home, but I can't make friends either. 

I don't understand how making friends happens. I've heard that it's possible to just be in public and strike up a conversation and make a new friend, but my brain just doesn't understand how that can happen. I can never ever see myself just randomly talking to somebody and getting to know them... Which then stems into my main problem which is my social anxiety. I cannot talk to people 1 on 1. I'm just incapable. I just go into fight or flight mode and try to get out as soon as possible, even if I'm talking to somebody who I WANT to talk to. And see, it's so bad that even when I WAS in college, I didn't talk to anybody. The place where people say that you make your most friends and learn the most about yourself. While I was there, I did nothing but sit in my room and dread having to talk to others. I made exactly 0 friends and had exactly 0 meaningful conversations with anybody. It was miserable, which is why I'm currently not in college. 

Another thing that really affects my motivation is that I have depersonalization disorder pretty bad. It ruins my motivation and makes me feel like it's just not worth doing ANYTHING. It's very frustrating.

So I guess what Im asking is how can I possibly find the motivation to leave my house and do something, or talk to somebody, or just have any sort of purpose? What do I do to be able to turn this around? I WANT to be the kind of person who can talk to anybody, go to events and have fun, or even just hang out with a friend.. not a socially anxious, introverted, basement dweller.

Before you ask, I do see a therapist, although I don't generally find much help with them. But I don't know how to get a different one BECAUSE of my problems with having no motivation, being socially anxious, etc etc.

I'm so fed up with myself that I'm beginning to think that I'm just MEANT to be a waste of space for my whole life. I'm so alone, and even when I want to fix it, I can't. I feel like I'm wasting my life away.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the essay. I'm just kind of lost right now. If you read this then thank you.",03Mar2020,1
427,"I’m going to try and keep this post as short and simple as possible, but I’m in desperate need of advice on what I should do in this situation. About 2 years ago I was sexually harassed at my job by a co-worker (let’s call him Tim) and he was ultimately fired and is now banned from the property I work at. I did him the kindness of not suing because he had just had a child and I wasn’t the kind of person after fast cash; just a safe work environment for myself and future employees. As of last night I received a phone call from a different ex co-worker (let’s call her Erin) telling me that Tim was going around telling strangers that my job was on the line because I got caught doing “you know” in the back of my workplace. Tim never specified to Erin what I got caught doing (because I literally don’t do anything other than work and go home) but after I hung up the phone with her I called my boss to ask why he would be telling complete strangers this. She was just as confused and pissed off as I was and reassured me my job was safe. That all being said, I’m seriously considering talking with my lawyer and bringing back up the harassment charges, that obviously should’ve been taken in the first place, and slapping slander on top of them. He is spreading god knows what rumors about me to strangers that can put me in jeopardy at my workplace.

431,"Throwaway because I’m paranoid. I apologize if I sound frantic, because I am. And I’m also on mobile. 

I have worked at the same bar and grille (in Iowa) for over 15 years in some capacity, for the last 6 years or so it’s been my main gig. Recently I was the bar “manager”, but I use that term loosely. When I started at the bar, it was a family place with a franchised pizza joint from a Midwest corporate company attached. In the last 15 years it has had three owners, and is now been bought out by the corporate pizza place. 

Back to using the term manager loosely, I say that because all that got me was the burden of babysitting a mostly untrained staff, being the middle person with vendors, and doing monthly inventory. I had no say in hiring/firing, specials, menus, pricing, and so on. I basically just counted products and but the totals in a very archaic spreadsheet. For FOUR general managers now, I have told them that since I am not there during the day to receive the product invoices, I either need a copy or they need to change the prices in the spreadsheet, it has never been done ( all of this noted every month and highlighted on the spreadsheet). On top of that I’m dealing with coolers twenty or more years old that makes the tap beer foam, so I’m losing product. I have corporate assholes sitting at their desk designing “blanket specials” covering all of their locations without doing any demographic research. 

Ive recently gotten another new general manager (my sixth in 6 years), and I’ve heard through the grapevine that I must not be ringing in things and giving the bar away because the numbers aren’t right. I’m sick to my stomach. I’m loyal, I have a following, and I would never dream of doing something like that. My sales every night reflect that. 

The general opinion is I’m being ran out because I am the third “lifer” they’ve gone after, but they don’t want to fire me because I’d get unemployment due to there being no proof I’ve done anything wrong, and I don’t even have a disciplinary write up in my file. 

I’m trying to go to school, but it’s so expensive and I’m already buried in student loans without a degree from my first try at it because I was stuck in making too much for aide, but not enough to be able to afford it. I need a new laptop, I’m overwhelmed, I have not idea what to do, and I’m scared. Due to my great reputation with my regular customers I made a comfortable living and I finally had another chance to go back to school. Now I’m starting over at 35, and I’m just lost. 

TL;DR I have been a loyal employee to a corporation for over 15 years and they’re using me as a scapegoat for their incompetence and trying to force me out, even though I don’t have any write ups and have a great work record.",03Mar2020,1
433,"Hi all, I'm torn here. So right now I am currently a student studying abroad in Rome, Italy. The COVID-19 outbreaks are all in the north but this has been spreading like wildfire. I feel like it's only a matter of time before things spread to Rome, if it hasn't already. Many American study abroad programs have pulled their students out of Italy and had them go back to the U.S. My school is giving me the option for right now. They strongly recommend I fly back, but I wanted to stay because I had felt like I barely got to live out my study abroad dream and explore Europe.

In April I had two trips planned, one to Barcelona and one to Morocco. Everything is booked already. However, I'm afraid of waiting this out because it feels like it's only getting worse instead of better. Plus, since I'm flying from Italy I'm afraid that as this worsens many countries will keep travelers from Italy under quarantine (even if I'm not coming from the north). I'm not sure what to do.

I've already wasted so much money having to cancel flights for my spring break which is this week. I don't know if I'll just end up wasting more money if I choose to stay here and wait it out. My school has given me the option to continue my courses at home online if I did decide to go home.

I just wanted some advice as to how others would go about this. I'm leaning more towards going home at this point, I feel like I will end up wasting more money if I stay here and wait things out. But I don't know what to do still.

*NSFW for mention of nude-photographs and other equivalent NSFW things.*   
*To preface, ""/cheated/"" as in some capacity of cheating, no outright sexual acts initiated by him. Cheating of the emotional variety, mostly. I didn't want to mislead in the title, but I'll explain. And yes, everyone happens to be 19, I didn't just get trigger happy with a fake number. Inserted names are all changed, of course.*  


*I'll elaborate more on this question later, but I am asking what I should do. I feel like I'm now some sort of gate-keeper to James' relationship, and I know it would cause divides among our friend groups as the situation isn't black and white; the value of any claims are all based on he-said she-said, at the end of the day.*   


I recently found out that one of my dear friends,  James, was in some way cheating on his girlfriend of \~4 years, Sarah, for at least 6 months with my ex girlfriend, Shea. Yesterday Shea texted me saying she had some things we needed to talk about. For context, we split close to a year ago, and although it wasn't pretty for a while, we've since gotten back to rather civilized terms and, more recently, have given each other guidance on one thing or another which is most likely (if I had to place an exact turning point) why she felt like she could come forward to me about this now. I'll try to keep the explanation not super over-kill, but fair warning, I suck at that. (After writing everything, yeah, I didn't keep it brief at all, sorry.)  


Shea is from out of town and as such has what I'd call a limited friend group in the city we all go to university in. We all go to the same university, by the way, James, Sarah, Shea, and myself. Other than the knowledge of my friend James existing, only having only met him a handful of times, when she started attending our school, I was the only person she knew. James and Shea have almost every class together, since they're planning the same major, which I can't exactly say I'm too happy about in hindsight, but James and myself had talked about it and thought that it was maybe for the best - I still care(d) about her immensely, and don't have any ill-will, and I trusted James to be a person she could get close with and trust in a sort of ""keep an eye on her"" way as she was definitely far more vulnerable than anyone normally is at that time, on top of having struggled with suicidal tendencies in the past. As time went on, they spent more and more time together, and James would communicate with me regularly about how things were going, not in a weird information-relay way, but just general heads-up type things. I was glad about this, but of course a little on-edge, and was by nature a bit uncomfortable with it even though I definitely supported it. Eventually Sarah started asking questions, as you would expect, and it turned into a bit of an argument. Nothing serious, but the ship was rocked, I guess you could say. Eventually, James began spending time with Shea while keeping it from Sarah, which I told him wasn't a good reason for a multitude of reasons, but it went on anyways.   


Enter Shea, texting me yesterday. She told me that James had been hitting on her for months in the time that they had spent together, and it seemed like he was trying to make things for more serious than he had any right to, given his relationship with Sarah. Shea and I, for context, were both pretty much on the same wavelength after our breakup. Beyond respect, we didn't owe each other anything; our relationship had ended, and so did the baggage of our relationship, as much as we could help it. Shea told me that she definitely considered James to be one of, if not the closest friends that she had at the time. They would go out for food, go to the beach, go to xyz, etc. After a few weeks, he started getting flirty/weird. Saying things about sexual tension, how he doesn't believe that there's such a thing as male-female friends without it, etc, which Shea shut down, and he subsequently subsided. He would continue this sort of thing, and eventually started trying to do ""weird"" rough-housing with her, asked her if she wanted to cuddle while watching TV, etc, and even in a ""guiding"" way, got her to lay down with her head on his lap while, and I quote, ""very obviously f\*cking erect."" He would also talk to her about how he and Sarah hadn't had sex in so long, how Sarah wasn't physically responsive to him anymore, etc. Shea, who although lonely at the time, isn't a home-wrecker and realized that this type of thing definitely can't be isolated to just her. At some point, she sent him nudes out of the blue to ""see what his response would be"" (although I know this is what she said, and maybe it was the general purpose, I do realize that the whole need of attention thing probably played a role here.) And yes, I'm a little chapped about that to say the least, but I can swallow my pride (and a little bit of dignity) and just keep on moving from that point. He responded with just his face, she sent another, face back from James again, and then she said something along the lines of ""Why aren't you saying anything? Why are you just letting me send you literal nudes, shouldn't you want me to stop?"" which he responded with some variation of ""Don't stop because of how you think I feel, I never want you to not be totally yourself around me."" They apparently spent time together once more after this, Shea saying that she didn't want to bring it up to him in person but knew that things would probably get weird. Before James had to leave her place for the night, again, all of this in secrecy, he told her ""I have to leave soon, so you can just do whatever you want. I don't care what it is, just do whatever you want."" Given the context between them and what had just happen, it was obviously sexually fueled. What other reason would he have to say it, anyways? To put it bluntly, Shea grabbed his crotch, and he just didn't say anything, not a word at all. I'm told that at this point she asked him to leave, and he did, in relative silence as they were both under the understanding that whatever the hell was just going on got shut down. James is now apparently starting to get flirty like how he did initially with Shea with one of her friends, which she said is why she's at a bit of a tipping point over all of this and can't keep quiet knowing what's going on.   


Sarah and James have been dating for around 4 years now, and are one of those HS sweet-heart couples that everyone assumes are going to get married some day. I know how relationship are at this age, so no need for mention of that, but at the very least it's the light-hearted consensus about them. James, however, has always been a bit ""weird"" with other girls. He has openly told me about times when ex-girlfriends, regular female friends, whoever, have needed things from him, tried to get close to him, etc, and he always talked to or spent time with them in some capacity while keeping it hush from Sarah. I love Sarah to death; she is one of the most genuinely kind and harmless people I have met, so I'm even more conflicted about how all of this is going to/could effect her. The consensus between Shea and I is that James never explicitly told her to do anything, never explicitly responded to her actions in a provocative way, and never asked for photographs, anything like that. What he did do, however, was perpetuate and support that environment and never said no to anything that happened or that she did/sent to him. This is part of why it's so sticky - when it comes down to it, it feels like it's his word against her's, and in our friend group, her say is worth much less than his. I don't even know how Sarah would respond to it all if I were to tell her.   


This is an aside as I just realized it's probably worth mentioning for context. James went to Italy last summer, by himself, and stayed in the home of an old Italian-exchange friend of his that was widely known to have a thing for him. Like, a very obvious thing, moves were made trying to hook up with him. James did the same sort of sneaky visitation with her that he did later on with Shea. Sarah wasn't exactly a fan of her for this reason. James, I kid you not, managed to keep his sojourn with this 'friend' a complete secret from Sarah. He would tell her that he was hosteling, or would simply not message her for days to keep any potential conflict from arising, saying that he had terrible WiFi, whatever. I do feel conflicted about having not told Sarah about it when it was happening, but at this time I had no reason to believe James was going to act out or cheat on her with this exchange friend. I know that the very nature of that situation is a big violation of their trust, and I should have probably said something at the time - I sure hope that someone would tip me off if my S/O was up to something like that. So yes, I do know that I messed up on not speaking up sooner. One of our other friends and myself talked about the whole ""James being sus in Italy"" thing together, and we decided to just keep our mouths shut because we thought that there was no way he would ever cheat on Sarah. This other friend and myself are incredibly close, I probably spend more time with the dude than without. I want to talk to him about all of this, but I know that he hates being a part of serious conflicts like this, and he isn't exactly a huge fan of Shea at that, so I really don't know how he would react to what I had to say.  


I feel very hurt and a bit messed up about the fact that James is this type of person, first of all, but also that he would do this with my ex girlfriend. However, I know that even though that's a class-act douche move, this isn't about me, and it would be selfish of me to act out of vendetta. The person really getting hurt here is Sarah. Until any of the aforementioned things came to light to me, he was just a completely regular good guy, no sign of any potential or want for anybody outside of his relationship with Sarah.  I'm some f\*cked up sort of gate-keeper to his future now, it feels like. Is it the right thing to do to tell Sarah? Do I talk to James first? Should I keep my mouth shut and let the skeletons in his closet fall out on their own? Do I talk with my other friend about it? My current girlfriend? I really have no clue. I can already see it happening where if I were to speak up, James would go off on a form of ""You're listening to your crazy ex and getting mad because she wants me"" type of thing. He isn't the type of guy to stay quiet when he's called out. Shea is afraid to speak up because she thinks he could easily ""ruin"" her or blackmail her given everything she had told him in the months that they were close.  


I'm still processing it all, and decided that some anonymous help from internet strangers is probably as objective of advice as I'm going to get, save for the my own predisposition and alignment about the situation that I have surely injected in this explanation. If I left out any glaring things or if more context/info is wanted, I'll respond to whatever replies this gets.  


Thanks, guys.",03Mar2020,1

Of course I'm happy that my friends are getting along, but at the same time, it's setting off a lot of my insecurities. 
Logically, I know that I shouldn't be worried - I've known all of them for years - but there's a part of me that just can't help asking: *would they rather hang out without me?*
Whenever these thoughts show up, I tend to go quiet and push people away,placing myself in the background, because I start feeling like I'm forcing myself on them. 

I know, logically, that i shouldn't be worried about them leaving me for each other, but if I start pushing them away myself, it's a very real possibility. These three are the only ones I actually know enjoy my company, and I am so scared to lose them to my own insecurities.

441,"Hello all,
This is my first post here and I honestly feel really nervous posting it. I've been debating it over in my head and I decided to do so anyway. 

So, in my spare time I draw, which is usually just my ocs and random ideas that pop into my head (like all artists.) My style is I guess under the category ""Anime-esk"" as I really like how it's drawn. 

Lately I've been questioning if I'm a bad artist. I occasionally do LIKE the things I draw but I always feel unsatisfied. I've always had incredibly shakey hands, so I switched from physical drawings to digital ones, which did, for a while, make me enjoy drawing again. 

The main reason that I've been question myself is I use an app called Easy Poser to design the way my models position. I struggle with proportions and by using the app it makes me feel a bit better. 

Am I a bad artist for not drawing everything from scratch? I've tried many times to do proportions on my own but I always end up hating the drawing and myself afterwards.

445,"TL;DR at bottom.

I would just like a little guidance or advice from anyone willing to give it. It can even be general words of wisdom or motivation.

My Issue: I have vague ideas of what to do with myself but I don’t know if I am being realistic or what.

Background:

I am a 22 year old female who just graduated from a well-known, great state school in December. My GPA was a 2.33. I switched majors over three times. My parents come from nothing and managed to better themselves into decent middle class Americans making enough money for my family to live comfortably. I have been working since I was 16 however since I hate asking my parents for support due to various reasons. I have had over 13 jobs in my life since I worked through school and all of them are in various fields.

High School: I was captain and president of almost every club at my high school. It was a medical magnet school so we had clinical programs at hospitals and medical classes. We wore scrubs everyday. Graduated number 4 in my class of 412 students. All honors and AP courses throughout. Granted acceptance into several universities and with full scholarships.

University: I started off doing engineering since that was what my sister did and what my family considered to be where the answer to the happiness of life is. I wanted to change majors after the first semester, but let family pressure keep me in for 1.5 years. I hated it. I had no motivation at all. Once I finally. Got the balls to change majors, I had no idea what to do. So I tried Urban &amp; Regional Planning, Education, General Studies, and finally settled on Anthropology. By this time my transcript was an extreme mess. I was due to graduate in the following semester. I took a bucketload of courses over the summer and took an extra semester. Graduated with 2.33 GPA.

Adulthood: I was due to leave for the Navy as a linguist with an awesome compensation package but the political ongoings had me changing my mind. Now I am due to start a job in hospitality, in a few months in a new state contracted for 12-16 months. I’ve thought about teaching English abroad but that seems to be more of a short term journey of maybe 3-5 years.

During the time that I am waiting for the new job to start, I am nannying in the day and teaching English online overnight. 

So far I am pretty confident my passions lie with linguistics and healthcare. Am I crazy for considering trying to start over for medical school?

**TL;DR**

I am 22 years old. Just graduated college in December with a 2.33 GPA. Excellent high school record, shitty college record. Was due to head to the Navy as a. Linguist. DIdn’t work out. Due to start applying for teaching English abroad. Corona Virus happened. New job starts soon but it isn’t something I see myself doing long term. My passions are linguistics and healthcare. Is med school a pipe dream?",03Mar2020,1

447,"A year ago I was friends with this one guy online, and we played a lot of games with each other, I liked the guy and I saw nothing wrong with him at first.  


Later, I found his true colors, and he is a complete and utter narcissist, he manipulated me, and continues to manipulate most people around him, correction everyone around him. I took it to myself to research him, figure out everything I can about him, and that I did, I took a deeper dive into his life and I think it left me scared, to know so much about someone and why they act the way they do, it's mentally tasking for me.   


He is constantly in my head, and it has been months. Not a day goes by about how much I dislike him, the thought will just not go away, it will every once and a while when I am at peace, but even then some event happens and it reminds me of him.   


He manipulated not just me, but so many other people, and the ways he did it was so sick, he used everyone around him to his advantage, and he pretty much extorted them, whether it be for an in game currency, or IRL currency. He got information on people by being friends with them, and with a complete God Complex, took it to himself to decide their fate, if they dare did something he disliked, he essentially punished them either by doxing them, holding their currencies ransom because trusting victims including myself would give him some currency, and other valuable items.  


There is a lot more that he did, but I don't really like talking about it, essentially, he has been making me feel like shit, or maybe it's me making myself feel like shit? I do not know. The way that he is in my head now and doesn't seem to leave, I need to know if there is any way to try and let go. That has been one of my problems since I was a child, I cannot let go.",03Mar2020,1
448,So my mom got money from her divorce settlement and we were are Best Buy and I asked her if I could get a gaming pc because I’ve been wanting for a while now and she agreed to buy me one. My mom and I left my dad a few years ago and while we were living with my dad before we left he was super controlling with money so I never got to get a luxury item like a gaming pc. I guess I feel guilty because of the fact that she spent a lot of her own money on me. She said that she was happy to buy it for me and that I deserved. I know it seems stupid to be upset over this but I just wanna know how I can stop feeling guilty over this.,03Mar2020,1
449,"I used to be very close with a girl in high school and we’d talk on snapchat every single day. Then she got a boyfriend.

She changed. a lot. She used to have a personality, she felt like an actual person. Hard to explain. But when she got her boyfriend it felt like her entire personality /became/ that boyfriend. He’s all she’d talk about. Everything our friends did with her, he had to be included. It’s been three years since they got together and they haven’t chilled. It’s so irritating. If I want to hang out with her and see a movie, she’d beg for him to come too. It feels like she doesn’t care about us, her best friends, anymore. 

They’re the lovey-dovey-I-can’t-shut-the-fuck-up-about-my-relationship type of couple. It’s been three years. Everything they post in snap groupchats are all couples photos and it feels like they’re mostly talking to each other... in a group chat. Everyone is ignored. I don’t ever hang out with them together because she only focuses on him and third wheels me. I paid for your tickets but sure, ignore me and go snuggle up in the corner.

She’s also gotten meaner, too. Her boyfriend can be an asshole at times and she’s definitely picked up on that. She became really elitist over certain things (for example she is a traditional painter, she shits on my artwork for being digital. I try to laugh it off but it gets to me often)

All of this is getting to me. It’s already gotten to one of my friends, who kind of just bottled up his feelings and exploded when they were being extra cringe inducing one night. He told them to knock it off, stop focusing on each other and start paying attention to their friends. Everyone was sick of their shit. Since it was the middle of the night, and they were the only three online, they essentially broke out into a giant argument and ganged up on him. The only way they fucked off was when he spilled the beans and told them that literally everyone else felt the same. Then, they played victim over the course of the week. 

You know, if everyone else is the problem, maybe you’re the problem, no?

There’s a lot more I could talk about, but honestly, I just need help. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been less active in the group chat and started making new friends and branching out to older ones. But all my other friends are still in this chat and I don’t want to leave them if I break it off with her.",03Mar2020,1

452,"After several months of trying to find a job and slumping into a great mental depression, I thought things were finally turning around when I got hired at a job I was really looking forward to. So, I started jogging to lose weight, as well as dishing out my own food portions instead of my grandfather's mountainous ones, and refusing to listen to him whenever he guilt tripped me for not eating everything on my plate. I lost 20 lbs in two weeks with no negative side effects, telling me that while my metabolism  has slowed since adulthood, it hasn't slowed to the point where I should have been as fat as I was.

However, little did I know, the sidewalk is not where you want to do your running. At the end of these two weeks, I developed a minor shin splint, so I stopped running the entire week before my first day was scheduled to start, but instead of the leg getting better from constant resting, it stayed the same, if not got slightly worse. So I emailed my contractor ahead of time that I might need to show up with a cane to help me walk... Unusual for a 26 year old.

Fast forward to today. It took me around 45 minutes to drive to work from my house. I left at 7:08AM and arrived in the parking lot around 7:46AM, when my scheduled shift started at 8:00AM. I was able to walk okay at first with my leg pain only at around 5 or 6 out of 10, but by the time I left the building, it was nearing a full 10. And since the time of day was now 5:00PM, the once 45 minute drive here turned into a 2+ hour drive back, all while I had to switch off both feet on the pedals because putting pressure on my right foot, shot pain up to my knee and slightly into my thigh.

On top of this, the two contractors I speak to for this position like to call my cell phone WHILE I'm driving, as if they expect me to live just down the block, when I've told them both I'm in a completely different city. Of course I don't answer, because it's illegal and stupid to pull out your cell-phone mid-drive. But for my 8 hour shift on my first day, I spent four hours of it driving in very unfamiliar areas. During the 2 hour commute home, one of the contractors tried to call me despite the fact that Rush Hour is a well known thing everywhere. I did not call her back until I arrived home at 7:07PM, and by then, their office was closed.  My cat had also been waiting for food 2 hours past her normal eating time, and I hadn't eaten more than a bite of a meal all day due to unrelated time constraints and unfamiliarity with the bass-ackwards city street layout with tons of one-way PARKING LOTS where there shouldn't be. But... Her office will only be open with me able to the call her during the time I should be sleeping, which is now. I'm waiting for that call. I can't answer mid-drive, and it's rude to answer phone calls during the job. And since it seems I'll commonly be spending 12 hours of my day away from home 5 days a week, there isn't a lot of leeway.

The reason I have not been to a doctor because of my painful injury is because I can't afford it. The only money I have is my rapidly dwindling Tax Return I've spent on gas, food, and car accessories (A dash cam, cigarette lighter splitter, and mount because I've gotten a bit paranoid of drivers and want to use my GPS and dash cam at the same time.) I don't know if I even have insurance yet, and I'm mainly relying on my credit card until I know gfr sure my paychecks will be reliable.

My grandparents are also in a different state visiting family, and won't return until later.

I have not been offered any accommodations yet, and my gas consumption is going to drain my bank account dry, and I may need my leg amputated if I keep doing this every day. I LOVE the job, the environment, and the people, but the commute is killing me and will quickly make  me homeless before my first paycheck 2 weeks from now.

It was my first day yesterday, though. And not only is this a contract, it's a right to work state, and I've been screwed before by employers. What do I do? Do I continue to endure torturous amounts of pain and stress, while feeling my contractors might think I'm overreacting  and ignoring their phone calls on purpose? Not to mention I put my home phone on my resume, yet they always call my cell phone which I don't give out to employers because my cell phone has a buggy lock screen that only lets me use it when it wants me to. Am I really willing to increase my chances of accidental death dramatically just because I like the tech support call center I'm training as an employee for?",03Mar2020,1
453,"(15m) I have very little motivation to do anything. I don't have any real hobbies, like playing an instrument or theater or art or anything. People always tell me to just go out there and get one, but nothing interests me at all. Everything I do seems boring, unexciting, and ultimately useless to me. I don't see the point in doing homework, or anything that would be positive to my future life. Nothing will be exciting to me in my future. Nothing is exciting to me now.

I also don't have any close friends. Sure, there are some people that will tolerate me being in a group, but nobody that would value my opinion on something. I'm not a very interesting person, I'm pretty boring tbh. Hanging out at people's houses would be a dream. I hope that having friends could help me get out of whatever pit I'm in, but I don't think relying on people to make yourself better is something I want to do. Plus, I very much doubt anyone really wants to talk to me, and the people that do are just being nice.

I talked to Dad and said that our families should share the financial burden, and asked if maybe we could set up a payment plan. 
The dad remembered my daughter coming over to his house (it happened only once) and he was supposedly there the whole time.

460,"Hi Reddit, I (23F) am currently in a predicament right now with a long term friend (23F) and asking for advice. To start off, she’s been dating this guy on and off for the last 7 years, they’ve broken up a handful of times but last July after being together for about a year they decided to get engaged. They are set to get married in May. I was pretty shocked at this because of how many times they have broken up but nonetheless I’ve tried to be a supportive friend and bridesmaid. Today she texted our bridesmaid group chat saying she’s off birth control, I asked her if she is using any other forms of protection and she replied with no, and that she was open to getting pregnant. I simply responded with “oh”. She responded with a comment about how being part of a “girl supporting girl friendship group, we need to support other women with their choices even if we wouldn’t make the same.” She then made a public instagram post about judging people’s choices, which I’m pretty sure was directed at me for my questioning and lacklustre response (I feel like I’m in high school again haha). haven’t responded back because I’m not sure what to say, but in all honesty I don’t believe her getting pregnant right now is a good idea. She has a lot of student loan debt and her fiance has a lot of credit card debt for reasons I’m not sure of. The other month she was telling me how broke she is (her and her partner are both currently making slightly over minimum wage right now) and how she can barely afford the wedding. Second, she smokes weed everyday to aid with her severe anxiety and getting pregnant would mean she would probably have to stop. Anyways, how should I go about supporting my friend without encouraging her to make this decision?

I am 18 years old male and in a new relationship right now that started as a FWB (you can read the story in my post history if you want). Everything is going great we have a lot of fun together, laugh a lot and so on, but I feel like I disappoint her a bit in bed.

I've had one sexual partner before her and we were dating for about a year with her the sex was great and it lasted long enouh imo. 

With my current girlfriend on the other hand I always orgasm after being one minute or two minutes tops inside her. I am able to last longer when I am the one in control like during doggy or missionary but whenever she starts to take control I almost orgasm immediatly.

That's why I wanted to ask you guys is it a big deal if I orgasm this quick and what could I do to improve the sex?",03Mar2020,1

469,"SO and older friends think I’m (22) naive to this older guy’s (38M) behaviour

I (22F) graduated college last year after studying an arts degree (vague for the sake of anonymity). It was a small class and as a result I was quite close with a few of my professors, and one in particular, who we’ll call J (38M) I’ve continued to keep in touch with and occasionally meet up with.

My boyfriend (30M) has a huge problem with the guy, and says he’s mega inappropriate and I’m just too naive to see it. I would put this down to jealousy, but some of my older friends (late 20s-30s) have flagged it as well - so I’m wondering if, based on the following info, anyone thinks J is slightly shady? 

I spent a lot of one-on-one time with J in my final year as he was grading and mentoring me through one of my biggest papers. We always got on really well and I sometimes thought there was a little sexual tension there but put that down to being in my head. Shortly after I graduated, he reached out to me through Twitter to ask if I’d meet up with him for coffee. When we met he mentioned an upcoming project he wanted my help on, but it was vague and nothing ever came of it, we mostly just sat and talked. We continued to sporadically DM each other with informal and joke-y messages, and he’d occasionally drop in wink emojis - not attached to anything sleazy, but still potentially quite flirty (think along the lines of “I bet one day you’ll end up hiring me ;)”). Side note: he didn’t follow any of my other classmates on Twitter, just me. Once after we met up, he sent me through his number (I didn’t ask for it) and told me to text him there instead. He’s also friended me on Facebook (again, none of my other classmates, just me). 

There’s a lot more to it, but those are the main points my boyfriend has an issue with, along with the fact that I’m “conventionally” attractive (long blonde hair, bigger boobs, etc..) - I’m not mentioning this for any reason other than my boyfriend thinks it’s the only reason J would be keeping in touch with a 22 year old girl and none of my other classmates. I’m torn because on one hand J has been a great mentor and hasn’t ever actually tried anything, but I can also see where my SO and friends are coming from with some of the stuff. 

So I guess, based on the info, does this all seem above board or am I being naive? Should I cut him out? 

Edit: forgot to mention, but J does have a wife and kids. Which makes me think everyone might be reading a bit too much into it - if he has a family that might have access to his phone/Facebook/Twitter account, surely the messages he’s sending and the fact he’s meeting up with me would be known to his wife? He also openly talks about his wife and children when we meet, so surely he wouldn’t do that if he had an agenda. 

TL;DR my ex professor added me on Twitter and Facebook, facilitated meet-ups after I graduated, gave me his number and sent me wink emojis - is that weird, and should I cut him out?",03Mar2020,1

My other friend tried to confront her and ask her what was going on and she said she can’t talk to us because we know she’s upset and she wants to pretend like everything is fine. So she’s not angry at me but she refuses to speak more than 10 words to me a day. I feel so shit about myself and she’s the only friend I have in class so I’m now super lonely aswell.

Let me be clear I did not hit her or have a history of hitting people.I would normally leave her alone or distance myself from her, but she has moved in with me and a flatmate who is friends with both of us.

Hey everyone. I am studying a bachelor of Electrical and Electronic engineering in Australia and the degree has been going decently so far.

If I don't tell her we're I'm going she'll get upset, and she monitors this through my bank account. If she sees there was a transaction at a place I didn't tell her if be, she looses it. Even after swearing up and down she'd never Snoop and that the only reason she's seen them is ""because she was checking her balance."" It's the type of app where you have to hit on the actual account to see the transactions.

She keeps saying it's because she's worried about me, and she thinks life is fragile but it's so suffocating. I have the need to want to not tell her everything because she absolutely goes ballistic and it's made me feel like a liar which I hate. But I also feel like I shouldn't have to feel the need to lie about basic human things. I'm 20, and I work so I don't understand why she's acting the way she is. 

Whenever we try to talk about it, she gets upset and says I'm blaming her for everything, and that she's given me so much. That I'm an ""ungrateful child"" and then she ignores me. I can't IMAGINE saying that or doing those things to her.

I am a salaried employee that works in a health care facility that is a private clinic and where I do have direct patient access. I was scheduled to take a few days vacation at the end of next week where I would be traveling to another country; however, not one that is majorly or close by a majorly affected country with the virus. According to the CDC website, it is not ""restricted"" or ""banned"" in any capacity Today, I was approached by my employer and told that if I decided to continue on with my trip that I would have to take off an extra two weeks unpaid when I come back. She states that her main concern is not wanting to be the first clinic in our city to have the first case of the coronavirus as she wouldn't be able to live down that reputation. I recognize that my employer has a right to make different rules regarding how her clinic operates; however, I am feeling like this is very unfair. She has restricted all employees who want to travel by plane or travel two hours south (where there is a city with some cases) stating it is unsafe.

To be honest I'm not sure what advise I'm really looking for but I guess a couple questions are: is this even legal (I'm like 99% sure it is since it is a private clinic and she makes up the rules). Am I in the wrong in that I shouldn't be traveling/is her thinking correct in restricting employee travel during their personal time? Can I file for unemployment for the two weeks in which she is basically ""laying me off"" especially because there is no pay (seems like I stretch but I have no idea). Any words would be helpful. I have no idea what to do.

So, my closest friends and I graduated high school in 2018, last year we all caught up for one of my friends birthdays and got a huge hotel suite. We went out and partied that night and took MDMA and all had a really great time. Honestly wish I had enjoyed myself a lot more. Anyway, the nest morning I called my girlfriend at the time and told her about how amazing the night was, she burst into tears and told me to make a choice, it was either her or them (she was super anti drug). I stupidly chose her, I regret my choice and told the guys what I had chosen. 

My relationship with my girlfriend became really rocky and we broke up in December. Once that was over I broke down because breaks ups are the worst. But I tried talking to my old high school guys but they didn't want anything to do with me. I apologized but they can't forgive me. 

I'm now alone because I moved from our country town into the city and don't have any friends here. I miss them more than anything but they hate me. I guess what I'm trying to ask is; do you think there is anyway for them to forgive me? I'm at a loss here.",03Mar2020,1

Yesterday morning started off with business as usual but we received a little tip saying that they are shutting down our warehouse by Friday because we are costing them money in the long run. We were obviously outraged and upset by this news then shortly after, a couple of the executives came in to have that meeting and break that news to us. Our first thoughts were obviously jump ship and file for unemployment but they are talking about repositioning us into new roles. Roles that definitely are much shittier imo. I basically took this warehouse gig two years ago to get away from food and bev/retail and they are trying to put us in retail. And now we are at this point to where we have a shit of work to do to close down the facility. Where I’m currently at is, I just wanna leave. I don’t wanna help them close this facility down and I absolutely do not want to go to a retail/sales position. I was told from a fellow coworker that if I left now, I probably wouldn’t be able to file for unemployment because they are offering another job so that’s me technically quitting. I asked someone outside the company, and they said no you should still be able to receive unemployment because regardless of where the company is trying to position you, they closed down your main area of work and are forcing you to do something you didn’t sign up for and they also would have to try and dispute your case if I file. I think I’m just getting somewhat bad advice so I figured I would post here for more help.

I may be sensitive but at the same time I’m just not sure why they can’t just respect what I want regarding conversation about my job and why that’s such a big deal.

495,"I’m 29 years old. I graduated from college six years ago – for three years it was hard to find much of anything. Three years later, when I finally was able to get a job doing freelance writing, I noticed it was hard for me to finish doing an assignment. I would freeze, clam up. Any task was too huge of a task.

Throughout these three years, I thought I had a huge procrastination problem. I just needed to get over it. After going to therapy I realized that it wasn’t me being lazy, I have anxiety. Anxiety is why I haven’t been able to move forward very much in my life for the past three years.

I’ve wanted to study for my new career, but my anxiety was so debilitating, I couldn’t get past the first page without having a panic attack. Yesterday I finally finished the first chapter. To anyone else, that’s not a big deal. For me, I feel like I slayed a dragon.

For the past six months I have been teaching part time as I study for my new career – which involves slowly finishing that chapter, which was honestly the best I could do considering how bad my anxiety is. With my teaching job, I don’t earn a lot of money. But, being able to function in a work environment is something I have not been able to do, so I consider that a win as well.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for many years. He knows how debilitating my anxiety is, but I’m afraid his family doesn’t understand it as well. When I was over at his parents house this weekend, his sister kept asking me about my teaching job in a way that I thought was weird.

I get the feeling she likes me, but she wishes that things were different for me and my boyfriend. I think she wishes that he was with someone that was more capable. I also think a part of her may think that I’m lazy. That’s the part that worries me the most – that she thinks that I’m lazy and that’s why I haven’t been able to do X, Y, and Z.

If I could, I would explain to her that I wish I could control my anxiety. No one wants to be more productive than me, but unfortunately my anxiety has been debilitating. It’s not due to laziness. Am I wrong for feeling that way?

She knew in the past how hard things were for me, but I still don’t think she gets it, and thinks I’m not pulling my weight when I should be.",03Mar2020,1

506,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months.I got a new job Myself and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. Then the next day I emailed her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses). A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",03Mar2020,1

511,"Be prepared this is a long one but I need genuine advice on what I could do next. 

In March 2018 I slipped on some ice and felt a pull in my knee, had pain a couple months after. In October 2018 I decided I should probably get this checked. I was sent for a scan on the 30/10/18 and then was sent the report for the scan on 14/11/18. It was then confirmed that I had a tear in medial meniscus, and a couple other minor problems but nothing that couldn’t fix itself, besides the torn meniscus. I didn’t have a follow up appointment until around March 2019. During this time I had been having physio to hopefully help the problem out. In the appointment I was told what was already confirmed by the scan report and was then told that the only option was physio, which I had already been doing and wasn’t helping too much. He said surgery wasn’t an option yet and was just told i’ll have another appointment in 6 months time, which should’ve been September 2019. I was confused at this because what was I meant to be waiting for? For it to get worse? Anyway I was also told if it gets worse to go back to the GP and they’ll send me back. I didn’t bother doing this, I didn’t want to come across as pushy or annoying. However when it got to around October/November and I had no letter about a follow up appointment I decided I’d go to the GP. I was given an appointment again for the orthopaedic doctor in January 2020. I was seen by a different doctor this time who just told me I’d go for another scan. By this time my knee was 10x worse already so I was certain my knee would look completely different from the last scan. So I was given an appointment to go over the scan again today, I was given no written report of this scan which I thought was weird but chose to ignore. When turning up to my appointment today I had another different doctor. My knee was turnt and pushed in all different positions for me to then be told that my knee looks absolutely perfect on the scan. I wasn’t shown the scan or given any written report. I’m now confused about what is actually wrong with it taking into consideration it’s a lot worse than it was last year. I wasn’t told that it’s healed or why it’s no longer there so I’m now very confused. I’m still in a lot of pain with it and it’s definitely affected my mental health too due to missing out going to America on a football scholarship due to complications with free healthcare here and private healthcare over there in relation to my knee. 

Is there anything I could do to possibly get seen again? Or get a written report even after my appointment? This is something I want to get sorted so I can carry on with my football career as I feel it’s holding me back but I’m so in the dark about what is wrong with it I just need any sort of advice about what I could do to get another scan or appointment or anything

I go to practice and holy cow, it’s so competitive. Lacrosse is one of the biggest if not the face sport of my school. You can even tell the people on the team have played for a long time or since they were young. I literally just started. Hell, I didn’t even know what to do. The entirety of practice I sat down and did nothing. All I did was stretches. I was scared in a way. I didn’t know what to do, and they were already playing a mock game. Maybe I should’ve asked someone to catch with me or wallball, but I was too shy to ask. After practice was over I felt myself go through overwhelming doubt and regret. Should I not do this sport?

515,"TW - Sexual Abuse 

..........,......................................................

Hi guys, I've been struggling to post this. I am in my mid 20s and I think I was sexually abused as a child, but have no proof.

I can't remember a lot from my childhood but remember waking up in the night screaming because of vaginal pain and the cause was never discovered. I masturbated from a young age, and didn't realise it was a private act and was turned on by graphic porn. I feel like I was obsessed by sex and now in my adult years, I let guys do anything they want to me during sex (which I consent to) but have no enjoyment.

I just feel like my perception of sex has always been skewed but have no evidence / memories of abuse - more of a feeling than anything. Has anyone experienced this before and do people think there might be any link to abuse in the past? I've never spoken to anyone about this but struggled with anxiety since I was 7 and depression since I was 12 and I've never been able to get to the core of my problems.",03Mar2020,1

518,"(TW?) I am a 17 year old girl. I don’t really know how to start this, but I have problems with my mom. She hasn’t been the best mom. I literally have a list in my notes of (almost) all the things she’s done to hurt me and upset me, so I guess I’m just gonna list them all. This is gonna be *really long* so I don’t blame you for not reading the whole thing lol. (Sorry if my English is broken, I am from Sweden.) Also, I wanna clarify that my parents are not together and I currently live with my dad and my mom lives in a city 3 hours away. *1.* Ever since I was small she has always yelled at me for the smallest thing. She has anger problems and would always scream so loud at me that it would make me cry and it made me kinda scared of her. She even swear at me sometimes, calls me “fucking lazy”, “go to hell”. I know it’s normal for your parents to yell at you sometimes but she would yell at me so often, and as I got older I learned to keep my room clean and put away dirty dishes fast and just try to avoid her screaming at me.  She always gets mad at the smallest things. I’m afraid to tell her everything she’s done to me because I know she will get mad and scream at me and I just can’t handle it. I *never* call her out on any of her bad behavior to avoid conflict. We also have 2 dogs and when they do something wrong she sometimes yells at them too, and they are really tiny so they get scared when she does that. She uses snus (a swedish nicotine products) and when she was without it for like 3 days she told me how angry she got at our dogs (since being without nicotine if ur addicted can made you irritated) and I got really mad imagining how horribly she must’ve treated them. Also because of this when I was smaller I would basically copy her behavior and yell at them a lot too but I’ve learned that it’s not right. 
*2.* She has bought and sold dogs &amp; cats a million times during my childhood. She would always buy a dog/cat and then have to sell them because she couldn’t afford to have them and it would upset me but obviously I couldn’t tell her because she would, yeah you guessed it, get mad and invalidate my feelings. I’ve always wondered why I couldn’t get as attached to my current dogs and only recently i realized why, because of her. She has done this so many times, I don’t even remember how many dogs/cats we’ve had since we’ve had so many and she’s always ended up selling them because she couldn’t afford to keep them. Oh and also, currently we have 2 dogs like I said and 1 cat, and she is planning on buying a kitten now for *some* reason, lol. 
*3.* She never cares about how I feel. Like I’ve said before I don’t wanna ever tell her that she is wrong for buying/selling cats or yelling at me or anything else, since all she does it get mad and she doesn’t listen to me. She is *always* right, and my feelings are always wrong. She is never understanding of how I feel, no matter what.
*4.* She is pretty poor and she always borrows money from my dad. My dad is kind of a pushover and is afraid to say no, especially to her even though they are not together anymore and haven’t been since I was like 1 year old. She also buys things unnecessarily (like pets) all the time. I’m 17 and even I can see she’s being irresponsible with her money. 
*5.* She has stolen things. I think it’s time for me to mention that I know my mom is mentally unstable. She’s even taken antidepressants and gone to therapy before, but I don’t know if she does still. A while ago when we (me, mom &amp; dad) went to a café she decided to steal a cup from there and I got so mad I started shaking. I asked her why the hell she would steal and she said “bEcAuSe i wAnTeD iT”. Long story short, while we were driving home we argued and she literally threw out the cup out of the window and she later got out of the car while telling us to “fuck off/go to hell” (the swedish equivalent of it) and walked the rest of the way home. Even at this time I didn’t lash out at her and swear at her like I wanted to, I just told her “you can’t just steals things” basically. I think I was around 14/15 at this time. She’s also stolen other things. Yeah, she’s not the best role model.
*6.* She has used cigarettes and snus during my whole childhood. I never liked it because I knew it was dangerous. One time when I was like 7? i even gave her this thing to help her stop smoking for Christmas, which when I look back at it was really sad lmao. 
*7.* When I was around 13 I was vegetarian and my mom would cook for her but not for me, and I barely knew how to cook at that age. Now the reason she didn’t cook was because she was tired, she has chronic pain so I can understand why she would be tired but at that time I could barely cook. She would only cook for me sometimes. 
Ok so I realized this is reaalllyyyyy long so I’ll make a part two if people are interested? Anyways, the point of my post is that I don’t know how to confront her about all this. I am pretty depressed and anxious and honestly haven’t been doing great lately (mostly because of her) and I just feel like I wanna tell her all of this but at the same time I am scared. I know if I confronted her I would cry and I never want anyone to see me cry. I don’t know what to do. I wanna talk to her but I feel like I can’t handle it at this time. I’ve been thinking of doing it when I’m older, but I don’t know if I could wait that long. Thanks for reading if you actually read this whole thing.",03Mar2020,1
519,"Thank you for reading this, I appreciate it. In respect to your time, I'll try to be brief, but I feel that I need to paint the full picture.

I am 28 years old. I live in a depressive, slowly developing country. The last 7 years were spent in an atmosphere that stunted my personal growth and dragged me into depression and decline of my physical and mental health.

I was emotionally blackmailed by relatives to study business against my wish, the education was uneventful. I tried to quit twice, but unexpected events prevented that. In the last year of uni my grandmother fell deeply sick and passed few months after. 2 years later my mother got cancer and passed a year after. Both times came at a key moment where I was stepping on a new path, but I had to drop everything to care for them and missed opportunities. I've seen some gruesome things. 

Those events hurt me deeply and due to the lack of grief and depression awareness in my country and community, both losses were not only left untreated, but also caused most of my friends and some relatives to turn away or bully me for my sadness and inability to cope. This resulted in another 2 years of apathy and gradual decline of mental and physical health. I got sleep problems, chronic IBS and other related chronic conditions. Doctors tell me that if I don't rid myself of stress, it will get worse. It is getting worse and I have lost faith in both doctors and treatment, since I'm constantly stressed anyway.

I tried to get work a few times, didn't succeed. Every attempt is increasingly difficult. Some relatives promised to help me get on my feet. They didn't. 5 months later and nothing is happening. Not only has no one helped me; no one visibly cares. Some relatives harshly mock me for being unemployed to the point where the thought of getting a job triggers anxiety.

I currently live with my dad and spend my days on the PC. I hate exposing him to my bad state, we're both in a constant state of worry. Going outside is impossible for me here with my health. The air is very filthy, I get coughing fits from the thick car smoke. The streets are very dirty and sidewalks smashed. Traffic is chaotic and based on complete disregard for anyone. Road ragers honk for any reason, and at any time. There is 24/7 construction in my street. As a result, nights are never quiet and sleep never peaceful. 
What's worse is that almost any person I talk to here seems to have the mentality of total denial and/or compliance with the corruption and decay going on here. I've heard ""just take it easy"" more times than I'd ever wished for. Internet is weak as well so I can't stream and do YouTube. 

It's also pretty common for people here to set appointments and dates and stand you up without any apology or feedback. 

So that's the picture I wanted to paint. All in all... I feel that if I keep going like this, I won't make it or will fall gravely sick. I feel that I am no longer in state to find a job, let alone keep it. My stress tolerance is next to 0, any stress triggers my IBS for a 2 weeks of pain and medicine. 

I have a few wonderful, precious friends who help me cope with a lot, but they have a hard time advising what I should to.

So my question is... What do I do? I feel like I want to move away to another country to just... Restore my strength, relax away from worry and stress. Somewhere warm and safe and with an accepting community. Can't think of a place like that that would also be affordable... Plus getting a visa is challenging for my nationality... Or maybe there are better things I could try?

I am a BA graduate with no job experience, but I do speak English fluently, German and Russian as well. If that's of any help... 

Thank you if you've read this far, I appreciate it, as well as for suggestions. I will consider them all.",03Mar2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",03Mar2020,1

Long

My GF (37F) of nearly 3 years is heavily considering to be a single mum without me (38M) and I think it's mainly my fault.

I think a little of backstory is needed.

I got married when I was in my 20s because my GF got pregnant and I really believed that I needed to do it properly. We were immature, with nearly no income and rough childhood but we believed we loved each other enough could make it work. We wanted to show to our parents and family that we could do it.

And in a way we managed to be better than them. I learned a trade and got to the community college, making just enough for living, while she was working in her retail job when our kid got into school, she went to college too and got a degree. At the end we both wanted different things and I was particularly poor in the communication side of our relationship.

7 years later, she asked for a divorce and it went down pretty bad for me, financially and mentally. It took two years to have a more balance custody and childcare support and more to gain a new relationship with my son.

My ex-wife got married to a nice bloke after few years, they seem stable and normal and my son is happy with his stepfather and new little sister. It took me quite a lot to get over the jealousy, she was the one who call all the shots, decided to not give me a second chance (I did not cheated but I was a mediocre husband and father back then, too concentrate in make money/work, while she was doing all the childcare/house/work and college) and then left me when she was found someone else.

I concentrate all my energy in working and saving enough to rebuild a normal life and having a better relationship with my son. It took me years, but I am now in a better place.

I live in a small house that I own, I have saving and a good pension fund, I have few friends and I have my son living just 30m from me. I have him every weekend, we do a lot of stuff together and sometimes we share it with his little sister, because she is missing him. So, even if he is 15 and she is 6, they like to do things together

My dating life in the past 5 years was absolutely poor. And I am the one to blame. I had few OLD dates and few hook-ups, I would interrupt any friendship with women that to me, seemed ready to do have a family or things like that. I think I became very selfish and quite a douchebag. Friends were noticing that I was not going anywhere like this and needed to address this commitment issues that were all liked to my ex-wife. I was probably hostage from all the divorce trauma, and started to not see people for who they were but how much damage they could do to me. A very sad thinking process.

I met my current GF just when I started to be more open to women in general. She was not want I was actively looking for, but I felt a connection with her than I didn't had for anyone before. We started to date straightway and I liked that she wanted to go very slowly due to a very high stressing position and her father being ill. 

After 6ish month, she asked me, quite bluntly, if I wanted kids and marriage in the future. I said no. I tried to explain to her why and what I meant by it, but she told me that it's not necessary to explain and that she understood. I felt bad for days, but she didn't change her behavior and our slow paced relationship continued.

Her father died around our first year together. She was completely destroyed by his death. Her mother fall ill shortly and her sister was living with her husband and kids in Europe and she was now taking care of her mother, her apartment, her mother house, few things her father left messy and her job which was stressful and demanding. Believe me when I say I tried to be there for her, but she didn't want me more than the necessary. She was not rude or mean or disconnected, her usually reply to any initiative from me was ""I don't want to impose/disturb/weight on you"". I was more confused from her when her mother died just few months later. I believed that she was going to ""break"" but she didn't. She accepted help from her sister but not from me and I started to believe that the way I framed our relationship at the begging (Let's just date! And the fact she never met my son at that moment) and the way I answered to her sudden question, she decided that I was not there for her more than Netflix and chill on a Thursday night.

I bought a spa thing for Valentines 'day, I actually pat myself in the back because it was the perfect gift, didn't require from me anything and at the same time it was thoughtful. Well, she gave it to her sister that was pregnant and visiting her while she was closing a deal for their parent's house. She told me that it was a wonderful gift and but couldn't decided when to go and use it for her sister instead because she was stressed and pregnant and needed rest before taking a flight back to her other children.

This is an attitude that I keep seeing. This altruism that goes even against her health or interest. I had a small accident, got a 15 days off from work and she came to my place every weekday evenings to cook and clean. I kept asking to not do it, to relax or maybe even sleep since she was looking exhausted, but no, she would just go to the kitchen and cook, then clean the apartment and leave to her place, because she didn't want to accidentally crush my leg or something during the night. She would fly over to her sister in Norway for a week and come back completely stressed out (even if she doesn't tell you). When you asked what she did in Norway, it's just a depressing list of chores for her sister or nephews or brother-in-law. I can see and even feel the love that she has for her family, but the fact that everybody comes first, colleagues, friends, extended family member, volunteer work and her sister that lives on the other side of Atlantic. Her needs are the at the bottom.

During this third year together, I started to be more proactive. She met my son, my ex-wife and her family. We started to meet friends and go to her formal work dinner together. I am proud of her, she is a brilliant professional and she probably makes 3/4x times more than me and I do not mind, but I can see how much cost her, physically and mentally.

Last month she came back from her sister, she called me asking to meet asap, which we did. And she dropped the bomb. She told me that she wants to be a mother before her 40s. That she got a promotion that would be effective in the summer and would be less fast-paced environment. And she has to move to 2 hour drive from where we live now. She went in a clinic/organization who has a bank sperm and you simply choose and inseminate yourself or in the clinic and she decided that that's was okay for her and that she could try it and become a mother. She apologize to me (and I still don't why) and she repeated that she loved me and was very happy to have me in her life but she couldn't wait anymore due to biology. I don't remember much of that conversation, only that I was very confuse and I told her that probably we should stop see each other for a bit.

I realized that that's was not what I meant. I called her and explain that it was like a huge news and I need to ""digest it"" before talk again. If I was a braver person, I would probably got back in the car and let her know that I love her too, and can't think a good reason for not try together. But I did what I always do which is to sit on my emotions and wait for a sign. I called her few times and she confirmed that she is being thinking a lot since the day I said no to marriage and kids, and that was the best solution and to her it would be amazing to still have me as BF while she does her motherhood experience by herself. I talked with my oldest friend and for him, this is part of her ""grieving"" process, that maybe something clicked in her head.

I found her sister Fb account and asked her if I can talk to her. She was very ""angry"" at me and at the situation and she gave me some feedback story. My GF had a long-term relationship in her 20s, a episode that she just mentioned once or twice but with no details, he was a big part of the family and when they were engaged years later she was happy and ready to be a mother. The guy not only left her few weeks before the marriage, but was cheating and got the other woman pregnant in the meantime. My GF had to go to work for nearly a year in the same company as him, watching him got married and become a father in a matters of months. Her sister told me to leave her alone, that she was sick of people get advantaged of her. Which I understand, but she should probably checking herself too, she was not a great help during these years and left her do the heavy lifting between the death of their parents, but I kept for myself.

I wrote her a message asking for a bit of time to spend together and talk more but she is avoiding me. I asked her to come to see my son game and she came, but she was not chatty, did not talk to me much, and left as soon she congratulate my son. I feel like a failure, because I am loosing a person that I love and care and did not fight enough in these 3 years.

If I ask for time to sort out things with my son, the house and financially then she would not really believe, isn't she? I probably would not. I really want us to pause and try to be together more that the once/twice a week thing and she could spend more time with my son in the weekends. I know that for a bit she felt unwelcome due to how my son reacted at the beginning but now he is okay and likes her. The more I think about her as partner, the more I like it, but I already did it and ruin it, and I do not want to disappoint her.

I mean, she is beautiful and successful woman, she is kind and a bit dorky, she could easily find a man that it's more ready and less ""slow"" than me. Sometimes, I am not available emotionally. I just can't process emotions, I need sometime to reflect on those before decide what to do. I didn't when I was young and now I think I force myself to not be spontaneous anymore. She deserves only good things and maybe I should fin the courage to let her go, but I would ended up kicking myself for the rest of my life. I know that I can do all of this things with her, but I can't force her to believe me.

What can I do to let her know that I can be ready to move forward with her? 

How do you know when you are ready to step forward?

She does avoid me, answering after hours, even days, to my texts and calls.

I wouldn’t necessarily call us friends cause we have only ran into eachother 3 times but we stay in touch ab each others lives, have a streak, and are pretty flirty. He’s always wanted nudes but I told him I’ve never done that and didn’t know him well enough and he was really respectful about it, although he still asked from time to time. Keep in mind this was like over a year ago, so I would think a guy only in it for that would have given up. Long story short I finally sent him one a couple days ago (no face or anything that would define me). Before I did he was even like “are you comfortable doing it? That’s the important question”.  After I sent out he hyped me up and we sent some a couple flirty messages back and forth but then he left me on read which is weird for him, especially after what I just sent. If anything he’ll just leave me on delivered. The next day I sent him a fake streak after 24hr to provoke a response out of him, and once again I’m on opened. He never does that. It’s honestly got me doubting what I sent and making me feel insecure. Do you think he doesn’t even want to talk to me now that he got what he wanted? Should I just tell him that took a lot of courage and for him to not talk much after I sent that was really rude? Ugh. Advice please.

526,"TLDR at bottom: I (37F) am getting married this summer to my long time partner (38F). We have saved and scraped our money together to have a nice wedding at a beautiful venue and are beyond excited. I grew up in the southern United States and my parents are both Uber conservative, bible quoting ‘good ole boy’ types. I’ve been out since I was 18. That’s almost 20 damn years. My mom and I have always had a bit of a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ relationship, but when my partner and I got engaged I tried again to get her to accept that I’m a lesbian. Her response was to immediately shut me down and tell me she doesn’t even want to hear it. She just wants to continue living in this half state of truth. I’m supposed to keep coming home for the holidays, alone, and pretend like my life with my partner doesn’t even exist.

My question is, do I send a wedding invite to my parents, or not? Is it just rubbing salt in her wounds, or standing up for myself? I’m so tired of causing her pain, but her reaction and absence is frankly ruining my wedding experience a little and I don’t know what to do.  I certainly don’t want to be selfish, but I feel like this time I need to be a little selfish?

I need to add here that it isn’t the best time for her right now. My aging grandparents, her parents, (who know and support me 100%) are both having some pretty serious health issues, and we lost my uncle (her brother) to cancer a month ago. She’s already kinda of fragile right now, and stressed out, thus my hesitation. 

TLDR I’m getting married to my lesbian partner, my parents are homophobic and don’t want to hear about it. Send an invite, or no?",03Mar2020,1

528,"For unrelated reasons, but now I have no one to talk to except my parents.

One was my best friend of 8 years who over the past few months has slowly stopped texting me back until I gave up a few weeks ago - even ignored her birthday last week. My last text was something like ""We haven't talked much lately and that makes me sad"" and it's been crickets since then...

The other was my ex, so not completely unexpected although I had thought we finally moved past that - we broke up about a year ago - and his decision to cut me off was still really hurtful. He knows I have no one else, and I know I shouldn't expect him to suddenly take the place of my best friend but we had a connection that made it easy to want to treat him that way instead of giving him more space. 

Anyways, any advice on how to move on from these ""friendships"" and how to find people and get close enough to have a best-friendship with someone?

541,"Hi guys,

I really need some help or some form of advice please! 

Let me firstly start by saying, I have always been an introvert from an extremely young age and growing up under strict rules gradually made me even less defiant to speak up or talk back to others as I grew older. I am now 27 and cannot seem to get rid of this anxiety to call out others when I feel disrespected, ignored or pushed aside... but honestly guys I feel as if this has been rooted within me as a result of my younger years. 


So to present day, I am now experiencing a variety of problems in my day to day life... firstly, I find that maintaining eye contact is a massive problem for me.. like IMMENSE (I feel as if people are really reading my mind and can look straight through me. Somehow they are summing up in there heads all of my flaws and drawing a conclusion of me right there and then) this then causes my subconscious to go haywire and I usually end up looking away briefly to then gradually resume eye contact when I feel it is right.. this will continue throughout until the conversation has ended as I feel so awkward when I do. 

In addition, being a fairly small height for a male 5'6 I really don't like having conversations with people taller than me... is this only me... well tbh it's not that I don't like it but I feel as if I'm just being looked down upon... literally I am but in every sense of the word.. I shy away from these conversations as I feel inferior or the 'lesser male'.


Secondly, conversations are a massive NO GO zone for me. I can't seem to get my head around what to say, when to say it and how to come across as nothing less than an idiot you wasted your time speaking to. This is equal to both sexes but far more prevalent for females. I seem to say the wrong things at the wrong time or points I make seem to go unnoticed or blatantly ignored, to which I will gradually creep back into my introverted shell and usually wait to be spoken to again... I mean do people not notice these things?? (friends mainly) In the same instance, when in a social environments with friends, I am always left waiting on others. For example I could go somewhere with a friend and spontaneously my friend will do something he wants e.g. walk off somewhere or go on the phone and have me standing there waiting like a fool. At this point I don't know what to do and subsequently find myself like the waiting guide dog. I hate this and feel as if I'm either following someone around or I'm some sort of underling to them.


Finally, (I do apologise for the long post) pertaining to conversation again. I have this thing where my voice will rise at the end of a sentence and I feel like people don't take to this much and it's as if I am begging for their validation... I've literally spoken like this all my life I have quite I high toned voice + I am tenor singer so baritone accents aren't really my thing... PLEASE HELP!! 

This ties in with trying to make a point in social groups, I will attempt to make a point only to be blocked out by a friend who has raised there voice.. to which I would raise mine to no avail as the friend would only go onto raise his. Stemming back to my childhood I will see this as being impolite to others as it's like I am arguing to get across a point (I mean isn't there a thing as common courtesy and respect for others) and will allow them to talk... only to flip on (once again) that introverted switch and remain quiet only to agree with points or spoke when spoken to again.


I honestly would appreciate it, if someone could take time out of their day to reply or even share a similar experience as to how they overcame this and developed as a person...  any advice is literally gold to me right now.

563,"This is my first post to Reddit so excuse me if I do something super nooby or am posting to the wrong subreddit etc. Warning - this post will be long, but please persevere and give advice. The first four paragraphs are just describing how she acts towards us (and the first paragraph is context), and not the main event that I need help with.

Cast (In order of appearance): Me - Me, Form Tutor - FT, Friend 1 - F1, Friend 2 - F2, Boy she always targets - TB (Targeted boy), Mr. G - Head of year (He's in charge of pastoral stuff in our year), Ms. L - Deputy head of year

For context, I'm in a secondary school in England (Middle School) and at the beginning of the year, I got a new form tutor, not only new to our class but also new to the school, (honestly, it's crazy that she managed to get the role of a form tutor having newly transferred to the school). Also, FT teaches maths so that's why the maths department will be brought up.

FT constantly shouts at the class for tiny, petty or nonexistent issues that most of the time aren't even our fault. When I say shout, I don't mean a slightly raised voice for half a minute, but proper full-on screaming for up to 15 minutes. Sometimes a concerned teacher or student peeks through the small window in the door but they never intervene. FT is the kind of teacher whose eyes light up at the excitement of 'awarding' us with sanctions and detentions. If you run into the classroom even literally 10 seconds after the bell has rung, you will be greeted with a shrill ""YOU'RE LATE, etc, etc."" The reasons for shouting are mostly the state of the form room that we leave behind after lunch. FT always complains about how the desks are crooked, how there are sheets of paper on the floor (because of course teenagers find throwing crumpled maths worksheets and graph paper all over the floor the no.1 best use of our lunch break) and how the batteries keep getting stolen from the remote for the interactive board. The thing is, we don't do any of that. We're not the hellspawn she portrays us as. What actually happens is her classes completely mess up the classroom and don't clean up after themselves. She (FT) of course denies this because she 'always cleans up after her classes.' This is a complete lie. I have come to our form room like a minute before her class ends and I see the room in utter disarray and her not even doing anything about it as she claims. She doesn't even ask her students to tidy up after themselves. I have asked my friends who have come before the class ended and they have backed this up. We have begun taking photos after the last periods of school before the end of the day (we would do the same during our lunch break but we are not allowed our phones and it's not worth us getting detentions) Everything she berates us for has an explanation. The batteries are falling out of the remote? Yeah, maybe it's because THERE IS NO BACK TO THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT. Of course, they will fall out! Her latest session of screaming was triggered by a computer that wasn't working... because she didn't press the on button on the actual computer underneath the desk.

The funny thing is is that we actually clean up after her classes and other people who have lessons in our form room so as to not get shouted at, yet FT seems not to notice this. There is always something that we are to blame for. For example, one morning we had to straighten the desks by ""exactly twenty centimeters!"" her words, not mine and F1 moved a desk a little too far and was about to push it back when FT shouted ""***TWENTY*** CENTIMETRES F1, NOT ***TWENTY-FIVE***!!! and then just continued screeching about how we disrespect her, etc. There is a boy (TB) who has a reputation as a class clown and can be annoying but is actually (mostly) good-hearted and funny. He doesn't ever seriously disturb the class and never is genuinely disrespectful to the teachers. For no evident reasons, FT has an enormous grudge on him and really seems to hate him. She literally treats him like the 'garbage of the class'. TB is also really sporty and recently had an accident with his ankle causing him to need it to be strapped by the nurse. Our school (form time) starts at 8:25 and the nurse opens at 8:30. TB usually plays football with his friends before school but because of his injury, he normally just stands and watches and talks with his friends (that's what he tells us anyway). Anyway, he told FT that he had to go get his ankle strapped by the nurse and she refused him. He said that he had to, he was injured his doctor told him tha- ""DID YOUR DOCTOR TELL YOU TO GO DURING FORM TIME?!?!? DID HE, TB?!? Whenever a desk is in the wrong place, she forces him to carry it around the classroom. Once, someone's friends (out of our form) forgot something (in a plastic bag) in our form room and FT was literally going to throw it in the bin but we convinced her not to do that. Jesus. So she called TB from his desk and shoved the bag into his chest and told him to get it to lost and found. he tried to reason with her because lost and found only opens after school but she practically shoved him out of the classroom and told him to get out of her sight.

Another friend of mine (F2) also gets targeted by FT, for seemingly nothing. F2 isn't a bad student and didn't disrupt the class. But when FT started firing her crap at us, we got a bit annoyed. We would raise our hands and try to reason with her and point out what she was saying was unfair. She would continue on screaming on. Whilst some in the class would get intimidated, shrinking back into their seats to not be noticed and targeted, and some would try to zone out as to not attract attention, some (like F2) would continue trying to reason with FT in hope she would finally realise something and change (not that FT ever did but still). I usually sit observantly, instead of zoning out, and try to remember what she says, which student she is shouting at, on what day did she say it, so if I ever need to supply proof of what she is doing, I can remember most things. I'm thinking of starting to write all this down in detail somewhere, just in case. Sometimes I raise my hand to argue a point but I don't snap back at her as to not aggravate her. When anyone starts coming up with a valid point, FT always interrupts them. Without fail. However, when someone else interrupts her she again starts shouting ""DON'T INTERUPT ME"" or something about disrespect. So, whenever, F2 (and a few others) was speaking and FT would interrupt, she would say something back to her. It was never disrespectful until it kept happening, and people would start snapping back. For example, the most recent one from F2 was ""Well, you're not exactly approachable."" which will come up in the story later. Whenever FT chooses to target someone, F2 has become more frequently chosen.

We get this sort of stuff every other or almost every form time. We got fed up.

So, F1 and F2 decided to write a letter containing most of the classes opinions, signed off by the name of our class, (When I say most of our opinions I am excluding a few people, for example, this boy who has made it his purpose to endlessly suck up to FT) to Mr. G and Ms. L telling them about FT. They asked me to help them write it formally, put their opinion across without being rude and also to make sure the grammar was ok. (Ms. L is an English teacher) Recently, FT has banned anyone from coming into the classroom (except us so we can get our books) during lunchtimes and break times as a punishment for us. We think this is completely unfair. We also complained about how she was hostile to us and how she constantly shouts at us and targets students. The letter was completely respectful. Later I decided to go to Mr. G and Ms. L's shared office with F1 and a few other friends from outside our form who used to hang out with us. We talked about how we cleaned up after her classes, how the actual reason for banning us was to punish us for a problem with her computer that we did not even create, how she's splitting up our friend group etc. Ms. L actually listened to us, but then Mr. G entered the office and took charge after finding out what we were there about (It makes sense, after all, Ms. L was just the deputy). Mr. G immediately took FT's side. He literally didn't even listen to us he just started dismissing all our points and saying how they were irrelevant. He even brought the head of the maths department who said that he has lessons during the second and fifth periods and when he comes into the classroom, it's always really messy. He says that we must be the ones making the classroom messy and that is unacceptable. The thing is, our school day is like this - Form time, Periods1-3, break, periods 4-5, lunch, periods 6-7. Notice how those are not after breaks, but instead after **other lessons**. How does he know that we are the culprits if he doesn't even teach there every day? As well as this, we were blamed for stealing batteries out of the remote. Those very same batteries, we found under the teacher's desk and on the floor because they had fallen out because the remote has **no back to the battery compartment. UUUUUGH.** I used some of my washi tape to make a back for the compartment after that. 

After this (and some more) all my friends left, apart from F1, and we began talking about how hostile FT was to us, how she intimidated us, insulted us and called us stupid, etc. Apparently, Mr. G had talked to FT earlier and discussed the letter we sent. Apparently, FT portrayed us as some sort of hellspawn, whilst she was this damsel in distress in the middle of it all. She said how rude we were to her and how we slandered her and shouted at her.  The thing that really got me, though, was what she said about F2. Apparently, after being told that F2 participated in writing the letter, FT said that of course, F2 wrote it as that morning FT was talking to the class and F2 started screaming at her saying she was unapproachable and evil and firing all sorts of insults at her. She made it seem like F2 had done this whole letter for revenge. Mr. G gave us this look of disapproval mixed with 'I know why they did it'. I was so angry. I sustained for the next 5 minutes and then we left and I was so angry my eyes were blurring and I just kept repeating, ""I am so angry, I am **so angry**."" I had wasted my entire lunch break to hear how all my friends and I were liars and how we were the problem. Pastoral is meant to make sure that children are being treated well and are happy, not the opposite! 

F1, F2, TB and I have decided we are all willing to write letters to someone in higher authority than Mr. G. I'm sure there are some other people who would be willing but who would we write to? The headmaster sounds too extreme, maybe Mr. B, the head of pastoral? We don't know if this will aggravate the situation or not and we aren't sure what to do. 

It would be really great if one of you guys could help me out. Thanks.

565,"Let me just start by saying I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for any formatting problems.  So I started a new job in manufacturing about 3 months ago, I work night shift and there's only about 6 of us in my department (5 of us plus the lead).  All of them have been there for 3 or more years, most much longer, so they're fairly tight knit but I get along with most everyone, and try to keep my head down and work hard.  

Like any job, there are things I don't like about it, until recently it's mostly just been the lack of communication from the lead regarding job expectations (he really only talks to one other worker on shift religiously, and on one occasion has actually ignored me when I asked a question straight to his face).  While it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, I very rarely need to interact with the lead at all, my position involves being on a machine with another co-worker, and look to him for answers to work related questions.  I have the potential at this job to make more money hourly than I've ever made before in only a couple year's time, it's close to home, and it generally doesn't kill my body, so I'd like very much to stick it out.   

However..

I've noticed in the past on a few occasions our lead talking trash about people to his favorite coworker behind their backs, and have come to realize that most things our very quiet lead does happen to say are usually inflammatory judgemental or critiques of people, and he never gives the person he's talking about the right to even defend themself as he says it behind their back, often in a break room with several other co-workers on shift.  Again bad taste, but trying to stick it out.  

Fast forward to last night.  Company insurance requires we do stretches before shift, and at shift meeting a coworker who tends to bear the brunt of lead's shit talking happened to be a few minutes late, and missed our stretches.  Shift lead and fav coworker start making comments about how ""maybe he's in jail, finally got caught for being a chomo"", and carrying on in front of all the other employees on shift.  To my knowledge, this man has no criminal background whatsoever, and I don't believe he's aware of the things they say about him.  I had heard those two ripping on him before, but never in such a way as calling him a freaking chomo, in front of everyone no less.  At very least it's unprofessional, and honestly seems to me that it might constitute bona fide harrassment.  

I don't know what to do.  I considered telling coworker what they've been saying about him but that could start a potential shit storm, the likes of which I won't have any ability to control.  I'm also considering meeting with HR and telling them about it, disliking someone is absolutely no excuse for calling them a child molester in front of their peers, but if I go to HR lead and probably several of my coworkers will be talked to, knowing I narced on them and will likely treat me as a pariah, almost certainly making my remaining time at this job miserable and likely talking shit about me too.  

I isolated myself all shift with my thoughts, and only communicated to others curtly about work related things.  My demeanor must of been apparent, because people who would normally chat me up gave a wide berth.  The only person who noticed and cared enough to ask me if I was ok?  The guy they called the chomo.  I told him I was fine, just dealing with a personal dilemma, wasn't sure what to do.  

Do I tell him what they're saying about him?

Or go to HR and bring what I truly feel is harrassment to light?  Lead has been there for 25 years I heard, not likely they'll fire him or maybe even do anything about it, but apparently at least one other person in the past quit over lead/fav co-worker's nonsense, so it seems to be a reoccurring theme.  

Alternatively, I could keep my mouth shut.  Doesn't feel right to me though, this guy doesn't deserve what is being said about him and has been one of only decent and welcoming people I've met there.  I feel he deserves better.  

TL;DR:  Coworker was called a chomo by shift lead behind is back in front of everyone else on shift, can't decide if I should tell him or go to HR, or keep my mouth shut.",03Mar2020,1

So basically i’ve had the same friend group since middle school ( i’m currently on my last year of high school). There’s nothing wrong with them but we’ve never been really close. The more i see them, the more i realize we’re completely different. For example, they talk behind people’s back A LOT, and this is something i’m very uncomfortable with. Overall, we just don’t have the same energy. I’m pretty sure the only reason why we are friends is because we are in the same class. 
    The situation is making me very sad because i don’t even have real friends. I guess i could just cut them off, but to be honest i would have nobody to be friends with and that’s worse.

   Wich brings me to my second question: HOW DO YOU EVEN MAKE FRIENDS????
I don’t do anything outside of school and i have strict parents. Tbh one of my biggest regret of high school is not having a group of real close friends that are like me, so we could just go out and enjoy life together.

585,"Friday night a couple of friends and I left for a short birthday weekend. My friend Brittany just turned 25, so we went to a nearby city to celebrate. The group consisted of her childhood friends, sister in law, and I. I have become closer friends with them in the past year, but Brittany is my main connection, as they've been close for a long time. Anyway, I discovered a lot about this group of girls from the drive in, and the few days we had together.

We played games, and three of the girls would ""jokingly"" kiss each other. Apparently, when they're extremely drunk this happens, they don't think anything of it and just think it's funny. It's just a quick peck. They all kept saying how they wanted to kiss each of us.

I at first declined because I don't have much ""physical"" experience outside of the three people I have dated. Being physical with someone is significant to me, and I even discussed this with them when they asked me a couple questions during the game. On Saturday night, Brittany, Allie, and I drank far more than we planned. While we were getting ready, Allie kept joking she still hadn't kissed me. I went up to her and kissed her on the cheek, in a ""showy"" way (grabbed her face and made a loud kissy noise). She ended up grabbing my face back and kissed me on the lips. I laughed and didn't make a deal of it, I actually didn't really mind it. We kept drinking and she ended up cuddling on me while we were playing the game. We left the hotel and started looking for a place to eat. She continued to be handsy, grabbing my waist and hand, and even my butt a few times. After dinner, we went to a nearby bar she pulled me to the side and kissed me a few more times, to the point we were almost making out. She asked if we could ""do more in secret"". I had heard her say to someone how she really wanted to ""get with me"" before we had left. While we were sitting together, she would stroke my thigh and be very touchy. She had her had underneath my shirt and was very close to my chest.

We all went back to the hotel and started playing a new game, but we were all extremely drunk at this point, so we started getting ready for bed. While Brittany was in the shower she grabbed my face again and we started to make out. Brittany walked out and saw, and turned back to the bathroom. This time, she kept the door opened, so we stopped. She then grabbed my arm and basically was just holding my hand and being touchy, but not trying to push anything further. That was the end of it, and we fell asleep.

She is actually in a relationship, but is very unhappy with him. I don't think ""kissing"" is a big deal to her, but this seemed far different than how she was behaving with the other girls. I know she wanted us to do more, and honestly, I did too. Which is surprising for me. I just started dating a new guy and I have done more with her than I have with him, and I *wanted* to do more with her. I still do. I never was ""against"" the idea of physically being with a girl, but I have always only been attracted to guys.

I don't know how these things work. I'm assuming we're going to never talk about it (I have friends who have hooked up with other friends and they basically say it is just never discussed). But, I want to know what she thought of it all..I also want it to happen again. I don't want to make it a ""thing"", but I don't know if I should do anything from here.

The thing is, they are really different and their disagreements began when we moved and, my brothers incessant playing would not let my sister sleep (their rooms are next to each other) She asked him to stop, but he never listens to anything so this behaviour kept going. 
This is one of the few things my sister tolerated throughout her uni years. She kept telling my father about his son's problem and his lack of responsibility, but he ignored her completely.

I am at fault too, I defended him at times and ignored his childlish personality because he was fun.

As years went by, their attitude towards each other worsened. They cant have a decent conversation without arguing.

My sister things my brother is a failure, an addict and  an aggressive maniac. My brother thinks my sister is a bitch and a liar. Months ago they got in a fight so bad they hit each other. 

I write this because just today they got in a really bad fight just before my sister left for work. My sister told him about how he didn't let her sleep the other night and that she was fed up. My brother got annoyed and with a childlish reaction threw water at her. They almost hit each other again.

My sister and mother (and me too honestly) are really mad at my father because he doesnt make an effort to change his son. I don't expect my brother to change by himself because hes to childlish and cant accept criticism. My sister told our father that she doesnt care about this situation anymore because she's so upset that she's moving out. My father got offended and threatened us by saying that he would leave us without a source of income.

The situation is way worse than it appears, I cant write every little detail here. Our family dynamics are not the best to begin with.

I need help. How do I get my brother to change? How do I keep my sister at my side? And how do I do this quickly before the situation gets even worse?",03Mar2020,1

589,"Hey reddit, 

Not sure if I am using this subreddit correctly so feel free to delete this. I just got some crazy news and need to vent, maybe get advice or talk to people with similar situations. 

So this weekend I had a pretty big bomb dropped on me. Im 26 m (if that matters) and my family has always just been me, my mom, dad, and brother (24). Well, turns out when my dad was a teenager he had a girlfriend who was cheating on him, the story is they broke up and he never heard from her again. Welp, turns out she got pregnant and through the power of modern technology and DNA testing, I now know I have a half sister who is 12 years older than me. 

This has been crazy, and my emotions and thoughts have been all over the place. I've been so wrapped up in my thoughts that its affecting my work and personal life. I feel so guilty and angry. Let me explain. 

My parents have always done this. They don't want to tell us distressing news so they put it off till the last second. Come to find out my half-sister actually reached out to me through a simple facebook friend request months ago thinking that my parents had already told me who she was. I had no idea who she was at the time who I denied the request. Now I understand who she is and feel horrible for what I have done and absolute anger towards my parents for not telling us sooner and for my mom wanting nothing to do with my half-sister. 

I also feel immense guilt for having a father. The best father in the world. I would be nothing without him and he has helped me through so much. I think about all the fun trips and everything he has done for me. All of our conversations and how he taught me how to be a man. He helped me get the career I have now, and I think of all the blood and sweat he has shed to give us the best life he possibly could.  He has always been there for me... but she didn't have that. I don't think my half-sister even had a father... but I did.. I had OUR father... and so did my brother.

My girlfriend is happy for me, new member to the family. She doesn't see or understand how hard this is going for me. She just wants me to be happy again but this has been pretty hard for me. 

I feel myself falling into depression over this, but it is getting easier. 

Thank you for letting me get all of that off my chest.",03Mar2020,1

593,"So I run a part time computer repair business aside from my normal full time job. Recently a very successful local ISP company in our town has offered me to bring my business full time in his store. He will not be paying and any business I do will be 100% profit for me. He wants me to work in his store to help promote his product when a computer product is needed, create more walk in traffic, handle tech support issues they have that they cannot figure out. He is not making me pay rent or electric. I personally feel like this is a great opportunity for me and my business because he wants to promote me as well, which could increase my clients greatly. The only thing that scares me right now is that I do not make as much money on pc repairs as I do with my full time job. But I also am not far out from making the same. I feel like this business opportunity could put me within the same income if not double within 3 months. The unknown is what is scary for me and making me indecisive to make that leap of faith.

594,"So my workplace is huge (a factory), which is divided into multiple areas, which are divided into zones on different levels. Each zone has a team of about 20 people. Recently i heard that a guy working for the same company, but in a different building got a 'promotion' and is moving into our building. This guy is rather intimidating, not because of his height (he is short) or muscles (he is fat), but because of the things he told me about himself and his life (he's doing bad things and has a shit attitude). We ended up having a (small?) fight/arguement which led to a lot of tension between us when i worked with him. Now ever since i heard he's going to move into our building next week, i've been dreading that moment. Him possibly ending up in my area, in my zone and having to see him every day all the time.

How should i deal with this? You may think that the chances are low that he ends up in my zone specifically, but so were the chances of HIM specifically getting a contract and HIM specifically moving to our building (since there are 3. So based on my bad luck, it wouldn't surprise me if he did.

So how do you guys do it? What tips do you have for me?

Thanks in advance

TL;DR: A guy who is into really bad things is coming to our building at work and possible in my zone/section. Resulting in me seeing him everyday the entire time. We did have a past and have had a verbal fight, which resulted in us both hating each other. How should i go about this?",03Mar2020,1

I noticed one of the girls tended to be a bit of a ""me monster"", but I decided to not dwell on it too much because I really wanted friends. 

Well, we all met up again tonight and this girl completely monopolized the whole conversation. It was exhausting and I don't want to really spend a lot of time with her if I have to pretend to be interested in her stories, but I still want friends and I think the other girls are cool.

599,"I've been letting my hair grow out and do it's own thing for a good few months now, and my mom doesn't seem to hesitate to tell me how much she wants me to ""get it fixed."" I keep doing my best to politely remind her how I'm an adult, that I'm fine with my hair, how she needs to respect that my decisions with what I do to my body are mine to make and that's final, and she needs to stop making a big deal over it.

Recently, my mom told me that one of her friends got tickets to see Hamilton, and her son apparently forgot to get the day off from work to go see it. So me, being the huge fan of musicals, didn't hesitate to tell my mom to tell her that I would go. But she's saying how I need to get my hair dealt with if I want to go see Hamilton cause she told her friend how I haven't had a haircut since the last time she saw me. So, I have to deal with my hair, or I can't go see Hamilton.

It just doesn't seem fair to me how she makes me feel like I'm still a child that needs to do what my mommy says or else I'd be put in timeout, and I'm seriously contemplating whether or not I should give up and let her have her way, just so I don't have to deal with her harassment everyday over something as stupid and trivial as my fucking hair. But if I give in on this, then I know that she won't stop pushing when I experiment with my hair in the future.

601,"I have recently been becoming closer friends to a female coworker. We work in a small, close knit career field, so she’s also friends with another coworker I was dating for over a year. I’d say her friendship with him was like a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1, being acquaintances, to 10, being bffs, if that makes sense. They only ever hung out through mutual friends. Since I’ve gotten closer to her the past few months, she knows a lot about his and my relationship after venting to her about him many times. About a month ago he ended things with me, but since they were friends before she and I got closer, I never even thought to ask her not to talk to him or anything because it didn’t feel like my place. It didn’t bother me until recently because she did few weird things. She went to a group thing with him, and seemed to avoid telling me he was there because she told me about everyone else there except him. I chalked it up to maybe she just didn’t want to bring it up in case it was awkward. Then the other night I was venting to her about him, on the verge of tears and told her “I just want my best friend back,” and the next thing she says is,”Yeah... I’m gonna hit him up to get ice cream or dinner with him tomorrow!!” And i was.. baffled? because I’m here crying to her about him and her next thought is to hang out with him one on one?? Which they’ve never done?? I didn’t say anything because I was just confused as to why it seems like she’s trying to get closer to him all of a sudden. I am honestly not worried about her hooking up with him or dating him, but I don’t really understand her thought process on this. I’m trying to think of a way to confront her about it, cause it almost seemed like she was throwing their friendship in my face. I also don’t believe she has any ill intent, so I don’t want to come at her sideways. I’m supposed to move in with her in a few weeks, so I’m trying to tread lightly until then. She makes it clear that she values our friendship. I just need advice on if i should even bother to confront it, and how I should confront her without trying to make it sound like I’m being controlling about their friendship.

TLDR; My female friend seems to be trying to get closer to my ex after he just broke up with me. They became friends after we started dating, but before she and I started being friends. It seems innocent, but she doesn’t really seem to see that she’s crossing a line with it, how do I confront her without seeming controlling?",03Mar2020,1

I was shocked and all the people i knew had already taken apartments and also i didn't apply for hostel allotments( which was over by then). After that i was devastated on the fact that he just left me out to dry. He stopped talking ever since. The thing that hurt most ws 3 people apartments were available easily.

The big argument sprung up from when she interrupted me then got mad that I was talking over her. She said that there's no reason I should be talking over her since she's my mother. I said that she interrupted me and she said that she did but that didn't matter. She then went on a long debate on how I was selfish and spoiled. Her argument? That she gives me a lot. I responded that I didn't ask for much directly, and she said that I was so selfish that I expected to be given things. The things I was being selfish for being given? Phone access, a room to myself, her driving me to school, and cello lessons. She said that she could stop all of these things and I was being spoiled for expecting those things to come. 

The argument continued saying that if she wanted to, she could just stop all of those things and make me sleep on the couch, take my phone/PC, and make me take the bus to school (which for a little bit of context is about 20 mins by car ride away). A lot of the argument stemmed off that I don't do too many chores around the house and I will never be able to repay her, thus, I should give her a certain level of respect (like not talking over her in the beginning like I mentioned). She kept rehashing the same points that I was spoiled since I was living in an upper middle class life and since I was expecting that things like my education and housing were provided that I was being even more spoiled/selfish.

It is halfway through the school year. My second period Honors class is by far the most difficult. They do not want to learn and they do not listen to me at all. Every classroom management technique I have tried has blown up in my face. For the first few weeks of this semester, I treated them lightly. Then I was observed and told to be more heavy-handed. Unfortunately, I was too strict. Think of it from 0-100, with the ideal being 50. 

Yesterday my observing superior came back to observe me in this class. It was a nightmare. No matter what I tried to do, students talked and cut up. One even looked at inappropriate websites on his Chromebook. The entire class saw my superior rip into me, and they have lost the rest of their respect for me as a result. 

As a student teacher who dropped into the middle of an established classroom in January, I was not able to establish expectations or implement a behavior plan. My cooperating teacher had her own methods, and they work for her. When I try them the same way, however, they fail.

At the beginning she said that we could wait for each other, since we had waited for so long anyways. But now she doesn't want to wait and pretty much said that we could be together.

I'm feeling devastated because the last two weeks have been really good for me and I wanted to be with her so much, but I can't just cope with the fact that someone would change her feelings about someone so fast...but I still need to do the same.

Truth is, I'm hating my life right now, I graduated as a Lawyer in my home country Venezula, but the country is fucked and I can't practice my career and now I'm studying Ingenieering so I can't leave to a better place (maybe Australia) and I wanted her to come with me after that time.

I don't know if I could hold on for 3 more years while I graduate...I would be a 27M and I don't think I would have many opportunities left, if any. And I'm doubtful I would just let her go and still try to go find her after 3 years, if everything goes to like I want to.

So...how can I stop thinking about her and just let her go? I want her to be part of my life, but that's not gonna happen, and even though she wants to stay as friends, I don't know if I can.",03Mar2020,1
624,"Alright, to start this out I'm 16 and a Sophomore in High School. I am finally turning to Reddit to try and help me answer this question. I recently have noticed that every girl I have ever been interested in has told me that we are better off as friends, and then proceeded to get with extremely shitty guys who will almost assuredly have no future. Now let me make it clear that if this girl thinks we are better off as friends I completely respect that decision and I would understand not wanting to be in a relationship with me, as they are their own person capable of making their own choices. 

The only concerning part is that consistently these girls go after guys that are just terrible people. Usually older that are extremely manipulating and often sell drugs. I would completely understand if they got with somebody like a lower key musician or a popular guy in the football team, but WHY a 18-20 year old who 99% of the time will use you and then throw you aside. Again pardon if I'm being dumb or inconsiderate but I just don't understand why.

That being said I am not a ""weird"" kid at my school and am known by pretty much everybody (I don't want to 
come off as having a massive ego either, but I find it hard to explain my strengths without coming off as a dick). I played basketball up until this year when I broke my wrist. I've played piano for about 10 years and I have a ≈3.875 GPA. Other people say that I'm pretty approachable and I'm also pretty physically fit and have a kind a famous 6 pack. 

Obviously I still have flaws both physically and personality wise, but I think that most are preference and not underlying mental or abusive things. If you read all of this thank you.

Anyways if you read all of this and have some explanation",03Mar2020,1

626,"Recently, I attempted to finally cut ties with a toxic person in my life. I cared immensely for him, was attracted to him, and wanted a meaningful friendship if nothing else. I kept getting hurt trying to maintain the friendship until it became clear he was only interested in having sex. A fwb situation. That wasn't something I was interested in, but I kept in contact because he was severely depressed, suicidal, lonely and claimed to be afraid of rejection/abandonment. I'm an empathetic sponge, and I did not want to hurt him. He would tell me that I was the most consistent person in his life, that everyone else has left him except for me. To leave out a lot of details, he was emotionally abusive, and I let him take me for granted. I made majority of the effort to keep us close, and I was constantly confused about if he even truly cared about or not. When I cut ties, I gave him a proper explanation as to why and then blocked/deleted his number. I was still attached to him, though. And I missed him after a while. 

The way I kept tabs on him and maintained a connection was checking his Reddit. He didn't know that I knew his username, but tbh he was really stupid in the way he accidentally revealed it. After 3 weeks of no contact, I checked his Reddit to find him posting about suicide now more than ever. He had always said that as much as he wanted to, he couldn't do it because he was afraid of death. But now he was saying that he was finally ready to end it. My heart shattered, and I felt so desperate to help. He hadn't posted on Reddit since saying that. A whole day went by, and I started to panic. I couldn't not go see if he was okay.

 I drove to his house just a few minutes away, unannounced. I got there and saw his car parked so I knew he was home. I knocked on the door. No response. Knocked again. Nothing. Rang the doorbell a couple times. Still nothing. My worst fears started to seep in. Until finally, after a few long minutes that seemed to last an eternity, I heard a rustling inside and he slowly came to the door. It was 3 pm, and he had been asleep. He looked like a mess. There was no life in his eyes. He didn't smile, looked me up and down. Opened the door and asked, ""What are you doing here?"" Now, I didn't rehearse anything. I just came to see if he was okay, so that's what I said. He said with his guard up, ""I'm fine."" I was looking at him, breathing heavy out of relief that he was just alive. From his perspective, he thought I was here because I changed my mind and wanted to be in his life again. When I said that wasn't the case, he became more confused and standoffish. After a few minutes of words exchanged and the topic of him only wanting to fuck me came up, he shut down, said he wasn't going to engage with me, said, ""Goodbye."" As he tried to shut the door, I said, ""Wait, please don't push me away."" He said, ""I'm not pushing you away. You already did that."" He painted me as the villain, and I started to lose it. He shut the door, and I started to call out his name, begging him to come back and listen. I started apologizing relentlessly for hurting him. It was absolutely pathetic. After a couple minutes, he opened the door again and told me I didn't hurt him. Shut the door again. I started my antics again until finally he had enough and snapped at me and said, ""Do you realize I have neighbors? Someone's gonna call the police about a girl crying at my door. You're acting like a fucking 15 year old, and it's annoying."" I said, ""I'll have no peace unless I get closure with you."" He said, red in the face, ""I don't care! Go!"" And so I left. 

I was hurt and embarrassed. It was a mistake, and I fully acknowledged it. I hated myself for the way I acted. But I just became so desperate to be heard by him that all logic and rationality went out the window. 

I still kept tabs on him through Reddit. I hated myself for doing that, too. But I just couldn't let go. A few more weeks later, he posted about killing himself again. He really wasn't letting it go, and it seemed like any day now. I texted him and said, ""I don't blame you if you want nothing more to do with me, but is it possible to recover and still be friends?"" He responded and said, ""I can't deal with the behavior. You're 23 going on 12. Please fuck off."" 

I followed his orders. I haven't spoken to him since. He doesn't know why I came. He doesn't know I came to see if he was live. He doesn't know just how much I cared for his well being. 

Should I tell him the truth? Would it change anything? Or should I leave him alone forever and let him have this awful perception of me? 

Please try not to be too rude and judgmental. I already hate myself enough for how immature I acted. It's not who I am.",03Mar2020,1
627,I accidentally went to a doctor in my small town that is sketchy. They spent two weeks getting my referral to a doctor there but I wanted a doctor in a major city and currently waiting on three weeks to get my referral. Total of 5 week.

630,"So, this is a bit of a long shot. I am in an extremely untenable place, and despite my efforts it seems I can't shake it - crap just seems to, you know, string along no matter what (series of crappy relationships, horrible jobs, and I despise the city I live in). I am at a point where I worry about a complete nervous breakdown.

So I've been wondering if anybody has basically said ""enough is enough"" and started over from scratch. Just get rid of everything and move someplace you know nothing and nobody. I wouldn't mind moving abroad either, the country I live in is very safe and all, but it's... unhealthy.

What did you do? Was it a good idea? What worked, what didn't? What advice do you have to someone like me? What place did you leave and where did you move to and why? Did you change careers? Etc.

I am 45 so I figure, it's now or never, especially if I want to move to another country.

I am not rich but I do have some money saved up, which would make things a bit easier. Having lived in urban centers all my life I never learned how to drive a car, so that would make things tougher. I'd want to stay in touch with my immediate family (parents, siblings, nieces and nephews) and maybe one friend, but that's about it.

632,"I'm mentally ill (clinically diagnosed) and prone to emotional instability. It's something I've been working on for years. Usually, when I feel the impulsiveness starting, I take a few hours to calm down. It's the only thing that works for me - I can't make reasonable decisions when I'm upset.

Unfortunately, yesterday was one of my bad moments and I'm disappointed in myself.

I play FFXIV to destress from school/work. The people in my guild are nice, some of them I don't know very well, but a few I hang out/chat with regularly.

I was already having a bad day and saw these particular people making plans with each other, they needed one more person, but no one asked me, even though I would've been glad to help and had done so before. It was a few mins later that I saw the messages, they'd already gone by then.

I know it's petty, but that set me off. They had moved on to a different thing when I logged back in the evening, and again I saw them waiting for 1 more person before giving up and running it with a random player. 

I was already suffering from burnout in this game and considered quitting the guild right then. I made the extremely childish decision of taking them off my friends list and deleting them on Discord. I guess they noticed cause the next day, even their usual greetings were missing and they ignored me every time I spoke up in chat to be social.

Oh I know, these people probably never considered me that much of a friend in the first place (they have their own clique), and tbh I wouldn't call them particularly close either. But it still sucks to be an afterthought, especially since I can't avoid them in the guild (I've resolved to stay - I've been here longer than them, with other actual friends in the community, and it's immature to quit over this)

Meh. Idk. I'm not upset over losing them specifically, I just hate being made to feel like an outsider in a community where I normally actively participate. I'm considering apologising for unfriending (that sounds so childish, but you know what I'm referring to) them and explaining that I was dealing with other stressors, just to remove this awkwardness. I don't have to be best pals with them, I just dislike this tension.

Thanks for listening.",03Mar2020,1

638,"WARNING: This is a long read. 

I've been dating this guy for almost 3 years. Since the very beginning I've been helping him whenever he needed financial aid. I like to help others specially someone who I ""love."" The more time passes the more it seemed he was taking advantage of me."" But perhaps it's all in my head."" I thought. 

I had 3k on my savings account. He wanted to buy this car (cash only) but he somehow managed to self sabotage the deal by making an idiotic mistake ( no one would do) with his bank transaction. Since it was now or never type deal and he was going to get the money back in a few days. I took all the money out of my savings plus took some money out of my credit cards so he could have the car he has now. That was 2 years ago. He never paid me back. Whenever I brought it up he would get angry and start charging me for everything he has done for me.

 He asked me to move in with him when I lost my apartment and get this guys. I lost it because of him !! right. 🙄 Then I got diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, and PTSD  ( I wonder why? 😂🤦🏻‍♀️) -Sarcasm-
 I got too overwhelmed at work and ended up quitting. I lived with him for 6 month without paying rent. I assumed he was lending me a hand being a good bf as I've been a good gf to him. (Am I wrong for assuming ? I have gone to the end of the earth for this guy.) 
Whenever I asked for my money he would tell me I had to pay him for those 6 month I lived with him rent free. I thought it was fair, so I deducted it from what he owed me. Not what he was looking for. He still managed to somehow not pay me. 

 It was very childish and weird. But his tantrum were rather scary for me to reciprocate. I always dropped it. 

Somewhere down the line when he saw himself with a lot of bills, he had this amazing idea  for us to become one with our financial. I didn't liked the idea. Mostly because I had a lot of student loan debt and now credit cards debt as well. I didn't thought it was fair for him to pay half of my debt. Eventually he became so pushy I agreed. I knew it was not going to end well. We split everything 50/50 and I mean everything! Any type of expenses, even gas. I was paying for his half with no hesitation but he was always hesitant and angry when it came to pay mine. We did this for maybe 3 month, until one day he explodes. So I said ""let's not do this anymore.  I'll pay for half rent and utility and my all of my debts and you pay your own stuff like car insurance, gas, etc..."" So we've been doing just that for the past 7 month or so. 

Today all of the sudden he tells me
 ""I put $30 on gas today are you going to give me half like we agreed upon?""

I told him ""No, we already had this conversation many times it never ended well. We already agreed not to do that. I have a lot of debt to pay off and not much money."" He gets angry. And says ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY!"" 

I got up and gave him the biggest NOPE! I told him I'm not doing this anymore. I was having such a good time reading my book. Sometimes it seems as if he gets jealous of my  alone time and  make myself happy since all he do it's suck the happiness out of me and play videogames 24/7. He wants me to sit near him doing nothing while he plays videogames. As soon as I start to do my own thing or move to a more quieter area of the house. He'll look for me. Say ""I miss you."" Or at the end of the day when he's all bored of playing videogames and I'm exhausted about to fall asleep. That's when he wants to ""Give me attention.""  It's short lived as he ended falling asleep 10 minutes into our interactions.
So I don't know what's the point on asking me to stay awake cause he wants to spend time. 🤦🏻‍♀️

The weird thing this behavior shows up randomly. As sometime he acts like a guy I would like to have around. I forget all the shit he have done but then that personality of his shows up and It makes me want to run away far far away from this guy.

until during reading week when i had a group of my friends over and happened to be on the couch half cuddling my older brother for a probably 5 minutes or something, i also tend to show a lot of affection to everyone in general, i hug and kiss people all the time, so as i was getting up from the couch i have my brother a peck on the cheek

no one said anything until the day after when one of my friends was like “damn you must’ve been drinking hella cause you were kinda all over big bro” and another friend snapped me a pic of my bro and i with the caption “stepbrother ;) you know what’s up” which i thought was a bit unnecessary.

ive known them since i was a baby essentially, so even though they aren’t blood related to me, it still feels like they are, my dad and their mom got married after she had the 18yr old so i was literally a year old when they became my brothers. 

like, we’ve all been cuddling and giving each other kisses forever really. and it’s so nice and comforting to have that kinda dynamic between us, cause when i was having weird relationship problems i would just plop myself into their rooms and we would just cuddle and talk for as long as we would need to, vice versa if they were having problems. 

and my favourites are when we’re just chilling and cuddling and suddenly we just shower one another with pecks and affection, it’s so lovely 

there’s nothing sexual about it, i just love them so much!!

So last January my boyfriend started his second semester at a state university on the GI Bill benefits.  He'd had an okay first semester, but the second started and ended as a nightmare.  The school was embroiled in a lengthy faculty strike, delaying classes and forcing the school to push the withdrawal date back multiple times in the hopes it would be resolved before they lost all their students.

My boyfriend stuck with it as long as he could through the subs the school provided, but finally withdrew on the final withdrawal date as the strike was not yet resolved.  He also informed the schools veteran office of this so not to impact his benefits.

Fast forward to summer when he goes to register for fall and low and behold the school has lost his withdrawal.  It's clear he withdrew.  He showed up to no classes after the date and went through the veterans office to ensure they knew he'd withdrawn and to cancel payment, but the school still wants to charge him the full semester.

Of course he disputes this and files an appeal, but the school denies it stating that they had proof he attended after the withdrawal date.  Turns out an assignment he turned in before withdrawing was graded and entered into the system after the withdrawal date, which the school argues proves he was there for one class and therefore he owes on all classes.  To make things more obnoxious the school considers the matter closed and will not accept any further appeals.

We've been paying the bill so not to hurt his credit, and are still waiting to hear from Veterans Affairs as to whether or not they'll retroactively pay the bill (the veterans office at the school claims they can, but it's still possible they could deny the charge).  We're just tired and frustrated with this whole ordeal as he's had no luck finding work, the school bill is essentially eating 75% of what he makes through VA disability, he can't attend further classes until the bill is paid, and we're not sure what to do to make this problem go away.

We've considered the following options but others are welcome

* Lawyer
    * I'm pretty sure this wouldn't go anywhere as the school like any other big organisation has you sign so many rights away with all their policy forms.
    * Not sure we could afford it either.
* Media
    * My bf apparently knows someone with some minor connections at a local paper.  ""School charges veteran for classes he didn't attend"" is not a good look for a school near a military base that enrolls a lot of veterans especially after years of other big public issues.
* Acceptance
    * Just pay the school the several thousand dollars over the next two years then never go back.  I'd love to see him further pursue his education, but this definitely left a bad taste in his mouth.

Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",03Mar2020,1

**Main points:**

Visited blackpill and incel subs for a few weeks regularly. Developed insecurities about being short and not a Chad. (Stopped going through that stuff more than a month ago)

Whenever I see a picture of 9/10 or 10/10 handsome, tall dudes, I feel insecure and shit.

Seeing an insta-thots' pictures makes me feel unworthy of good sex and I still put pussy on a pedestal subconsciously.

**Question:**

***Q.*** *How to not be an incel subconsciously?*

I'm not full of shit, still feel that way due to the incel stuff I've seen. Can't bear the presence of better-looking men around me and seeing women get instantly wet as they are around Chads. Feel like a cuck.",03Mar2020,1

663,"Hi everyone,

I work a travel job since I finished college. 

I’ve done this for 4 years. It’s pays amazing, but lately I’ve noticed I’m burnt out. I haven’t had a vacation in years because there’s always something that comes up (we have to project our travel 3 months in advanced). Recently, a college friend of mine passed from cancer earlier last week. I asked my teams if there would be any issues taking time off if my travel was not effected, but due to deadlines I was declined. Not only that, I’m dealing with issues at one of my sites I travel to for work (they don’t know what they’re doing and I just noticed this- was escalated, but our client already saw how bad it has been so all fingers point to me)

I dread opening up my laptop. I hate hearing my email ringer go off on my work phone. I was only home in January 5 days. February was better, but I was still gone 10 days. The company is focused on us traveling to our doctors to talk about compliance with the sites because this makes revenue. 

I want to quit. I don’t have a social life, gained 12 pounds, and mentally not happy with work. I also have my girlfriend whose about to move in with me if she gets into a nursing program in my area. Luckily, She’s supportive of my mental health and would want me to work somewhere else 

I can’t quit because it pays well. I’m able to pay for my parents mortgage and my own. And if my gf lives with me she is someone else I would need to support because I don’t want her to work while going through school. 

I make 6 figures, but now I learn my happiness is worth more than money. The only thing is- this is a niche field so I don’t know where I can go after this. Companies won’t hire you to a manager role unless you have 5-7 years experience. 

Any advice is recommended from someone who went through something similar.",03Mar2020,1

Hello to whoever is reading this, I am u/opacitize, i’m 16, from canada, and in a really bad spot. 

i’m sad, feel stuck, I’m pessimistic and a little self centred for a good reason. 

I need to go to school, in grade 10 i was kicked out of two classes for never being there, last semester I failed my civics and careers (got kicked out of civics so i had to redo and i blew it by not going along with english) 

I have a school to go to, it’s a safe school, the people are alright... But for some reason I just can’t go to school whatsoever. Whenever I get out of bed I get up and think should I actually try but can’t force myself to go out like 90% of the time, yes i smoke weed, yes obvious thing to say is stop smoking weed. I don’t abuse weed anymore, i smoke a couple bongs every couple of days and it’s really not a big deal anymore now that I’m mature about my pot usage. (never high in class anymore unless i’m really anxious)
I just need help, I need some advice I don’t care where it comes from as long as you’re a real one. I fucking hate school, but for some reason that’s not the reason why i stay away, I don’t even know why I stay home. We are one month into second semester and i have gone to maybe 8 classes.

665,"Hi. So I have been texting with this guy in about a month (on Snapchat) and I slept at his house 2 weeks ago (we kissed and did some other stuff, but no sex) and since then we have texted as usual, but in the last 2 days he has been acting different.
He asked me last week if I could come to his place this week, and I told him that I had to check my plans and he hadn’t ask me since. But today I texted him that I am available tomorrow and he said that I could come over then, but he just had to check on his studygroup if they had plans about meeting early the next day.

And we agreed that he would text me later this evening when he had found out. Then I just sent an empty snap, you know, then he did too and I did again, but then he just opened it 3 hours ago and I can see that he has used the app since but does not text me. 

What does this mean?
He is flirting with me and we usually text each other all day on a new topic but the last 2 days, he has just opened my snap when it didn’t say anything.

A little help over here? :))",03Mar2020,1
666,"Hey there, last year, I (15M) met a classmate (16F) and got her number. Soon after texting, we flirted a little bit, I took her out on a date, held her hand and kissed her cheek. This was my first date, and soon after that, we went to prom together also. I love her personality and her looks. She always did most of the talking and had such a cool life, so she would be busier than me, and I wouldn't talk much but rather listened to everything she said and gave her my full attention. I'm really bad at making conversation, and I felt like I'd be too boring compared to her to talk about myself. 

After prom, we went to dinner and I got to see embarrassing photos of her and she was just a total goofball like me, but it's hard for me to express myself to other people. I'm really closed off, but when I'm alone or with someone I know really well, I can be myself, also a goofball. I told her something along the lines of ""You can be as stupid as you want around me"" since she seemed nervous to show how weird she was too and she seemed really appreciative of it. When I got home, she hugged me like I've never really been hugged before. She made me feel safe and honestly loved, she held me close and didn't seem to wanna let go. And I thought about it so much. I replayed our date and that hug so many times in my mind, and it brought me extreme happiness. 

Fast forward a bit, my anxiety and overthinking kinda made me push her away and figure she didn't like me. So I allowed us to drift apart. And I regret it a lot. I see her in class every week and I even dream about her every single week. It drives me crazy, because I know she probably doesn't think about me that much. No matter how hard I try to forget her, I always think about her, especially after a dream. Every dream is romantic and it makes me happy but annoyed. One of them even had her say ""I think about you everyday too."" And I feel like my brain is fucking w me haha. Idk what to do, should I get back in contact with her? I want to but I'm always afraid of messing it up or not being interesting enough. Idk if I'm in love or something, it seems like I just really love her company and the fact that I never did any of that stuff with anyone before. She's always been really nice to me and accepting of my awkwardness, and always pushed me to talk about myself. She tried to help me, and I pushed her away without realizing it. I think I felt scared that she didn't like me, when in reality I think I accidentally made her believe I didn't like her.

What should I do? Am I just crazy or something? I feel so happy when I'm with her, she still makes little efforts to talk to me in class too. I feel like I'm drawn to her, like I can't do anything to forget her, like I'm being told to keep her in my life, but I feel like just some attached weirdo. It feels like if she were to see this post, she would be so repulsed. But she's really nice so I dunno what I'm afraid of.

669,"Before Covid-19, I planned and paid for a European trip to two countries that currently have minor numbers of cases of the virus.

Should I still go? My tickets/hotel are not refundable.

I'm not panicking about the virus per se. I feel the chances of getting it are still low and the chance of dying from it is even lower (from a purely percentage based POV.)

However, there are some things weighing on my mind: My home country has Covid-19 as well. So Europe is not a higher risk per se. However, traveling is different than being home: A lot of public transit, being in crowded public spaces, the long air travel with 200 other passengers and going to capital cities with higher population density. Additionally, both countries speak different languages than my home country, so navigating the medical system could be a bit painful. There's a chance that my home country will enact stricter quarantine rules or make it difficult for travelers to return home. My job would not be very happy if I were to be quarantined right after my vacation. Finally, it seems slightly morally wrong to go: even if I didn't get badly sick from it, there is a chance of picking up the virus and bringing it home and spreading it to someone who would get sick. International travel seems to be an obvious vector for the virus. However, my home country already has it and it's spreading even among non-travelers.

My brain sort of illogically flip flops back and forth between ""Of course you should go!"" to ""Of course you shouldn't go. It's just money.""

Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",03Mar2020,1

So this guy in person is really nice, but as soon as we started living with him (me and one other guy) we realised he's just a massive douche.

He regularly plays music with maximum bass so my walls are vibrating. I feel bad for asking him to turn it down and he refuses to wear headphones. We started getting noise complaints from next door and his response was ""they must have a bad taste in music"".

He never helps with absolutely anything around the house. He has a slight tremor in his left arm but regularly goes climbing. Yet he uses this as an excuse to not help with anything at all.

Leaves his plates out for weeks until they go mouldy.

Whenever I politely ask him to do anything, he always comes back with a sarcastic response plus I'll do it later. 

Weve made the stupid decision of signing on next year with a house with him. He has gotten progressively worse so at the time it didnt seem that bad.

672,"Hello Men,

I have mostly female friends and would love your prespective before I have a conversation I'm feeling anxious about.

I've been dating a guy for a little over 4 months. It seems like it's been going well. I've met his friends, he's met mine, I've met his family too when we went on a trip to his hometown together. We have so much fun together. He's really smart and kind, we laugh a lot, the sex is good, getting better (I'm inexperienced and he's patient and eager to please me).

The last 1-2 weeks he has been under enormous stress at work. He's working 12 hour days, the only other employee quit and he's doing both of their jobs, he also feels like there's ethical issues he's stressed about. They've been sending him out of town to work with clients for a week or more at a time each month. Last week he had to find a new place to live right after he got back in town and has to move this week before going out of town again on Saturday.

During these last 2ish weeks he hasn't initiated communication nearly as much, and in the last 2 days it's not at all. Previously we wouldn't go more than every other day without texting to say hi, or send me an article I thought would be interesting (we are both science/politics nerds). He still ""likes"" my FB posts (I know - again, nerds!) I'm really not one of those girls who are clingy or needing constant affirmation, it just seems like things have changed. When we are together they haven't, it's just between dates.

So, help me men. I 100% don't want to be one of another stresses in his already super stressful life. I want things to be easy and fun. But I also really miss him and it makes me feel insecure that I'm the one who has reached out the last week or so. Do I bring that up?

I'm currently finishing up my junior year of college and have been planning and saving money for a long time so that I can study abroad in Japan this summer. It's been a dream of mine since I've been studying the language for 2 years and visited the country last summer on vacation. All I can think about is how much I want to go back. 

On the other hand, I applied to a bunch of internships as a back-up. My field (graphic/web design) isn't the easiest to get a job in where I live, but I had an interview last week and just received an email today that I got the internship at a place that has good pay and what seems like a good work environment. The internship would last the entire summer, and I wouldn't be able to take a month off to go study abroad. 

Then of course, there's the coronavirus factor- With talk of the olympics being suspended, I'm worried that the study abroad trip might end up getting canceled anyways. I would honestly be willing to go even if there's some risk but if the trip gets cancelled there's really nothing I can do.

Currently, I work full time hours everyday except Tuesday’s. Their reasoning for the new hours being that it’s best to have 2 people working (even though our shifts are scattered?) and they hired a former stay at home mom to work the regular 9 to 5 shift. Apparently, this woman worked at our office about 10 years ago and lots has changed since. I also moved about an hour drive away from work (used to be about 5 mins away) and my manager said that she thought it would be better for me to start later because of the drive... but, my shifts are shorter so it’s almost not worth the drive. 

I have been at this job for 3 years and have been very loyal to them. I will always cover shifts for anyone, I always show up on time, rarely take time off unless it’s for one of my college exams. And of course I’m doing my job properly, and being professional with our clients etc. I know I’m not the best employee of all time but on paper, I think I’ve been doing well and she has never voiced any concerns about my performance. 

I am also a part time student and these new hours will not work with my school schedule because they are so scattered. 

I’m quite bothered by the fact that this woman they hired got priority and is getting the “good” shift even though I am the one who is currently working full time. It’s been 10 years since she worked here, so I am going to have to train her on all the new software and I know its really going to hurt me. 

I feel really confused and honestly hurt by this and I don’t know if there is anything I can do or say (other than quitting) about this while still staying professional. I’m a broke student and losing that 7 hours is going to hurt even if it doesn’t sound like much.

My friend finally landed on two part time jobs.. so she’s out of the house for LONG days everyday. She also is dating and likes traveling.

683,"Hi everyone, I wanted your advice and opinion on something that weighs down on me. My close friend adopted a large dog a few years ago but her life has been a roller coaster and to be rawly honest she doesn’t take care of the dog. My friend finally landed on two part time jobs.. so she’s out of the house for LONG days everyday. She also is dating and likes traveling. She lives in a small studio and this 65lb dog sits home alone all day in silence and usually with the lights off. She goes to work and the dog sits home alone for 10+ hours.

684,"The title sounds weird but I hope I can explain myself better here. 

For years my biggest goal was to get big through music(rap specifically), everyday I’d just daydream and think about how it would be. I got a job and started saving up for equipment and everything was looking good. Then I got hit with reality later 2019 and realized my family wasn’t really in the best position to take a risk like this. 

Needless to say everything crumbled down and I went into a state of severe anxiety, then got diagnosed with GAD and OCD which is a whole different story. Only way I could assure some sort of future was through university and I always wanted to go to university and study history(another thing I love) but my main goal was to be famous, that’s all I wanted.

686,"I work at a fast food joint. I’m 18 so quitting would cause me no issue but I can’t say the same for the rest of my staff who all depend on this job. We are always understaffed and by some sick twist of luck I have managed to be one of the longest employees there. This means that if I leave, so does all my experience and work I have been giving. I wouldn’t say I’m the best employee there, not by a long shot. But it doesn’t take a genius to recognize that if I quit, the entire place is screwed and that will cause the staff, most of whom I’m friends with, a lot of hardship. 

 Despite this, our RGM (for privacy let’s call him Matt) seems to do everything in his power to convince me to leave. I resisted the urge to quit many times because I wanted to prove myself, considering this was my first job. But now after a year and a half of constant torment I have had enough. Only now I know that when I do, everyone I leave behind me will suffer the consequences, not Matt. 

Matt’s shitty crimes include...
Lying about employees wages. One of whom only just found out he was being paid minimum wage for the last year despite being told he was being paid 9 dollars per hour. 
Starting fights and spreading rumors to make us not focus on him but fight amongst ourselves. Like telling a manager trainee that everyone else talked crap about her behind her back. Even though literally nobody had a problem with her. 
 Being incompetent, either on purpose or just because he’s an idiot. Like when I asked him many times over 3 months about the raise he promised only for him to pull me aside one day and ask why I never brought up the fact I hadn’t gotten it.
Mood swings and in general being so inconsistent and  bipolar that his mere presence causes the whole staff to get stressed. We don’t fear his authority, we just don’t know when he’ll go from the jolly manager to a rabid dog.
And many, many, others.

Now the staff is well aware of this. And we all talk about it behind his back. But nobody confronts him because he takes criticism about as well as a bull takes a red towel. And like I said, for some people working there, they need that job. 
Anyway it is obvious that I ought to cut my losses. But I can’t help but feel that that wouldn’t fix the problem. We have complained to corporate but they care more about results than morals so since his shitty behavior gets us working hard, why change it? 
Now I have been thinking about sending an anonymous letter to Matt, listing his many crimes so that he knows that his staff has long caught on. 
Then again after all this should I just leave and let the place burn?

Summary: 
Should I try to convince the boss to be less shitty or just cut my losses and leave my friends in the staff to suffer?",03Mar2020,1

Because it's also in another town, i have to live with some guys, my boss has also employed... they speak only russian and i don't understand a word of it.

Oh and my boss is also my sisters boyfriend.

Now to me:
I quit school due to severe mental illness - depression, social anxiety, PTSD due to childhood trauma - and have been in therapy ever since.

Now, as i had my plans i would have gone back to school, get my degrees and get a job somewhere in IT, doing what i love. Thing is, my current boss came around christmas with this job opportunity. Of course i took it... I'm feckin short on money, i have to feed two cats, which i rescued from an abusive home and they are my all. Also i'm a people pleaser.

I've been living off of social welfare before, due to the mental illness and not getting hired.

I don't exactly want to go back to it, but if i continue this job i'll probably be dead in 10 years, either on the inside or actually dead.

Now, if i quit, i son't think i'll get social welfare again, just like that.

god, i just want to get my degree and go into IT, but i don't know how, if i'm going to do this job.

Don't get me wrong, i'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, but c'mon a human being can't possible work 12+ hours a day and be alright, especially if you do heavy lifting all day.
It's not my first time doing such a job either.

I don't know what to do... Should i tell him, that the job just isn't for me? Because i want to get my degrees and so on? But then.... if i quit, i don't know, how soon i might get back on social welfare, i need to feed my kids(cats). But i'm also in a constant state of almost having a panic attack.

701,"Hello all!

This is in the US, and I don't think state really matters. The amount in the UTMA account is over the federal yearly gift allowance but no where close lifetime gift allowance.

To get to the story, my parents got divorced when I was younger (under 18), and in order to protect their assets from the other parent, one of my parents created a UTMA in my name (not specifically ever known to me). I'm not sure where they got the idea that it would protect their assets, but they had a financial adviser so who knows.

Since I had started working when I was around 16, I had helped my parent with my taxes and now do them for myself. They had always told me to put down the amount in the brokerage account on my assets for my taxes as well as the gains. I figured this always made sense because I knew it was some sort of investment account from the paper report that had both my name and my parent's name on it. I sort of thought it was just kind of a joint account that we both had access to or whatever, I suppose my fault as to not inquiring further.

So this is where to issue is. I had always assumed that this was technically my parent's asset. I knew I put it down on my taxes as well, but I thought that was for a different purpose. I am now 21 and while looking at what constitutes parent's assets on the FAFSA I saw that something called a UTMA and how it should be filed under the students assets. Well lo and behold when I looked at the reports for the brokerage account it says UTMA right at the top.

The first dilemma is that for the past 3 times that I filed the FAFSA I never reported any investments for myself. Granted the money in the investment account always got filed under my parents investments so it just didn't go unreported, but I saw how the investments for students/parents are taken into account differently (students are expected to contribute more of a percent of investments). So my main question is should I report it as my investment on the FAFSA this year or not? Are there any repercussions I may face in doing/not doing this now? The money was never really supposed to be mine but I understand that's not how it is setup so it's beyond the point.

Second dilemma is that after doing some quick research on what a UTMA is, I realized that I have complete right to the money since I'm no longer a minor. Now, this money was never intended to be mine, at least theoretically, but legally it is. I could go and withdraw all the money and just take it for myself (I think), but I would never do that in a million years. The money belongs to my parent, at least that was their intention, so I want to know what my best course of action would be to giving it back to them?

Thank you for any help!

Side Note: I referred to it as a ""UTMA"", even though I know it's technically a ""UTMA account"", and I'm not concerned about the effects on my taxes since I'm pretty sure we got those filled out correctly.

TLDR: Parent created UTMA account in my name to protect money after divorce, and never explicitly told me about it. Just figured out what it actually is and wonder how this could affect my FAFSA. Also curious as to what the best way is to give it back to my parent.",03Mar2020,1

It sounds cliche but having a dog is a huge responsibility and it takes sacrifice. It’s not just cuddles and kisses when it’s convenient. Vet bills, training, his special food (he’s allergic to chicken), dog walkers for when I’ll be out long, and the times I have to send him to a babysitter when I travel overseas. I make life decisions after considering his well-being first. It’s effected my social life, dating life, and my financial life. Those are the sacrifices it takes to invite a living breathing thinking feeling creature into your life and home. Anyway.. my friend is upset with me. It’s not personal. I would say all these things to anyone if I witnessed a neglected animal or child. If it’s going to be extremely positive and beneficial for both sides.. why not consider giving them a better home and reliving yourself of the burden.

Jack and I are really close friends; we're physically affectionate and very comfortable with each other. Even though we're not currently hooking up, I'm worried that any future boyfriend I have will resent the closeness Jack and I have. 

I've been hooking up with another guy (Larkin) who knows Jack because they're on the same sports team. I want to date Larkin, but I'm not sure if he's comfortable with the closeness Jack and I have.

713,"Background: My ex (37m) and I (29f) split in August. I got my own apartment and we have been sharing custody of our 5 year old. He is very very high conflict, controlling, and toxic. I spent most of our relationship being verbally, financially and mentally abused and in one instance it got physical which resulted in me with a black eye and him being arrested. No matter what I do he is ALWAYS the victim and I’m some evil villain. He forced me to pay for his probation saying it was my fault. He spins everything around and never takes accountability for any of his actions. If I don’t do what he wants he will bully me, harass me sometimes sending 50+ messages and phone calls. If I block him, he shows up at my apartment and causes a scene. If I call the cops he’ll just make it my fault and tell me I’m a piece of shit for getting him trouble and I’m ruining HIS life. It’s honestly a mind fuck. He lives in a different reality where he’s this great guy and I’m out to get him. 

As of now I am making 1,080 dollars a month. My rent is 600, electric 30, internet 30. We have not fully separated our finances, for instance I am still on his car insurance and job and family services case receiving Medicaid. He keeps all the food benefits leaving me to rely on food banks and family to help me. He kept all of my daughters things so I had to buy her new clothes socks underwear. I only have her bedroom set up and I sleep on an air mattress on the floor in living room. I really need my own welfare case so I can get food stamps and get back on my feet. Here’s the problem. If I put my daughter and I on our own case it will start child support against him. The answer seems simple, just do it right? But this is going to start war and quite frankly I’m a little scared of what he’ll do. He’s already threatened to make my life hell. I mean..he already does. He claims me as dependent on his taxes and won’t give me any of it because he “took care of my ungrateful ass for years”. Which isn’t true. I fixed my own car, bought all of my own necessities and paid all my bills with the money from work. He never once helped me in 10 years unless I paid him back. He fixed my car one time and it was a hundred dollars then told everyone I robbed him. 

If I start my own case he will take me to court immediately, threatened restraining orders, and he said he’d sue me for everything I have including custody. I’m scared to lose my daughter. At the same time I’m barely scraping by especially having the car problems I’ve been having which I was only able to get fixed because I won some money out of sheer luck. Food stamps would really help me. I could use the child support but he doesn’t make much on the books. I know I need to take steps to secure my future but this is going to start a chain reaction where he’s just going to make my like hell. I guess the worst part about it is I’ve lost all of my friends because he’s convinced them that I’m a bad person. In august he kicked me out at 1 am. I had no food, gas, and no where to go. I slept in a truck stop parking lot. Before I left he had 350 dollars in rolled change and I admittedly took 40 dollars so I could get food. He is now telling everyone I’m a thief who steals off a guy living on disability but I really didn’t have a choice. That was the only way I was able to eat. Now I’m isolated from everyone and have nothing and labeled a relationship thief. Sorry for the long post that’s all over the place. I could really use some advice on what to do. There’s just so much complexity to this situation it would take years to type it all out but I believe that’s all the pertinent information.",03Mar2020,1
714,"Ok I got some toxic and shit advice last time, so I’ll start again and be more specific. 

I’ve made many mistakes out of poor training, as well as me just despising my manager and the workload. I’m 19 and working in an office just bores me to High hell, I hate it. I feel miserable. 

This isn’t something I want to get a career in either so there’s that, it’s just for money. But I’ve fucked up so many times in the past month that I’ve been called out on it 5 bloody times, and I have anxiety throughout the day bc I worry when I’ll next get told off. 

Everyone there hates me now bc I make life worse for them bc I add to the workload due to mistakes. 

I’m shy and I have bad anxiety problems so it’s a horrible environment. I’m scared to go again tomorrow bc I know I made more mistakes today that they have yet to pick up on.

715,"I'm a 23F, who works in security and I have been here at my current site for the longest amount of time, which is 3 years, I have even been working 6+ days a week for over a year and at least 56-80 hours a week. We just lost 3 guards in 2 weeks which puts us at 5 people covering 24/7 and we possibly have 1-2 leaving soon as well. I'm even in the middle of working 13 days straight. We just lost a site supervisor because the company hired another supervisor and lied about keeping in communication with the previous supervisor about replacing him and demoting him. And before that we went an entire month without a supervisor where I was enacting. I turned down the promotion 3 times because of the amount of bullshit involved. The new supervisor is coming in and is trying to change everything on his second day, this isn't something and the other guards enjoy at all. I apparently got in trouble for having a small hairband on my head. Small Hair Band! It matches the uniform and it keeps my hairline in check. Also I keep getting asked about why I don't wear a company jacket even though I ordered one in November since the one they gave me doesn't fit. I can't do anything about that since it's out of my power. I'm tempted to just up and quit since I do have enough saved up until the end of the year. But I don't want to leave the remaining guards overwhelmed like I currently am. I am just tired of constantly being stepped on about small shit that has never been an issue before the supervisor we had last year. I don't know what to do, but my body is starting to give up on me.

716,"I'm going on a trip in a few months and, as per my lease, needed to get consent from my apartment management because I was going to have a friend pet/house sit but shes' not on the lease. The lease states that I need written permission and that people not on the lease can only stay 7-14 days in a one month period.

When I went to speak to one of the employees in the leasing office today, she read my lease and said it was fine to go and she didn't think it'd be a problem if I had my friend pet/house sit, even if I wanted to be gone for 3 weeks instead of 2. She just wanted my friends name, number, and the dates I'd be gone. All she did was have me write it on a sticky note. I asked if she needed to put all of that in written, but she said that no, it's fine.

I'll admit I have pretty bad anxiety and tend to assume the worst, so I'm pretty anxious that, since my lease technically states specifically written permission and only 7-14 days, someone else who works there or even upper management would find out that I'm gone and I'd get in trouble or my friend would be kicked out. I thought about emailing them all the information they asked for so at least my portion would be in writing, but I don't know if that's legally binding or would hold up if something went wrong.

722,"I bet this post will get a lot of downvotes, (because misanthropes are generally disliked, which is kinda deserved, I guess) but I'd really appreciate, if you spent 2 mins of your time reading this and gave me some advice.

So, I'm a misanthrope. I tend to dislike and distrust most people, even without knowing them in person and human nature, in general.. 
Although I don't wish any bad or any misfortune on others 
, I tend to think the worst about most people and to avoid social  interaction (except for very few people that I've known a long time). In the past I used to be different and try to be understanding and empathetic and approach other people, however I don't have any more patience nowadays and think it's a waste of time.

No matter how polite, friendly and helpful someone is, people will always treat some other people better, based on their looks, status and money. If you're a woman and aren't conventionally good-looking, you're going to be ignored and treated like $ hit by everyone, no matter how kind you are. People will talk to you, as if they're doing you a favor and will bash you, if you ever happen to disagree with you (even if your arguments are well-founded and reasonable). How dare you even have a voice? Have you ever looked at the mirror? 
I could probably change my looks, if I wanted, however why I should waste my money and time, trying to impress shallow people? So, instead I choose to avoid most people and live a lonely life. 

I know these feelings of hatred aren't productive but I also don't know how to deal with them (or don't want to)

I sat across from him but he insisted that i stay next to him on the couch and again insisted that i sit next to the wall, not at the end. I’m not good with confrontation and i just went with it, even though i already was uncomfortable. 10 minute in and he put his arm around me while i was talking about the degree i’m studying for and started to touch me in different places. I stopped talking and he said go on, i’m listening, like that was supposed to distract me from being touched. Then he grabbed my head and started to kiss me while i kept on trying to pull back, but every time i pulled away, he came closer, still holding my head. 
I went to the bathroom to get away and he kept on opening the door because i was “taking too long” and i was legit afraid that he’ll come in and push me inside the toilet. 
I told him i had to leave and he basically stood up in front of me, not letting me pass. I’m 1,75 and he’s like 1,90 so he felt like a wall in front of me and said something like “we have to have a proper goodbye” and again started to kiss me while i kept on trying to move past him, but he was stronger and was forcibly holding me in place. When i managed to get my face away, he started kissing my neck. I was so uncomfortable that i was almost crying and he again grabbed my face and kissed me again then said i was “really cute”.

726,"My mom has struggled with being pretty severely overweight ever since I was born 

About a two years ago I (also a little overweight at the time) decided to try and better my body and health and started to run and lift daily, losing about 30 lbs, then gaining back 15 of it in muscle. Anyway, I totally turned myself around and among other people on my family I (in her words) ""inspired her""

She's been on this train for about a month now but is not going about it the right way whatsoever. She's picked up keto and is tracking her calories (good part) but is completely obsessive over it  (bad past) and is basically starving herself (eating less than 1000 a day) and because she's doing Keto isn't getting any carbs and is like a zombie basically with no energy. This tiredness is also making her extremely irritable, a simple ""good morning"" from me makes her snap at me and say things I know she doesn't mean.

727,"I'm 22, male, and completely lost. I've probably drafted 50+ of these posts, only to delete them and not bother posting. But this time I need help.

To cut a long story short(lol this post turned into a ramble. Sorry), I am fairly miserable. I up and left all of my wonderful friends behind in a different continent and ran away to Europe to start over. I wanted new friends (I don't know why), a new job, or more so, career. I wanted to get a qualification. A degree, a certificate, something... ANYTHING. Something I could be proud of and feel a sense of achievement about. I barely made it through high school, dropped out of university after a single semester, did almost 2 years of an electrical apprenticeship only to suffer from imposter syndrome the entire time, fail every single exam in the technical college (the teachers really did bend over backwards to help you) and quit.. with nothing to show for it.

I got my first job at McDonald's when I was 14 and worked there till I was 18. I travelled the entire continent of Europe by myself when I was 18. I was on the road for 9 months. I worked in London for a bit, and was miserable. The only time I can say I am truly happy is when I am with my friends. Socialising. I love it. But I am also a recluse and will ""happily"" spend weeks on my own.. ignoring the messages my friends have sent, avoiding group chats, not opening snapchats. I must make people feel like shit. I ghost people all the time for literally no reason and I hate myself for it. If I had to say one nice thing about myself, something that I think I am proud of, is that I think a lot of people like me. I can be very friendly, charming, charismatic, and have had a large group of kind, supportive friends since I was in high school. On top of this, I have multiple, very close, long term friends. BUT at the same time, I feel so alone. I have almost no self confidence. I think people hate me. I over analyze what people say, how they say it, how long it takes them to reply, you get the idea. I want to be the most social person in the world but I also just want to lie in bed by myself all day on the Internet.

I have a problem with drugs. I have smoked cigarettes and weed since I was 13. I come from a not rich, but well off, educated family and was brought up in a really nice area and went to the best public school in the state. But I have struggled with addiction since I was about 15. That was when I started to smoke weed every single day. I began experimenting with ecstacy, Xanax and other benzos around 16/17. To be fair, ecstasy never was a problem with me. I have never not spaced it out at least 3 months apart, and kept my doses low. In the past 2 years I have done it maybe 4 times. 

However, around 20/21, I really got into benzos, ketamine, cocaine and amphetamine. I would do it every weekend. This was on top of smoking around 3 grams of weed a day, mixed with tobacco from the moment I woke up in the morning. I would drink heavily and take drugs on Friday and Saturday night, then smoke weed and take benzos the rest of the weekend to recover, then work full time all week. 

I have mixed alcohol with benzos and blacked out for days at a time. There are 3 occasions I have in my mind that are really, really bad. I wont bother explaining in detail, but I will just say I should have died. Seriously. I should be dead. I have driven my car multiple times in blackouts, injured myself horribly, and really worried my friends and family. I am so, so ashamed at what I have done in my blackouts (technically nothing bad, but I have driven cars and put people in danger, and humiliated myself in ways I can't forgive myself for) 

The one thing I can luckily say is, they were ""isolated"" incidents, and I never got into the habit of taking benzos daily (except one time where I took them daily for about 2 weeks) I havent taken benzos in 3 months. 

I am struggling to not go and buy some weed right now, as it's the first time in months I haven't had any on me. 

One of my really close friends killed themselves a few days ago. I was one of the last people he spoke to. He made a mistake that was forgivable and mendable, but he took his life because of it. We were talking it through and I thought he would be okay. I was wrong. 

I think his death has had quite a profound effect on me. I feel weird. I almost feel good, like it's a chance to change my way of thinking. To do something. I don't know. I've spent all day applying for office jobs, because I want to try working in IT, but I have to start somewhere, so an office job seems appropriate. My parents and family have done amazing things. Doctors, professors, journalists. I know I am not stupid, but I feel stupid. I've done so many stupid things that only stupid people do. I don't learn from mistakes. My mum always kept telling me the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. 

God, this whole post is just basically me venting. I feel hopeless, useless. I just want purpose, I want to feel like I matter. I want to not hate myself for no reason. I want to feel confident. I want to be able to love myself. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT. I've been in a rut for years. I spend most of my free time in bed or in my room. I am trying to change that. It's hard. I want to make my parents proud. Can someone please help me.",03Mar2020,1
728,"So I am a 22 and my girlfriend is 21. We started dating when i was 16 in highschool for about a couple weeks till her one of her friends that disliked me convinced her into leaving me for an abusive wannabe that she stayed with for half a year. I was broken cause this girl was perfect in my eyes at the time. 2 years pass and we end up talking again somehow and we end up hanging out. The first day i hanged out w her, we both did mdma with a couple of her friends and i stayed over the night w her. She wanted to have sex but i tried to decline but she made it happen still. Months pass and we stayed as a couple cause i stay commited after having sex with someone. Well it almost comes to an end after my dumbass gets a dm on instagram from a girl that i found attractive in hs, it was friendly conversation until she asked me to go eat sushi w her but never replied back. So one night my gf is asleep and i'm gaming late at night with my friends and explain to them about the messages. My girlfriend wasn't asleep and came out of the room to punch me in the face asking why was i cheating on her. I got on my knees and cried asking her to forgive me and after that things have never been the same. I'm a piece of shit, trash, and not even worth being called a man 3 years after that incident happened. These past 2 years it's been taking a toll hearing all these insults to be honest.
An example is I fractured my tailbone a couple months back and I got a job at a warehouse pulling heavy orders of alchohol. The second day there one of my nerves on my lower back got strained and i told my girlfriend i probably won't be able to return to the job due to this. Appearently ""I'm not a man, I don't do anything for her, I'm a pussy"" for the fact that I couldn't mess up my body more just to buy her a nintendo switch she wants because im obligated to her financially since her family took me in when they weren't supposed too or because she's a girl that came out of an abusive relationship and has anxiety that's why im obliged to do everything for her. I have no escape now since she convinced me into saying bad things to my family and i can't go back to live with them and it's like im trapped in this relationship. I just need advice from anyone please, thank",03Mar2020,1
729,"Sorry if the title sounds a bit over dramatic.

Basically,  whenever I hang out with my friends, I always notice that they don't usually respond to what I say even though I speak clearly. More often than not, I have to repeat myself, while another good friend of mine gets doted on hands and feet when shes not even trying to get attention (shes like sitting in the corner just playing on her phone). She ahs even admitted she feels she gets babied buy our friends. I want to note that these people are really good people, theyre not bullies, they don't put me down, they just...don't take me seriously. 

I'll be honest, I sometimes think it's my fault since I tend to act very silly and say dumb things just to make them laugh, but I do that because in the past my family used to say I was super moody and took things too seriously (I'd be defensive of things, too questioning, etc.) and no one would want to be my friend if I kept acting that way, which is why I ""change"" myself when I am in a group setting to not be so negative. If they make fun of me, I don't clap back or even tell them to stop, I just laugh it off because, in my mind ""sticks and stones"". And what they say doesn't really bother me, but what does is the fact that they think it's ok to keep making obnoxious comments cuz I don't fight back and that whenever I do decide to be serious, what I say goes over their heads. But trust me, if I call them out on what they say... I'd eat their feelings and then they'd hate me.

But lately, it's gotten to the point where I just feel like an extra friend, I'll get invited to maybe the big things, but not the small get togethers. They also don't open up to me as much as I do to them (but this is proably because I have low self esteem, so my advice would be ironic).

My question is, how do I find the balance of not being too defensive, but also deserving of respect? For the life of me I can't figure it out.",03Mar2020,1

736,"I'm sorry, it's long.

I recently, about 3 weeks ago, just got a roommate. He's nice and we get along thus far. I'm not in love with the fact that he smokes weed outside constantly, but that's neither here nor there.

Yes, we've slept together. Before he moved in and after.
No, we're not in a relationship. I do like him though but I don't know him well enough to like him like that.

I was out grocery shopping last night and he texted me asking if he can have someone over. That in itself kind of bugged me because he's trying to be deceptive in his question. Is a friend coming over and I need to look respectful? Or is a girl coming over?

I did get him to be straight with me and he did tell me that he wants a girl to come over and that she'd be in his room.

I guess we're two different people in that sense. I would never bring someone home with me to bang them while my roommate was 4 feet away. Apartment walls are made of tissue paper and I can hear him roll over in bed at night. Why should I have to feel uncomfortable in my home?

Honestly, because we were sleeping together and now living together, I suppose I thought we were getting to know each other and perhaps, one day, possibly try dating? Apparently I was so off base, I was on a different planet. So, it was a huge slap in the face to be asked 3 days after us sleeping together if he can bring a girl into his room.

There may be a hint of jealousy, yes, but this would be with anybody. If I had a big enough home, to where the chicks could come and go, without me hearing or seeing their faces, well ok. But the idea of listening to them banging it out on MY mattress (I let him use until he gets his own) and having to hear that, then watch her leave? It makes me sick to my stomach.

738,"Background info:  
My parents have been divorced since I (29) was 18. When we were all together, we had three dogs. Everyone loved the dogs, but my mom did the majority of the work, followed by me and my brother. The three of them were incredibly bonded to my mom to the point of separation anxiety if she wasn't there with them (I'll admit we did not train them well, or at all for that matter). My dad basically did nothing. The youngest dog was paid for using a joint credit card. After they separated, my mom took all three of the dogs which was completely expected and there was no issues that I was aware of. All three were pugs and two had health problems, with the youngest having the most of the three despite living the longest. The first two dogs passed away some years ago. Yesterday we put down the youngest of the three, he was 15 years old and wasn't in great shape anymore. For years now, my dad has claimed that the youngest dog was his, specifically because he was the one to swipe the credit card, essentially. He's always used language that suggested that he was somehow involved in the dog's life despite contributing nothing to the care of the dog and not having any regular contact with him over the last 11 years. Needless to say, my mom gets upset when he says things like that. 

The problem I need advice on:

Yesterday, I called my dad to let him know we put the dog down. It was a courtesy to him. I asked if he planned on saying anything to my mom, and he said no, but to pass along that he ""felt as bad as she did"" which is complete bullshit (I even changed the wording when I told my mom, saying that he felt bad), but whatever. I told him, ""listen, if you DO contact her, PLEASE do not say anything like 'he was my dog' or 'he was our dog'. Lo and behold, my mom gets a text today saying that he was sorry for ""our loss"" and some other loaded language. My mom messaged my wife and I with the text message. She was upset. My wife offered to text him, and she told him that it's not fair to say that the dog was ""his"" and that he really needs to respect this boundary. Afterward, instead of responding to my wife, he texted me saying that my wife ""went ballistic on him"" and that no one is considering his feelings. I'm tired of being in the middle, but with my firstborn kid on the way, and despite all of my feelings from my childhood I want him to be involved in his grandkid's life, I feel like once again it's up to me to broker the peace between everyone (something that my therapist has warned me is a reoccurring problem I have; a.k.a. always trying to fix everything). I haven't told my wife yet that he texted me, because he's done this in the past, where something will be brought to his attention and he'll come to me to complain about it. I don't know what to do anymore. I texted my therapist to ask her advice, but she hasn't responded yet.

744,"As the title states, I am planning on running away from home, and a date for the trip has already been set for May. Let me start by saying that I am 19, making me a legal adult (whether or not I am truly an adult is up for debate, but I digress). 

Let me start by saying that the logic of this has been greatly thought over. My father and I have a difficult relationship. While I love him and he loves me, when we are together we are both often left uncomfortable or irritated. He often degrades me, informing me of all of my short comings (ie “if you dressed better you would look pretty”, “you are too abrasive to be a proper woman”, “the play you‘re in is dumb and boring, so I refuse to go”), acting as though I am a small child (ie tries to dictate what I can and can’t listen to, play, read, or watch), and regularly treats me as though I am hired help, specifically in the care of my older sister(who is in no way impaired; she is simply lazy and refuses to get a job, which he knows). Not only that, I am stuck going to a college that doesn’t even offer my degree (I’d be getting a bachelors of general studies). I do not have the money to go somewhere farther, as I do not have the money to pay for housing.

The plan is that I will leave with my boyfriend in May. I will not be telling my father, as he would try to do all he could to hinder my ability to do so (i.e. take my car (despite me paying for it; he refused to put it in my name), take my phone, force me to drop out of theatre (which is my passion and dream career field) to avoid me having time unsupervised, etc etc). I know this due to him telling me in the past that he would take these actions if I ever came out as anything other than straight, started smoking, or really did much of anything that fell outside of his religious/moral alignment. 

I will move in with my boyfriend, who lives in Tennessee (10 hours from where I am), and take a semester off of college to set up my residency. From there, I will attend a college that is only 15 minutes from his house (my dream college) and build my life there. 

I realize how insane it sounds, but I feel like it’s the best thing for me. I have told my closest friends, as well as my sister, and I plan on telling my father once I have left. While I doubt I will change my mind, I am curious to hear what others think, as well as get some advice on how to prepare.

TL;DR I am planning on moving in with my boyfriend (out of state) in order to get away from my father and go to my dream college. Thoughts?",03Mar2020,1

747,"I feel inferior to my girlfriend's best friend. When the friend is around her attention is more focused on them and she whispers a lot to them because the friend has something private going on and, understandably so, doesn't know me well enough to trust me with knowing. While I do understand this fact, I can't help but feel inferior because I do in fact know what they are talking about because she let something slip once and so I do know what they are talking about, and I know this is something they don't need to be talking about in person in front of me through whispering conversations. They could just as easily text about it later and not exclude me from being in the conversation and being engaged. 

This is something I'd like to bring up to her because I don't want to feel excluded and I don't want her to have to choose between me or her friend when we're both around. That's not fair to anyone involved. I'd like to have a healthy relationship with her and her friend. I just want to know how I should approach the situation with her. Her friend does not like me much despite not knowing me really at all. In fact in our first interaction they called me an ass. So I'm trying not to have this person judge me even more and start telling her I'm being overly controlling or attention seeking. I just don't want to feel excluded. 

If I'm being ridiculous please let me know. If anyone knows a fair way to approach this that is also greatly appreciated. I really love her and I just want to make sure everything in our relationship is healthy and happy. Thank you for taking the time to read this and help/upvote.",03Mar2020,1

I wanted to get back to sports but when I returned home from school I once again turned on my computer and did absolutely nothing.

I honestly don't know, what's wrong with me. I'm very angry all the time, I envy relationships that my classmates have, but at the same time I want to be left alone.

I feel like crap because I want to change, but at the same time I don't want to do anything, I just want peace of mind.

755,"Hey fellow redditors.  As the title says, I'm starting to get to the point where it feels like I'm going to be stuck where I am forever.  Right now, I'm (30 Male) working full time at a job I like, but it certainly isn't my dream job or anything.  Just a normal cubicle job. 

For many years, I've wanted to be a voice actor.  THAT is my dream job.  I want to be able to bring someone's creation to life and hear it later and think, ""that was me, I did that"".  To further that goal, I've joined some websites where you can voice act for people.  No money, but I figured the experience would be good and it would help me get material for a demo reel.  

Things were going pretty well for a while.  I was cast for a lot of parts and was praised quite a bit for my talent, however, I guess because these were just free projects that had no real stakes, EVERY SINGLE ONE of those projects died.  To this day I've never actually been in anything except a 5 minute video a kid did for a class project.  

I'm just not sure where to go from here.  Working full time means I rarely have the time or energy to devote to this.  I would love to find somewhere more stable to audition, but I live in the middle of New Jersey.  As far as I can tell, there's nothing around here.  It's a creative dustbowl here (from a voice acting standpoint anyway).  I know some people will say that New York isn't that far, and you're right, but again I have to work full time.  My wife and I don't have a lot of money yet either so moving, quitting, moving to part time, etc just aren't options we can take.

It also doesn't help that I was raised in a ""business"" household, so I know next to nothing about the technicals of voice acting or the arts world in general.  

I've thought about looking for a coach if I can find one and afford it, but like I said, money is tight.  I was hoping they could help me learn more technical skills and maybe point me in the right direction, teach me what I need in a professional demo reel, etc.

Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, but I really needed to get this out.  If you got this far, thank you.  And if you have any advice on what I could do next, of how to feel less ""stuck"", it is so greatly appreciated.",03Mar2020,1

So first of all i am 22 years old, a lot of you may disagree with me but im not a very ambitious person, for this last 4 years i have done nothing with my life, i have just been living under my parents household and their money and im starting to try to get work now but the thing is that i dont want a lot for my life, just the enough i need to live by my standards and spend on the things i want to like my games because i dont like studying nor anything school related.

Recently my friend that i have known for 15 years came to me a bit mad, he has tried on multiple occasions to tell me to do something but i just dont want to and i have told him that multiple times.

But last time he came to me a bit more mad than usual, he is a very ambitious person and he works a lot and he tried to help me by putting myself into a project he is doing  but i told him no because imo it was too much work and he got all mad that he has been doing that and much more and he even told if i wanted to one day have to work as a janitor (We are Portuguese, so this is the best translation i can come up with) after this he just says he is tired, that i am ruining my life, proceeds to leave while telling me that he wont give me more free rides unless i ""wake up"" and that he will stop caring.

I got really mad with it because i have a car but i hate driving and im afraid of doing so and in my opinion he has no right to tell what i should do with my life, there is nothing wrong with having no ambition but he just gets mad because i dont have the culture or the knowledge he has or that i dont want to work as much and then he comes up talking that i should have more care with myself because of ""girls and all"".

tldr; mental health issues are affecting my school performance, but i’ve already dropped a class this semester. 

title pretty much says it but there’s a bit of backstory. 

3 years ago i was diagnosed with major depression disorder and anxiety, and it took a huge toll on my once great GPA. i failed two classes in one semester and dropped out for two years. i got help for my mental health, went back to school, and eventually stopped needing my antidepressants. 

flash forward to now, the situation is a bit different. i moved out with my boyfriend, and i now pay rent and all of my school fees (my parents used to pay). i work part time and my boyfriend pays a bigger portion of the rent. at the beginning of the semester, i was enrolled in 4 classes. sadly, my dog of 14 years passed away right at the start, and i dropped 1 of the 4 courses because i was a mess. my school doesn’t reimburse after the first week of classes, so i received a W on my transcript and i lost out on 400$. i felt super guilty due to my already stressful financial situation. 

now, 2 months later, my depression and anxiety seem to be back in full force. i cant even bring myself to go to one of my classes. its a super interesting topic, but i cant feel myself attached to it. i am completely unmotivated and anxious at the same time. and due to past experience, i think i know this ends with a poor grade. it took me 1.5 years to get my GPA back up to mid 3s after i failed my previous classes. 

i have 6 more days to decide if i want to drop this class or not. 

my boyfriend says to just power through, but i feel so stupid and lazy and messed up about it. if i do drop it, its another W and another 400$ lost. i was about 3 semesters away from graduating, but if i drop it, its just prolonging my graduation. additionally, i want to do a masters somewhere down the line, and if i get anything less than a B, my gpa will drop. 

im feeling so conflicted and like a POS about dropping this class (especially considering the fact that my boyfriend pays more rent than me due to school) but my mental health is really failing right now and i have absolutely no motivation and i feel empty aside from my anxiety. 

any advice would be awesome.",03Mar2020,1

760,"Hi everyone! I could really use some professional advice on this situation.

So, I am an undergraduate science student about to finish my degree with some summer classes. I do not live with my parents, so in order to stay at my university for the summer I would have to get a job to pay my bills (and ideally, save up a little bit!).  I have been offered a position by a professor to work in his lab, but I'm hesitant about the situation:

* pros: 
   * it would be good research experience
   * I would be able to make connections in the field.
   * it's a secure position!
   * it would pay for me to live here so I can finish my degree
* cons: 
   * the big one: it pays $8 an hour for full-time work, when the place I live has a minimum wage of $15 an hour. 

Honestly, the money is what concerns me the most. I'm already broke as a student, and I know it will be hard to fully support myself on that kind of money (can't expect handouts from my parents). And since the position is full time on top of the classes I'll have to take, I definitely can't get an additional job. Also, I  know this might sound silly, but I feel somewhat offended that the value of my work is seen as so little. But, I'm imagining that the benefit would be in gaining professional experience in my field, which I couldn't expect from a job such as retail.

I keep turning this over in my head, and I don't really know what to do. I don't want to bring it up to my professor because I don't want to seem ungrateful for the offer, and I know he probably wouldn't have offered such a low wage if he was prepared to pay more. And, I do want to do research over the summer! I just wish I didn't have to pick between having enough to survive and doing what I enjoy.

If anyone has been in a similar position or maybe can offer a different point of view, I would appreciate some advice!",03Mar2020,1

769,"So I may be psyching myself out idk, but here goes. I work for Kona Ice. For those who don’t know what that is, I sell snowcones for a living. It’s a very happy job and I really really enjoy putting smiles on faces but stepping into shoes where I have tons and tons of direct contact with people took time to get used to. I was and still am a major introvert. Public spaces just don’t work for me, for whatever reason, I have grown up fearing eye contact and freeze mid sentence when talking to strangers. But I swallowed a lot of that fear with this job and again have grown to love it. 

However, the issue... Kona Ice is a franchise company, meaning just any old joe with enough pocket money could buy into the business and run it how they see fit. Well the owner of the franchise I work for has had a very up and down experience while owning. He branched off another owner years ago and has since grown into a fairly popular franchise, however this year he is really wanting to expand from what he does now. I started working for him last january and have a great hold on the job but due to this or that, it came down to me and one other person being the only employees that stuck around for this next season. 

So now tying all this together, in order to expand what we do, we have to market/develop the business, which includes cold calls/pop-ins for an enormous amount of businesses and such and just overall territory. I have zero experience with something like that and have never had any interest in it because of my social anxiety. The owner’s a really cool dude and I really want to help out but I’m just having issues determining whether or not I’m biting off more than I can chew. Obviously this marketing is not solely relying on me, but when you have a team of 3 and the owner is one of those 3 and he expects results, it puts what feels like an ungodly amount of pressure on someone who basically has no idea how to do what’s being asked of him and actually fears doing it. 

Again I love this job and what it’s done for me, but what I’m being asked to do now is something I never thought I’d be getting myself into. I will take any advice on how to handle this.

Also to clarify, whenever I make money in the truck, I am always being sent somewhere and given direction so it was uncomfortable at first until I got ahold of what I was doing and built a routine. I could see how that might help here but encroaching and soliciting still just seems like a whole other game than being sent somewhere to set up and basically wait for people to come to me.

771,"
I’m an 18 yo dude. Graduated college, made money etc. I have everything I could ever possibly want in life because I’m blessed to have kind parents. 

However one thing that never really stayed with me was friendships &amp; relationships. Since I was a kid till maybe I was around 16, I never really had friends. Also introverted, I was pretty much the really weird kid. But when I made friends in middle / high school, they’re just toxic and were no different to bullies. 

Since I graduated high school. I made actual friends from my college and even from a firm that I worked for 6 months. So that turned out alright, I started losing weight and just being more confident in general, but there’s something that I’m just so confused about. I always longed for a relationship, but I never got into one (I was in an all boys middle &amp; high school, I was still fairly fat in college) 

Only recently I made change. Over the last 3 months, I managed to match with 10 -15 plus girls on dating apps. Yet I always end up unmatching them.  I have girls straight up asking for sex, some just can’t maintain a convo, some don’t have anything in common with me. It’s not like they’re ugly and that’s why I unmatched them, that’s not the case at all.

Idk. So it made me think, what if I’m afraid of getting into a relationship ? Why is it that I crave so much for attention from girls and wanting a relationship, wanting to have my first kiss, but when I’m granted with opportunities, I back away. Why ? I’m kind of planning to delete all dating apps because maybe it feels like I am not ready or I’m afraid for whatever reason. 

What is this ? Am I afraid of getting into a rs ? What’s happening to me ?

Edit: People may think I’m a troll but I’m not. I’m 18 with a diploma because it’s a private college. 
Middle school: 6-12

772,"So about a month and a half ago, my best friend (and roommate) of 3 years (let's call her Lilly) have a huge blowup at a party. Initiated by me which I shouldn't have done and apologized profusely for. Words were exchanged, my abusive ex-boyfriend was brought up against me. It doesn't matter, I figured we could move past this, everyone runs into conflict and argues, right?

Fast forward to 3 weeks later, we're hanging out and we have a bunch of our friends over for pre-drinks. Everyone is having a great time, Lilly runs out of the room crying out of nowhere. I go to find her to see if everything is alright and to assure her that we don't have to go out to the party we were planning on attending. She screams at me saying I'd never understand anything she's going through. I'm a bit taken aback as I don't know what's going on, our other really good friend (let's call her Sam) comes to see what the commotion is and he gets screamed at too! So we leave her in the care of one of our other roommates and get going to the party (we still have a house full of 10 people who just came for pre-drinks and party). So we get there and everyone is having a good time, and Lilly shows up at the party half an hour later and starts screaming at me and Sam in the middle of it. We try and reason with her but she's just screaming. So we pretend everything is ok and continue to hang out with our friends. It's 2 am and Sam and I are tired and want to go home, we see Lilly flirting with a guy that she's hooked up with before and so we text her to say we're leaving and leave.

The next morning, Lilly comes into my room and says that ""what she did was justified due to her hard childhood and that she thinks she has depression"". I push aside my hurt and upset from the events of the night before to talk her through her self diagnosed depression. Later that day, I'm at the track watching my varsity track mates run, Lilly calls me crying because she tried to apologize to Sam but Sam doesn't want to forgive her immediately and tells Lilly she needs some time. I talk Lilly through this and as a result, miss the running race I came to watch. That's okay, that's what friends do right?

Later that night, I hear Lilly talking shit about me to one of our roommates in our dining room. I'm hurt. I'm upset that despite me putting aside my personal feelings to help her, it didn't seem enough. It was at that moment that I decided my friendship with Lilly was one-sided and unhealthy for me. Now, we still had 2 months left on our contract not to mention we worked together so I figured we were both adults, I could be amicable and surface-level friends for another 2 months. Here is the issue that I'm facing - Lilly has been hot and cold towards me (depending on what she needs from me) and overall just childish in nature (avoiding me and running away). She has also been talking behind my back to my other 2 roommates trying to turn them against me (I have regular communication with them and I know that they will remain my friend despite anything Lilly says), however, it makes living in my house very uncomfortable for me and slowly I can feel my mental health slipping because of it. I don't really know what to do in this situation and would appreciate any advice.",03Mar2020,1

775,"My younger brother is literally doing nothing at school and he’s not going to his any of his classes and hasn’t handed in a single assignment all semester and it’s his last year of high school.   He’s not going to graduate and has no plan for what he want to do with his life which isn’t a problem because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do either but he has 0 clue and he’s closing a lot of doors in his own face. All he wants to do it play D&amp;D, and be on his phone and laptop like 24/7.  My partners who he lives with are very worried about what he’s going to do next year, he doesn’t even have a part- time job.

I ended up getting my high school diploma a few years later and then was gonna go to community college to start to figure out what I wanted to do. I eventually decided I didn't want a degree and instead wanted to do a cosmetology program. I am currently enrolled in the program and am really struggling mentally for a few different reasons. I'm really not sure if this is something I am genuinely passionate about and from the begining have been concerned that I won't be fulfilled by this potential career. The program was slightly expensive and my parents paid for it. I really don't know if would like to finish but I don't feel like I have an option being that my parents paid for the program. I'm really struggling and have no idea what to do. Any advise is appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
778,"Okay, this one is going to be long, but please help me out. I took science courses in 11th and 12th grade. My parents encouraged me to do so because they believe that doing science opens up many doors and I will be able to major in anything in the future.  However, I ended up getting even more confused. I scored well, but I was never interested in science. Initially, I planned on doing engineering but I wasn't keen. I gave a shitload of entrance exams for different types of courses. Finally, I settled on a liberal arts college. This college is small and very expensive but has a great reputation. My parents were very supportive. My mom, however, keeps passing snide remarks on how I could've done engineering instead. But she is supportive and doesn't object much. I was confused about my major so I decided to take both economics and computer science courses to experiment. I'm interested in other humanities subjects, but I struggle with writing and thinking about abstract ideas. But subjects which are conventionally ""non-sciency"" appeal to me but I don't want to major in them. In fact, I can't because my parents are typical Asian parents who believe that such subjects are not worth majoring and view these subjects as hobbies. Now coming to the problem. This semester has been hellish for me. These courses are very intense and taking a toll on me. There are certain things I like and dislike about these courses, but right now I'm stuck in limbo because both courses don't spark joy in me. I feel like I'm compromising and doing these courses to appease my parents. But at the same time, I don't know what else to major in. The uni i go to is expensive, has extremely short semesters and long holidays. These facts combined with the issue surrounding my major is making me reconsider my choice of coming to this university. I feel trapped. I'm also not doing well mentally because of all the stress and I end up crying everyday. From where I come, dropping out is a big no no. I have had a fair share of issues specifically with my mother over my indecisiveness. I feel that if I vent to her she will again blame me for being indecisive. At the same time, if my parents agree to changing the university, I don't know where to go. One more thing, my parents are pretty old and I feel guilty spending their hard earned money. They keep telling me not to worry about it, but it really affects me. I feel like I've come to a dead end. What do I do? How do I make my situation better?",03Mar2020,1
779,"Hi everyone, this is my first Reddit post so I hope its okay. It's a little long, sorry about that. 

I'm (f21) a college student living with two of my friends (m22 and f22) a few miles from campus. We have been living in a duplex for 9 months and the whole time we have suspected that the neighbors we share the duplex with are making/selling drugs.

First of all, there is a father and three young kids living in the duplex and two adult brothers living in the attached garage. Since we have been here, we have seen a tarp tent in the garage (before they blocked the windows) and they have had a lot of downtrodden looking visitors, some of whom have accidentally come to our door instead. We haven't had a whole lot of issues with them, but they have made my lady roommate and me uncomfortable multiple times. We have also found used hypodermic needles in front of our house once.  

Two nights ago, my roommate took her dog out at 4 a.m. and heard some snow crunching. When she looked over, one of the brothers was standing outside of the garage staring at her. Last night, I was leaving at 1030 p.m. and one of the brothers came out of nowhere and said ""what were you doing out here with that dog this morning?"" It doesn't seem to me like he was being inquisitive, it seemed like he was trying to intimidate me. 

My lady roommate and I are starting to feel unsafe, especially since she has to leave for work early early and I come home late at night pretty often. We have talked about calling the landlords or the police anonymously, but we are worried nothing will happen and they will retaliate against us. Plus, we stick out like a sore thumb in our neighborhood. We are three white college students and most other people are Hispanic adults or families. It would be obvious who reported them. We don't really care about getting them in trouble, we just want to live here until our lease ends and feel safe coming and going from our house. I was hoping to get some advice on how to react in this situation. Thank you very much for reading.",03Mar2020,1

783," 

To give some background, I am a m(24) i've had my job for 5 yrs now and love the job itself. I do drafting for a concrete form rental company, i make 50k gross a year and have great benefits, and already have a retirement going. I've worked in my position for 3 yrs now but....

I work with a woman who is 50 years old She is only 1/2 woman who works for our whole company, she has worked for the company for 4 yrs and was hired into the same position as me, so she's been in the position 1 year longer than me ( i worked 2 years in another position).

The problem i am having is that she hates me, she hates most of my coworkers and if she knew you she'd hate you too, and the feeling is mutual even the 1 other woman who works for us hates her.

So she is always making fun of me, insulting me, belittling me, like literally making my work life a living hell. She has even made facebook posts insulting me and my coworkers. Even one time had me in tears at work because i had never been treated in such a way before.

i have complained to my supervisors several times, and so have other people, but they refuse to do anything but slap her on the wrist. Honestly i think because she is a woman in a male dominated field, they refuse to do anything because of the legal repercussions she may explore/exploit.

To be honest she really isn't that good at her job, she makes a ton of mistakes and always has an excuse to why it wasn't right, or blames somebody else. She even talks bad about us to customers and blames us for her shortcomings, if something was left off of a delivery she immediately blames the guys that pulled the order, when 9/10 times she forgot to write it up on the order, but it's always someone else's fault.

We have had to move desks a lot because nobody can stand working next to her, (we work in an open area with 5 desks, grouped into 2,2,1. my boss is in the desk by himself. i don't know how she doesn't see the common denominator here.

Another thing is she has an associates degree, where as i do not, nor does one of my other coworkers, but hers is from the ""Ivy League College"" ITT Tech, so she automatically thinks she is smarter/more qualified for the job than either of us. The thing is we have hundreds of parts and pieces to our forming/shoring equipment and she can't even properly identify half of the parts by sight. Even on the phone she tends to call parts thingamajigs and whatchamacallits, when talking to customers or trying to explain how to do something to a customer. It is completely unprofessional and makes me die inside every time i hear it. There have been times where we have had a walk-in customer that she has helped where she has given them the wrong equipment or even equipment that doesn't even go together, and i have had to discreetly run down stairs and change the equipment behind her back because if i speak up, i get in trouble, but i don't want the customer to have the wrong equipment because it destroys the integrity of our company, and the trust that customers put into us.

Basically what i am trying to get at is should i put effort into this company that bends to the will of one woman out of fear, when i believe, and others, that she is completely incompetent and should no longer work for us.

i am scared of leaving because this is a job i could see myself doing for the rest of my life, and there is opportunity to move up and better myself in this company. But if nothing is done i think that we will lose our complete will to work because of the pain of one person",03Mar2020,1
784,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

I hooked up with the guy a few times after because of what happened I felt like no other guy would want me. When I was 17, one time, when we were hooking up, he took photos of me. Afterward, he ignored me, and I found out he was in a relationship (I don’t hook up with people in a relationship). He never made it clear from the start. He only wanted sex when I wanted more at 18. He was 20. He called me annoying that he wants sex and nothing more.

I moved away. I haven't seen him in person for five years. Now years later, he continually tries to contact me. I am 23 now he is 25. He tells me I'm beautiful and he's never felt so comfortable with someone. He begs me to visit him(I moved states).

I tell him how he ignored me and used me to hurt me that I don't want to see him again. He told me,” what did you expect? You slept with a guy, and he didn't call you back grow up.” he was saying that I most guys suck that I need to grow up cause most guys would ignore me.

806,"Backstory to establish how I'm in this situation now:

So ever since the very end of November last year, I've been working at a luggage store that's part of a national luggage store chain, and it was easy to get the job at the time because one of my former supervisors at my last job (ironically enough was another smaller chain luggage store in the exact same location before closing down) was the manager. I had an opportunity at this job when the new store opened anyway but I couldnt take it due to obligations I had that spring and summer.

Im their most recent hire and the owners and operations managers of the chain keep staffing very lean, too lean in my store's case, so scheduling was always tough especially with the majority being part-timers, but it worked. My manager at the time had a more relaxed system of handling operations of the store.

Things got bad when my manager, during vacation she took after Christmas, got violently ill with some virus and had to be in the hospital from then to mid-February. We were without any manager from January to mid-February but we were handling things still ok. Despite schedule tightness and people stretched farther in their hours, we made it work and one of my colleagues was doing well at making the schedules.

The temporary manager that came in was only in to perform essential operations, only showing up a couple days a week because he's manager of one of the stores in another city, and he still wasn't officially in charge, so his methods weren't law since my former manager was still officially the manager.

All this changed during the 2nd-to-last week of February. We did our major inventory count day, and while the prep and initial counting were done quickly and smoothly, the day was a disaster because it was discovered we had over $25,000 (retail, not wholesale), in inventory missing, including some luggage. This obviously made the main owner of the chain angry, and he was literally walking back and forth looking over sheets, and audibly saying things to the merchandise managers and such like ""we may as well close the store, this is too much money lost, not worth it"" or ""something is not right with this store."" so the owner is saying these things openly in front of myself and another colleague, demoralizing us, and then the owner and operations directors, and the temporary manager I mentioned (who was participating in the inventory count) all decide to take a lunch after finishing looking over the initial counts. When they all come back, the temporary manager talks privately to myself and the other colleague and says that he's gonna be the new manager of our store and that they'll make major changes to the store's operations to get it back on track. It was this now new manager's idea and he convinced the owner to give it a shot. The owner announced it later, and said that my former manager, while the immediate reason was her health, the owner made it sound like he doesn't ever want her as manager again, because of problems they've had with eachother and because of this major money loss. However they don't talk about any detailed investigation, the only things the owner mentions is that they'll install cameras as soon as they're able to, and they're gonna look into ways to lock the basement door leading to the dock at the mall and the trash/recycle crushers. The owner makes it clear, even without saying specifically, that he's more concerned about an internal theft risk than external.

So that's the backstory. Here's the current situation:

The new manager's rules are very strict and basically has neutered our ability to do anything other than sell and do opening/closing procedures. The list of new rules are as follows:

-the downstairs basement bathroom is not to be used under any circumstances, no exceptions
-trash and boxes aren't to be taken out by anyone unless the manager is present to accompany and help
-we aren't allowed to open the safe to put in deposits or take them out to go to the bank anymore
-when people are by themselves during a long shift, they are not to close the store for their lunches, but instead have their meal break on the floor, stop those to help customers, and keep on the meal break, all while clocked out.
-the only time the store can be closed is for bathroom breaks, and for no more than 5 minutes
-daily inventories are required for morning shift, at least one brand a day per morning shift person, and afternoon and evening people can work on such if it's not busy.

Now something like the inventory counts is perfectly reasonable and honestly should have been done this entire time. But the other rules are either downright ridiculous or straight up illegal (at least according to California law). In regards to the break policies, my coworkers and I haven't been following the new break rules and we've been closing the store when by ourselves for our lunches still. But it's still horrible that this is required under these new rules my manager put up, and I'm sure eventually he's gonna catch on and it'll be a problem.

On top of that, it's been clear as of this past week that the manager only shows up when he feels like it. He's always been late even though he's scheduled in the morning until 3pm, but lately he's been not showing up on some days, either because he overslept or for no reason at all. Yesterday he chose not to show up, and had my colleague who was in the morning call and ask me to come in. I did it because I happened to be fully awake a few hours before with time to prepare and I didn't want to leave that coworker hanging, but it was cowardly of my manager to not talk to me directly and go through her (knowing I'd help any of my core coworkers out).

I don't know what all of this is, but my coworkers and I believe that in some way, the owners and the manager are actually trying to get us to all mass-quit so they can close the store down.

On top of that, one of my other coworkers talked to a friend of hers who works in retail as well, and this friend said to her that based on past experiences, it's possible the owners are still investigating and that they're looking to see who's gonna quit first, and use that to label that person a suspect (I guess the thought process is that whoever quits the soonest is the one who's trying to get away with the crime asap). So after hearing that, a number of my coworkers are afraid to leave because now they feel they'll be suspect if they do. I'm pretty sure I personally have nothing to worry about because I joined the company well after these major inventory losses started growing, but I admit the paranoid part of me that remembers my unluckiness is also a bit scared to leave. What sucks is that there are a couple possible suspects of theft yet no evidence to prove anything. 

On top of this, I talked to an associate at one of the other nearby stores yesterday, and SHE said that her store is also noticing a major inventory discrepancy in one of the brands that was reported as a high loss for my store. So that could be evidence that supports the theory here that the issue is on the owners/operations directors' ends with poor inventory system.

Basically, right now, I've been forced to work 30 hours per week, even though I signed on as part-time for working 20 hours max after holidays so I can focus on my health and strict diet, and it's been damn near impossible with me being forced to work this much, especially if I need to come in to make up for when my manager decide not to show up. Mentally and emotionally, due to all the illegal and bad stuff happening, I'm checked out and ready to quit. It looks like the mass-walkout my core coworkers and I planned won't happen due to this new fear, but I still would like to quit as soon as I can. But I'm afraid of the possibility of entrapment with both the seeming pushing they're doing to get us to leave as well as the fear of what was heard about the possibility of them labeling whoever leaves a suspect of theft.

So my questions are, is it safe for me to quit the job? Will I still be at risk for investigation and false arrest despite not having worked there until the end of last year? If my coworkers are safe, is there anything I can show them to convince them and try to get them to leave as well? Also, do you think, given everything I've said, that the owner is trying to have the store tanked on purpose to close it down and cut losses? 

I'm only concerned about legal risks since I cant afford a good lawyer. I don't care about the difficulties of getting a new job, I have contingencies for that.",03Mar2020,1
807,"Ok so this girl and I have been friends for over a year and recently, I’ve found that I’m being a bit of a prick towards her. 

It pretty much started last week, I can’t remember the specific day. I had feelings for her and she knew it, but I couldn’t be what she wanted and some other guy who she had been friends with since childhood liked her and was pretty much exactly what she wanted. But yeah nah that’s not the point. He liked her, I liked her and when she told me, I was almost a dick about it but stopped myself before it got too far.

Ok so on Sunday, I was talking to her cause some friends had found my other reddit account and there was some bad shit ok there, like worrying not embarrassing. So when I asked her, idk why I didn’t expect it but she asked for the account. (I posted something on there asking where the safest place to cut yourself was but that’s a different story)  After a lil back and forth I sent the account to her and she saw the post. She’s had a bit of history with self harm but I’ve never gotten into it with her cause I didn’t think she would wanna get into it. When she saw it I guess he got angry or something, I couldn’t tell that well cause it was over text, and she told me that when you wanna cut yourself you can’t stop yourself. I tried talking to her about it but she just wouldn’t respond.

I apologised to her about it yesterday and all she said was “I’m fine dw about it”. Idk if I’m overthinking it all but she just seemed kinda out of it but it’s justified yk. Like we talk everyday and pretty much all the time she starts it. It’s not that I don’t wanna talk to her I’m just awkward like that but anyway. So we talk everyday and yesterday pretty much the only talking we did was that tiny apology I sent to her explains it all and shit.

I’m not sure if I’m overthinking all of this cause I’ve been doing that a lot recently but she’s just seems off since Sunday and I wanted to know how to fix it

Any help is appreciated even if I don’t say it, thanks",03Mar2020,1
808,"  Hi, I feel frustrated, disappointed &amp; angry lately. The life I want would be simple, as close as possible to off the grid, in a small home or cabin, near a forest, in the mountains, hiking, growing my own food, enjoying the seasons. Because of circumstances beyond my control I can't have this life. I live in a city, in a tropical environment, with almost no distinction between seasons. 

  My husband makes most of the money so I do not get much say. We have to be where his job is. I beg him to look for jobs there. He made a half assed attempt once, but did not put much effort into it. We'll probably end up in a giant house in another city. Leaving would not help, as I'd still have to stay in this area for custody. Besides where I live, I have no other issues with him. It is not perfect, but leaving would not solve my problem. There are others to think about, so I cannot live the way I wish, or even close to it. I feel guilty for being unhappy. I have everything I need &amp; more. My dreams may happen in the future, but for at least a few years I'll be sitting in this box, stacked upon people, looking out a parking lot, dying inside &amp; wishing I were in the woods.

  I was wondering if there is some certain type of therapy I can get to help me be grateful, happy, &amp; content? I know most people do not get to live their dream &amp; I need to let it go &amp; try to be happy. I try daily to change my thoughts, but I feel so sad. I feel like I am not a good mother, because I am frustrated. I clean, go to school, &amp; care for my child. I will soon work, &amp; then it will be the same except school will l be replaced by work. I need something more. I try to find things I enjoy, but all I want to do is hike &amp; be in the mountains. I think of it constantly, dreaming of it &amp; trying to find a way to make it happen. 

  Does hypnotherapy work? I just want to be grateful &amp; enjoy the things I have, instead of wishing for something else. Thanks for reading &amp; any advice is appreciated.",03Mar2020,1

811,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post on this sub and I'm just looking for some direction. I've been in university since September and I'm nearly 19 now, but I still feel less mature/prepared/intelligent than my peers. When I first entered I was planning to major in CS and I was really into (most of) my classes in the first term. But as the months went by, my excitement waned--as seems the case these days. I felt less inclined to get out of bed and go to morning classes; less inclined to do my webwork days before the due date. I passed my classes, but just barely. Whatever ""love"" I had for CS is completely gone and I hadn't even *started* taking CS classes first term.

Now, the truth is, this isn't something new. It happened in grade 11. It happened in 12. And it's happening now.

When the new year came I tried to make a resolution and promise myself that I would focus, lessen my social media use, and be productive. Guess how many of those resolutions I've managed to keep? While I have deleted all but one social media app from my phone, I still find myself unable to focus. I'll sit down at the computer and open up the work I need to do, but then I'll say to myself that a little Twitter won't hurt. A little Reddit or Tumblr or Instagram won't hurt. But it does.

With my love for CS practically nonexistent now, I have fallen back on the thing I've always kinda wanted to do since I was like 12, which is to write. But when I step back and take a look at my writing, which I love, I can see that I am not a good writer. I follow a lot of authors, even my favourite author says that her writing sucks upon the first draft. But I cannot help but compare myself to those in my CRWR class, and when I do, I see that I am nowhere near as good as I want to be or think I am. I know I am not the best writer, but I am not smart, so I know I will be a worse programmer. At this point writing is my last option because if I cannot write, what *can* I do?

I haven't been to class in 2 weeks, my marks are dropping like flies, and I didn't get accepted into a mentor contest I entered, which is really bumming me out. I've started seeing a counselor to help with stuff, but at this point, I don't know what to do.  Any advice would be appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
812,"I got bid into a social fraternity. I was aware of the hazing process, and the stigma around frats, and this didn't really scare me. I wanted an easy social outlet and good business connections, but I got more then what i bargained for. 

Weekly, I was forced to spend 20-30 hours at the frat house (a decrepit old house solely used for drugs / partying), which is 10x more time then they told me before I joined. Furthermore, every member seemed to be going nowhere with their life -- just sitting around and getting high or drunk seemed to be the majority of the activities done by the members. 

Taking all this into consideration, and the fact that I was walking home shitfaced on wednesdays, thursdays, saturdays, and occasionally sundays, I decided to quit the frat before it got out of control. They pushed me to attend more and more events, and being a STEM major it just became too much to handle. I don't know if I necessarily made the right choice, as the fraternity was truthfully the only place I could be social, but I have to prioritize my career -- even if it means my college experience is inhibited as a consequence.

817,"I'm having an issue with a nurse who is in charge of refilling prescriptions, at my doctor's office. 

There are three ways to request a refill. The preferred method is to put in the request at the pharmacy and they fax it to the nurse. Or, you can email the nurse, or you can call her. (She rarely answers, so you have to leave a message &amp; hope she calls back).

This doctor has provided me medication for severe headaches, for several years now, but each time I try to get them refilled, it takes this nurse a little longer to do so.

The last time, my pharmacist had to call this nurse from her *home phone* and basically argue with her, to just refill the damn thing, because the nurse was just ignoring the requests.

This time, I put in my refill request on Feb. 24 and still haven't received a refill or any sort of communication. But the meds haven't actually been denied.

The pharmacy has called her and faxed her, multiple times, and gotten no response. I have emailed her 4 times, and called, and gotten no response. 
I'm wondering if the pharmacist made her so angry that she's behaving in this way, to ""punish"" me. 
I've even requested refills for a vaginal medication, just to see if she would call that in, which have also gone ignored. How can she do that??

I don't know what to do! There isn't a way to speak directly to the doctor, and I'm VERY sure he has no idea that this is happening. He's a very busy doctor, in high demand, who also does emergency surgeries and such, so he can't really take the time to be talking directly to his patients.

I've considered calling and asking to speak to the Office Manager, but I worry that that could make things worse for me. If her team is as horrible as they are (the front desk team is also absolutely terrible), then it might be because the Office Manager is also terrible - and they will all protect eachother.

What should I do? 

Additional info: this doctor is a specialty doctor, not a general doctor, so it's different that trying to get in contact with a general doctor. It's a huge office, with many employees, who are supposed to be taking care of all the extra issues, so that he can do his work. However, I have considered calling to ask to have him call me, to discuss ""a very private problem I'm having"". Not sure if that would work, though. 

Also, the city I'm in doesn't adhere to normal rules, so people just kind of do what they want. Normal rules, etiquette, ethics, and behavior do not matter to these people. They will protect eachother and if I make too big of a stink, they could totally screw me over, even if it requires them to lie.

828,"I got my degree, however didn’t get honours. For the past two years I’ve been playing some gigs with some bands and doing a bit of kickboxing. Currently living with my parents who say they support me but they don’t allow me to have my own space and constantly cross boundaries. My dad has also talked me out of getting two jobs. The first one was a taxi driver because I wanted some freedom and extra cash. He said there’s no money in it and I shouldn’t do it. Then I applied for a job as a waiter at a local hotel and spa and he said “why are you applying for a job like that? You’re selling yourself short”. 

They’re constantly looking in my room, I can’t do anything in my room without them asking about it. 

They constantly ask me about my plans. 

They gave me £5k for my birthday last year and told me it was to buy a car. But when I didn’t cash the cheque right away, my dad would constantly ask “why haven’t you cashed it yet” and constantly asking what I’m going to spend it on. He would come home from work and say “I’ve been thinking all day about what I would spend the money on if I were you”. In the end I never spent the money on anything. I ate at McDonald’s and ate out and spent it all on rubbish over the past 6 months. It’s all gone and I don’t have a job or any gigs in my diary as I pretty much burned all bridges and cut of friendships over the past year. 

I have no motivation to do anything. Each day is spent just trying to get through the day without fighting with my parents. 

The only things I have is ideas of things I like and want to do. But no motivation to do anything. I feel trapped. Resentful towards my parents and others. 

Neither of them care about becoming a better person. I asked my dad last week “what are you doing to become a better person” and he said “I don’t really think I need to become a better person I think I’m happy with the person I am”. He says the same things, does the same things and asks the same questions every day. If he asks “what’s wrong” and I start talking to him, he’ll either say “I’ve got something else to do right now” or something. He never listens or seems to actually care and it makes me so fucking angry when he does that. They’re both so defensive and in the house, there is rarely a point where all 3 of us have energy and are happy. It’s like we all drain each other of energy. 

My dad has told me that his idea of me having a good life is just chilling all day, not working, staying up all night, doing what I want. I’ve told him this isn’t what I want but he doesn’t care. It’s fucking annoying. He likes it when I’m lazy because it’s what he didn’t have as a kid and he encourages, laughs and supports me when I’m lazy rather than when I try and do the things I want. 

It seems that anything I do that hints at me having freedom or independence, they want to control it. They’ve even read some books on creating boundaries with adult children after I said to them that they should read something and they said “I read the book in one night and I instantly felt like a new person” but nothing has fucking changed? They still do the same behaviour and nothing has changed in the house. I feel like I’m going round in circles. I don’t know what to do. I never really enjoy a minute of any day. 

I seem to think that moving out and supporting myself would help me, but both of them just say “but where are you going to go? You don’t have a job” when I mention doing that, which isn’t support?! They say the exact same thing the exact same way and it makes me want to scream because they know what it is I want but it seems all they care about is keeping me here under their financial dependence. 

My mum screamed at me once in December saying “this is the only family your dad has and you’re ruining it” because I said I wanted to move out. 

She also says this same thing occasionally “you’re not right, you need some serious medical help” even though I already know and I am seeing a psychologist. It’s like she says it just to annoy me, I literally have no other explanation. 

What I want: a job, my own place, to do the things I like which is kickboxing + playing music. 

I have cut off all friendships, so i somehow need to find new friends. No girlfriend either. 

I feel like I’m under the control and oppression from my mum and dad. Who have cut themselves off from the rest of the family. They haven’t dealt with their own relationship issues and they seem to have no idea how to live their life and appear to copy the things I do. They also copy the things I say. It’s fucking annoying. They say they want to help me. But really they just want me to lead the way for them or something. My dad is super sarcastic and says things that I don’t find funny, he laughs at his own jokes and then curses me for not laughing at his joke. They’re both also very conservative, pretty racist and in denial about it and bigoted.

829,"I (26F) work as a janitor in a church closely connected to the local university. The local university (let's call it LU) has frats and sororities that sometimes have events in the church building. No big deal, I don't mind doing my job. But, here's the issue. The LU clubs want to have events at the building until midnight Saturday nights. Well, I can't get to the parts of the building that these students use until after they leave, and I've had to work as late as 2am on Sunday because of these events. I get done everything I can before they show up, but they demolish the parts of the building they use. The students without fail make a mess. The bad students give everybody a bad name, and a lot of the students at LU are there on mommy and daddy money, driving mommy and daddy's car, and are used to mommy and daddy cleaning up after them and wiping their butts. The bad ones are entitled, and leave a horrible mess. I've even asked a club sponsor if the club could use certain bathrooms so I could do as much work as I could that night, and minimize the next day's work. Apparently, that was good with her, but there were girls going into a bathroom I just cleaned less than 5 minutes after I mopped the floor, messing it up and throwing trash all over the bathroom. I take pictures of the mess, and I can easily find the email of the person who oversees all club events at the university and email her the pictures, but I haven't because I'm not sure it would be my place to do so.

Anyhow, according to my boss, the office ladies (secretaries) will not change how late they schedule events, so my coworkers and I are screwed in cleaning up after the events.

One issue I have is about a year ago, the administration guy (I'd say he's my boss's boss) has noticed that I work later, normally no later than 7pm. There are some things that I cannot get to until people are gone, meaning I have to work later. So, admin guy, who knows my parents, went to my mom instead of me about his concerns over me being at the building late. This caused drama with my mom, who doesn't understand what I need to do with my job. As soon as I found out admin guy talked to her about when I work, I went to him and told him ""I am an adult, I am the one who works at this church. If you have any concerns about me or my job, please come to me about your concerns instead of going to my mom."" He responded saying he and my boss were worried about me working late. I know for a fact that my boss is not in any way worried about me working late, and 100% trusts me to do my job and be smart and stay safe.

So, my issue is that I don't want to risk any more office drama about me working late, and I really hate having to work late on Saturday nights after these events. There is no way to avoid working late with LU's club events without leaving their mess for the Sunday morning service people and getting complaints from a very persnickety congregation. I also have a hard time sleeping, and would really like to get enough sleep to attend my church on Sunday.

832,"17NB here. Recently, it has been brought to my attention that I'm an emotional abuser, manipulator, and I realized I very much might be a narcissist also. I dislike (and criticize) myself if I'm being honest, went through times where I wanted to kill myself, but I was a coward. However, I think about myself a lot and put myself first out of comfort (and fear) and I used to feel like I was better than everyone else up until five years ago, etc. I don't trust a lot of what I do or say now more than I did before.

I'm supposed to be working on self improvement, and I want to see a professional about it, perhaps a psychiatrist or a counselor if we can't afford the former. The issue is that my father won't let me. We had an argument over the phone, and he says he knows everything about me because he raised me and that he's going to ""help me"" and well...he doesn't know everything about me and went as far as to deny things that I knew firsthand. It makes me feel a bit hopeless on that part.

I used to look up to my father because he had a hard life and had to overcome a lot on his own, he was like a legend to me, but I really doubt my father (who thinks the wisdom ""God"" gave him, google, and me being his child is worth more than degree) can help me in the way I need a psychiatrist to. He's the one who even told me to look into these topics, and while I appreciate it being brought to light, I don't think his personal connection, anger, and righteousness should be my remedy. How can I convince my father otherwise?

833,"   As the title says I(24F) think I want to drop out of college. When I was in high school I thought I wasn't cut out for college due to a learning disorder. 
   5 years later I decided I should apply for financial aid and give it a go. The first semester had stupid easy classes and I excelled. The second semester left a scar on me emotionally as the english class put so much pressure on me I cracked one a week. After talking to other classmates I found out I wasn't the only one drowning and half of the class dropped out before the last day of the semester. My mental health was in shambles. I spent all winter break repair the damage and working part time. Two weeks before Christmas my husband (26M) said that I could quit working to go back to school.
   I thought this semester I would be doing much better. We are almost half way through and that is not the case. I got A in two classes but my science classes are what I need to focus in are not up to par no matter how hard I study. In Anatomy and Physiology I have failed 4 out of 5 of my exams even though i studied hard for days. But obviously my best is not enough. I have D+ and it keeps falling. This may as well be an F if you want to get into any program at any college. Chemistry is ok but that grade needs to be higher if I want to get into the nursing program. Although admittedly I not sure if that what i want anymore because i was reading that workplace bullying is a huge issue in that field. I have been through that in the workforce before. I don't want to go through it again. 
   The other problem that I am grappling with is that I feel like if I do drop out is that I feel as though I am failed my husband as he gave me the opportunity to not have to work. This is soul crushing that he is working to keeping us fed and  housed but I am unable to keep my end up. 
   I told him what's going on with my grades and he says he supports me no matter what but this feeling doesn't help me get through. I feel like I will disappoint my father because he gave me some money when the pell grant did cover all the bill last semester. They probably won't cover much of next semester because of these grade. I think that's how it works. I feel like a made a terrible mistake.
   I am looking at other options but I don't know if I want to pursue another major or what I would do with one and I am already at community college so that isn't really an option. Trade schools are not really available here. There is a vocational school but you never know what is offered until they advertise the next available classes which seems pretty random. I don't know what my talents are anymore. I thought I was good at science but anymore. All the jobs in town that are worth a damn I have failed to get an interview before but maybe I could try because I have work experience but I know the one is 3rd shift only so I would never see my husband. I know that wouldn't bother some people but I am the type that needs to see my significant other as he is on days and night shift isn't available. I know I could probably eventually switch to day but it can take more than a year to get that opportunity. So maybe I could adjust to that. The other one is hard to get into as it is a collection agency which I failed to get even with a reference from someone who worked there. Due to an injury the military or anything with a physical exam is off the table because I blew out my hip and even after getting help I still can't run like I did before because i didn't know what I did I waited so long. Maybe I just feel hopeless right now.  Any ideas of alternatives? I don't even mind that I will never make what i could have if I could even get into the program. Any helpful advice is appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
834,"Hi all, I just had my 6 month old kitten put down due to FIP. Me (22M) and my fiance (22F) watched as they put her down, and we're absolutely devestated, but I'm feeling a lot of guilty. I gave her a good amount of attention and cuddles (she loved sitting on my lap while I pet her when I am playing games), but a lot of times when I get home from work I'm mentally and physically exhausted and while I love my cats to death, when I get home I need some me-time. Some nights she would sit outside of my office door while I unwind and mew for an hour, and I'd just put headphones on and ignore her. Other times I'd let her in, giving in to the fact that she just wants to spend time with me. I'm feeling incredibly guilty about the times that I shut the door on her, after she was home all day not seeing us.

837,"
We bought two power reclining loveseats. They set delivery for 2/25. Hubby takes PTO, no problem. They neglected to text us like promised when they were on their way so we weren’t quite ready. No biggie, we get our old sofa moved out to the garage. It was already sold and the lady was coming that evening to get it. 

They get the new loveseats out of the truck and they’re badly damaged.  The boxes are destroyed and when opened, the love seats were both splintered and had broken frames. One is not even able to be assembled, but one is functional. They decide to leave the functional one with us and will bring two new ones ASAP to replace the broken one and set up our second one. That way, we have somewhere to sit for the next week. 

The warehouse calls to clarify the situation and thought only one was broken. I explained both were broken but they left one. They said they would be bringing two new ones today and taking back the broken one. Husband took another day off work (we have to rearrange at the last minute and I cannot do it alone). 

So I just got a text with an estimated time and my ‘order’ summary. They are only bringing one loveseat and taking one away. So now husband will have to take a third day of pto to be here for the second couch. Meanwhile, we’re sitting on a cheap futon from my kid’s room and a broken loveseat. 

What is fair in this situation? Reimbursement for 2 days of PTO? Refund of delivery fee ($99)? We paid over $3k for these loveseats. This is a large national chain and their warehouse is out of state so I know we won’t get the second loveseat today (unless the order summary is wrong and they actually DO bring both). They will likely leave the good one and the broken one, and come out a third time in another week to replace the broken one. 

I do plan on contacting the store and requesting some sort of compensation, I’m just not sure what is fair/reasonable.",03Mar2020,1
838,"TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ABUSE AND INCEST


This will be a little long so please bear with me.

I am (17F) and I have an elder sister (19F).

My mom had a severe drug addiction and she even went to rehab for it as well, when she was on drugs, my mom would sexually abuse both me and my elder sister. This was when we were still young kids but the abuse left lasting scars on us. The abuse stopped after she came back from rehab. 

My sister once questioned her about the abuse and my mom told her that she was actually a closeted lesbian and when the drugs would take over, she just needed some outlet to let out her pent up frustration. She said she was very sorry for doing what she did and that she would never hurt us. She never did do it again. My sister forgave her but I for some reason, could not. My father didn't know a thing about the abuse.

The abuse has left me with severe mental health issues and depression and I have no outlet to get this out since I haven't revealed anything about the abuse to my therapist as I don't want to bring shame onto our family as these kind of things are very scandalous in my country.

Mom died a year ago from an accident and it was all very sad for my sister and I. But my dad was devastated the most because he thought that Mom was finally recovering and they could be happy. 

It was her death anniversary a week ago and my dad was reminiscing about what an amazing lady she was and how much she loved us kids and how she saved up a lot of money for our college. 

For some reason i felt really enraged at hearing all this. I don't know why but I went on a full on monologue about how Mom used to abuse us kids and how she was actually a lesbian trapped in a loveless marriage who let out all her sexual frustration on us. I also, foolishly blamed my father for not taking care of us enough and leaving us alone with our mom when he knew she might be on drugs.

Now my father is even more devastated and my sister won't talk to me at all. She says i ruined my mother's memory for Dad and I was a terrible person for doing it. I feel like I should not have told him about the lesbian part but it was impossible to tell him about the abuse without mentioning it.

Personally, I don't know why i did it. But know i am thinking that i really shouldn't have done that. I am very confused and need an outside perspective. 


TL;DR; Mom used to sexually abuse me. I told my dad after her death now everyone's mad at me",03Mar2020,1

845,"Hi everyone! I’m currently in my 3rd semester of (community) college. I’m currently taking an English II class which is needed for my degree. I am debating dropping it. The class itself isn’t too hard and I don’t think I will fail and I don’t mind my professor, but it is so, so mentally draining. My professor makes attendance a requirement for this class, if we miss more than 3 classes we get a 0. This is not the issue, but what makes it an issue is that it is a very interactive class. We work in groups and talk to different people and share our thoughts out loud every single day for the entire 2 hours. We don’t ever even have lectures, just strictly group work every single class, multiple times per class. This is a huge issue for me because I have really bad social anxiety, I am very quiet and keep to myself. I love English, I’m actually pretty good at it. But the amount of socialization we do in this class is absolutely mentally draining and makes me want to not attend. I also am going through a lot of shit at home currently and I haven’t felt this depressed in years which doesn’t help at all. I really wish I would have taken this course with this professor as an online course. So I’m considering dropping this class and taking it next semester online.

851,"Example:

I will finish Project #1. Project #1 is done accurately and without errors. Then I will get an email from Boss about why Project #2 wasn't finished as well. I will explain the status of Project #2 (ongoing). Boss will then tell me I need to identify priorities better and be more on top of things. Meanwhile, Project #2s deadline isn't for another two weeks, whereas Project #1s deadline was met.

Rinse and repeat for almost any task.

No completed task is ever acknowledged. Only undone tasks are ever talked about.

Last week, I blew up at my boss after 7 months of this. Constant nit-picking, absent management, micro-managing emails and phone calls, CC'ing multiple departments to chastise me for something, etc. I told them we are reviewing my position, my responsibilities and I want to be a part of the business meetings going forward so that we can have some idea of what projects are priority in the scheme of the business model and quarterly goals.

Boss tells me I don't need to know goals or objectives to do my job. Boss cannot provide goals they are working towards, priority list of projects or even a vague idea of what my job priority roles are.

I feel like I am dealing with a psychopath (no, really) that just wants an excuse to always complain about people's performance.

I myself have been measuring my output, quality and quantity, time on projects, tasks completed in allotted time, etc. My efficiency has gone up, accuracy has gone up, yet I am still constantly being told it is not good enough or I made the incorrect call on priorities.

When I ask for priority clarification, Boss will respond with: ""You need to get familiar with it because I can't always be holding your hand.""

I honestly feel like I'm being set up to fail. Last week, I thought I was going to be fired for fighting back. I'm still here, surprisingly enough. Yet nothing has changed.

I feel like it's almost personal at this point. I don't remember the last time I was even thanked at work. Heck, during our last meeting when we were asked to share successes of the week, Boss interrupted me after only a few words to clarify that successes are only defined as something 'above and beyond' my job description, so what I was mentioning isn't a success. I was then held back after the meeting and told that I had been asked to find a success, had failed to do so, and was being given a verbal warning to come better prepared to the next meeting. 

Am I dealing with a narcissist? How can I get ahead in this kind of situation? Do I just grit my teeth and bide my time? The pay is solid enough for me to keep going. It's just shitty to hear day and day that I'm not good enough, yet they haven't let me go either. I feel like she's pushing me to quit, and I'm too stubborn.

I'll try to explain this mess ..

I've [24M] been with this girl [28F] for the past 5 years, we have been through thick and thin together. We met abroad and once back in our country we kept on going.
We live far from each other (500km) and only manage to meet once every two-three weeks. 
We had lived in the same city for 2 years and it was great but due to my studies and her job we had to go back to the long-distance relationship we both HATED. 

She has now started to raise some concerns over our relationship and I agreed we'd break up whenever she wants (I like her as a person and don't wanna be a weight on anyone's shoulders) but she's afraid she might throw me into oblivion with this choice (and it's my fear aswell).
She has these ""periods"" of ""bad humor"" so I really don't know if this is one or not. I'd break up first if I were strong enough, just for our well-being and to avoid a more painful type of breakup.
I really love her and I think she loves me too but I can't make her find the light in this shit-tunnel we found ourselves into.

Reddit is really my last resort, I'm alone, apart from my family. My friends have completely dumped me a couple of months ago and are just ignoring me. To me they were great friends (not to them apparently) that I had for more than 7years, and there's no way I can go back to them after all the painful shit I had to do to keep them (in the last times).

I feel completely alone, I can't make any new friends or find people to hang out with or ask this kind of advice to. My city is small and the coronavirus outbreak is keeping everyone at home anyway for now.
How can I have a social life like I used to? I don't feel comfortable ""fitting in"" new groups and I'm scared I might end up be alone and go into a deep depression state.

How can I deal with a possible breakup in this mess? Is there any chance I can make this relationship survive? What should I tell her to make her live better together/apart?

I know this is a mess of a question, probably cause I'm a mess myself :) 
Thanks in advance, I usually read stuff here and realise I'm a very lucky person, but today I am the one in need of advice.

Tldr: I'm scared to suffer from a possible breakup, how do i avoid it? If it actually happens I have no friends that could help me through it. On the other hand I think I could try to ""resurrect"" the relationship (which I think could survive), but how?",03Mar2020,1
854,"So I'm a college student and my parents pay for everything for me. In high school they told me not to get a job because they wanted me to study hard and get into college and to not worry about money because they will pay for everything. When I started college they once again told me not to get a job because they wanted me to focus on my studies. 

I know I am very privileged to be able to have parents well off enough to pay for my college and life. I am very grateful that they are willing to do this. 

I've been studying really hard and this semester has been really hard on me mentally, I have a really big course load on top of my internship, volunteering, job shadowing, leadership positions, and research so my friend's parents invited me and some other friends to drive to their beach house at venice beach ca from where we live in Idaho for spring break. We have been planning this for months and I've been very excited but last night my parents texted me saying that I am no longer allowed to go to venice because they're worried I'll catch coronavirus and that if I do go they'll cut me off financially.

I hate that they can pull the money card whenever they want and I have to listen to them or else we'll just fight and I'll be cut off, especially when they've spent my whole life telling me to not save money or get a job because they didn't want me to worry about money. 

Am I wrong to be mad at them? My brother says that I don't listen to them and I'm stubborn and I should just suck it up. I know they're just concerned for my health but I'm still upset about the money part? Like, how much control they have over what I can do?",03Mar2020,1

So my ex and I dated for about 5 ish months. I literally can’t even tell you why we broke up. He gave me a million reasons why and I just don’t even know what the truth is anymore. He said he didn’t love me anymore, cause he had feelings for his ‘first love’, he didn’t want a relationship anymore, the one hour commute to come see me was too much for him and probably a bunch of other stupid excuses I can’t remember.

Point is, he bullshits me a lot. And I know he does, yet I still find myself getting caught in an endless loop of on and off with him. He loves me, then he doesn’t, then he does. I know he’s probably toxic and doesn’t care for me because he just gave up so easily at the smallest inconveniences in our relationship. There was a lot of red flags that I will admit I ignored..he would complain to my friends when I wouldn’t send him explicit photos and stuff. There’s been quite a few times I didn’t want to do things and I’ve been guilted into it. (I know now that it was a shitty thing of him to do.)

My happiness depended on him and now he’s gone and I don’t know what to do. I find myself grasping at any sort of attention he gives me. I guess I already know he’s bad for me?

857,"So, background: we’re a group of 5 girls in *the equivalent of high school in my country*. I’ve only know 3 of them for the past year and a half because I moved, the other 1-2 only recently joined our group. I’ve recently told the 4 others about my mental health issues (told parent and a doctor soon after, it’s all good). One of them (V) has a close relative who had a medical procedure a while ago, and that’s affected her quite a bit, which is why I’ve been forgiving/ignore these possibly insignificant things lately. 

I’ve noticed that (V) has been more distant from all of us lately, especially me. Hasn’t been noticing me as much and just not acting as they normally would. The issue surrounding this post happened earlier today. I had to go to a teacher at lunch since I didn’t understand the homework. I asked all of them to make sure they’d be able to wait for a few minutes until I’m done. I figured it would be fine because we sometimes go to another class that 3 of them take (not V) for them to finish projects, normally waiting most of the first half of lunch, leaving 20-30 minutes to eat. 

So we went into the classroom (can I add, this room is one of the only classes we’re allowed to use our phones freely during breaks, because the teacher is really chill), and I sat down and started working with her on my homework. The others were on their phones a couple tables away, trying to be kind of quiet so as not to disturb us. I was about halfway done what she was helping me with when (V) suggested they’d leave, but one of the others reminded her that we couldn’t leave me. She agreed and they continued to do their own thing. I was on the second to last question when (V) said they should go again, again reminded I was there, the suggested that one of the group (H) should stay with me, while the others go get food. Then all, but (H), left. I finished up and I looked at the clock assuming it was probably taking a longer time than I thought and felt bad until I realized it only took 10 minutes (not even, didn’t go in there right at the beginning of lunch, so more like 7 minutes). I got a little pissed and was gonna mention something to (H) (who also gets upset when our friends leave us, after a certain incident where us 2 were left on the beach, with no way to get home, had to call parents. All was forgiven, but never forgotten), but I didn’t because I didn’t want to seem like a shit-stirrer. But I was quite upset for most of the rest of lunch.

859,"So my parents said they were going to be out for the weekend, like until Monday (teacher work day for my school), and so Saturday night I decided it would be a good idea to throw a party at my house.

I expected it to be a small party of 5-6 people, but I told a specific friend who knows lots of people that he should invite some people, and boy he invited like 20-30 people, I think at the peak there was like 50+ people in my house. I was glad I decided to lock all the rooms and take down breakables. Anyway this is besides the point.

I had some good friends of mine that I agreed I would shelter in my house, so they don't have to bear their parents drunk, and I told them it would be ok to unlock the rooms with paper clips to crash.

So here's where my step sister comes into the picture. She said she was going to hang out with some friend for the weekend, but last minute they canceled. So she ended up being there for the party.

I don't remember too much of the night, but I do remember being exceptionally close with my step sister. We've always been pretty close and friendly, and I have to admit, I'm attracted to her, but I wouldn't want to pursue her or anything like that, I don't want to ruin my family. I guess drunk me didn't care.

Remember  making out with her that night and doing some other touching and things of that sort. After people were left and everything I crashed in my room, and she came in there too or something, but yeah I woke up and we were spooning in our underwear together. I wasn't really instantly mad or surprised, I just kinda went with it.

 Well yeah we got up and decided just to pretend nothing happened. We just didn't speak. I waved my friends bye after we cleaned up and everything and I thought it was ok after they drove home.

I was wrong. Today I was made fun of for being a ""sister fucker"". Of course you have also the people who don't care and say things like ""I wish I had a hot step sister, you are living the pornhub life"". I tell everyone that I was just drunk and I don't really like her like that or anything, but talking about her just increased chatter. I understand it will pass and I just have to wait.

 Those friends of mine are not apparently friends a told every damn person in the entire school about how I allegedly ""had sex with my sister."" I can deal with this sort of thing, but I really don't know if she can. She seems really sad and ashamed after today. She came to me for comfort and started making moves on me.

 I mean if I'm 100% honest, I wish she could be my girlfriend, but it's not realistic. What should I do? This is really bad.

TL; DR :
I threw a party at my house and ended up becoming a public example at my school after sleeping (without sex) with my step sister who I like, but I know I can't be with. She may not be able to deal with all the embarrassment at school. Multiple problems here.",03Mar2020,1
860,"I feel like there's some need for a backstory first. I am the third year in high school, every year third-grade students organize something which resembles prom a lot, it's basically a fancy party with not much to do. We did not pick to organize it, and it seems we have much less saying in it than we thought we would. 

One of the worst parts of it is having to stay at the party until 3 am only to then clean. I did my part, and I did much more than half of the people did. I brought 30 glasses of wine only to be put on tables, I brought in about 15 things at least for the raffle, and we only needed 5. Not to mention I will also sell tickets for it on the ball. Some people either only did one thing or none at all. 

I do not want to spend so long there, both because I have chronic pain in one side of my body that gets worse when I'm tired and then only slowly gets better. I might have to deal with it for the next whole week, don't ask why but neuropathy is fucking weird.

Then on top off that, I also don't want to be there for that long. My original plan was to take a car and drive home at around midnight. I will not drive a car if I'm supposed to be there till at least 4 am (the cleaning will begin at 3), I got my drivers licence a month ago and would probably fall asleep in the first turn. I live quite far away from the town where the prom is, so I cannot even go home to get some sleep and then come back to clean. I am not against parties, but there has to be something to do. From my experience, all you can do after midnight is drink and dance. I don't drink and dancing is only fun for a while. I don't know what the hell am I supposed to do there till 3 am.

As you can guess, cleaning someone's vomit and used condoms doesn't sound too appealing. If we were to come in the morning to clean, I would be okay with it. The lack of sleep is what I take issue with. I don't ever party till 3 am. I don't know how should I entertain myself or if I should make up an excuse and go home. At least partly it is legit as I do truly have chronic pains as mentioned, but it feels unfair to my classmates who will have to stay there.",03Mar2020,1
862,So there is a guy I go to school with but not in the same place so I don't see him very often. He is 2 years older than me. Sometimes we're done with school at the same time. We occasionally sit quit close and I dont know how to get his attention and I am a very shy person.,03Mar2020,1
863,"I have a fiend who white-lies constantly and I find it hard to respect them as I used to because I just can not trust things they say at face value.  


It is usually small things like something comes on TV they have obviously never seen before and hey will say ""I always though that X Y Z about that"" - when obviously it is something they just though now bu want to feign knowledge.  Or I can't do X because of my Dad's illness,  or because I argued with my brother,  or because his medication or because whatever,  when you have never done X, you always just dream up false justifications because you wan to conceal what is really going on.  If these sound small, they are, but it is the quantity that is the problem. Probably 20 times each meeting.  It becomes particularly grating when you see the repeated problems that this action has over and over, but these things can't be solved because the real causes are being obscured.

I have tried pointing out gently when things are not true or are bing exaggerated or embellished, but the friend has not altered this trait, and I almost think that when I stat to get irritated by it,  they get even worse and do it more out of nervousness.  I suspect this person had a very volatile home-life when young and has learnt to white-lie to quickly get themselves out of pressured situations by quickly-lying to put themselves out of danger, which is why I think it gets worse if other people get stressed

I find myself losing patience with this person  and it feels like a personal insult that I would believe all the stuff they say quite honestly.  I also feel tho like I am bing a bad friend getting irritated but also like they must think I'm stupid.  It seems like too little to lose a friendship over, but I start resenting being around them and don't want to lose respect for them.  But I can't keep seeing this sad case of an adult lying over silly things and still respect them.

Job: Clinical Research Coordinator 

Salary: $50k with no OT

Benefits: Yes 

PTO: Yes 

Hire date: August of 2019

&amp;#x200B;

I am basically at a point now where I no longer give a damn about my job. The people in my office have pretty much thrown everything at me and have expected me to ""get it done,"" and being busy is ""no longer an excuse"" to meet certain deadlines. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a new hire, I have stressed this since November of 2019, and here were are in March of 2020 and they've given me 0 extra support. I have come to a point now where if it doesn't get done it simply doesn't get done... 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking for jobs - and have been hiding behind my problems at work. I simply just no longer deal with them, and I feel like I am burying my own grave. I tried, and I tried to do the job they've tasked me to do but I feel completely incompetent and I feel like I have sabotaged the projects they have given me because I have ZERO medical background. 

&amp;#x200B;

After 3-4 months of complaining, I told a few folks that I was going to quit and hand in my notice, and it eventually got to my supervisor who confronted me about it. Ultimately, I don't see myself staying in this job for the long haul, if I get fired, I get unemployment.

865,"So yesterday I was playing my PS4 with my friend, we opened up a game but it didn’t load and after a minute of waiting we heard a man with a strong accent saying something unidentifiable. We just passed it off as a glitch or something, but today after hanging up on a discord call I could hear a mans voice that sounded similar through my earphones. He spoke for a while, and if I didn’t shut my laptop down he would have probably carried on. I tried turning my volume up but no matter what volume level I put my laptop at it didn’t change the volume of his voice. He spoke frantically but had a casual essence about it, for example how a 911 call sounds. His speaking was quiet but I could hear him mumbling something in what I assume wasn’t English.

Her two daughters have a lot of problems. They’re beautiful smart insightful amazing girls, but they’re not easy kids. The younger one has adhd and oppositional defiant disorder. The older girl has really dangerous moodswings, she’s only ten and she’s done things like bring a knife to school, reach out to multiple adults online about sex, and threaten to kill herself. 

Keeping them from hurting themselves can be more than a full time job, and it’s super heart breaking because you can easily see how smart and capable and caring their whole family can be and they’re just struggling so much. 

We’ve discussed watching the older child and having their grandfather watch the younger while their mom can focus on rehabilitation because they’re much calmer and healthier apart, they’re constantly at each other’s throats and you spend the whole time breaking up fights and don’t really get to focus on either of their needs or what they’re going through. Their mom really doesn’t want to separate them and she’s afraid that having them live with family or friends would give them the idea that they can just decide to go have a different home if they have any issues, and that they won’t learn to deal with their issues they’ll just run away from them. Which makes sense. And she’s their mom and she’s trying so hard. But sometimes I get so upset because they’re in a super fucked up situation right now and I just want to help them.

In October my bestie was visiting me and i was talking to her about how i was feeling about how my bf was treating me (and It wasn’t good) and she just jumped on It and started telling me i should just break up with him. The whole time i was telling her that i love him too much to break up with him but in the back of my head i was like “maybe i am too young to be worrying about this” and “wow she’s right i should just break It off”. This went on until i decided yea I’ll just do It it’s over between us. So for some reason when i decided that and made It official in my head i went and downloaded tinder. For no reason at all. Like i didn’t plan on actually talking to anyone or even swiping i just downloaded It. Then, long story short, i talked to my bf and we didn’t end up breaking up.

Looking for some general advice here. My buddies and I are planning a rock climbing trip to South Arfica in June. I was super excited for it up until about a week ago when all the coronavirus stuff started (doesn’t help we live in WA State). We are making our decision on tickets this thursday and I am super conflicted about whether I should even go at this point.

Supposedly the virus might slow down in the summer, but if it hits Africa I know it’s gonna spread like crazy due to the poor healthcare system there. I’m not that worried about the virus (healthy 22yo here) but it sure would suck to have to be in quarantine in South Africa and without the benefits of an advanced healthcare system. 

My question to you all is should I still buy tickets? I desperately want to go (I’m graduating this year and only have 3 weeks of freedom before work starts) but on the other hand my parents think it’s a bad idea and I’m conflicted myself.

884,"I met this girl in September last year, in school. We get along really well, probably because she's a very friendly person, but I make her laugh and we both have a great time when we hangout. We're both members of the same club, but the guys and girls hangout separately, and only certain events do guys and girls hangout together.

I had a major crush on her in the beginning of the fall semester, but ultimately I tried to get over her because I barely met her for a month and a half. I did get over her, and only ran into her once or twice in Oct and Nov.

Then I met her again during late November at a friends-giving, and that's when I fell in love again. Not as much as the first time, but enough to get me to ask her to hangout again. I did it during finals week, which in hindsight was a mistake. She felt really bad, and told me she couldn't because she had a lot of work to do. 

Then in February, I asked her out on a date (not to hangout, a date). She said she'll let me know, but it's been nearly 2 weeks now and no response. During those two weeks I kind of just dropped it, and forgot about her.

Then I met her recently again, during a meetup. I didn't know what to feel, I stopped liking her thinking it was a lost cause, but there she was again. She said greeted me with a smile, and I did the same, but I didn't talk to her. I stuck with two guys, while she talked with two girls. I wasn't sure what to do. She and her friend knows I asked her out (but they weren't weirded out, at least thats what my friend (one of the guys I stuck with) told me). 

I think she doesn't want to go on a date with me, but I heard she might've been going through some medical problems? I'm not sure, but if it's true it might be possible that she didn't respond because she's been going through some rough times. I also don't want to come of as obsessed, and get embarrassed in my circle of friends, since some know that I asked her out, and therefore like her, already.

Honestly, the what-if's and maybe's is getting to me. I can't focus, and this whole ordeal has been an on and off thing for 6 months now. At this point, I don't care if she doesn't like me, I just need some closure so I can stop thinking about what could be.

But she's on percocet (not sure if spelled right) and a few other medications to help alleviate the pain. However, she claims that they make her drowsy, hence the reason for her constantly flaking.

Now I don't want to be an asshole and cut things off because of the cancer.. because tbh I would still like to see where things go. But certain things make it feel like she's using me. I'm always paying for dates, she never really initiates anything. Well to date, she did pay for one date.. but that's all.. part of me also feels like I'm a sidedick.. I really don't like wasting time.. and much less money. Should I keep trying with her? Or just cut things off before I waste more time?

Any advice would be appreciated!",03Mar2020,1
896,"I (22F) have been suffering from one for 5 years now. When I started dating my boyfriend one year ago, I found out that his sister is anorexic. This obviously put a big toll on his entire family, especially his mother it seems - especially because the daughter/sister in question lives in another city and they cannot really check up on her. Sometimes, when the sister is not there, my MIL might update me and my bf on how she's doing or share her concerns with us. It's obviously very... weird for me to hear them talk about eating disorders and not being able to say anything. My boyfriend knows I'm suffering from one, but not his mother. It isn't obvious either as I am at a normal weight and ish eat normal amounts of food and seem healthy. 

So yeah, it all just creates this weird atmosphere for me. It also feels kind of icky because I feel like I'm essentially lying, or at least hiding something really important from my MIL. She means a lot to me and is like my own mother (I actually see her often than my own mother) and she has opened up about a lot of her personal problems and illnesses to me. So it feels so... I don't know - fake and mean maybe, to hide such a major part of my life from her. I also get very uncomfortable when she asks for my opinion about something eating disorder related (like if we watch a documentary, or read an article) or we just discuss the topic, and I have to play dumb as if I have no idea how EDs work, when in reality I can fully understand the stuff that her daughter is going through. I also feel like it could potentially help the MIL to talk to me - as someone ""outside"" (i.e. not her daughter), but that isn't a therapist and that has experience with eatings disorders. Maybe I can offer some insight or give some advice. Idk. A part of me also wants to tell her about my issues because I have a strong longing for support and love and care from a parental figure. My father is absent and my mother does not believe in mental illness, so every time I've tried to open up she ridiculed me and said that I'm healthy. So yeah, I feel like it would feel nice to open up to my MIL and have her in my support system (right now the only person who knows about my ED is my boyfriend).

But I'm so worried that she has enough on her mind as it is, with her daughter's disorder and her own issues. So I'm afraid that it will be hard on her to hear that another person that is close to her is struggling with an eating disorder. So I'm afraid that it will simply be egoistical of me to tell her about this issue of mine - that it will cause her mental health to deteriorate even more. But at the same time, I struggle a lot with asking for help and support from the people around me - I'm so afraid of taking up space and getting attention - so maybe it's just this voice in my head that's telling me not tell my MIL about all of this? 

So should I tell my MIL about my eating disorder, or would it indeed be egoistical/inconsiderate of me to tell her these things? Would appreciate any advice.",03Mar2020,1
897,"So I've been playing with a team for 2 years. I like them but I never really bonded well with the other team mates. The team itself is pretty good, they are not winning anything any time soon.

Last year, on an extended stay away from home, I started playing with a new team temporarily. I got on really well with them all and I felt like a valued member of the team. They are unexpectedly on the rise and making a name for themselves. They have gotten into the finals.

When I left in December, the new team offered to continue paying my transport costs and membership fee for me to play for them still, which I accepted.

The two teams' schedules did not clash, but the new team had to delay a game to the same week as my regular team. 

I would like to play for the new team. They are making history and the team is all but begging me to play. However, the old team are very passive aggressive in their attitude to me playing there in general. I worry they will think Im choosing someone over them and it will reflect badly when I am finished playing the new team's season, and I wont get my place back",03Mar2020,1

901,"TL;DR I have a textbook case toxic friend as a best friend (watch the Phyc2Go video she’s all but 2 &amp; 6 https://youtu.be/XET6Kdn7qS0 )and she’s constantly bringing me down even if it’s intentional or not. I want to end things but I’m afraid that she’ll do something because of her mental health issues.

I’m going to hope and pray she doesn’t have 
Reddit because this will go down in flames but basically I have this “Best friend” and after months or denial I finally got it through my head that she is toxic  
Background: so I’m going to call her TX for a toxic friend, I’m going to call another one of my friends 0F for original friend. So I’ve been friends with this girl for about a year now we’re both 16F and we go to the same school. Originally we got on like sisters and I really felt like we could have a long-term friendship but she started changing this year.. Both of us got extremely depressed (my mom believes I have genetic depression not sure that’s a thing though) and honestly we’re miserable together. If you’ve ever watched the psych to go video on toxic friends she’s the textbook case of a toxic friend, she guilt trips me, she makes me spend every waking second in contact with her, she puts me down, she starts fights and overall I come home still worried and stressed about the next inevitable fight we’ll have. I hate being around her, I’ll go out of my way to avoid her because I feel like every time I talk with her I’m either walking on egg shells because she’s “sensitive” Or every little thing I say is a competition.For example: we were in class the other day and I would raise my hand and say something and then immediately after she would raise her hand and have something else to say trying to one up me, initially I thought this was just a coincidence but then it happened over and over and over again. She’s also extremely jealous,I used to be best friends with OF But she’s gotten pretty sick so now she Hass to go on home instruction, before that though whenever I would talk about her or hang out with her she would start to Paul and get very jealous even though they have nothing in common and don’t get along. It’s just very exhausting that I feel like I can’t hang out with my one friend without feeling anxious because I know I’m gonna get shit for it next time I see TF. One last thing that I have to mention that I know some of you will get a kick out of but, she is also a textbook case of the Tumblr girl self diagnosing herself yet she makes fun of other people because she feels like they’re lying about having hearing problems or OCD. According to her she has ADHD, severe depression, anxiety disorder (with panic attacks and anxiety attacks almost every day), short term memory loss, OCD, Suicidal thoughts, Some sort of perception disorder that I forgot the name of And more that I probably forgot about. But I take mental health very seriously and I worry that at least one of these may be a something that she genuinely struggles with (even though I doubt it). I feel nervous to ever bring up my concerns or voice my thoughts with her because I run the risk of being the cause of one of her panic attacks or crying fits. I’ve talk to most of all people like my mom’s therapists and school counselors and they all say that she is very manipulative, But I’m still worried that she may do something because of me. 
So now today: I’m kind of a doormat at my school which is probably my least favorite thing about myself I’ve always admired confident people. This is relevant because she asked me to give her the answers to the homework thing and (I know I sound like a nerd but I recently got suspended so I am not trying to take any risks and my school takes any kind of cheating way too seriously) didn’t want to give it to her but I gave it to her anyway because not complying runs the risk of her having an anxiety attack because she couldn’t get her work done. Low and behold today I got pulled aside because I’m cheating. I start to freak out a little bit because the aforementioned suspension and I swear to God I’m not a bad kid. I tell her not to tell the guidance counselor because the teacher was most likely gonna let us off but apparently what I say doesn’t matter because she goes to them anyway because “ she didn’t want to get in trouble” and “ it’s ok we’re not in trouble because I went in there crying” and the last time I got suspended was also because I did something stupid for another one of my friends so I’m very disappointed in myself and frustrated in general.
So Basically: I’m at the point where I can’t fucking stand her, I dread school just because I have to see her, she’s brought my self-esteem significantly lower, I come home just to be stressed out because of her and I don’t know what to do! I tried making her take a break from our friendship about a month ago but she found me when I was in a low place and I forgive her and I really regret that. We have a class together and she knows where I am at all times of the school day so I wish I could just easily avoid her but like I said earlier she will Spend time with just me alone any chance she gets. I wish I was stronger to just tell her that I can’t do this anymore but I just feel like I can’t.

Anyway, my mom paid for the appointment. I offered to pay her (with my scholarship) but she refused: she told me that I didn’t have to worry about it, since she’s my mom.
Now, we got into a fight because of my scholarship; I didn’t tell her how much money I received, and she asked me for money. I’ve been on that road again, and I gave my mom a hundred bucks when she asked them a while ago. She promised she would pay me back. I tried bringing this up, but she says that she pays me in being a good mom to me (feeding and clothing me).
Now, when she asked for money today, I gave her my lunch money that my dad gives to me (I don’t buy lunch since I’m saving up for college and the future).
Five minutes later, she asked me if I could give her more money, since she wanted to buy some soda. I know I was wrong in not giving her anything, but you have to understand: it’s my future. It’s my money. And it’s my savings. I refused. She told me that I had to pay her back the doctor’s appointment by today, since she has no money. She told me that I’m cheap, and miserable.

At the time, I was and probably still center-left and Hillary Clinton seemed to better align with my views. So I said ""Clinton"" to him. He got passive aggressively upset. His upset nature was very low-key, implicit, and subtle. Cannot see it on first glance.

However, it came somewhat clear in a few days. When I was considering on voting in the primaries, and I asked Gavin if it was too late to vote, he replied...

&gt; ""Ohh.... You didn't knew....? The deadline passed a few days ago.""

After that, I called my GF to verify the authenticity of Gavin's claims and she said...

&gt; ""To my knowledge, the deadline is in two weeks and four days. You still have time. I am not sure where Gavin got that. Did you tell him who you planned on voting for?""

I said yes and my GF briefly lectured me in worldviews, emotions, biases, etc.  It all came down to me being careful about talking about religion, politics, sexuality, health, finance, or anything else that can be personal and or controversial.

927,"Yesterday my manager handed me a sticky note with my new work hours which are 7 hours less per week than what I’m currently working and mostly evenings. Currently, I work full time hours everyday except Tuesday’s. Their reasoning for the new hours being that it’s best to have 2 people working (even though our shifts are scattered?) and they hired a former stay at home mom to work the regular 9 to 5 shift. Apparently, this woman worked at our office about 10 years ago and lots has changed since. I also moved about an hour drive away from work (used to be about 5 mins away) and my manager said that she thought it would be better for me to start later because of the drive... but, my shifts are shorter so it’s almost not worth the drive. 

I have been at this job for 3 years and have been very loyal to them. I will always cover shifts for anyone, I always show up on time, rarely take time off unless it’s for one of my college exams. And of course I’m doing my job properly, and being professional with our clients etc. I know I’m not the best employee of all time but on paper, I think I’ve been doing well and she has never voiced any concerns about my performance. 

I am also a part time student and these new hours will not work with my school schedule because they are so scattered. 

I’m quite bothered by the fact that this woman they hired got priority and is getting the “good” shift even though I am the one who is currently working full time. It’s been 10 years since she worked here, so I am going to have to train her on all the new software and I know its really going to hurt me. 

I feel really confused and honestly hurt by this and I don’t know if there is anything I can do or say (other than quitting) about this while still staying professional. I’m a broke student and losing that 7 hours is going to hurt even if it doesn’t sound like much.

A while ago when I was planning on looking for a job my mom told me maybe I'd be able to work where she works. Her job is not something I'd be interested in and I really don't think it's a good fit for me. However, I didn't want to come across as rude or bitchy so I acted excited about it and said maybe someday. 

(I also just want to point out that there ARE other jobs I've been looking at that I'm interested in, it's not that I'm lazy and don't want to work at all.)

I should've seen this coming but it totally backfired, as she has now had me fill out an application and has told her supervisors that I want to work there, and they said the job is basically mine after I interview (the interview would basically just be a formality). 

She wants me to call tomorrow and schedule the interview with them. I realize I've just been digging myself a deeper hole by going along with it for so long, but I seriously need to get myself out of this before it gets worse.

I don't know how to tell my mom that I don't want to work there. I'm afraid she'll be mad at me, either for not wanting to work there or for not telling her earlier and letting it escalate to this point.

I flew out of SFO to another state with a low number of cases. That was 10 days ago. Here are my current symptoms in the order I got them.

1. Migraines on the side of my head. Like a strike of shock going through my head.
2. Got better and turned into slight headache with a very mild cough and an intermittent runny nose.
3. Diarrhea on Sunday exactly one week after possible exposure at SFO. Head started getting warm throughout the day Sunday and woke up Monday with a very hot head.
4. Morning of Monday was at school and felt nauseous like I was going to throw up. Took my temp at 98.9 under my armpit and took Tylenol. Tylenol made my head feel less hot.
5. Tuesday Morning. Head not hot anymore but sharp sore throat. Light dizziness and slight nausea persist. Still feeling super low energy.
6. Tuesday middle of the day. Slight chills, but I’m feeling normal besides that. Going to get some work done from home.
7. Tuesday as I'm writing this. Head warm again but not as hot as last night. Nausea mostly gone and the chills gone too. Very very mild sore throat. Not as bad as this morning. Still no fever.

Questions:

1. What do I do? I figure I shouldn't go to a hospital unless I have a fever above 100 and I start having respiratory problems.
2. I am currently living on my own. What are some good steps to take? I am going to stock up on fever reducers if it progresses to that. I already have canned foods and some rice that will last me a week or so.",03Mar2020,1

938,"So I'm really stressing out and could use some advice. It's kind of a long story, so try to bear with me please. So currently, my boyfriend and I and our 2 kids are living with my parents. We used our tax refund money to find an apartment that's close enough to my daughter's school and close enough to my boyfriend's job and it's cheap enough that we can easily afford it plus expenses for other things. Well when we filled out the application for the place, tha manager showed us an apartment that she said we would be moving into. It was nice, and it was downstairs which would be much easier on us with 2 young kids, and we were excited. It still needed work done on it,(walls painted, tile put down, oven put in, bedroom doors put on hinges) but she asked us when we wanted to move in, and we told her we wanted to move in by March 1st. I even wrote down on my application under the ""scheduled move in date"" for the 1st. So on the 27th, we rented a uhaul, and we bought all new(used, but new to us) furniture and everything for our new apartment and we put it in the back of this uhaul. We used the last of our money to buy an actual car, because we haven't had one since ours quit running about a year ago and we needed one. And so on friday(February 28th), I called her to confirm that we were set to move in by the 1st, and she told me that she was going to lowes to get the tile and lay it that day, so she said ""hopefully it will be ready by the first"". I tried calling her on the 1st, but it was a sunday, so no one was working that day to take my call. So I waited until the 2nd and called her, again asking if our apartment was ready for us to move in yet. She said no, and that she hadn't even laid the tile or done anything in the apartment since we last talked. So I asked her when we would be able to move in and she wouldn't give me a direct answer, she just kept telling me all the things she needed to do. She started arguing with me, and telling me that we had never told her that we wanted to move in on the 1st, and that she was sure that we said we wanted to move in the middle of the month. I assured her that we said the 1st, I even told her that that's what I wrote on my application too. So after we hung up, she called me back a little while later and said that she has an upstairs apartment available if we want it. So I said yes and asked her if it was ready to move in. She said no, because she needed to replace the window frames and paint. We told her that we have to be moved in by the morning of the 4th, because that's when we have to take the uhaul truck back, and we cant afford an extension on it. So she said she will do her best. So we called her today and asked about the status of the apartment and she said that she cant get anyone in to fix the windows until at least tomorrow. And now I dont know what to do, and this is where I need advice if anyone has any to offer. We cant afford to rent the uhaul any longer, we cant afford a storage unit to put all our stuff in, and even if we could, we would have to rent a uhaul to move all the stuff again anyway because we dont know anyone with a truck. We dont have room in my parents apartment for our stuff, either. So I really dont know what to do about any of this. Does anyone have any advice for me?",03Mar2020,1

940,"Backstory to establish how I'm in this situation now:

So ever since the very end of November last year, I've been working at a luggage store that's part of a national luggage store chain, and it was easy to get the job at the time because one of my former supervisors at my last job (ironically enough was another smaller chain luggage store in the exact same location before closing down) was the manager. I had an opportunity at this job when the new store opened anyway but I couldnt take it due to obligations I had that spring and summer.

Im their most recent hire and the owners and operations managers of the chain keep staffing very lean, too lean in my store's case, so scheduling was always tough especially with the majority being part-timers, but it worked. My manager at the time had a more relaxed system of handling operations of the store.

Things got bad when my manager, during vacation she took after Christmas, got violently ill with some virus and had to be in the hospital from then to mid-February. We were without any manager from January to mid-February but we were handling things still ok. Despite schedule tightness and people stretched farther in their hours, we made it work and one of my colleagues was doing well at making the schedules.

The temporary manager that came in was only in to perform essential operations, only showing up a couple days a week because he's manager of one of the stores in another city, and he still wasn't officially in charge, so his methods weren't law since my former manager was still officially the manager.

All this changed during the 2nd-to-last week of February. We did our major inventory count day, and while the prep and initial counting were done quickly and smoothly, the day was a disaster because it was discovered we had over $25,000 (retail, not wholesale), in inventory missing, including some luggage. This obviously made the main owner of the chain angry, and he was literally walking back and forth looking over sheets, and audibly saying things to the merchandise managers and such like ""we may as well close the store, this is too much money lost, not worth it"" or ""something is not right with this store."" so the owner is saying these things openly in front of myself and another colleague, demoralizing us, and then the owner and operations directors, and the temporary manager I mentioned (who was participating in the inventory count) all decide to take a lunch after finishing looking over the initial counts. When they all come back, the temporary manager talks privately to myself and the other colleague and says that he's gonna be the new manager of our store and that they'll make major changes to the store's operations to get it back on track. It was this now new manager's idea and he convinced the owner to give it a shot. The owner announced it later, and said that my former manager, while the immediate reason was her health, the owner made it sound like he doesn't ever want her as manager again, because of problems they've had with eachother and because of this major money loss. However they don't talk about any detailed investigation, the only things the owner mentions is that they'll install cameras as soon as they're able to, and they're gonna look into ways to lock the basement door leading to the dock at the mall and the trash/recycle crushers. The owner makes it clear, even without saying specifically, that he's more concerned about an internal theft risk than external.

So that's the backstory. Here's the current situation:

The new manager's rules are very strict and basically has neutered our ability to do anything other than sell and do opening/closing procedures. The list of new rules are as follows:

-the downstairs basement bathroom is not to be used under any circumstances, no exceptions
-trash and boxes aren't to be taken out by anyone unless the manager is present to accompany and help
-we aren't allowed to open the safe to put in deposits or take them out to go to the bank anymore
-when people are by themselves during a long shift, they are not to close the store for their lunches, but instead have their meal break on the floor, stop those to help customers, and keep on the meal break, all while clocked out.
-the only time the store can be closed is for bathroom breaks, and for no more than 5 minutes
-daily inventories are required for morning shift, at least one brand a day per morning shift person, and afternoon and evening people can work on such if it's not busy.

Now something like the inventory counts is perfectly reasonable and honestly should have been done this entire time. But the other rules are either downright ridiculous or straight up illegal (at least according to California law). In regards to the break policies, my coworkers and I haven't been following the new break rules and we've been closing the store when by ourselves for our lunches still. But it's still horrible that this is required under these new rules my manager put up, and I'm sure eventually he's gonna catch on and it'll be a problem.

On top of that, it's been clear as of this past week that the manager only shows up when he feels like it. He's always been late even though he's scheduled in the morning until 3pm, but lately he's been not showing up on some days, either because he overslept or for no reason at all. Yesterday he chose not to show up, and had my colleague who was in the morning call and ask me to come in. I did it because I happened to be fully awake a few hours before with time to prepare and I didn't want to leave that coworker hanging, but it was cowardly of my manager to not talk to me directly and go through her (knowing I'd help any of my core coworkers out).

I don't know what all of this is, but my coworkers and I believe that in some way, the owners and the manager are actually trying to get us to all mass-quit so they can close the store down.

On top of that, one of my other coworkers talked to a friend of hers who works in retail as well, and this friend said to her that based on past experiences, it's possible the owners are still investigating and that they're looking to see who's gonna quit first, and use that to label that person a suspect (I guess the thought process is that whoever quits the soonest is the one who's trying to get away with the crime asap). So after hearing that, a number of my coworkers are afraid to leave because now they feel they'll be suspect if they do. I'm pretty sure I personally have nothing to worry about because I joined the company well after these major inventory losses started growing, but I admit the paranoid part of me that remembers my unluckiness is also a bit scared to leave. What sucks is that there are a couple possible suspects of theft yet no evidence to prove anything. 

On top of this, I talked to an associate at one of the other nearby stores yesterday, and SHE said that her store is also noticing a major inventory discrepancy in one of the brands that was reported as a high loss for my store. So that could be evidence that supports the theory here that the issue is on the owners/operations directors' ends with poor inventory system.

Basically, right now, I've been forced to work 30 hours per week, even though I signed on as part-time for working 20 hours max after holidays so I can focus on my health and strict diet, and it's been damn near impossible with me being forced to work this much, especially if I need to come in to make up for when my manager decide not to show up. Mentally and emotionally, due to all the illegal and bad stuff happening, I'm checked out and ready to quit. It looks like the mass-walkout my core coworkers and I planned won't happen due to this new fear, but I still would like to quit as soon as I can. But I'm afraid of the possibility of entrapment with both the seeming pushing they're doing to get us to leave as well as the fear of what was heard about the possibility of them labeling whoever leaves a suspect of theft.

So my questions are, is it safe for me to quit the job? Will I still be at risk for investigation and false arrest despite not having worked there until the end of last year? If my coworkers are safe, is there anything I can show them to convince them and try to get them to leave as well? Also, do you think, given everything I've said, that the owner is trying to have the store tanked on purpose to close it down and cut losses? 

I'm only concerned about legal risks since I cant afford a good lawyer. I don't care about the difficulties of getting a new job, I have contingencies for that.",03Mar2020,1

Over the past 5 months I have been attending parties for a fraternity and befriended them. I pledged 4 days ago and my life has completely gone downhill. 

The day of initiation everything seemed great. We celebrated by getting food and going to the frat house afterwards. Our process was to begin the next day, and none of us knew what to expect. 

After some time all of the brothers go into the basement of the house excluding our new pledge class. I hear a yell, ""Associate members get down here"". The brothers then make us line up alphabetically. 

The clock struck 12, and to them the process began. They began yelling at us, forced us to clean the entire house, forced us to remember each brothers position number, etc

I was disgusted by this and felt beyond anxious. This harsh treatment would continue daily. Every night at 10pm there is an event where we either get lectured or yelled at. I can no longer sleep, as early classes are a part of my schedule. 

We are forced to wear a shirt and tie every day, hold a fraternity handbook in our hands at all times, attend the school library daily from 8:30-1, clean the fraternity house every Sunday, greet all the brothers at every event with their positions and position numbers, etc. 

On Friday I was locked in a closet for 4 hours with the same song playing over and over. Keep in mind this is an anti hazing school.

I can't do anything anymore. I can't hang out with friends, I can't sleep, I have trouble completing assignments and studying due to my inability to work around other people. The fraternity has become my life, and it depresses me. 

I don't know what to do with my situation. A part of me wants to drop the fraternity, and a part of me feels bad because of the friends I have made from it and how my future will be altered.

Advice would be greatly appreciated as this problem has consumed my life.

943,"So, I (17F) went to the store today with my sister (17F) to buy some stuff.  There's a little café area right next to the public bathrooms so we sat down there so we could each go to the bathroom before heading home. I went first but after washing my hands I realized there was just an air dryer. I. Fucking. Hate. Air. Dryers. They're just absolutely disgusting in my opinion. I saw a comedy show one time that pointed out to me how nasty they are and since then I've never been able to use one. I shook off my hands and patted them on my jeans while in the bathroom but I didn't wanna waste anymore time so I left with my hands still kind of damp. I wiped them on my jeans while walking to sit and traded places with my sister. 

After sitting for awhile I felt something hit my hands. I'm not gonna be dramatic and say it knocked me out of my chair but it was a very agressive throw. Some older man (maybe 40s-60s) had thrown a stack of napkins at me. I looked up at him really confused and he just said ""Hey, beautiful. For your hands."" And went back to his pal to sit down.  His voice was neutral at best and rude at worse. 

I kinda feel stupid for getting so upset but I felt like he was mocking me. I know wiping my hands on my jeans isn't the best manners, but it felt really aggressive. I'm also not by any means attractive and especially today my acne is bad (stress, period hormones) and my hair is greasy because I had it in a pony tail all day; so basically I felt like he was sarcastically calling me ugly. Or maybe he just calls all girls beautiful. Any ways, I just felt really upset and left as soon as my sister got out of the bathroom. 

She was driving us home and she just sat in the car fixing her music at the pace of a snail; and I really really really wanted to get home as soon as possible.

Ok so about 8 months ago someone joined my school and for a bit he was shy at first, not really speaking to anybody but he started to play football with us

Anyway he was and still is treated well by everybody in our year group (he’s literally the only person who doesn’t get bullied) and so his school life isn’t too bad

Anyway I’d say 2 months ago he tried to overdose on Paracetamol, taking 20 tablets pretty suddenly.

I sent him a message saying if he needs anything I’m always there and people were supporting him in school although he’s super nervous now

Now is my issue. Every day on social media he craves for attention and sympathy. He posts on his Instagram and Snapchat that he wants to kill him self and nobody cares about him etc....

Now although he’s 17, he’s already becoming a pro gamer, getting paid to play for a small E Sports team so he’s pretty much got a guaranteed job as long as he keeps it up. He gets treated well so why is he depressed and suicidal? Not sure but I presume it’s something at home

Anyway because everybody knows he’s suicidal, he posts telling everybody to please send him nice messages and I even did once but he’s doing it every day

I don’t want him to kill himself obviously but why is he making it so public? For the people who do care about him, he’s pretty much sticking his middle finger up to them and saying they don’t care when I’m fact they do but they don’t want to constantly see if he won’t kill himself or not

955,"I work in a very international/diverse workplace, and I am one of the few employee's who grew up in the same city. I often enjoy showing people around and revealing all the hidden gems in our *not tiny* but *not huge* bustling city. More recently though feel like every casual individual or group conversation I have with my coworkers devolves into my coworkers bashing the city. It feels like everyone just dog-piles on the ""this city sucks"" rhetoric without really thinking about it and make a lot of broad comments about ""The people here..."", and it is really hurtful. I never took myself for being a RAH!-RAH!-HOMETOWN-PRIDE!!! type of person but it's getting me down. 

Topics of complaint range from the big issues like healthcare, poverty, cost of living, accessibility of public transport, safety, but also more day-to-day culture shock/social etiquette. All of which are important topics. I'm AM NOT suggesting we shouldn't talk about these things, I'm just exhausted by the nature of the conversations.

I really am the first to admit to that our city has a lot to improve upon, and I probably don't want to stay here forever either. I don't think I'm blinded by being here for so long, and often agree with these complaints, and sometimes provide some practical tips for living here which I think is appreciated. But because I've lived here my whole life, I am often expected to answer for all the shitty aspects of how the city operates. I don't know how many more times I can be asked ""Why isn't YOUR city like MY city where they've solve all the issues you have and it is much better in every way???"" without exploding. I usually say I don't know so we don't get into it, but maybe I just feel it's naive to not recognize the many nuanced factors (political, historical, cultural, economical etc) at play as to why all cities can't just spend more money and become like the 'Forbes top 10 cities to live in"".

I alsp have an addictive personality so if i got convinced into trying anything, thats it; it'll become a habit.

This would also likely be the last time I will hang out with them, because I have issues reaching out to friends and have felt like we've been drifting apart slowly during the year. Plus college is gonna keep us apart.

958,"Hey there, so recently my relationship with my roommate has gone downhill significantly. She gets pissed/mad at the simplest of things. Last semester right before my friends and I all left for winter break (her and I are in the same friend group) we were eating dinner and the conversation switched to her recent boy crush. I recently met him and one of my friends asked my opinion of him and I said he was super nice and that I like (as in he isn't a psycho that would murder my roommate). She then got super mad and talked shit about my behind my back to one of my friends saying that I said that one purpose to make her mad. After break she was, and still is, mad about it. Last semester before anything of this happened she would never stop talking to me in my dorm room. Now the only words she says to me is ""hey"" and ""later"". 

My two friends spent the night this weekend in my dorm which I asked my roommate about beforehand and she was okay with it. Now, she's going around and talking shit about me behind my back to all my friends and complaining about me doing random shit to her that makes her mad. I do not think I'm a bad roommate. I am tidy and go to sleep at the same time she does. I don't try to do anything annoying and I do my best to accommodate her. She's had a boy overnight and all I heard was their wet noises and she's also had her sister and her sister's friends spend the night. Both times I was okay with the situations and I never talk shit about her to my friends. I've tried to talk to her and make conversation but she doesn't respond. What can I do to help fix this issue? I'm afraid of losing my friends because of her talking shit behind my back because my friend group is hers too.",03Mar2020,1

961,"Hello Reddit, 

Just looking for some general advice here as I am quite depressed with my current life situation and would love some encouragement to move forward.

2012 - I had a child with my high school sweetheart and moved states in with her family at 17 years old. Her family was military and got stationed elsewhere just as our child was due so I went with them. I was a terrible teenager and was literally on probation at the time but was allowed to transfer it and move. 

During this time - my partners parents convinced us to grant them 'gaurdianship' of our child so they could be covered by Tricare medical insurance. 

I agreed because I was dumb asf and 17, it was signed off in court. 

2013 - Myself and my partner graduated high school and moved back to the state where we met (US) to live with MY parents while we got on our feet.

2014 - While working as an electrician's apprentice, I had about a 4 hour daily commute to the neighboring big city. One day about a year in to this gig, I had a car accident on the way home. I have no memory of the event but police determined I fell asleep based on witness statements. Hit a guardrail at 81 mph on an Interstate. Helicopter took me to the trauma hospital where Doctors saved my life. 

I won't list all of my injuries but there was a sever TBI, both femurs fractures, and damage to my C5 C6 C7 vertebrae. Due to whip lash, I have nerve damage in my right arm and to this day it is only about 40% functional. I WAS right handed, so adapting to this has been less than fun. Months of rehabilitation and almost 3 weeks in ICU. No more electrical work for me. As I was working commercial construction, a good paying gig especially for 2014. 

2015 - After recovering for the most part, we decided to move back with my partners parents. This was her idea as she missed them and wanted to go to school for Cosmetology but us have a babysitter. I also was still on disability and just around the house with our child but my disability was about to be up. Did not qualify for SS obviously. 

2016 - 2018 - We are living with my partners parents and with our child. I am going to school for Network Administration and she is going to Cosmetology school stereotypical I know. This is when I started drinking. I HATED where we lived (deep South). 

2018 - We graduate, we move back to the state where we met. ( No specifics, but for reference it is 1800 miles between the two states - 2 day bare minimum drive and 400$ min plane tickets ) 

We move into our own place. My grandmother passed in 2017 and left 2 properties to my mother which she rented out one of them to us. 

I work at Walmart for about 6 months until I find a real job providing IT software support. It's a 'supplier' BPO for the biggest company on the planet. I like the job as it is challenging and pays well. 

2019 - I am still working full time and my partner hasn't done jack shit to even apply for a job with her valid license in state for Cosmetology work.  Our child is with us, all of this time. 7 years they have lived with US as their caretakers whether we were actually living in a grandparents house or not. 

September - My partner begins cheating on me again. This is the 3rd occurance. (trust me I know) While I am at work and our child is in school she is fucking another man. 

I find out by snooping as I had my suspicions. I break up with her finally. Tell her I want to split and we can work out a custody agreement. 

I move in with my mom, and tell my former partner she can stay in our former rental house with our child until she makes plans otherwise. (She has began sleeping at the boyfriend's house at this point)

October - Nov - I am still working and seeing my son regularly but my ex and I are becoming more and more hostile towards one another. I start partying and going to the club (I never cheated, this ex was my high school sweetheart so I never went 'out' prior to this really)

Discovered cocaine. Drinking accelerated. Finally one day broke down and asked my mother to take me to a detox center for rehab. She agrees. I get clean. 

While in detox - my ex takes our child and gives them to her parents. This is in another state 1800 miles away. She is still here. Once I get out, she tells me this and I am livid. I see an attorney, I write the courts from back when we were 17 living with her family. 

Turns out - we actually signed custody of our child over to her parents almost 8 years ago. Black and White. Despite these terms being broken as myself and my partner had been providing financially the entire 8 years and our child was living alone with us and not with those parents for YEARS!

Fast forward to today - my ex is driving a car around owned by my mother. My ex is still on OUR family plan where I pay for my line and hers. All of my ex's stuff? It is sitting in the vacant rental house. She is living with her boyfriend. 

I have lost my job and am drinking again and have basically never been more depressed in my life. I need to pick up the pieces and get this shit together but it just seems too bleak... 

How do I get myself out of this slump?
How do I get my child back? 
How do I get my ex to pay her dues? 
How do I get my life back? 
My main concerns in my child, I fight suicidal feelings with them so far away tbh. 

Thanks for reading this rant.",03Mar2020,1
962,"Yo Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Many people have problems when they are in school, and I know this may sound like a 5-year-old problem, but it hurts sometimes.

Me and another person have the same classes, and so we usually inhabit the same room. Since we sit pretty close, he'd always insult me whenever possible and make the situation uncomfortable. I would tell a friend something, and then he would eavesdrop, and then say something insulting with the words I say. And then when I try to talk back to him, he makes a face and makes it so like I am taking offense to something I shouldn't have, even though he insulted or at the very least implied insult with the words he said. I'm not a particularly popular person, but there's no reason for him to be mean only towards me and not others. Any advice?

965,"Hey, I didn't know where to post this, so hopefully this is ok.  For reference, My friend and I are both 25.

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, I've had a picture of a tattoo on my phone for just over a year - it's something that I've wanted for a long time but I told myself to wait (I'm quite an indecisive person and, obviously, tattoos are permanent) and if I still wanted it after a full year I could get it. In a nutshell it's two people's faces looking at each other, done just in line-drawing. I don't have any tattoos yet, so this one would have been my first. I also don't know about ""tattoo etiquette"", or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my friend (we'll call her Rachel) about this tattoo as soon as I saw it. We've talked about it a few times. A few weeks ago I had a dream that I got it, but that it was on my thigh (not where I had originally planned) and it was placed a little differently from what I had seen - so one face was slightly higher up and was looking down at the other person.

&amp;#x200B;

Rachel knew this, and she also knew that I was not yet in a financial position to afford it, so I had to wait a little longer. I told her about this dream a week ago. She was very encouraging that I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got a text from her with a picture of a tattoo she got today. It was on her leg - two faces looking at each other, one slightly higher than the other, done in line-drawing. It's so similar to what I had shown her and told her about that at first I thought she was sending me it to ask ""is this what you're planning to get?"". Unfortunately, it turns out that she had got it done earlier today after she went to get a touch up on one of her other tattoos. She says that the woman who does her tattoos ""designed me another, and I just said fuck it let's do it"". I don't know much about tattoo consultations but that to me sounds like Rachel went in with an idea, explained what she wanted, had the artist draw it up for her and then got it done.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I feel like I can't get mine done anymore (I would have to make considerable adjustments though) but I do feel like she went behind my back a little bit. I feel like she purposefully didn't tell me that she was going to get it done so that I couldn't say anything about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need advice on is whether or not to say to her. She's my closest friend and I love her so much. I don't want to start an argument and, at the end of the day it's not like that thing's coming off of her. But I also feel like I'm going to be really bitter about this if I don't talk to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated.

My salary is secure - it's not to big for my country, but right now I make more money then many people do. I am on great terms with my coworkers and my bosses - we get along great, can chat about other stuff too outside of work. 

For a few months now I am developing an idea for a startup with couple of my friends, and we are really convinced this idea will be a success in our country.  Recently we found investors, and they are ready to invest a very very decent amount of money in this idea.

971,"Hi complete stranger, let me spill my feelings to you (cause we're basically besties right?)

So I have a wonderful best friend. She's compassionate, kind, smart, funny, lovely and I hold her to my highest respect. This is where the issue kicks in: I compare myself to her. I know, I know, I should admire her beauty without questioning my own blah blah, full of crap. But I do, and sometimes I imagine that she's not my friend and my life seems so much easier, but a little empty without her.

We both get exceptionally high grades. And we both want to go into the sciences for College next year (we're in our last year of highschool). We also want to take the enriched sciences (there's only one class) and we're both smart enough to get in. I really want to take that class but I know that I'm going to compare my intelligence to hers and I'm scared that that's going to ruin my college experience.

I'm tempted to go to  just take the regular science class (which is literally the same thing as enriched) Or go to a different college and take the enriched science course there. 

Another way I compare myself to her is beauty. We also went prom dress shopping today. She fit in every dress and looked beautiful. Me, on the other hand, could barely zip the bloody zipper. I cried and made an embarrassment out of myself. So ya that was fun. I also have bacne (literally looks like the acne of a pubescent boy on my back) and her back is perfectly clear. Did I compare my beauty to hers? Kind of a rhetorical question.  Did I feel like shit? Like manure. 

You thought I was done? This is free therapy. I used to like this guy for 4 years (kind of verging on love here) and he didn't like me back. He's in love with my friend and has been since kindergarten. You can't even imagine how much this hurt me. Too long... Then I realized he's fucking ugly. But that doesn't take away from the fact that every guy is in love with her. And I, on the other hand, have never been asked out.

Do I need therapy? Yes. Can I afford it? You're funny. Do I use (horrible) humour to distract from my sadness? Occasionally. 

But I realize that this is eating away at my confidence. Sometimes I think it's better if I stop being her friend.  Should I take the enriched science class even though my friend will be in the same class as me?  I don't want to ruin such an important relationship over my being a mess. But I really contemplate ditching her and going to sunny Mexico. I'd never actually do it, but I might be happier.",03Mar2020,1

977,"Today I was offered a new job that I had applied and interviewed for several weeks ago. This position represents a decent pay bump and room for growth in the company. I accepted it but part of me is having doubts.

The reason I was looking for a new job in the first place was because despite being at my current job for nearly 3 years, I haven't gotten a raise and when I asked for one I was told that the company doesn't give raises.

Now obviously that's why moving on should be a good thing right? But I can't help but feel hesitant about this new job. My current position is comfortable, easy (I mean I get to spend a lot of time on Reddit for cryin out loud), and the schedule is pretty flexible (like if I have appointments or errands to run all I have to do is text my boss and they're ok with it and I just make up my time as I see fit). So what I'm wrestling with is debating whether or not higher pay and better benefits is worth having to do more work, with a more rigid schedule, with much more supervision or is having lower pay and virtually no advancement opportunities worth it by having less stress and more freedom.

I have recently purchased some jewelry for my wife for her birthday. This purchase was kind of expensive but she definitely deserves it. We have been together for several years and she adamantly refuses to get nice things for herself due to an abusive/poor childhood. She has very low self esteem and thinks that she does not deserve nice things, it is an issue that has gotten better over the years but is still there.

I gave the jewelry to her and told her that I got a really good deal on it because it had ""impurities"" in the diamonds and the bracelet. Let's say I told her it was only a couple hundred dollars, with the actual price being a little over $1,000. 

I only do this because a few years back she lost her wedding band and literally cried herself to sleep several nights over it. I bought her a new one of equal value and when she learned of it's cost she made me return it, threatening to sell it herself if I did not. She now wears one of those cheap silicone bands, which I don't have a problem with but I was fine buying a replacement one. 

We are in no sort of financial distress and the purchase will not hurt us at all. I financed it and only put a couple hundred down (what I told her was the full price) and am currently planning on paying it off in full over 90 days.

That sucked really bad cause I've had a crush or 2 before, but this felt different. It felt like I couldn't live without her, since I started missing her the second we went home. I genuinely think that if we were closer to each other we might've become a thing. 

So the reason I'm feeling like an asshole is the following. After she rejected me my heart broke into a million pieces, I didnt know what to do to get the feeling to stop. So I decided to distract myself, I met another girl (M) that I thought I had a crush on, I kinda liked her and stuff , but it didnt feel the same as with P. I was trying to get her attention and stuff till I realized that it wasn't working. I gave up at that moment.

A week ago a friend of my friend's gf (A) added me on snapchat. We started talking and she was really nice. She started making jokes about missing me in her bed and stuff. I ofcourse made them back. But I'm pretty sure she caught feelings for me and she wants to hang out and stuff and I said yes. The thing is tho, I've been thinking and I realized that I didnt really have a crush on M and that I dont really have the right feelings for A.

I’ll try to keep this short.

I have been going to therapy since I turned 12. The basis around going is to do with anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies.

I have been to 3 private therapist for a couple years before being moved to camhs. Overall these years, I still think my mental health is shit. I get told he same things all the time. “Just breathe and focus on something else.” And it’s just a waste of an hour a week to be told the same thing.

A month or so ago I told my camhs therapist that I was a discharge session. She called in my dad, and he said he wants me to keep going as he thinks more progress can be done, but he understands I’m 17 and old enough to make my own choices.

They are making me feel completely worse and not understanding my points I’m trying to get across. 

I told my therapist that I want to continue speaking with my parents as our parent-kid therapy sessions have been helping. My parents don’t think that is good enough and blame everything on me and me wanting to quit therapy.

I’ve been trying so hard to forget about her but I keep having dreams of her and thinking about her when I’m not doing anything more than I ever did when we were friends. Last thing is our personality were polar opposite. I was very outgoing, honest, bold, I was not very sensitive, I was very opened. which made me look like a bitch a lot of times and tbh I can be such a bitch. She on the other hand was very shy, converse and overly sensitive. I’d say something, she’s be offend by it and mind you im just being blunt and it had no connotation.

  I’m currently volunteering in the US for Americorps NCCC, which is a 10-month volunteer commitment where teams of people travel around the US living and working together. 

  Starting off, I only found a few people on my team that I was friends with but unfortunately my closest friend, (my roommate and the only other guy on my team) was dismissed from the program after he gave me a concussion when we were arguing. 

   I find myself with no one on my team to really talk to as the other 4 have jokes, conversations and personalities that don’t really reflect mine. Along with that, I figured out that 1 of them, who used to be my second closest friend, has flaked out on me several times and has stopped talking to me because of her major fear of “missing out”. 

  Now, with only 2 1/2 months left in the program I have found myself frustrated, angry and sad at both work and home everyday. I plan to finish the program but feel as though I am simply surviving each day rather than living it.

1002,"Hi, this is probably going to be longish so my apologies in advance. 

I’m from the UK, and my friend 20(F) recently opened up to me about how her parents are forcing her to marry a man in Afghanistan. He’s going to move here this year through her British citizenship, in order to legally marry her. 

Her parents manipulated her last year and told her they’d take her on a “holiday” to Afghanistan, where they turned on her and instead forced her to have an Islamic marriage with him there. An Islamic marriage involves signing certain papers with witnesses etc, so in her parents’/the community’s eyes, she’s now married to him. 

Whilst she was in Afghanistan, the man basically locked her in a room and wouldn’t let her out, explaining she was to wed him no matter what, forcing her to agree. He left bruises on her arms from grabbing her and she resorted to throwing a chair at him to escape the room. He’s very abusive and toxic and not a nice person, so she’s really scared of him coming here, no matter what the outcome of their marriage. 

She dropped out of her first year of university (studying law) last year, as she hated the university and wanted to transfer, and also was dealing with depression etc from the situation. As of now, she’s working two jobs, which she finds highly stressful, and is trying to get into a different uni this September. If she doesn’t get in this year, her parents said she’ll just have to stay at home not working and be this man’s housewife. 

Her parents are extremely toxic, they’re always putting her down for dropping out and her father even wished death upon her. She’s had a suicide attempt and overdosed, at which her parents simply laughed and called her pathetic. She has two younger siblings, one 19(F) and a brother quite a few years younger, neither of which understand. Her sister takes her parents side, so my friend has been feeling very depressed and alone. 

She pays for everything herself, her phone bill, her food etc, despite living with her parents, and even then they force her to take money out of her bank account to pay them for God knows what. I only know one of the reasons they force her to give money is to aid her “husband” to move to the country. 

She only has a year before he moves here and they get legally married. I told her that no matter WHAT, even if it gets to the point where she’s legally married, she will always have the choice to get a divorce, and for parents like hers, sometimes it just takes that long and that drastic of a measure for them to realise they were wrong the whole time. 

I also told her to simply focus on obtaining her degree for now, as that will give her far more autonomy, and allow her to get a good job and make a living to move out and have her own life (she currently lives with her parents.) We agreed that if she focuses on her degree, she can gain some independence to make her own decisions. 

I’ve talked for hours about this with her, her parents have had this plan since she was as young as 15, and she rejected it her whole teen years until this year, when it started to get very real, and she finally accepted defeat. No matter what I said, she was completely defeated, she had no more fight in her and is starting to accept this as her future. 

It sucks that divorce may be the only option left as a last resort, as she doesn’t want to be a 20 year old divorcee, partly because of what people would think or say (in her community. Which, I reminded her, wouldn’t matter once she’s independent and left this life behind), and also because that’s just a very depressing and mentally exhausting thing to go through. Divorce takes a lot, and she’d be doing it alone without her family’s support at such a young age, and with what money?? Also her family will disown her she said, but we both agreed that would be for the best anyway, as tough as it may be. 

She has sort of accepted that divorce will happen but I don’t even want her to accept the marriage, what if she just decides to stay in the marriage because of the hassle of divorce? I’m scared she’s just going to settle, like she is right now. She should not have to settle and marry someone against her own will just to get a divorce. 

I really need dire advice, legal or anything between, I don’t care. I’ve given her all the advice I can but she’s tried everything. Her friend is a lawyer and she looked up Afghanistan’s laws etc, but there’s no way out of it. 

Someone please tell me how I could help stop this forced marriage from happening, no one deserves this.",03Mar2020,1

1017,"My best friend is 27 and has been suffering from olfactory hallucinations. 

He thinks sweat from his feet is producing an odor. He has been obsessed with it for years. These delusions first started when he was around 14, according to him.
Nobody can smell it (not even himself), which is a pretty big clue to me that it’s a mental illness.

He has had many “cures” over the years from his self-analysis of the “cause”. They never work so he gives up his ritual for something else. Examples include: Hour-long footbaths/pedicure every night, tons of different special socks, random chemical skin creams that he finds from strange places on eBay, special diets (no cheese, no milk), exclusively wears shorts and sandals to avoid sweating, etc. 

Most recently, he discovered the hack on YouTube named “The Gut War” (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvaHSNpVV4lUcQcughM5StQ), who attributes these symptoms to an extremely rare disease called TMAU, basically saying the gut biome is responsible for producing these odors that only some people can smell. 

So my friend has been following his advice religiously and talking to him in his Discord channel. His advice is basically to drink a bunch of kefir, which just spawned a new “ritual” which has been going on for months now. My friend has been spending tons of money on kefir, bought kefir stocks, started making his own kefir, and chugs 1+ huge bottle of kefir a day. This actually ended up with him getting high cholesterol at his annual check up.

My theory: I’ve done hours of research and think he has Olfactory Reference Syndrome (ORS, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_reference_syndrome). It is also more common in Japan and Korean cultures, and my best friend is Korean. He also suffered childhood trauma of losing a parent, and trauma is a common theme in developing this disorder from my research. I’ve found many case studies that talk about people with almost exact symptoms, and they were treated with medication and were able to live more functioning lives. 

Furthermore, I found academic articles of instances of people who believed they had TMAU,  but actually diagnosed with ORS. In this study, only 2 of 54 individuals who thought they had TMAU actually had it. The rest were people who had delusional odors. (Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720598)

His reasons as to why he thinks he smells also lines up with ORS symptoms. Lots of small things trigger it that just seem like paranoia or anxiety. When he was a kid, he said a girl moved her desk away from him, so he thought his feet stank somehow. He tells me stories of people “sniffling” near him, or scratching their nose, and he blames it on himself being stinky. He calls these “reactions”. The most recent reaction was when he went to sit in a meeting, and after he sat down his coworker started sniffling. Despite it being allergy season and humans being allowed to touch their nose or breath, he ignored all of my logic and just said it’s because he stinks.

I hate seeing him like this, and frankly, I’m exhausted dealing with it. I’ve been adamant there is no odor, and supportive of his other “cures”, but this is getting out of hand and I’m genuinely concerned for his mental health. He refuses to accept to go to a psychiatrist with me (every time he says “let me just do X cure for Y more months, it’s going to work!”, and basically shuts out all logic I’m telling him. He gets insulted when I say he has a mental disorder (“You think I’m crazy huh?”) and incredibly defensive when I’m just trying to help.

I’m sorry for the long winded post, but does anyone have experience treating ORS or talking to a psych about it? I have no idea how to get him to go with me, and he’s just going to end up living in hell for his whole life because he doesn’t want to take medication. 

I’ve also went on the Discord channel of “The Gut War” with the same articles, asking if anyone has had experience or gone to a psych to check it out. The dude just ended up arguing with me and deleting all my posts, and also got extremely defensive claiming I’m calling people crazy (never used the word). It is extremely cultish/hivemind and brainwashing poor folk who need professional help with harmful broscience, and I’m wondering if there is anything legal I can do about that as well.

Thank you if you read through this, and I appreciate any advice that comes my way. I just want to get my friend some help.",03Mar2020,1

        my parents, well more of my mom, seems to literally only care about school. and the school roped my dad into actually caring instead of focusing on his beer by emailing him as well. whenever i feel like i have a sliver of somewhat fun, my mom just has to ruin everything and bring up school. i just want to learn from my dad and be a mechanic. i love cars and i can even learn a lot from vocational at my high school, i think i have to be somewhat passing my classes to go to vocational but i cant seem to bring myself up to talk about what i want to do in life with my parents. when my mom gets angry she tries to guilt trip everyone. she plays her little game of "" i am now the victim in this victimless arguement look what you did you useless piece of shit"" 

        i dont really know what to do as of right now. this was kinda a rant but also asking for advice. life is a bit of a mess if you couldnt tell.

ps. also sorry for the formatting and shit im on my phone.",03Mar2020,1
1026,"Throwaway, because part of me is still hiding from life.

Reddit I need your help although I don't deserve it. Last year I did something awful. I committed fraud against my employer. Small family business that grew to be an international business that always maintained the family owned feel. The fraud took place over several different transactions over a period of a few months, so this wasn't just one bad desperate day. Financial stress. That's it. Who here has never experienced this? Who here didn't resort to theft? Yeah, I thought so.

I just adore the owners and employees (ex best friends). I was charged, sentenced to not enough days in jail, and am now carrying on for the most part. The level of betrayal I just cannot explain.

Personally and emotionally I am forever changed. It's been a year now and it feels like yesterday. My therapist tells me it's time to move forward, and I guess she just isn't helping me do that, so who best to ask for help from but Reddit.

I am from a smaller area (made the major local paper) so I have a hard time leaving the house without suffering panic attacks. I received a ton of messages around the time the article came out from friends and ex co-workers who wanted to send positive messages. I reread those from time to time. My family, husband, and teenage son have been amazing. If not for all of that I don't know where I would be right now.

All of this aside, I just can't even begin to forgive myself and truly work on the version of me who stooped so low. I never, ever, want to meet that person again. 

I am looking for personal experiences, book suggestions, online articles, ANYTHING that can help me. I still have nightmares almost ever night where I relive everything. I think about the family and my old friends who I hurt and let down. My husband does all of the grocery shopping because I panic at the thought of running into someone I know (99% chance here). I'm ashamed, embarrassed, grieving over the loss of people I love, scared to face people I haven't seen yet, anxious, depressed, scared, and just flat out sad. 

Has anyone ever had to work on self forgiveness and they can recommend some good reading or suggestions? 

Thanks friends.

1028,"Although I have friends at college, the only ones that I used to spend all my time there with was with some of my classmates, who are friends of my ex boyfriend, who I'm trying to avoid contact with because of some personal reasons. He was toxic, uncontrollable and crazy. I didn’t tell them the reason why I broke up with him because I respect their friendship and I don’t want to ruin our too. 
My classes started now and, as I decided to stay away from my ex I would consequently stay away from my friends too (we used to hang out together). So I told one of them that I was sorry but that I need to stay away from him and he simply replied with some pictures of an anime girl, pretending like I said nothing important to him. 
I know that he talks pretty much with my ex but, as he said nothing to me I’m stating to think that maybe it’s ok to him if I stay away? He didn’t even said something like “Don’t worry, I’ll be seeing you”. Not even that.
Today we got back to college and my friend didn’t even try to see me and any of the other ones did too.

1030,"Hi, I was hoping to get some advice. I met my best friend online about a year ago and we became super close over time. Everything was great for a while, we never argued. She was really my only close friend.

However, in the last few months, my depression and low self-esteem have been at an all time high. I didn't realize it until she decided to cut me off, but I started picking fights over small insignificant things. We probably argued every 2 weeks for 3 months, and I think every single argument was started by me and was about something that didn't matter. It felt good to release my anger, but I didn't realize the effect it was having on our relationship and how unfair it was. 

She did bring up these concerns to me and I promised to work on it. &amp; I would focus on doing better for a few days. Slowly though, I stopped focusing on it as we mended our relationship and the cycle started again. I basically cried wolf so many times that she can no longer believe me when I say I'll work on my problems. 

She no longer wants to be friends. This finally made me realize how serious the issue is. I went back and analyzed the chat logs of all our fights and saw how stubborn and hostile I was. 

I'd like advice on how to prove to her that I'm serious about treating her better but also how I can learn to treat everyone better. So far, I've made an appointment with a therapist and a psychiatrist but they are almost a month out. I've been reading a book on CBT/depression and I think it's helped me find some tools to deal with my depression in the mean time. I've made a sincere apology to her and waited a week but it doesn't seem like she is ready to give me another chance yet. I valued our friendship a lot and I really don't want to lose her and I'm scared she may never give me another chance.",03Mar2020,1

1032,"Im in highschool rn and I happen to be in an advance program called IB (International Bacalleurete). I hanged out with a group of friends in this program and happen to meet this girl who was in my class. At first I had no feelings for her, but as time when on and we were now in grade 11 I developed feelings for her. Initially, I thought my crush for her would eventually fade away, but it's been 7 months and I still have feelings for her. She has a fckn great personality and is pretty cute, but I don't want to be in a relationship with her or have feelings for her for the following reasons: 
- I did not want her and myself to also be occupied in a relationship while we were both in a program designed to act like college.
- I was way dumber than she was and did not want to drag her down since I know she has multuple clubs she attends to
- I was afraid this would make our friendship awkward 
I tried to ignore her from time to time to get rid of this feeling, but it only got worse when I started to get jealous of other people being around her especially guys who make her laugh. Everytime i felt jealous for a girl whom i was not even in a relationship with I thought ""wtf is wrong with me"" , but I couldn't help myself for having these feelings for her. Even when I'm alone by myself I constantly think about her. I don't know what to do, should I confess to her or should I just wait until my feelings for her fade away.",03Mar2020,1

1039,"If you're interested in the finer details of my uniquely damaging past, feel free to look through my post history, I've talked about it extensively. To sum it all up, I was loosely home schooled from 7th grade onward. I'm 20 and still completely under my (very controlling) dad's rule because I've had no opportunities to get my license/GED/anything else normal and live in a small town with no friends or other relatives to help me. So, anything I need or want to do has to be done on my own.

I very much want to get a job. Even something part time at a fast food joint will be fantastic because I will no longer be in the house for months at a time, and also money would be nice. There are so many hurdles to even apply, however, that the mere thought jumpstarts my anxiety. For one thing, my dad is very likely to be pissed that I'm even trying to get a job. He prefers me to be around the house so he knows where I am and am available at a moment's notice whenever he needs help with this or that. So it's a catch twenty-two where I need help (because I'm absolutely clueless, may need a bank account, etc) but if I ask him, I risk pissing him off, and if I don't ask him and do it alone and tell him later, that'll *definitely* piss him off. Then there's the simple fact that I haven't left the house regularly and been around non-relatives daily since I left public school at age twelve almost eight years ago. I have pretty severe social anxiety as well as absolutely zero confidence. I've been trying to get out more (which is extremely difficult in a small town with no money and walking as your own transportation) but almost every social encounter leaves me kicking myself and fixating over any perceived awkwardness for weeks. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm tired of feeling like I'm doing something wrong by wanting something 95% of people my age already have. Any advice to help with my fear/anxiety and get more confident with looking for work will be greatly appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
1040,"I've worked at a pink phone carrier for about a year now. I love the job and would hate to leave it. 

I also work at a large yearly event where I help run an accessibility program for patrons with disabilities. We basically make sure that people with disabilities are able to enjoy the event as much as possible and with as few obstacles as possible. 

Personally the event holds a special place in my heart. This will be my 11th year in attendance. Getting paid to help others enjoy the event is like the most amazing gig you could imagine. Not only am I helping people, but I get to do it at my favorite place on earth. 

For 2020 I was offered a management position at the event. A job I've been chasing for 4 years. I immediately asked my manager for  time off and she approved it. It was approved by the manager who hired me and the HR rep that interviewed me. 

I was recently transferred to a new store/location and the new manager is suddenly acting like those days off would be impossible to approve.

I'm thinking of handing down an ultimatum. Approve the time off or I'll give you a notice that ends when the time off I need starts. It costs them tens of thousands of dollars to hire and train a new employee so I feel like she would give in. 

But Reddit maybe there is a better way? I love both jobs but no matter what I will not miss the event. Any ideas on how to approach the manager without giving her the ultimatum?

part of me says 
she should be able to invite whoever the fuck she wants 
the other part of me says, she knowingly tried to start drama. (this person had it out for me) 
so weeks go by with no confrontation, but she’s all over social media, i’m trailer trash, i’m this and that and i literally don’t say a fuckin thing. not worth it. 
i tried grey rocking her because i didn’t want her to know more about me. (considering she communicates with someone i don’t trust) 
so confrontation happens. 
i bring up the belittling comments, i bring up her stepping on my neck. 
SHE GOES “i’m bipolar i know i’m a bitch but i won’t get respect any other way, i don’t have medicine to control it” so i said “i’m also bipolar and i don’t harsh on anyone in this house” and she says “you just have more control than me” now i know it was unfair to compare mental status’ but what the fuck was i supposed to say to that? “i’m sorry”? ...”all is forgiven”

1051,"Ok yes I am the “crazy” girl who’s been posting excessively about this “fwb” (not even sure if we are that anymore) for the past days. Hopefully this is the last post I make before I really sit down and talk with him in depth about what’s happening between us! Thanks for bearing with me, everyone! 

To summarize, this guy and I have met 11 days ago off Tinder and been seeing each other ever since. We have met 4 times so far. 3 of those times (including the day we first met) were spent at his place — averaging 8 hours each day full of sex, Netflix, tons of cuddling, laughing/joking, eating food, etc. On the second date, he brought up he was open to more (but that we were both casual for now). On the third date, we both mentioned we weren’t seeing other people. 

The fourth time, last night, he invited me to watch his hockey game, joined by two of his brothers (30/m and 25/m). 

I knew his brothers were coming, and I was really unsure how he’d be acting in front of them. To spare myself of possible hurt, I told myself ahead of time that he would treat me as a buddy (“friends” with benefits) in front of them. 

I got there ahead of time and noticed a guy who resembled him was looking at me in a certain, intentional way with a slight smile. (I found out later that was his younger brother, &amp; he had told him “someone” would be coming to the hockey game). 

Later, the guy showed up with his older brother. He walked up to me and gave me a kiss. After the game, his brothers, him and I were all just hanging out at the hockey rink. Throughout the entire time, he was showing me tons of physical affection both in a sweet and naughty way in front of his brothers and also other hockey teammates passing by — kisses, putting hand around my shoulder, back rubs, hand on waist, squeezing ass, neck massage, a subtle boob squeeze underneath my jacket, and holding hands; he couldn’t keep his hands off of me. His brothers didn’t seem to blink an eye / they were very nonchalant about it. 

He initiated making plans for all of us to go to an amusement park next weekend (joined by the brothers’ wives), as well as going to a real hockey game together. 

The next time I’m going to see him is this Friday evening at his place. 

The only thing that possibly concerns me a bit is that this guy is a singer based in LA — he has a social media presence and that makes me insecure, especially when a lot of women follow him, etc. 

Also idk if this is worth mentioning, but his last relationship of 2.5 years ended 3 years ago when his ex-girlfriend cheated on him — with a woman. I can tell that scarred him. We don’t talk much about our past but that is one thing I do know. He hasn’t been in a relationship ever since. For me, I broke up with my exbf of 1 year (international long distance) only 2 weeks ago. Yes, I only met this guy 1 week after I broke up with my ex. I know, I know... ok well now all the cards are on the table! 

TLDR: Sorry if I sound thick, but what the heck is going on? Does he seem to want a relationship? Are we more than casually dating? I plan on talking to him more seriously this Friday when I see him for the 5th time, but in the meantime any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. And again, hopefully this is my last post.
