0,"So I have a new problem relating to my earlier post about my selfish cunt of an uncle.  


If you've already read the story, you can skip to the hyphens.  If you haven't, you can keep reading for the short version or you can read the whole dumpsterfire, in its entirety, here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/j9eh07/my_family_is_fucked_and_i_need_some_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share, 


Basically my estranged 70-year-old uncle has recently come back into our family's lives after telling us of his decision to divorce his wife of 30 years (she's an asshole, so we are glad).  


All was well and we were happy to have him back until about 1.5 years ago when he tells us he has a son.  A newborn son.  He accomplished this by getting a surrogate in a foreign country (because our country told him he's too fucking old!).  He previously had an adopted daughter (his wife's sister's child), but they abandoned her when she showed signs of mental illness in her teens.


About 10 months ago, he also decides that his niece or one of his nephews (my two brothers, my two cousins or me) should adopt the child in the unlikely event he were to ""... get into a car accident."" (His words).  We've all said no for now, but added if there were any chance of one of us adopting the child, he would have to move to our rural area (where the rest of us live) so we could get to know the child.  He won't move because he's looking for a wife/girlfriend/vagina in the big city.  So there's that.


--------


So now he's coming to family gatherings like everything is just fine, and the rest of my family, appears (to me) to be acting as if nothing is amiss.  I find this absolutely insane and have found myself questioning if I am the crazy one.


He was over for Thanksgiving 2 weeks ago.  It was just my parents, my Mum's parents, me and SC and his baby.  (We are in a rural area that has had &lt;20 cases total since March and SC has no friends in his city, so the risk of COVID-19 spread was low, although I did try to use that as an excuse of why he shouldn't be there.) 


I had a very hard time being civil to this human after all that has happened, and it was extremely noticable to both my parents and grandparents.


So my parents have basically told me that if I can't be polite to SC, than I shouldn't be around for the holidays (aka Christmas, aka Saturnalia).  


Now, I understand that I am not great at hiding my emotions and my parents don't want to have to stress over the holidays about their ill-tempered daughter snapping on my father's brother.  I agree it's not fair to put that stress on them.  Normally I wouldn't be bothered all that much, and would probably go bundle up and go camping or something, but my brother recently got married to a foreign woman (who is just fantastic), and this will be her first Christmas in Canada so I really want to be there.


So I need some more advice.  What should I do?  Does anyone have a secret technique for tolerating a complete chicken-fucker of a human?  Or should I just go off into the wilderness with my dogs for a week or so?  Or is there another solution I'm not seeing?  I just don't know what to do.  I'd be grateful for any sincere advice I could get.",29Oct2020,1
1,"So my(22) car has finally taken the final dump on me. The other night the control arm broke and messed up the axle too. My car is 14 years old and 235K miles on it. Its in rough shape. My mom technically owns it and decided that she'd rather get a newer reliable vehicle with value instead of dumping more money into it.

3,"I shave and my skin look normal and lighter and radiant during the shave but when Iv finished my skin looks really browned is this normal? And it looks very dull and my face also goes puffy/rounder idk why. I‚Äôm not talking the shave area I‚Äôm talking the whole face. Sometimes It feels tight on my cheeks and smarting too sometimes and my lip on one side swellls up too
This happened everytime. During the shave my skin is moist and I look fine but after as I said it looks very dull and bloated looking. I don‚Äôt use aftershave will that help?
I use shave gel and new Gillette Mach3 or fusion blades every time. I take my time with it also

Edit: or is this hyperpigmentation?

4,"I‚Äôm starting to think my manager hates me. For context, i work at a seasonal halloween store. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I‚Äôve worked there since the start of the season. I helped with set up (and I was the only person to show up at 9am every day until the store was set up), and have worked every shift I have been scheduled for. No call outs or anything. 

I would often open with her at the start, but now I only open with her once a week. Im a really shy person so opening with her was usually awkward. We never really started a conversation with each other, and when I would attempt to she didn‚Äôt seem interested. 

It was only last week when I started to feel like she hates me. She texted me asking if I would drive an hour away to cover a shift at another store. That was my only day off that week and since I use my boyfriend‚Äôs car I wasn‚Äôt able to go an hour away. I told her that im sorry but I couldn‚Äôt take the shift. 

After that, her attitude completely changed. She barely acknowledges me now, and when she does it looks like she‚Äôs glaring at me from underneath her mask. 

Last week, I texted her asking for a few days off before I noticed her attitude changed. She did not respond. On Monday, I texted her again. She was scheduled at 8:30am (the usual time to be scheduled if you open as the store opens at 9am). No one else was scheduled at 8:30am, but I was scheduled at 9am. Its a company policy that two employees must be in the store at all times, so I was worried I was supposed to come in at 8:30am. She has made this mistake before, and had to ask me to come in at 8:30am instead of 9am. I texted her just to check in and see if the schedule was correct. The text was ‚ÄúHey, just checking if i need to come in at 8:30am or 9:00am tomorrow‚Äù. 

She did not answer this message. 

That day I went in at my scheduled time, and she did not acknowledge me, even though she let me into the store and I said good morning. Her sister was there to open with her, and her sister was not scheduled. 

This week I have had to work everyday at 8:30am and 2 of those days I opened with her. She has given me the hardest tasks of the day, and I always finish sooner than she expects. I also always do a good job, she has said it was a good job. 

I have no idea what I could have done to make her hate me. When she ignores me and glares at me, it makes me feel like she dislikes me. I dont know if maybe i‚Äôm being too analytical, or being dramatic but I really feel like she doesn‚Äôt like me. 

I cannot think of any reason why she wouldn‚Äôt like me. I do everything she asks me to plus more. I get good donations, and give good customer service. I really don‚Äôt know what I could have done for her to suddenly hate me. 

How do I tell if she actually hates me, or if I‚Äôm just being dramatic?


TL;DR: my manager started to give me dirty looks and ignores me in person and over text, how do i tell if she actually hates me or if im being dramatic?",29Oct2020,1
5,"I suppose story isn't important, it's all my fault. For reference, I'm 18 and have just entered uni.

What to do and how to cope? Chances of getting my money back are low, even though I filled out police report and scammers are from my country (not US or Europe btw). Money aren't even my own, my parents saved them up, so there's additional guilt from that. It doesn't possess immediate threat of me going homeless or starving, but the pressure is huge.",29Oct2020,1
6,"So i'm crushing pretty hard on my boss and, as a guy, i feel like i may be misreading ""the signals"" because i'm pretty sure she likes me too, but everytime i bring up the topic she denies all allegations, claiming that ""she has no interest in anyone she works with""   


now i never see signals when they're being given, but her body language and her actions around me scream out that she's into me, even another work colleague has said that they're jealous of the way she looks at me sometimes (doting, turned on, impressed etc.)   


i always chat to her online after our shifts together and she's always laughing at my dumb jokes and everything. But she gets weird when i try to ask about personal life or about hanging out outside of work (just the two of us), saying she want to maintain a professional working relationship with everyone she works with and nothing more (which is a lie), so i have no idea, there are a few other mutual work colleagues who keep encouraging my pursuit and they also share my belief of her interest in me.  


anyway, we have this halloween party for just our small team from our area in the warehouse, and she's hosting it at her house, this will be the first time we've socialised outside of work in person, should i try my look and push myself forward? or ?",29Oct2020,1
7,"I (25f) have a sister (22f) who I have had an estranged relationship with for over 5 years. She initiated the estrangement by just completely ignoring me one day. I went crazy at first, tried desperately to find out why she was treating me like this. I kept initiating contact, and gradually found out that she just simply hated my personality.

I felt really bad and tried so hard to work on the qualities she said that she hated, hoping that she will like me after I improve, but I think she just hates my guts and no amount of self-improvement I make will change her mind. My family has been of no help. They always excuse her as just being young, tell me I'm too sensitive, and don't understand any of the emotional pain because she is perfectly pleasant to them. And my sister goes out in the world and is super nice and smiling to her friends, coworkers, etc. It just kills me that I can't get an ounce of her kindness, when I'm her only sibling and spent a childhood together. It makes me so angry that everyone else in the world probably thinks she's a wonderful person when she has been a strong contributing factor to my depression.

I still live in the same house as her, and can't afford to get my own place. It's been 5 years since the estrangement and I still ruminate about her every day. What disturbs me is the extremely dismissive way she continues to treat me. We rarely talk, but on the cases I have to, she speaks to me so coldly. It might sound like nothing, but it truly makes me feel utterly worthless being treated like this for many years, while seeing her act the complete opposite to everyone else. I really don't know what I did to deserve this treatment and I don't know how to stop ruminating about her. I know she's not thinking about me, and the intrusive thoughts about her is a big reason for my depression.

How do I live in the same house as her and not be emotionally hurt at all the reminders of her? How do I stop feeling so indignant at the unfairness of how she acts like a nice person to others but treats me like dirt behind closed doors?",29Oct2020,1
8,"We‚Äôve been talking and really hitting it off. No issues at all and its been bliss, until last night. We talk every night and have no problem asking questions and talking about the big issues (marriage, kids, relocation, where we see ourselves etc)

Last night we‚Äôre talking and out the blue she asks ‚Äúdo you have a type...like a body type...like i.e. big boobs, butt?‚Äù I was caught off guard and naturally shocked she asked that. I don‚Äôt really have a type in that sense (though I do like a curvaceous woman...nice hips butt nice legs etc) so I basically told her whats inside matters most to me but yeah of course I have to be attracted to her. To make a long story short...I think she asked because she has small breasts, and she was trying to indirectly bring it up. I‚Äôve seen pics (only pics, haven‚Äôt met in person yet) and I see she has smaller breasts but I don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm still attracted to her and its not an issue for me at all. I have not seen a full picture of like her butt and lower half (I have seen a full pic of her facing forward but you can‚Äôt really see much because of what she‚Äôs wearing.

Her asking me that bothered me. I‚Äôve been in a relationship where she had major body issues and it really affected the relationship. Also I‚Äôve dealt with a date who wasn‚Äôt honest about their pics and didn‚Äôt look like their pics. So I‚Äôm wondering if one of those scenarios is happening now. How should I go about bringing this back up? I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings but I don‚Äôt want to take it too far if shes purposefully not showing herself because she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be attracted to her.

11,"So, as the title says:

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years, and we recently moved to Philly from the Bay area as of September. We relocated because covid, and my grandmother having cancer. It was a good opportunity as more and more people are working remotely and I had some slight flexibility. She also saw work prospects that we figured would pan out. I make a reasonably high amount of money for my age so I can support us.

So, onto the actual issue. I work in tech as a Network IT and my work is wanting me to return in late December(ish), which isn't going to happen since 99% of the company is remote. I've done more for this company in a year than most have, I'd say. Including a 23 hour long shift to meet an unreasonable deadline. I've asked for a raise, reasonably so since I've been there over a year, and I was met with ""Don't worry about it"" and no changes in pay. Basically, I feel they're being unreasonable since our work hasn't been impacted by covid at all. However, I do want to be making more and I'm aware with my skillset, I could be making what I'd like (around 75k/yr)

My girlfriend hasn't been able to find a job here in Philly for her field, and I dont expect she would in this short of a time span but she thinks she should be at least receiving calls back. So we've agreed, that maybe we should look into moving back on January 1st so I can seek a job there while holding onto my employment or if we both get job offers, to settle here and just live as comfortably as possible since we'd both be making fairly decent money. Only issue is that it's a brickwall for my career, and I have no hopes of making more than $65k/yr.

So I guess my question is, would it be unreasonable to move back if we both can't find an offer before January? Would it be safer to just wait it out here since our cost of living is literally cut in half? I feel really uncertain and anxious about moving across the country twice within a 4 month span but I know I'm only starting on the low end of my salary there with huge promise of growth. Versus here in Philly, I don't think I'll get opportunities like that. I feel unsure.

**TL;DR:** Moved to Philly from west coast because grandma has cancer. Doubt I'll have same job prospects and GF is struggling to find work. Do we stay or do we go back?",29Oct2020,1

I (17m) can never complete an assignment on time ! At first I thought it was procrastination but even when I organize my time well and start much in advance, I overthink and get nothing done.

14," Just looking for advice or similar circumstances as the advice subreddit I follow on here says I don't have enough karma yet. 
If this is the wrong place to ask please let me know.
It's kind of complicated and if it's too long I'm sorry. I (M26) got kicked out of my house when I was 16 years old and my stuff was sold before I got back to it. I was okay with it though because I had a job  and finally left the abuse.  I worked for 8 years before developing a drug addiction and getting married. I'm in sober living now doing okay, trying to stay okay also. The drug abuse led me to getting brain damage and a heart problem which I now have to take medications everyday for to be normal. But I guess that's the hand you get dealt when you get greedy with your serotonin. My wife and I broke up within the last year so I left the house and almost all my belongings to her. I felt she deserved it anyway because her stuff got taken before by her ex, I felt she deserved one normal break up and also she helped me get through a really tough time in my life when all my medical stuff happened. My name is still on her electric also. My doctors(and family) tell me I shouldn't work and go on disability but I can't take that chance because I need to work. I used the last of my money to buy a car and even traded a lot of my stuff for it to break down last month after only having it for one and a half months. I guess in my state it's not illegal to sell a car without a catalytic converter, exhaust and the whole bottom rotted out and breaks beyond repair. I was really upset because I've been living in in a vehicle for the past five months. I even traded him my Kia that had some minor problems because he led me to believe this one didn't have and I thought I knew him enough to trust him. That was last month.  Now I live 15 miles out of a town and ride my bike 20 miles to and 20 miles back from work everyday. It's winter now and it's been raining cold and flurries. The girl that let me stay with her just a month ago was very nice at first but I got sick and now got let go of my job because I had to take two days off of work due to a fever. Even though I wasn't allowed to work if I wanted to. She was a type of person offer me every day for a ride and I felt bad in the one day I did she was a type of person offer me every day for a ride and I felt bad in the one day I did ask her if she got mad and asked why I didn't have any credit. There's no buses around here nor jobs even closer than the last and I have no idea how to escape this. I hitchhiked across country before but not in the winter and not before I had medical problems. I don't have any family that would help me because they believe everybody should help themselves. Almost everybody I know still lives with their parents due to really low pay across the state or the parents wanting them there. It makes me feel very lonely and let down when it used to make me feel so strong. I'm mad I got cheated out of my car because I don't like liars, he knew my situation. I have no idea what to do and I understand why people think sometimes there's no way up anymore. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? My mom won't even message me to say hi or just listen to me about my problems. So there's really no where else I can go to talk about this. I'd like to see here if somebody got out better. Any advice helps as theres no homeless shelter here and i believe this one mess up is me leaving. Thank you",29Oct2020,1
15,"I've already made two seperate posts and I felt satisfied, but that lasted only for the rest of the day and now I feel like I'm going back and forward between sadness or regret and satisfaction. Earlier I felt like I was not into anime as I was a while ago and regretted buying a figure based on a character and books, but now I feel fine and don't regret it all. I've had the same feeling for a couple days now just basically in this same cycle and don't know how to fix it or how to decide if I still want them.

I've also been regretting buying a lot of video games, digital ones being the biggest, because I don't play them as often as I use to think I would and I'm not able to sell them to someone else who would like them more. At the same time I feel perfectly fine and glad I got them so I don't know how to feel. 

What comes out of both of these is the fact that for some I begged my parents to buy for me or let me buy it, and it seems like I've made them waste money on something that doesn't matter. Also, whenever I start thinking of many of the other things I own, I realize how little I actually use them such as a graphing calculator I've really only used a bit last year that was around $100 or notebooks that get used up half way for one class and never get used up completely so it just ends in a waste of paper and money

I also can't decide what I want my future career to be, something I always thought would be in music but I realized that I haven't prepared my self for and made my parents spend loads of money on and I don't even know if I still want to do it or what else I want to do, and at the same time I don't feel that stressed anymore

I also feel like all I do is waste time watching anime, playing video games, and being on social media, but there isn't anything else that there is to do, especially with covid not allowing me to see friends and don't text them that often.

16,"I'm a straight A student, 4.00 GPA and always top of my class. I'm majoring in Food Science. Tough classes are nothing new to me and I know what I need to do in order to get the grade I want, until now. I don't like blaming people or things for my problems, but in this case I feel it really isn't my fault I can't succeed. 

My professor is horrible, the worst I've ever had or could ever imagine having. She's ridiculously nit-picky, vague, and scatterbrained. There have been multiple times where she says she won't test or quiz us on things and does anyway. She vaguely explains complex mechanisms like the interworking of photosynthesis or meiosis yet expects us to understand how each of these mechanisms would work in arbitrary scenarios, which we never talk about. Our lecture is 50 mins 4x/week but her lectures are often 15-20 minutes. She's taken points off assignments because of the way I write my letters and has accused me of cheating twice because responses to questions were ""unusually"" close to other students. Even when I do well on a lab or assignment she always finds the negative and criticizes my work because it's not ""perfect"". She won't answer questions during her office hours because everything we ""need to know"" is in the book.

We just had our 3rd exam, which I got a D on. I've never gotten lower than a B on an exam before. I've kept up on everything, read the chapters 3x, watched lectures 3x, have 27 pages of notes/diagrams, and have worked through all problems exercises in the book. I understand the material, I know what things are and what they do and how they work in conjunction of one another, but that's not what we're being tested on. I'm working on this class alone 40 hours a week. After our last two exams my grade is slipping toward a C and I just don't know what to do. I feel like she's intentionally making her exams much more difficult than necessary and gets some weird satisfaction out of it. I'm absolutely lost, I'm debating contacting the Dean of her department or something but I don't know what that would do.

20,"So generally I'm not very good at hearing about others struggles and hardships, not that I am not sympathetic but that im not very good at giving comfort. Usually when someone tells me a sad thing thats happen to them I think of if I've had a similar experience, and if so I tell them about it and how it affected me, trying to show that I can relate to what they're going through. My problem is tho is ive been told it sometimes comes off as not hearing them or trying to make if about myself when that's not my intention. But if someone tells me about something I havent experienced I don't have much to offer up besides ""im sorry that happened"" or similar small comments.

She is 5'5"" and has very short legs but keeps pushing on everyone that they are ""really really long"" despite evidence to the contrary.  She has small breasts that she talks to me about not fitting into swimsuits because of all of her ""side boob"".  I am incredibly uncomfortable with the situation.  My husband and I had to talk to her pointedly about not asking me to review and seek compliments for her body.  We told her we just want to make sure she's healthy and strong and it doesn't matter what you look like.  Fast forward 8 months and she has figured out away to showcase her body again by now talking about how strong her really really long legs are.  I am actually repulsed by the behavior and I hate that she doesn't wear anything but soft leggings that show a thong line and her cellulite and always a bare midrift with a sports bra.  I don't want to have every dinner with someone sitting in their bra that is so tight you can see the underwire.  I checked the internet looking for the words to talk to her about wearing a shirt.  The rest of the family does!  All I read are how nobody has a right to tell someone what to wear.   I'm shocked by how many people think that parents are out of line asking their daughters to wear a bra.  I hate being around people who aren't wearing bras.  They look topless.  How is that ok?  I don't want people to force their bodies on me.  That, in my opinion,is a completely selfish act.  Going back to my step-daughter, I think it's really bad for her to be wearing revealing clothes as she is trying to get validation from the opposite sex.  She wants the attention and I think it's a blatant demanding of people to look at her by wearing it.  Why should I be the one to have to pretend she's wearing clothes and that it doesn't bother me?  My other step-daughter left for college still eating her boogers, hair dander, and ear wax.  I tried to get her to stop.  If the internet thinks that people can fling their bodies all over the place and that it's""everyone else's problem"" then no one should be calling out the 18 year old for eating their boogers.

At the moment we are not currently dating, just seeing each other every so often when we can due to work and other obligations. But I‚Äôm happy with what we have set up as it‚Äôs slow and steady for us right now. (Also, before anyone comes at me saying you can‚Äôt be in love and feel something for someone else, you may escort yourself out) 

So I recently moved and a roommate(M23) moved in. We click extremely well.. we get along as if we have known each other for years. We cook together and hangout often and laugh and I feel like I can be my true self with him. He has told me he likes me but he also has a lot of qualities that I truly can not bare to be around. He is immature for his age, and he cannot grasp the concept of personal space. I have had a conversation with him about it more than once and he still cannot get it. In my head, if he can‚Äôt get it as friends how could he in a relationship? I‚Äôm huge on personal space, and needing A LOT of alone time and he is very evidently the opposite. We have had a lot of issues in our friendship due to his strong feelings for me, and as of the last 48 hrs he has distanced himself from me and basically stopped talking to me. He also has gone to multiple of MY friends for advice. My friends have told me everything he has said and I feel extremely uncomfortable with the fact that he thinks it‚Äôs okay to go to them with this. They don‚Äôt break any ‚Äúgirl code‚Äù but they allow him to vent as he is clearly sad. The other night he came at me for having my man over, saying if this is the girl I wanna be then I can be that, and not to come crying to him when I get my heart broken. Mind you he knows nothing of our relationship or our history and what we have been through or anything. I asked what he meant by that and he stated ‚Äújust the girl who sleeps with her ex‚Äù and I told him he can‚Äôt be upset with me because I don‚Äôt wanna date him. And he said ‚ÄúI respect your decision I just disagree with it‚Äù 

I‚Äôm at a complete loss for what to do. I do like this roommate but he has these qualities that get under my skin so much that I don‚Äôt think I could truly ever actually see us in the long run. We have never had a real serious, deep conversation which is another play into it. With the guy i am seeing, we have history, and I truly believe I love him more than I can explain. And at the moment things are going very well, just the way I want it to. But I‚Äôm so confused.

28,"So I've been suffering from severe depression for a while now, and struggle to make it out of bed most days due to lack of motivation and energy.  I've stupidly kept this to myself instead of seeking help, and it's basically ruined my life. I failed three of my second year university modules due to not being able to function normally and just do the work. I was given a chance to resit but only resubmitted one of the essays, something I hate myself for doing. After resubmitting, I heard nothing back from my university, and stupidly decided to simply wait to see what they would say. I moved into the house I arranged to live in with my housemates from university, and have payed the first two months of rent with money i had saved up. However, the university never sent me any information on anything at all related to further retakes or being kicked out. Total silence. My depression numbed any sense of urgency at this, and I never asked them for any clarification. Typing this now really illustrates how badly I've screwed up. The start date for university rolled by, and nothing came from them. Instead of coming clean and speaking to my parents or housemates, I pretended that I was still attending university, despite obviously not doing so. Now i have ran out of money as i never received my student loan, and my house's rent is due tomorrow. I want to tell my parents but I don't want them to know how I've wasted everything they've given me, and that I've kept serious depression a secret from them for so long now. I'm at my wits end, stressed beyond belief about what will happen when the rent check bounces but also too terrified to face the consequences of my actions.  I have no idea what to do, and I really need help and advice. It's a month into the course so I doubt there's any way to get back into university now, even if I could have done so originally. I really need any advice as to what to do in my situation and if there are any possible ways to fix my life from this. Thanks.",29Oct2020,1
29,"Hi everyone,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll try my best to keep it short. I'm pretty heavily impacted by some form of anxiety. I'm hyper-conscious of everything I do, the weird ways I do them, and the things it might make my close friends and family think. I'm functional in society - I have a part-time job, I'm somehow making it through college, and I have a beautiful girlfriend (hopefully she never reads this). 

I think a lot of my issues stem from a fear of being perceived as competent. If I can't do something well, why should I even try? I'll fanatically stick to what I know is ""safe"". I also feel like I'm a boring person without much personality. Being hard on myself is my modus operandi and a result of how I was raised.          


* I've been in my apartment for two months and still have barely decorated. Am I afraid? Negligent? Am I secretly an NPC, aimlessly wandering through this world? I'm not even sure what I would get for my room.
* When I get hungry, my mood drops like a rock, which really thwarts my attempts to lose weight. I'm not overweight, I just want to be skinnier, but I don't want this part-time depression that comes with it.
* I don't know how to cook, and I'm terrified and afraid to learn. What happens if I mess it up? What will my roommates say? 
* I don't really know how to define my interests. So many people have massively interesting hobbies. Especially since COVID has taken my college coursework online, my life is basically work or school. I feel guilty whenever I'm not doing one of these two things. Even if I were to start something, what would I do? Where would I start it?
* Ever been asked what Disney character you're like, or what color best describes you? What's your favorite song? If you could live anywhere, where would it be? Now imagine drawing a blank to these questions. That's me. These questions give me massive internal anxiety unless I have time to think about it in advance. ""uhhhhh....""

30,"I've met someone online and we ended up developing feelings for each other. We've talked about meeting up and then decide if we want to be in a relationship or not. However, at the same time, we can't fully explore what we feel for each other because she just ended a relationship with someone and she doesn't want to be in a relationship unless she's over her ex. I told her I'd wait for the day she's completely over him, but she did mention she's not sure if she'd ever get over him because of how strong their feelings are for each other. And we decided that after a year, she'd tell me if I'd need to continue waiting for her or if I should move on. Recently, she hasn't been responding as much to messages because of how overwhelming things are in her life. She really is going through a lot. And she asked if my feelings would fade if she takes some time off to be on her own for a while. I told her I would still have really strong feelings after a week and even a month, but that my feelings might start to fade after 2 months because I wouldn't be sure if she'd still be alive after 2 months, and I don't have anybody to contact and ask how she would be. And she said if my feelings would fade after 2 months of not talking, maybe she isn't all that special to me.

35,"I was heavily involved in a sport that did not have a team at school, so I was mostly in school for just classes, before heading out to run to the gym on the other side of the city. For 4 years I did this, and as you can tell I didn‚Äôt have the chance to make much friends.

I didn‚Äôt hang around after class, join a school organization, a frat, and because of my double gym sessions every day and homework at home, I‚Äôd bee too exhausted in class to even think about talking to others. This was what it was like for the first two years of school, and by the time I got to my last two years, it seemed like everyone had their own social circles already, so it felt pointless to even try and get involved with a ‚Äúclique‚Äù or group of friends. Most of them were only friends because of their mutual organizations at school anyways, and I felt like it was too late to make friends.

When the lockdown started, let‚Äôs just say I didn‚Äôt feel it very much because I never hung out much with people. I was actually quite happy instead because it gave me a much needed break from training and I could do all my classwork at home now. But as the months went by and I graduated from school, I realized that I felt empty inside. Besides being a good boy and doing my chores at school, before running off to train, I didn‚Äôt have a life. And as you might expect, the gym being closed made me feel much more empty and without purpose than you could imagine.

I have no one. I haven‚Äôt been able to just go out and hang out or chill with friends since junior year of high school. Friends to just randomly send memes, text or FaceTime. Friends I could randomly ask to go out and eat with me randomly when I‚Äôm bored. 

Now, I get that as people grow up they have to stop being so ‚Äúchildish‚Äù and realize they can‚Äôt cling onto what they had as a kid. But is this it then? I have no social circle really, just acquaintances from the sport I play. Coworkers, in a way. Is that what adulting is? Having no friends but lots of acquaintances and contacts? If that‚Äôs so then I guess I‚Äôm alright. I just feel empty. 

And if it‚Äôs not really the way things should be, and I can blame the tunnel vision I had in the last years for my current emptiness, then what are ways to make friends as an adult? I know it‚Äôs different because 1) I‚Äôm done with school 2) Adults all have commitments and work, so we can‚Äôt hang out like we‚Äôre in high school 3) Most of the social circles adults have are carried over into adulthood from college.

38,Bit of backstory. I moved in with my cousin. We had a good relationship when we were younger and I believed it would be good for both of us to live together. The first couple weeks were good and I enjoyed being there. Unfortunately things took a turn in her mental health. I am aware of some of the issues she has dealt with in the past and I have made sure to be there for her and give advice when necessary. A big problem is she broke up with her ex a few months ago. Their relationship was extremely unhealthy and he cheated the entire time. Even though they broke up he still called and texted her often asking and begging to get back together. It caused her a lot of distress and made her feel as if she was a bad person for pushing him away. I advised that she put distance between them for awhile so they could both heal. She has done the opposite and is now spending time with him. I know I can‚Äôt control what she does but my biggest concern is how it affects her mentally. She has been getting steadily more unstable and is becoming more and more dependent on me. I want to be a good cousin and help her but these issues are far deeper and more extreme than what I‚Äôm qualified to handle. She has a history of severe depression. I have suggested that she return to her therapist and have listened to and advised her in any way I can but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. It has gotten to the point where if I visit my family or boyfriend for a couple days she gets jealous and angry with me. It‚Äôs made it difficult for me to be away with the guilt that I‚Äôm experiencing and makes me want to avoid being at the house with her. I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this properly.

42,"Today, I told my mom to only call me on the weekends because she calls me at least 3 times a day to ""check on me.""

That's the short version, but here's long story:

My mom and I have not really had a good relationship for most of my life. When I was a kid, she was very abusive to both me and my older sister, but in different ways. When it came to me, she would hit me for being clumsy. Literally, I dropped a bar of soap in the sink one time and she hit me for it. Whenever I scrapped my body from falling, she would either yell at me or hit me for it, and I grew up being afraid to make a mistake. She wouldn't let me play with any other children, not even my own family. I was always inside, and she would make up an excuse saying that I was ""allergic to grass"" when I was actually getting bit by bugs. Anytime other children would want to invite me over for a playdate, she would always say no because I would ""hurt myself.""

Being overprotective is one thing, but I want to point out her response to when I told her I was being bullied. I remember when I was five and children were already throwing me off the bus and laughing at me and beating me up during my first month of kindergarten. I came home one day and told her that kids were picking on me and all she said was ""okay."" ... It was the first time I ever experienced an awkward silence. Whenever I would tell her about bullying after that incident she gave the ""it is what it is"" type of approach. I remember screaming ""I hate you!"" to her, and everyone told me how inappropriate that was at age six, but I've felt that way for years after that. 

She wouldn't teach me how to do basic things like sweep and mop and wash dishes or cook. God forbid that I used the stove when she was there. I always had to cook and iron my clothes and wash clothes when she wasn't home so she wouldn't hurt me. She eventually found out that I was doing all those things. She wasn't pleased, but she didn't do anything when she found out I did it.

She's also a people pleaser. I recall how she would drop whatever she was doing to help other people out. My sister had her convocation for college, and she said she wasn't going to attend because our church was having choir practice. When I entered high school, she was having an affair on my dad, so it would only be me and my dad at the house everyday. He is the exact opposite of my mom, which is why I'm a daddy's girl. Anyway, once I started becoming independent, she suddenly saying that we were best friends, which was NEVER how I felt about her. She was upset that I didn't talk to her that much and asked me and my sister to call her everyday.

Fast forward to now. I've been out the house for about four years and I keep thinking about everything she's done to hurt me and my dad and my sister. My sister is currently in another country, and she didn't stay with my mom because of how my mom treated her. She demands that I call her everyday, and recently I've been having constant thoughts of the younger me telling her that I hated her. Today, I told her to only call me on the weekends and she has yet to call me. The thing is that now I feel bad, but I know that this is good for the both of us.

He is extremely loud in public for no reason and tries to act ""tough"", every time we go out to eat if our table isn't helped within 30 seconds he screams out loud ""HEY DOES ANYONE WORK HERE?"" and embarrasses me each time we go out, if I get a smaller portion of food he starts to go on a rant about how I need to eat more and how my family at home is horrible for allowing me to eat such small portions, and lastly he is just extremely weird. I really did try to give him a chance but after meeting him for the second time recently he did the same exact thing again and I just don't know how I can deal with it. Now he wants me to move in with him and move away from my parents because ""my mom kept him away from me for so many years"", which is true... but obviously as I have seen in person for a reason.

My husband 44m (obstetrician)and I 39f (physician) adopted our son 20years ago. My husband came across the baby he delivered to be given into the home . Police,  care and home were all involved.The bio mother said the baby was a result of her being taken advantage and the boyfriend just kept mum through the whole process.  Within weeks we were married and became parents to our son Charles (fake name) . We didn't get any hint that the boyfriend was the bio father and the story was a lie.. when our son was 13 we told him he was adopted because he had started noticing the disresemblance Our 3 bio kids have black hair and grey eyes white but easily tan skin (middle eastern) .while our oldest was white blonde hair and brown eyes .We told him we loved him and nothing changes he was still our baby . Both my hubby and I never treated him any different .charles turned 17 and demanded to know about his bio mother .Within a few months we learnt that his bio mom was living 3hours away from us and was married to the boyfriend .When we met for the first time , we had a look of horror because their son was a exact copy of charles . The bio parents admitted to cold feet .

The parents asked if charles could stay with them , Since it was school break we agreed.when charles came home after 10days .He started hurling insults and abuses at us which really hurt.  From how we are not His parents to  he didn't  love us. He went back.  the parents transfered his school to their state. We  contacted the police system and lawyers to bring him home but he was turning 18 in a month and they advised us not to do anything which will lead to resentment from him. Both my daughter's begged their brother to come back . My younger son just cried . My husband and i had to take a break from work. We continued visiting him every week amdist the shouts the I hate you' s because we knew it was because of how blinded he was of their flashy lifestyle.he wreaked his brand  new Camry  just weeks after we gifted him.We never blamed him . It was just it's okay but no new car till you are 20. And when he turned 18 he went no contact. At that time my cousin sat us down and made us understand that it was not our fault.  We provided what we could , gave him love .We had saved about 150k for each of our 4kids for university  . At first we thought to give him that  upon going to his bio parents house ,we were insulted . We donated his share. he was cut off the will from both grandparents and ours As Well  .Fast forward to now . Charles came home and demanded his money.  He knew from a young age that we would pay ( in muslim household parents pay for uni and everything ) till kids marry. I asked him if he wanted to stay home he said no .Well my husband had enough and told him he wasn't getting any money.His parents then contacted our parents and demanded the inheritance he was going to get . Our folks said no. 
What should we do? Give him the money and forget about everything? Honest opinion ?
Edit: we were 3months into dating when hubby asked if he could adopt charles , our parents were okay and suggested we marry so the process is easy because a couple has a higher probability to be accepted for adoption than a single man . We didn't tell  him he was adopted earlier because he was still a child and we feared he would think differently of us . We let him stay with bio parents for 10days because charles wanted to know them.he was intrigued with their flashy lifestyle expensive cars which we now learn is on mortgage and about to be taken by the bank.",29Oct2020,1

I need advice on what to do with my life. I‚Äôm 20 and still live at home, living at home is decent enough but the only reason i want to move out is because of my Karen mum. She constantly tells me i‚Äôm useless and gets mad at me for leaving the house so honestly its to get away from her. I have two jobs so i have been saving money however she‚Äôs gotten me to put $40k in stocks or something i‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve always had my mum do taxes, medical and basically everything legal and then she gets upset at me for not knowing what i‚Äôve never been taught. 
Yesterday i went on a little shopping spree and bought $600 worth of anime figures because I like to collect them. Its the only thing I enjoy in life and she threatens to take them away, refund them and if she cant do that then discard them and throw them out. 
I have anxiety but i also honestly couldn‚Äôt give a shit about anything that isnt my anime collection. She‚Äôs rearranged my room several times and i cant stand someone touching my stuff so I usually have a massive anxiety attack or something so if she gets rid of it I‚Äôll honestly kill myself out of spite for my mother.

57,"We've dated for 2 years. At times it's very smooth sailing. Those first 6 months, I'd never felt so happy and alive! We had a bad rough patch for 2/3 months towards the end of our first year and it left a dark stain. I lost a lot of trust in him. He developed bad anxiety and all his issues/baggage consumed him and me for a long time. He had all these doubts about me, about never having sex with another women again, about the guilt of finding other women we know sexier. He was really suffering, lost like 15lbs and really needed psychiatric help. But he wouldn't and insisted he was ""fine"". It's like he didn't care how hurt I got. I spent hours a day for weeks looking for resources to help him through this. 

Things got better for almost a year. Any arguments we had were about him occasionally prioritising his friends over me or me being salty over stuff he said during the rough patch (some of it made me cry back then). It started happening again in May this year and the relationship further deteriorated. I was a shadow of myself. His issues need help. I grew resentful about 2 months ago and I have this sad feeling I'll always wonder if I could find someone who wouldn't burden me with baggage. He has been pretty good for the last month or 2 by comparison but it's like the spark died for me. I have little interest in sex. I rarely miss him and I haven't seen him for 5 weeks due to quarantine. Suddenly meeting a new guy a year or 2 from now sounds great. I was practically blind to attractive men only a few months ago, this is not like me. 

 I have to wonder if distance plays a role in this. I didn't see him at all from late March to June (missed him like crazy) because of quarantine. After that I was seeing him 2 days a week. When we lived in the same college city (college is online until fall 2021 now) we were together 5+ hours a day everyday.  I feel like if I got to see him regularly again in 2021, my feelings might come flying back. My issue, is he wants us to live together next fall when college campus is open again and I'm worried we won't last because of all my doubts. I want to see if things can improve before I take such a risk.

58,"My mom got remarried 7years ago to a really sweet guy. Seriously he's one of the best guys an I'm very glad to have him as a step dad. He's originally from a small town in Tennessee. After they got married they moved there. My mom &amp; I are not the best at communication so we would only call or text every few months but when we did it'd be for hours. For numerous reasons I wont go into my boyfriend and I decided to move to Tennessee. We've been staying with my mother &amp; step dad since late January 2020. Over this time I've noticed differences in my mom. When I was younger she raised me to accept EVERYONE unless they were mean or disrespectful to you. She was the one who taught me about Homosexuality, Human rights, etc. She was a very loving &amp; accepting person. This woman I live with now however.. She's still very loving but she has really changed. Within a week of us moving in she mentioned she believes gay people are wrong, marriage should be between a man &amp; a woman, etc. This is the woman who's BEST FRIEND throughout me growing up was openly gay. She's become so obsessed with religion and God. Now please don't get me wrong I have nothing against God or people worshiping him. As long as they don't try to shove it down anyones throat or judge people for believing differently. She's for Trump because she believes he has been chosen to bring the nation closer to God. She openly doesn't seem to understand what the whole BLM movement is about. Just tonight at dinner she was talking about a candy when she was a girl called N-Word toes. SHE PROCEEDED TO SAY THE N WORD (Hard R) OVER 5TIMES IN 2MIN AND DIDNT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS BOTHERING ME. She just brushed it off ""That's what people called them when I was young. If you wanted to be polite you'd call them 'Colored people'."" I just don't understand what happened to my mother. This woman is preaching the exact opposite of what she raised me to believe. It hurts so much and all I want to do is scream and yell at her for her bigotry &amp; ignorance. But shes my mother and I love her. I was raised to respect her. But she isn't the same woman..I'm just not sure what to do anymore, does anyone out there have any advice or similar experiences?",29Oct2020,1

Not for prestige, but for simply turning down the opportunity to go somewhere where ill be immersed in an environment where I can have more opportunity.

I am almost 14 years old and I‚Äôm in 8th grade. I have a huge crush on this boy, I have liked him since kindergarden. We used to be friends in 4th in 5th grade but once we went to middle school we didn‚Äôt have any classes together and kinda drifted apart. But now I have two classes with him this year we have had a few school related conversation. (Very basic ones.) 

My crush is super attractive, smart and funny. He would make a great father. And I know this sounds crazy but he is the only person I would ever want to marry. I think I found my soulmate. He just makes me so happy. He has anxiety so I have seen the goods and bad‚Äôs of him, but I‚Äôm still in love. No other girls like him, at least at the moment so I think I‚Äôm good for now.

Im so in love I can‚Äôt think about anything else. This has been going on for months now. However the good news is that it‚Äôs not interfering with my daily life and I am getting straight As in school. Anyways long story short I want to confess to him in high school and hopefully we can date. I have been told that I am a good person, so my hope is that he would fall in love and happily ever after.

But then I realize that that will never happen, but I don‚Äôt want to loose all hope. I think that he at least thinks I‚Äôm a good person so that‚Äôs a plus.

Anyways I care about him so much and am in love. Please dont tell me in crazy because I know I am for thinking this but, I need you to help me. What should I do? Do I have a chance? Please help!

71,"I love both my mother and my grandfather tremendously. While I am hesitant to say that I love my grandfather as much as my mother, the truth is that I've always gotten along with him more and been closer to him, and he's always been there for me, even at times when it seemed to me that my mother was not, or at least when my mother and I were not on good terms. Before I make it seem like my father isn't in the picture, he definitely is, and he's the one person that I'm probably closer to than either my mother or my grandfather, although I do love my mother just as much as my father, I'm just closer to him than pretty much anyone.

My father, though, is not capable of mediating between my mother and my grandfather when they get on each other's nerves, which happens quite a lot, often because of politics, which at least in my country has become far more divisive in recent times, and for understandable reasons. Or perhaps it's just that it seems like he doesn't really try. I'm not saying my father sides with one of them or that he just doesn't care, but for whatever reason it just seems to me that he doesn't really have any influence on calming them down or anything like that, and neither does my grandmother, although admittedly I'd expect my father to take action before my grandmother, just out of respect. The reason my father never really gets involved is that my mother and grandfather never really get into heated arguments or fights, but it just seems to me that they both hold deep resentment for one another, particularly more so my mother holding resentment for my grandfather, which is partially understandable but nonetheless it sickens and saddens me.

I wish there was something I could do to heal the divide between the two. I love both of them, respect both of them, and care for both of them very, very deeply, and knowing that my grandfather is getting old, almost 80, I just wish I could heal their divide before he leaves us forever. On the other hand, I also wish my mother wouldn't do what she does to herself, because it is without a doubt unhealthy, harmful, and painful to her, but I don't know what to do. Especially today, what I've seen happening to my mother ever since I remember has been happening to more and more people.

I really don't know what to do, and I just want our divides to heal. We need to love one another and stop assuming the worst in others. We need to stop thinking of each other as the enemy. I've seen the impact of it happen, it's still happening, and even worse today. While I understand why there is a divide, I also recognize that we need to recognize that love is bigger than politics or whatever else we're disagreeing on. Arguments and disagreements are fine, so long as they don't lead to pain, suffering, and grief, which I personally have been through with my mother and grandfather and am still going through.

tl;dr: I just need advice on how to heal the divide between my mother and grandfather, which isn't solely politics-related but has been fueled by political division.",29Oct2020,1

Like don't get me wrong I was also a pos because at the time I actually enjoyed being friends with those assholes even knowing that some of them were stealing homes, bars and what everyday european thugs do.

So i become friends with this guy and I left my parents house so I could go live with him and smoke and do drugs all day. This was my last highschool year. 

The guy had a lot of ""respect"" and he is very smart and manipulative, and I kinda wanted to be like him and wasn't the true me. Like i would lie and say i did some stuff that i didn't. Like regularly... And he started to call me liar and in a day or two I felt that 'badboy' personad of mine being destroyed.

Fast forward 1-3 years, we both got into different universities, and during three years i completely changed my life when i started dating. The guy had started to call me junkie in a bullying way and I decided to cut my relation with him, so I started not responding his messages.. 

I never blocked him in my social media because I can always find him in the street and not have that ""you blocked me, are you afraid thang', so to this day, and it's been almost 10 years he never stopped sending messages. Today he dm me just my name.

I work retail and since our return from quarantine, it‚Äôs been hectic. Everyone has taken on extra duties and tasks. I got two promotions in three months. 

One of the workers in my team has a bad attitude and sometimes verbally abusive. He works directly under me and I‚Äôve warned him about it a few times but it wasn‚Äôt until the week my grandfather died that pushed me over. 

That week he said, ‚Äúyou know if you get lung cancer I ain‚Äôt coming to your funeral?‚Äù Which firstly, I don‚Äôt even like the idea of him attending my funeral anyway. Secondly, this isn‚Äôt something you say to your boss during a time of grief, let alone say it in front of customers. So I immediately reported it to the GM and strongly encouraged her to write him up for his behavior. Nothing happened though. Nothing. 

The attitude and insults continued so I reported him two more times after for similar incidents. Nothing happened. So finally this week I said enough was enough and I started to give it back to him hard. 

He said yesterday, ‚ÄúI bought a Nintendo switch.‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúcool man. What‚Äôre you playing?‚Äù 

He bursts out, ‚ÄúTHATS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHAT IM PLAYING. why are you asking so many questions and why you so nosy about it?‚Äù 

I waited for this moment and I knew when it came I‚Äôd let loose. 

I said ‚Äúyou idiot, why are you bringing up a conversation you ain‚Äôt equip to handle? It‚Äôs not like I asked about your kids, your wife or your mother. I asked about a damn game.‚Äù 

We went back and forth a couple more times and I didn‚Äôt let up. I kept going after him and mocked him publicly just as he‚Äôs done me. I don‚Äôt plan to stop neither. 

Finally the new girl I was training to work alongside him said ‚ÄúYALL JUST ARGUE. ALL DAY.‚Äù 

I felt for her because before I‚Äôd had let everything he says and does slide since the GM wasn‚Äôt taking action against it.

Me and my sibling are adults but can‚Äôt afford to rent out because of everything that‚Äôs going on let alone give her a life she deserves. I feel pathetic. The only way out is by winning the lottery. My mother would rather die than go into a shelter and live off of state support. So we are stuck in this horrible household. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has any advice.  


If there is any advice I can give to anyone... this idea of staying together for the kids is a complete fucking fairy tale. If your relationship isn‚Äôt working out, divorce. Because the impact this has had on me is ten times worse than a childhood divorce would have been. Please.",29Oct2020,1

This is the website I came across. For premium pricing (kind of pricey, but still less than I have seen on essay websites) they  claim a PHD level individual will help me receive and A or B on the test. I can afford it, but I'm a little wary. Their live chat is good and clearly ran by a real person and I have been texting back and forth with an individual from their website. The payment website they use is also legit and secure. I'm getting to the point of seriously considering it, and my curiosity is piqued in seeing what sort of service I'll get. 

I'm still planning on studying my butt off until the test, and if it is a scam it isn't the end of the world as there is a fair amount of evaluations in the course so a fail on this doesn't mean a fail in the course. I really would like some input on this from other engineers // students // people. I will also update on the experience if I go ahead with it!!",29Oct2020,1

Then it was done he kind of just walked away. I was happy how it turned out even though I didn‚Äôt get him to take a step back but it was the first time I got to defend myself. But today he hasn‚Äôt said a word to my mom today. He‚Äôs usually all over her even over text but he didn‚Äôt even say hi to her when he got home.

93,"These past few months, it came to my (23M)  attention that my brother (29M) has been claiming that I am stealing medical marijuana from our terminal mother. All three of us smoke marijuana. My mother due to her terminal condition, I do for my ptsd, autism, anxiety, and major depressive disorder. Found out he's been saying this by someone asking me if it was true. It isn't, I would never take her medicine. She is beyond important to me. I trust and love very few people, and my mother very dear to me

Fast forward, it is Oct 20th. I confront my brother about it in my mother's room. She's sitting against the pillows by the bed's headboard, brother is sitting at the foot of the bed. I am in a padded metal swivel chair near the foot of the bed. When I bring up the lying, brother begins telling me how he knows I'm taking it since ""I'm unemployed and can't pay for my own"" and he claims I am constantly high. For the record, my tolerance is very high and I rarely ever get a big high from smoking. 

He then goes on to say I am not visiting our mother enough. He starts saying I only come out to smoke. I have visited my mother every single day since I moved out in June.

Brother then literally tells me I have a skewed perception of time, that I don't spend as much time with her as I ""think"" I do.

I begin getting distressed. My ptsd triggered by the gaslighting and autism has me in sensory overdrive, I begin heading for a meltdown. The gaslighting triggered me badly due to abuse I suffered as a teen. He keeps going on about how I'm not doing enough, even with mom interjecting to tell him how often i help with chores. suddenly the confrontation about him calling me a thief turned into, as he said, an ""intervention"" for my ""behavior"".

I meltdown. I very rarely meltdown, and never have I exploded like this. I don't remember much. I remember screaming, and I hit the chair  I was sitting in. My hand breaks with the punch. According to mom,  I start hitting myself and she jumps up to get me to stop. The next thing I remember is sitting numb and aching with mom trying to put ice in my broken hand. My brother then acts concerned, asking to see my hand to ""see if it was broken"". I say ""don't touch me.""

My sister takes me to the hospital. It's a nasty break, and now my dominant hand is in a cast for awhile (this is taking so long to type with just my left hand).

I see my brother again about three days later. He says ""I'm sorry for everything,"" and all I can muster is ""what do you want me to say? "" I can't even look him in the eyes because my anxiety is buzzing and I was desperate to leave his presence. 

Now, I've been avoiding him, and when I know he will be at my mom's, I wait to visit her until he is gone. I'm not one to hold grudges. But right now I am so raw and hurt and confused. I don't understand how he says he cares for me, then tells lies about me to mom and says I'm not doing enough. It hit too close for my ptsd and I have been doing horribly. I have much self doubt already. Am I over reacting? Am I wrong for not wanting to be in his presence right now? I don't even know if I can get past this any time soon. I'm weary and worried that maybe I am awful. Idk. Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank you.",29Oct2020,1

95,"Hi there,

Loaded curiosity-killed-the-cat type of situation. 

My mom and her twin were adopted. When they got to meet their biological mom as adults, they found out they were conceived through a really traumatizing rape at a college party. One day, in talking to my aunt about it, I realized I could probably find him because she knew his name and the school he attended. Ten minutes of Google searching later. I found him. And damn, we look like him. Just like my grandmother said.

I never got to know my grandmother well... the relationship with us was too painful. I just can't believe this guy has lived his whole life not knowing the pain and suffering he caused. I want to tell him. But I know I can't. 

I also don't know how to handle this with my aunt. She really wishes she could have known him or met him, despite everything that happened to her mom. Should I show her what I found?

Is there anything realistically I can do? Besides therapy, LOL",29Oct2020,1

97,"For a summary, I broke my brother's expensive cologne on accident. For some more information I didnt provide in my original post, my brother is about 30. He is technically the owner of our cats, but my dad is legally listed as the main provider. 

I tried apologizing through text, as my brother has secluded himself in his room, and is still rather angry. I expressed that I knew what I did was wrong, and I truly regretted it. 

He doesn't care for my apology, and wants 100 dollars to repurchase his cologne. Im only 14, so I don't have a single penny to my name. He'll likely go to our dad for money. My dad likely won't want to pay him back, and then get mad at me. 

The only option that I have right now is to give him all of my switch games to sell. They were bought by my dad for me as gifts. They were bought for 60 dollars each, and I have for of them. The problem is, he's telling me each will only sell for about 26 dollars at gamestop.

He says until I pay him back he won't be providing food or litter for our cats. He says that he'll give them back to their previous owners, because theyll be suffering and its my fault.

I can't lose these cats. Theyve helped greatly with my anxiety, depression, and over all feelingd of self hate and lonelyness.

99,"Hello. I'm 17M. This is going to be long but I would greatly appreciate you reading the entire thing.

My entire life has been a living hell. I have terrible trauma from my childhood that makes anything that involves people a nightmare (I'm always being anxious, hating myself, and beating myself up if I say one thing slightly wrong), I'm afraid of everyone and everything, and my entire life is spent hiding in my room. 

What happened? For one, I believe I was emotionally neglected as a child and my parents would let me do whatever I wanted and then scream their heads off when it became a problem. I have extreme anxiety and trust issues stemming from my father who appeared kind, loving and non-threatening but would all of a sudden blow up on me. One of these instances was when I had not done anything really wrong; they let me browse on the computer by myself when I was like 5 or 6 and soon discovered I was watching dark news stories. I had locked myself in my room because I didn't want them to see what I was watching and so they screamed at me to open the door; my father sounded almost like he was going to hurt me and I was terrified and crying at the end.

Then I became a shitty person and started to bully my poor younger brother. My parents yelled at me to stop, but because I had no discipline or respect for them, I continued. They would yell, I'd do it again to defy them, then they'd yell again, and so on, and this continued for years. My parents started to bully *me* in an attempt to make me stop doing it to my brother; they would guilt me, degrade me, invalidate my feelings, talk to and yell at me like I was the most worthless thing in the world, and make fun of me. Eventually it got to a point where I knew what I was doing was wrong but I just *couldn't* bring myself to stop; I don't know if it was anger, hurt and defiance from my parents treating me like shit, or because I might be on the autism spectrum, or both.

I finally forced myself to stop after my brother had been seeing a counselor and my dad told me he (my brother) was showing signs of clinical depression because of my awful treatment of him. Dark and makes me awful, I know. However, my parents and my brother now tell me he just saw the counselor because he was stressed about school at the time, that that was the reason for the signs of depression as well, and they just lied back then in hopes that I would stop... not sure how much I believe this though; I think they're just lying now to make me feel better. 

Anyways, it has been a few years since all this shit finally ceased, and my parents and my brother seem to have moved on from it. My brother seems to be doing well; he's got lots of friends and people who love him and seems happy (I hope). I've talked it over with my entire family, brother included, and they all forgive me and say I should not let it bother me anymore. I'm still deeply wounded though and I feel as though I have extreme psychological damage from the distress of not being able to stop and then getting screamed at and degraded for it, all while I knew I was hurting my family with my issues. I've been uncovering these memories and their emotions for the past few days and the pain is absolutely unbearable.

I feel like the absolute scum of the earth for what I did and I deeply believe I don't deserve happiness. Also, all the trauma has made me deathly afraid of opening up to other people; I avoid people like the plague, and heck I even have trouble saying ""hello"" first because I'm too scared. I hate myself far too much to even try being in a romantic relationship--I'm always sabotaged by brutal, toxic thoughts shaming me for liking someone. Besides, I don't want to be betrayed and I don't want them to find out what a terrible person I am. 

Even though I believe I'm not worthy of happiness though, I know this suffering can't last forever. I know it needs to get better at some point, but I feel lost. I'm too afraid to talk to any kind of counselor, psychotherapist, etc. because of my fear of opening up and being judged (I'm actually having a panic attack just posting this). I'm worried how personal the topics/questions would get. *I feel like I'm trapped in hell.* Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",29Oct2020,1

102,"I am 15 and I recently noticed my sex drive has been a bit absurd, for example I am no longer ever not horny, This on its own being another issue.

103,"Let me start from the very beginning. I'm 15M, and I just switched schools. I met this one guy, and we became friends. Pretty early on into the year he told me he liked me and wanted to have a relationship, and since I'm straight, I said I was flattered but I said no. Keep in mind that he already knew I was straight and wasn't looking for a relationship. After that whole thing went down, he didn't really talk to me for two days, and I figured he needed time, he was embarrassed. Which I totally get. Eventually, we talked to each other, and everything came out fine. We were still friends, everything seemed good. Which is what I wanted, because I thought he was a great guy, and I stilled wanted to be friends with him. After a while though, I began to notice a few things that put me in a weird spot with him. Here are a couple of things.

**He calls me ""cutie"" and other names like that and I don't know how to feel about it.** He would often make remarks on how I looked ""cute"". I made me feel a little bit weird, but at first I just brushed it off because I knew he was just trying to make me feel good. I didn't want to be an asshole about it. I would often have personal zoom calls with him outside of school to watch movies and talk and other things, and sometimes he would ask me ""why are you so cute today"" and I would awkwardly just smile or something because I have no idea how to answer that. He would change my name on zoom to ""cutie"" or something, and constantly text ""I love you"" to me. By then, he was doing things like that to me a lot, and now I kind of feel uncomfortable. I don't know if it's normal that I feel weird when he says things like that or I'm just being an asshole. He also asks from time to time if I'll be his boyfriend in some form, and I don't know if it's a joke or not because he already knows that I don't want to date anyone yet and I'm straight. I feel like no matter how much I repeat that to him, it doesn't register. It seems to me that he thinks that I rejected him because I didn't like him rather than I was straight and didn't want to date anyone yet. (Also, just as a note, I am in full support of the LGBT community. I don't have a problem with him being attracted to boys.)

**He makes me feel bad for things that I feel I shouldn't.** He often says that I'm mad at him or I hate him because I have to hang up to do homework or if I'm busy doing something else. He always takes it personal when it has nothing to do with him. He sometimes makes me feel bad for hanging up. For example, he says that he's being annoying and I hate him and that's why I'm hanging up even though we both know that is not the case at all. I have expressed to him that he is not annoying, and he has told me he believes me when I say that. So sometimes I don't know if he really means what he says or if he's trying to fish for compliments. Even when I'm not supposed to be on face time or zoom because it's way past my bedtime, and I say I can't call, he'll get make me feel bad for it. Now, It makes it hard to tell him that I feel this way about him is because he'll immediately tell me that I hate him, and that I never wanted to be his friend. It's very frustrating because when I even hint at something that's related to this he'll shut down and immediately say I hate him. No matter how many times tell him that I don't hate him he won't make up his mind. What hurts me is that I show him that I really like hanging out with him and he still says to me that I hate him. Another thing that bugs me is that he says to my face that I broke his heart, and constantly hints that he was rejected by me. How am I supposed to reply to that? I didn't reject him because I didn't like him. It's kind of the same thing that I talked about in the last paragraph.

**He feels betrayed because I called another friend.** This happens a lot. I'll be with my other friends on a call or something and since people in your zoom contacts can tell if you're in a meeting, he knows when I might be calling another friend. After I get off he'll make me feel guilty for being on a call with them. 

**I'm hesitant to talk to him because of his past.** This part is important because he was frequently bullied in his last school. He has had ""friends"" who have treated him like shit, called him ugly, and said he will never date anyone. I feel like he is acting this way because so many people have treated him horribly at his last school. I want to be as empathetic as possible when talking to him, because he has gone through some rough shit and I don't want him to feel like how he did in his last school. 

This has escalated since I met him, and I feel like it's going to get worse. I still want to be friends with him. He's a great guy, and I don't want to lose him as a friend. Have any advice on how to confront him about this?",29Oct2020,1

None of our family members spoke to him over the last 10 years, except for myself who kept in contact with him on social media. 

He lived a pretty tragic life, and died alone.  Although my mom and her siblings (justifiably) hold resentment towards him I really want to honour him. I also know this will be really hard day for them. 
I was wondering if anyone has any prayers, or stories they recommend me sharing tomorrow. 
Or advice on what to say or suggestions on what to do, there will only be about four of us. 
I really want to respect him, and give him a proper goodbye.

For this story I‚Äôll be calling the subject of this story ‚ÄúTom.‚Äù
Also sorry for this being a little bit long.

So this morning my sister texts me asking if I knew this kid who goes to our school named Tom. Tom is a quiet kid, he doesn‚Äôt really have any friends and he just drifts around friend groups. So anyway she tells me that this kid said he was going to shoot up the school a few months ago. Now the thing is, I was a bit on the edge about this at first because everybody always jokes about school shootings and stuff nowadays, so you never really know if someone is being serious or not. So I just brushed it off because I had to study for my permit test tomorrow and had other things to worry about. 

So anyways, with this information starting to get to my head a bit, I get a little freaked out. So, I decided to find him on Instagram to see what kind of post he makes and stuff like that. I follow him and his page is just mainly memes, with the exception of one picture, which is a pic of a Jason Voorhese action figure. So anyways I don‚Äôt think much of it until he DMs me saying ‚Äúwho the fuck are you and why are you following me?‚Äù

I reply telling him that I‚Äôm the kid who sat behind him and health class etc. and he finally remembers me. The way he text was really strange too. But anyways out of the blue he asks me ‚Äúdo you know who [my sister‚Äôs name] is?‚Äù 

I heart dropped as soon as I read that. I tell him, ‚Äúyeah I know her. That‚Äôs my sister. Why?‚Äù 

His response, ‚Äúoh nothing‚Äù

129,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this post but..
TL;DR: Caught my manager lying about throwing my business cards away, (definitely retaliation) swore at her, got told I couldn‚Äôt come back to finish my two weeks. District manager decided manager wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble bc ‚Äú*Company Name* is not responsible for employee property.‚Äù bc apparently, she can‚Äôt be held responsible for folding business cards in half and putting them all the way at the bottom of a trash can. I found out recently that those words are actually NOT in the contract I signed.
Screenshots, since most of the interaction is over text
About a month ago I caught my manager (L) in a lie about throwing away some and taking home 25+ of my business cards. I‚Äôd worked at this doggy daycare/boarding place for almost 2 years, forming really amazing relationships with so many of the dogs there. I found my love of taking care of dogs through their skin and coat. I spent countless hours off the clock, brushing/de-matting whichever dog needed it the most. I taught myself the basics of brushing, skin/coats, and nail trimming. It took a while but eventually, I realized grooming was the perfect career for me and I started trying to decide on a school. I tried my hardest to get along with my coworkers as well as with the dogs, but it just never felt as close as everyone else was. I was always so scared that they were making fun of me behind my back, that they didn't really like me and were just pretending, and that I was purposefully left out of things. My boyfriend kept trying to convince me that if they‚Äôre so nice to my face, they probably do genuinely like me, and I should just be as nice as possible and not worry about it. Eventually he did convince me, so I relaxed, tried to be more outgoing, and started to think we were all friends. Which was maybe 3 months before this.
In the first text that was sent, I made a group chat of some coworkers to ask if anyone had seen my business cards I had displayed in the lobby. L texted me directly, saying ‚Äúthey were knocked over everywhere I picked them up before I left the other day! I have them in my car, I was waiting to see you to give them to you! Did you have them displayed or drop them?‚Äù As if I‚Äôd just drop them and leave??? And I had cards in two different spots, one being in a rack with other business cards...which weren‚Äôt spilled... And why would she feel the need to take them with her???
I knew she was doing it to get back at me because I had just sent my two-week notice the night before, citing my reason for leaving as that manager and her BFF/assistant manager(T), and their unprofessionalism.
This wasn‚Äôt the first time either of them had messed with me/my things, so I was livid when I caught her on camera doing it and swore at her in my text response. (and I may have sent a petty text to the group chat) The district manager(DM) (also a very close friend of theirs) texted me and said today would be my last day. It was already hours after my shift, so that meant I would never get the chance to say goodbye to the dogs. I was still really pissed off, so I argued with her. She said multiple times that ‚Äú*corporate name* and its managers are not responsible for employee property.‚Äù I sent her the video I took of L throwing my cards in the trash, noting how she specifically tried to hide them all the way in the bottom of the trash can. She tried changing the subject into it being about whether or not she was hiding the cards, or if paper towel happened to be on top of them because she was also cleaning the table in the video. So despite acknowledging that L herself folded and put them in the trash, DM says L can‚Äôt take responsibility because of a bullshit loophole. And I just read my employee handbook which does not say anything like that. (I have had jobs where that was in the contract, and something they mentioned often.) but does say ‚Äútheft or inappropriate removal or possession of property‚Äù is a fireable offense. Before I had texted the group chat the petty message and DM texted me, and after I‚Äôd sworn at L, she gave another bullshit reason to get rid of my cards, again trying to lie her way out of getting caught retaliating: ‚ÄúOkay well I‚Äôm sorry, the only reason they need to be removed from our lobby was because they were not approved by [DM] or [owners] first since you are working for a groomer[similar industry]. I do have the whole stack with me though and I‚Äôd be happy to give them back to you. I legit have them and AM going to give them back.‚Äù
First of all, our owners are retired, bc of the husband‚Äôs life-threatening, stress-worsening disease. Technically, they‚Äôre still a part of the big stuff, but they don‚Äôt make surprise visits anymore and they definitely don‚Äôt care whose business cards are in the lobby. Secondly, the day I got my cards, I was very excited and showing them to people. DM happened to be there to talk with L, and they both said they liked them a lot. L told me (in front of DM) that she‚Äôs very excited for me and that I can ‚Äúdo whatever‚Äù with them; ‚Äúgive them out to the clients, put some up in the lobby, give them to us to hand out, whatever!‚Äù (Not the first time she‚Äôs told me I could do something and then did something to contradict it behind my back. And lastly, the last two sentences definitely make me feel like she was not planning on giving them back to me. As I said, they‚Äôve messed with me before, but it‚Äôs always either I can‚Äôt prove it or I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre actually messing with me or if it‚Äôs my crippling social anxiety making me paranoid. So I could never say or do anything in response to what I thought might have been happening, so she never expected a response from me. She thought she‚Äôd just throw away some of my cards, take the big stack home with her, and see what I‚Äôd do, assuming that I‚Äôd just take whatever bullshit lie she told me. This was the first time I‚Äôve stood up for myself, ever. The first time I‚Äôve told someone I wasn‚Äôt extremely close with, to not fuck with or lie to me. Even though it ended my employment with my favorite job I‚Äôve ever had, I‚Äôm still proud of myself.
The employee handbook also says ‚Äúfalsification of timekeeping records or assisting others in falsifying timekeeping records‚Äù which I'm pretty sure includes another thing L did to me.
Sometimes when we would forget to clock in/out, we‚Äôd write our name, in/out time, and the date on a sticky note, and put it on the computers for whichever manager to put into the computer. I‚Äôm not sure how long it had been before I realized that my notes were staying up longer than everyone else‚Äôs, but the oldest one I found when I realized, was about 2 months old. So for at least a couple of months, she‚Äôd been entering in every sticky note except mine, throwing them away, and then leaving mine up. until someone eventually assumed they were entered and threw them away. So basically countless shifts, unaccounted for. When I told the district manager, she said she didn‚Äôt think L would do it on purpose, it must have been an accident, because ""that just doesn't sound like L."" But that she‚Äôd help me figure out which shifts were missed and that I could text/call her whenever I needed a shift entered, if it made me more comfortable. This was about a week before I put in my notice.
so my question is: is there anything I can do? Should I try to take legal action, since I know she at least broke the retaliation law in Michigan? And possibly a couple others, is it worth it to try to go through court? Do you guys think there‚Äôs any way I could talk to the DM again and try to get her to understand my side? I miss the dogs so incredibly much, and some of my coworkers. They are always understaffed, and they‚Äôve told me before I‚Äôm invaluable. There is another location that L is hardly ever at, but DM is still also in charge of. The two managers there like me much more than those (L&amp;T) at my original location.",29Oct2020,1

133,"I'm in the last year of an engineering diploma program, and for my capstone project, one of my 3 team mates often writes in broken English, as well as not appearing to be very competent in her work. In conversation, she is fine, apart from having a slight accent (she says she is from Jamaica) and I recognize that many of the countries in the area don't have top tier education systems (compared to Canada) but after 2 years in the program, and an intro communications course, you would think that this wouldn't happen? Its especially bad when she tries to write a technical sounding statement, but it comes out as vapid BS or straight up nonsense. Other times, basic rules of writing are broken. I can post samples if needed, but coaching her through the writing is not a great solution.

Last semester, we had a small assignment together, and I ended up rewriting most of her portion. When she noticed this, I had to explain I wasn't satisfied with the quality of work (don't remember exactly what I said, but I had no easy way to say it tactfully.) She was upset by this, even though I pointed out the exact issues, and explained that I wasn't judging her, but the criticism was still not taken well. This says to me that she might not know how bad her writing is?

This semester, the project is a semester long capstone project, so I won't have time to rewrite her portion, and keep up with my own portions. There is a third teammate, so if it came to that I could get him to help with rewrites, but my preferred solution would be to get her to do better somehow? I'm also not sure how much help the instructor will be willing/able to provide. I'd rather not involve him, but if I can see a positive outcome from it, I'm willing to do it.

I'm not sure if she doesn't realize that she needs to proof read her stuff? Or if her actual writing skills are that bad? How do I talk to her about this? Other general guidance is welcome.

Additional thought: we have a communications course this semester, maybe I can talk to the prof for that? There is also a ""success center"" where you can get help with coursework/proofreading from free tutors. (its all online this year)",29Oct2020,1

138,"Hi! My dilemna is this. I had previously made plans to live with two friends from my freshman dorm. They made this plan with our other friends to live in this complex which is super far from campus. We needed a fourth roommate but couldn't find one. That is until one of them asked another friend who I don't like at all. He's rude and extremely condescending. They asked him without seeing if it was okay with me at first. That is just one of many decisions that were made without checking in with me first, including the apartment complex itself. 

So anyways, my current roommates (I am a sophomore) asked me if I wanted to live with them again next year at a much more desirable apartment and I would much rather live with them. So basically my choice is to live at a place which is much better with people I would rather live with or screw over my friends because it will be very hard to find another roommate. 

Personally I feel that they haven't shown me the fairness which I would expect from a rommate. My parents also don't want me to live at the far apartment complex because I may not have my car and don't want to walk long distances to class. 

I would appreciate some advice on how to handle this situation or tell me what you would do. Thanks guys.",29Oct2020,1

the last real job I held was from 2015-18 and I went though utter hell in that place. In the 3 years I was there I had four managers in my department alone. (I worked at a car dealership) I had a drug addiction, the devil ( a women who would scream and belittle you at the drop of a hat) The social media junkie, and two face.  my last few weeks there at the store I was demoted to a lesser paying position and when I started to settle back in they fired me. (basically humiliated then fired)  

after the hell I went though there i was mentally broken, I had no faith in myself...no confidence. So I took a break from the normal working world and started to drive ride sharing. I did this until the pandemic broke out. I always told myself and others who asked, it was not my forever job but it was where I needed to be at that moment in time.  Uber and Lyft did that for me...I feel better about myself and confidence in the skills I have picked up along the way. 

two days ago I got a call for an interview...it has been five years and one global disaster from my last interview and to be honest I am starting to freak myself out a bit.

151,"My boyfriend thinks I hooked up with a guy double my age

My boyfriend thinks I hooked up with a guy double my age

Is there anything I can do?

I have been dating this guy for almost 3 years now. We are 6 years apart and more experienced. I was 20(f) and he was 26(m). We met from working together at this bar. He is the second guy I dated and the second guy I‚Äôve had sex with. We started off by hooking up and during the time we were hooking he asked me how many guys I‚Äôve slept with, since he was the only second guy I slept with, I lied. I lied because I felt embarrassed and he was this older guy who had so much more experience than me. I said a random number like 4 or 5. Before him, I was with my high school boyfriend for almost 4 years and a couple months after I broke up, I started hooking up with then guy who ended up being my current boyfriend. A year into our relationship, he became very different and he would never tell me what‚Äôs wrong. 

He eventually told me he‚Äôs hurt because I hooked up with this guy double my age while I was hooking up with him and that if he knew he would‚Äôve never dated me. I never hooked up with anyone besides my current boyfriend but he won‚Äôt believe me. He‚Äôs says all our co-workers says it‚Äôs true and all his female friends told him the same thing. I let him go through my old phone and current phone, I let him go through all my Uber trips yet he still refuses to believe me. He says he knows I did it and I‚Äôm lying and he knows I‚Äôll never tell him the truth. Recently he told me he knows for sure because during the time we were just hooking up, he had a hunch and when everyone told him I did, it makes sense. He said it‚Äôs because during the time we were hooking up, I had a ‚Äúgaping vagina‚Äù and once we started dating my ‚Äúvagina closed up‚Äù.

I swear on everything I didn‚Äôt hook up with anyone else but him. I didn‚Äôt not hookup with him because of my loyalty to him or anything. I just didn‚Äôt care to look for someone else to hook up with &amp;amp; we were hooking up so frequent. He doesn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs only the second guy I hooked up with. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do to make him believe me. He says if didn‚Äôt hook up with him then I need to explain why my vagina was like that. I don‚Äôt have an answer for him because I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt even know if my vagina was like that because he bought it up 2 years later.

So we have some really adorable budgies. I was thinking. I paint up a deck really nice with art of our birds and get some nice trucks and wheel things (sorry idk) but I have no idea where to start. He‚Äôs a pretty advanced skater (or at least use to be) so I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself. I want to learn more so I can do this for him! 

-what is the best kind of blank board to use? What wood works best? 
-wheels? Trucks? Good ones? 
-what kind of paint can I use? Is acrylic okay if I have a good top coat?
-what kind of top coat should I use? I want something that will keep the art nice as long as possible even though I understand a skateboard gets abused!

160,"Hi, I'm a 27 year old bisexual transman. I figured out I was trans and came out about a year ago. The thing is, how I dealt with my dysphoria before was really unhealthy. I had this huge disconnect with my body. I kind of ignored it for the most part. However, that's what it took to be able to go on living. Coming out has been the best thing that's ever happened to me, but it was at the price of having to come to terms with my body and be aware of it.

Anyway, to the point,  I've been in relationships before. I was even engaged at one point. I've had sex plenty of times. But keep in mind, I was disconnected. Sex was only tolerable because I disassociated from it.

Now, I'm at a point where I'm afraid to enter into relationships because I feel like sex would come up eventually and I can't imagine letting someone put their hands on me intimately. I'm more aware of my body now and I feel like, even with someone I trusted, I would not feel comfortable with them seeing me naked or touching me like that. The thing is, it's been several years since my last relationship or even hookup and if I wait until after my medical transition is complete, it'll be even more years.

But I wonder, is it wrong that I still have these moments with how long it's been? I feel like most of the time, when someone has a falling out with a friend, they get over it fast.

162,"I became friends with Andrew when I was 15.  He was shy, introverted, but very caring and sweet.  Andrew had some issues with anxiety like myself, sometimes struggling to even leave his house.  

He had a very neglectful upbringing with a dad on drugs, and his mom too worried about whatever guy she was after at the time.  One of the many things we bonded over.  

We were close as you could possibly be for years until he went off to college.  He got mixed up with the wrong people.  And he spent the next couple of years smoking crack, and doing a bunch of illegal shit.  

We talked on and off, but I eventually removed myself from his life temporarily when things got to their lowest point.  Two arrests later, a very emotional abusive relationship, and a stint in the psych ward we slowly reconnected. 

He‚Äôs ‚Äúsober‚Äù now, and doesn‚Äôt talk to those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù anymore.  He also lost his job, and dropped out of college.  When I say sober I mean the crack addiction has stopped, but he has some issues with drinking.  He recently took his grandmothers Valium on a drinking binge and ended up overdosing.  He‚Äôs a lot different now.  

Ever since we reconnected he‚Äôs much colder, and while not totally emotionless I guess to most people he‚Äôd come off as apathetic.  Which he can be, but sometimes his former self slips through the cracks.  But as soon as I point it out he says that person is forever gone, and it only got him hurt being that way. 

He‚Äôs very mean to... pretty much everyone.  Not to me, he says it‚Äôs because he knows me. If he does say something out of line he‚Äôll apologize and try to make up for it in some way.  

I‚Äôm not getting into political stuff on here as everyone is entitled to their own thoughts and feelings, but basically he did a full 180 with those.  And a lot of his views are against me existing as a human being.  Which can be problematic, but it‚Äôs more so alarming how differently he thinks.

He‚Äôll have moments where he says he doesn‚Äôt deserve me as a friend, and shows a lot of gratitude.  And other moments where he asks me when enough is enough, and when I‚Äôll start to view him as the ‚Äúdegenerate‚Äù he is and leave him.  He says he tries pushing me away, because that‚Äôs how he wants it to be.  Not with just me, but everyone. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to be close with anyone so he says.  I feel like the only ‚Äúpositive‚Äù thing at this point is when our conversations can turn a bit sexual.  And he talks about how purity is underrated, and he would love to teach me things. ( I‚Äôm a virgin ) 

I know if you‚Äôve read this far you‚Äôre probably thinking why I even bother at this point.  And it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had feelings for this guy since the very beginning, and being this involved with him would leave me feeling guilty if anything happened to him. 

I was thinking about seeing him soon, we‚Äôve talked about it a lot.  We haven‚Äôt seen in each other in a long time.  The pandemic doesn‚Äôt help anything.  I‚Äôm thinking of going to see him in a couple of weeks, and see where it goes. Idk.
 
I also... have this false hope that‚Äôs slowly going away I guess.  That some day a switch will go off, and he‚Äôll be hopeful again, and some of his former attributes will come back.  I hoped it would when he got off the drugs, and stopped associating with those people.  

It didn‚Äôt happen like I thought.  I‚Äôm slowly starting to accept it‚Äôs never going to happen.  And it hurts so bad.  I feel like my friend died, even though he‚Äôs still physically here.  And what sucks the most is that I never got to say goodbye.",29Oct2020,1

My two options I‚Äôm considering are a stand up mixer for baking because I think baking is pretty neat, and it can follow me forever when I live on my own etc. my second is some water color paints and supplies! I‚Äôve always liked to draw but never really invested in markers etc. I also have an interest in water color painting I‚Äôve seen so many beautiful art works!

170,"Hi, I have never posted anything on here, but I am dealing with a weird situation with my neighbor and I would like some advice. My family and I have been living in our home for almost 6 years. Our neighbor ‚ÄúBob‚Äù is in his mid-forties and lives next door with his parents. Since we have moved in we have done some work to our home that ‚ÄúBob‚Äù had helped us with and we compensated him for it. He has always been a bit weird and very paranoid but we didn‚Äôt mind because he seemed to mean well. A little background on Bob, he has not had a job since long before we lived here, he is a recovering addict, and also has special needs (not sure what it‚Äôs just what he‚Äôs told us)and he is also a pothead.None of that has ever mattered to us because we don‚Äôt judge people, I bring it up because some of it might have to do with the issues I am having and I am not sure how to properly address them because I do not want to upset him in any way.

Around June he started to act strangely, much stranger than usual anyways. He comes over every time we are outside, he never use to do this and we can‚Äôt seem to get any privacy. Bob constantly is screaming and swearing at every car that drives by, for no reason. If a car pulls in one of our driveways to turn around, or looks lost, he thinks they are spying on him. If a helicopter flies over he says they are watching him. He is always telling my fianc√© I have guys over (which is not true at all). On one occasion he was sitting near my daughter and he was telling her about how his ex used all his money to by drugs and fucked him over so he couldn‚Äôt pay rent. Ummm my daughter is 5! Bob is always asking me to hang out or smoke weed, eat edibles etc., I don‚Äôt find anything wrong with people smoking weed, I just don‚Äôt do it, I have family members that were addicts and drugs always were huge no for me. He is constantly saying things like I want what she‚Äôs on..... he is not joking, And it pisses me off. Another time he asked if I saw the tall man who was about 6ft, I said no, he told me it must be the ghost of the civil war guy buried next to my shed......he was serious about this. He has made friends with my dad over the years and I do not have a great relationship with my dad, but I try, he always says you need to forgive and forget..... excuse me? He has no idea what i went through. He told my fianc√© that our garage was broken into 20years ago and it could happen again, this was the same day my fianc√© debut card went missing from his car in the driveway. These are just a few examples, but tonight creeped me out, my fianc√©, his cousin, and Bob were working out and afterwards he told my fianc√© there was something he needed to tell him. He told him I saw your women in the camper last night with another man, she was cheating on you, and she was moaning. I also found out he called my dad and said this. My fianc√© said umm I was home last night and I have security cameras I didn‚Äôt see this, he told my fianc√© the man must‚Äôve ran into the woods, I know what I saw! This really creeped us out. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do because he is not always like this and I feel like he means well most of the time. He really has crossed the line and I don‚Äôt really want him on our property anymore, I just don‚Äôt feel safe. I know he has special needs which makes it harder because I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings. I also don‚Äôt want him to react in a angry way. I am not sure if he is using, or if he has some type of psychological issues but I was thinking of speaking with his parents asking if they know what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm not sure but I need some advice. Thank you",29Oct2020,1
171,"Hey y‚Äôall so I‚Äôm pretty fucked up rn and I‚Äôm falling into depression again. Long story short my ex and I broke up back in September. Him and I where in a relationship for a year and in a LD relationship for about 8 months. He treated me like shit. But I‚Äôm not gonna get into that. Anyways right after I split with my ex I met a really sweet amazing guy and believe it or not we worked together. It was like God did this for a reason. I believe that I was supposed to breakup with my ex just so I can be with him. I also have very low self-esteem and I don‚Äôt know why a guy like him would go for a girl like me anyways We started talking a little but at work until I finally worked up the courage to ask him out and he said yes. (I remember him telling me that he was glad that I asked him out first since it would have took him awhile to ask me out since he‚Äôs shy) So after a few dates we started a relationship and let me tell you he was so much better than my ex. This guy treated me like a Princess. He would always tell me how Beautiful I was even though I would disagree with him. :) so we have such a great time and he even told me I made him happy because back in the day his ex cheated on him and he I guess was in a dark place for awhile. Everything was perfect but up until a few days ago he was changing and I could tell something was off. We dated for a month (and I know a month isn‚Äôt long but I was getting attached) 

Low and behold he dumps me. I saw it coming but not that fast. He told me that it didn‚Äôt seem like we didn‚Äôt have much in common and that we jumped into the relationship to fast even though I thought it was more him going to fast for me. (So I just went along with it) He even said it was premature that we said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù after the third date. But I don‚Äôt get it like he was so in to me but all of the sudden he dumps me. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want to start a new relationship because I knew this would happen. He is also moving back to college so I‚Äôm sure it was either trust issues or he didn‚Äôt want to commit to me while in college. Or maybe it was my self hate about myself and he always had to listen to it. 

My point is how do I cope? I feel like I was used in a way. My last relationship was so fucked up. My ex left me twice and it was just toxic. I finally break up with him (I‚Äôm happy again) I meet this wonderful guy I‚Äôm super happy now he leaves me and now I‚Äôm just depressed. I‚Äôm so sad rn I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Any advice?",29Oct2020,1
172,"Last night I was scrolling on OkCupid and I matched with a cute blonde girl. We started messaging and she suggested a skype call. She started undressing and asked me to as well. Once we were getting into it she stopped and showed she was recording the whole time. She then pulled up my dads Facebook and my grandmothers Facebook. She said if I didn't pay $550 right then she'd send it to everyone on my Facebook that I literally never use and has all my family. I said I was unemployed and I didn't have any money. She lowered it to $350 and again I said I had no more than 10 dollars in my account. We agreed on $100 to be paid via PayPal Friday. I paid her a down payment of $25 on PayPal last night and we've been texting on and off although its mostly me confirming over and over again I would pay her. Interesting to note is when the money was sent to her via PayPal it was converted to Philippine Pesos, and when I asked about that she said her mother was living there and the money was going to her medical payments. Obviously I am really skeptical about that but regardless it doesn't really do anything right now. Also her phone numbers area code is from Cincinnati and I live in Massachusetts but she just said it was her aunties phone beforehand and she was given it. Again doubt but I don't think that really has any impact here. The agreement is that once I pay her she'll skype call me and video share her deleting the video. I'm terrified shes going to screenshare herself sending the video to everyone even after I paid her. I mean I'm literally paying less than 1/5th of what she originally asked for so I don't know if she'll just do that instead. I've slept about 5 hours in the last 2 days.  


what do I do?? I'm going to pay it but what are the odds she posts it to everyone anyway?",29Oct2020,1
173,"I'm using a throwaway account since he knows my usual reddit account.  I (f16) dated this guy (m16)for around a year. Let's call him Kevin. Anyway we ended things over quarantine when he said he needed a mental health break. I completely understood and we stayed best friends. I was devastated obviously because he was my first serious relationship but I got over it in about 2 weeks. However, it's been 4 months and it still stings when he mentions a different girl he likes or when he talks about dating someone else. We never really lost that ""connection"" because he still calls me first thing in the morning to say good morning and he calls me throughout the day just to tell me stupid sh*t. He also still hugs/ cuddles me and our friend group thinks we're still secretly dating. 

I keep telling myself that we're better off as friends anyway but I feel like something inside me still wants him back. 
My friends tell me to get a rebound but I'm not exactly conventionally attractive so thats not very easy. 
One of my friends suggested that maybe I feel that way because Kevin was my first serious relationship and I'm afraid no one else will love me the same.

178,"Hello, it's my first time posting here and I need know if I should do terapy because of this or everyone else is underreacting. I don't have any mental condition.

There's a reality show like Big Brother, but it's in a farm and the contestants are ""famous"" people. I understand the dinamics and edit of reality shows, I've watched some of them, and never experienced anything like that, usually I just enjoy or don't like the contestants, like I'm watching a normal TV show and the people there are characthers, but not in this case. This year there are 2 really famous people there, both horrible but famous singers, Biel and Mirella, and they are the definition of assholes

Not only they are arrogant, narcissistic and dumb but they are nasty. There's another contestant with Borderline Syndrome and her trigger is calling her crazy. They planned along with other people to make a circle around her and scream crazy to her to make her beat them and be declassified. Mirella tried to annoy 2 people to make the same result. Also it is clear the favouritism for them. They constantly break the rules, never are punished and the votes are obviously manipulated, this is because in one of the votes if add it up it was 99% and not 100%

So far, very normal for a reality show but it goes beyond that. Biel beat his girlfriend, everyone knows that, there are hundreds of videos of him beating her and covered in blood, has several accusations of harrasment and run over someone and didn't stop to help. He's 24 and has 6 Million followers. Mirella has Regina George complex, has gone to a school to convince children to stop studying and become a singer like her, gone to a homeless shelter to sing to them her trash music instead of giving them food or money and has lots of accusations of prostituting teenagers, so she promotes pedophilia and prostitution. She is 22 and has 19 million followers. Both have being investigated, but because they are famous, rich and white, nothing happened to them.

They have a big base of followers and I don't understand this. Everytime I mention this people lose their shit to defend them or simply don't care. They are now the most hated ones of the show but still have lots of support and crazy fans, and even people who hate them ignore the fact they promote misoginy, prostitution and pedophilia, they just hate them because ""they attacked my fav"" and forget they have a list on their criminal records. And now because a guy made a kinda misoginistic comment about her, people are trying to protect her at all cost but she said way worse things. It goes like this:

Misoginy and homophobia: you are a horrible person, kill yourself

Racism: that's not racist, you are just a bunch of whiny people who hate her and want an excuse

Promotes pedophilia and prostitution: QUEEEEN!!!

I am very worried with myself for overreacting to a stupid reality show but I just can't handle how they are making more followers and money when they should be on prison with people kicking them and being miserable",29Oct2020,1
179,"I am a sophomore in high school and I run distance for cross country. In my freshman year I got 24th in state. My pr was a 19:03. I was starving myself and only eating 1000 calories per day in order to lose weight to get a good time. I soon fell out of love for running and I began binge eating and weight lifting after the season ended. I gained a lot of weight, I went from 110-140. I really love lifting and my coaches won't let me do it during the xc season. This year I noticed that I had scattering pain going down my leg. I had told my coaches that I had extreme pain after I ran and could barely walk after I ran, they did not pay any attention to it. This is after I had problems with my shins I had to take 2 weeks off just for my shins. The first day back I had to run a 2 mile time trial, I had to stop because I knew I was going to have extreme pain after I ran it. Then I had to get a MRI because they thought I had labral tear. There was no labral tear. When I talked to my coaches they said I could either run through the pain or just quit, so I quit. I'm not sure if this was the best idea but there was no way I would be able to run with that kind of pain. When I stopped running the pain kind of went away. I still feel the pain when I run long distance but when I run 100 meters it does not spark up. I don't want to do xc next year but I would feel like a failure if I didn't do it. I want to do cheer instead of xc. My mom keeps on bringing up how this one time in therapy (2 years ago) I said that I really loved running. But I keep on trying to tell her that I hated how she kept on forcing me to do softball so I felt pressured into picking legit any other sports. She would feel really disappointed in me if I didn't do xc next year but every time I do it I have to stop lifting and then I have to start from the bottom again. I was really good at it but distance is hell for me and I get really sad every time I have to start lifting. Help",29Oct2020,1

185,"Hey all- I recently had to leave my last job editing videos due to my girlfriend and I planning to move back home because her parents got a divorce and we couldn't afford to live in the city we were living in prior to that.

Since moving I've applied to a handful of jobs both in my field, and in entry level tech support and haven't had any luck. I'm generally demotivated and very pessimistic about my chances of landing a job at this point, even if I manage to get one, I don't think I'm qualified enough to really succeed or have the motivation to excel at this point. 

I worked really hard in my life to get the job I left in order to move for my girlfriend like we were planning, and now I just don't have any motivation to go through all that effort again. Especially because of my student loans. I have a friend who joined Navy a while ago and he seems to be doing well but also posts about his struggles in the navy, though he seems to have a real sense of purpose in life, which I'm lacking at the moment.

I've thought about joining the Navy, because I'm 27 and relatively in shape, and like the idea of having advanced degrees paid for by the Navy after enlisting. I have a few family friends who are older that served, and I have been thinking about asking them as well as my friend about their experiences, but wanted to reach out to people here before doing so because my girlfriend doesnt think I should do it/would like it.

I've also been regretting buying a lot of video games, digital ones being the biggest, because I don't play them as often as I use to think I would and I'm not able to sell them to someone else who would like them more. At the same time I feel perfectly fine and glad I got them so I don't know how to feel. 

What comes out of both of these is the fact that for some I begged my parents to buy for me or let me buy it, and it seems like I've made them waste money on something that doesn't matter. Also, whenever I start thinking of many of the other things I own, I realize how little I actually use them such as a graphing calculator I've really only used a bit last year that was around $100 or notebooks that get used up half way for one class and never get used up completely so it just ends in a waste of paper and money

I also can't decide what I want my future career to be, something I always thought would be in music but I realized that I haven't prepared my self for and made my parents spend loads of money on and I don't even know if I still want to do it or what else I want to do, and at the same time I don't feel that stressed anymore

I also feel like all I do is waste time watching anime, playing video games, and being on social media, but there isn't anything else that there is to do, especially with covid not allowing me to see friends and don't text them that often. 

I think I've written a lot but I just want to know why I feel this way, and why I keep going between feeling two ways. If anymore information is needed, I have two posts talking about most of this.

tl;dr: I don't know if the same hobbies interest me anymore but at the same time I feel like they do. Regret purchases that make me feel like I made my parents waste money on. Don't know what I want to study after high school and feel like I'm wasting my time despite not knowing what to do with it.",29Oct2020,1
198,"I started my undergrad in a very theoretical field with the objective of pursuing research at grad school. However, I struggled with finding the right research opportunities, and decided to focus on getting a decent job instead (started off in a community college). I took industry-geared coursework that I clearly wasn't very good at just to make myself more 'marketable'. To add to that, everyone around me supported the idea of preparing for an industry job instead of a research career in a niche and nascent field. Most importantly, I didn't have the confidence to stick by my goals and convictions, so I just went along. During my final year, I finally got into a lab that allowed me to do research in the area that I had been wanting to work on. During the last six months of my undergrad, I also had the opportunity to work with two influential faculty in the field that I love, and ended with a publication in a reputed journal.

However, merely one year of research experience is insufficient to get me into a grad program (PhD). Plus a masters' degree is not an option in my field. After graduating, I applied to several opportunities at research labs but didn't really get through because of mismatch in research interests/experiences, lack of funding, visa requirements etc. (even got to the interview stage with some labs but never heard from them AFTER scheduling interviews). I ended up getting hired at a company that works in a VERY different and highly technical domain, and they hired me on the basis of a few courses that I took during undergrad (these courses equipped me with only the very basic skills that I can apply to this job). I don't understand anything ‚Äì the work is extremely technical and requires a decent theoretical background, which I really don't have. I'm an actual imposter here, and will definitely get fired sooner or later.

I've hit a dead-end ‚Äì instead of working on getting better at the field that I'm passionate about, I'm working in a job that offers me no prospects. I don't think I will get into grad schools with my current credentials, and the job I'm in does not improve my profile (instead, it might work against me). I don't see a future in the job that I'm working in ‚Äì I'm unprepared for it and really don't find it interesting.

I'm really scared and confused about my future ‚Äì would appreciate any advice on this!",29Oct2020,1

I just wanted to point some things out in a way which will allow me to edit things and perhaps express myself in a more constructive way, its very easy to get heated in an argument and i thought that maybe writing things down, listening to music might make me say other things that i wouldn't normally say.

Music inspires me and makes me think differently, so maybe it'll help.

201,"I‚Äôm about to undergo a major surgery in the coming month. I‚Äôm working on all the details of it still and naturally like in pre-CoVID times, my immediate family want to come stay at our house to help. My husband will be able to take off work and quarantine with me, and one of my lifelong friends who works remote 100% committed to quarantining for 2 weeks and being tested before driving over to help. 

My siblings have been traveling and will be around my surgery time too. They live way out of state so they can‚Äôt just quarantine at home and drive over. They also work in offices and live in major urban neighborhoods so their exposure risk is very high. My parents are teachers in school (not remote) out of town and god bless them but they talk about watching kids pick their noses and teeth and stuff all day. The worst part is I‚Äôve seen both of them doing unhygienic stuff without even realizing it. Like taking off their mask to rub their nose with their hand or sneeze.  When one of them got sick with a fever and cold symptoms recently, they wouldn‚Äôt quarantine from each other and still shared living spaces, didn‚Äôt disinfect the shared areas, and decided on their own that as long as one of them wore a mask the other didn‚Äôt need to. 

All in all my husband and my BFF will truly be enough help and they‚Äôre low risk with the precautions and testing they‚Äôll take. We also have to be cautious I don‚Äôt get it and give it to them too of course. But my family just terrifies me. I love them, they love me and they want to help but I can‚Äôt have them come and stay here in my small home and put me and husband/bff at risk of a horrible health catastrophe. 

How do I go about explaining why BFF can come but I need them to stay away without implying they‚Äôre dirty or something?  It‚Äôs so hard to picture saying I know you mean well but I don‚Äôt think that you can quarantine and protect yourself properly in order to keep me safe. There‚Äôs really nowhere else for them to stay after travel to quarantine first and be tested because most of the extended family nearby are older and high risk. But either way they just are too unknowingly careless.

I did have a very abusive and traumatic upbringing and i know that would explain a lot of the difficulties, but even then i feel like something isn‚Äôt right.

207,"I have been struggling with panic disorder and severe depression and anxiety for several years now. I'm living at home right now in a room separate from the rest of the house. Living in the house are 5 other people, two couples and my mom. Our family has two dogs and a cat, all of which I love with my whole heart, but I am not their first choice. My cat *only* sits with my mom, and my dogs will always choose her over me. I'm not bitter about this, she is their mom too, their source of love and safety in their home. I'm just jealous of that bond. Don't get me wrong, the animals love me too. They get up to greet me when I come into the house every morning, they come when I call them (always with a happy dance) and will follow me from room to room. All three pets are over 10 years old. Within the last year or so, the couples moved in and brought along their young cats. We've had problems with them shredding our chairs with their claws and them peeing on blankets and assorted laundry, but overall, their company is lovely. They chirp happily at us when we give them love, but only sit or sleep with their parents. In the house we have three cats and two dogs, and my mom has said for years that she doesn't want any more pets, especially after our very much loved dogs and cat pass away. 

Over the past year I have looked into several different options for a pet that I could get. Snakes, are very cute, but live quite a long time and can't give you very much emotional support. Bunnies require a lot of space and their living spaces are often smelly. I'm very afraid of birds. Fish are lovely but not exactly cuddly. I don't have the space or energy to adopt a dog. Ideally, I'd love to adopt an adult cat. However, my main living space is a very small room in the backyard, and the question is whether or not I could move my kitty back and forth from the house as I do. Where would I keep her litter box? Would I move it? What if her food and water is in my room and she can't get to it? I don't want to put a cat through that confusion, not to mention that she would have to adjust living with two dogs. I've brought the subject up to my mom several times, but she gets upset and frustrated when I talk about adopting a cat. She doesn't want to take care of another animal, and I understand completely. Almost every night my mom or I have to clean up cat vomit or dog poop in the kitchen or living room, and I don't think I would be able to be constantly cleaning up bodily fluids. 

The other day my mom and I took our older dog to the vet for a check up, and I walked over to the reptile section of the store. There were 4 or 5 baby bearded dragons sitting on their little rocks. One handsome fellow marched right up to the glass and stared right back at me. I was happy with our little staring contest, but then I wanted to cry. I want so badly to bond with a pet. I watch the a cat that I have loved for over 10 years sit and sleep and love my mom, and only my mom, so much, and I am jealous. I see one of the couples' cats get so excited when they get home from work, and only snuggle up with her parents. The other cat sits at the other couple's door, ready to be let in or follow if they come out. It kind of hurts my heart.

AND I went out of my way to practice a fiddly skill that I was struggling with until I was confident I could do it while customers are waiting. 

I don't think of myself as a stupid person or someone who struggles to learn. I'm doing science at uni, and have had a 15-year career before this in web development. 

BUT. My managers can NOT seem to grasp that we aren't all born knowing this stuff. That it has to be learnt! They are constantly frustrated with me. Constantly panic when more than two people come into the store at once (and take it out on me by saying things like 'NO! What are you doing?!'). And it just generally seems like I'm driving them nuts. But then sometimes, when they've calmed down, they say, 'You're doing well.' 

I come away at the end of my shift feeling like an idiot. That I'm unteachable, thick, and just plain dumb.

I have been struggling a lot with school, I'm in my first year of university for computer science, and recently I have been debating that choice; my passion is music, but there isn't nearly as many opportunities in music as there are in computer science. This has led me to be uninspired to show up to my classes. Because of that, I started to fall further and further behind which led me to become overwhelmed. Prior to this, I already had awful sleeping habits (issues with falling asleep, for the most part) but because of the stress and anxiety from school, it's gotten a lot worse. Before school, I could at least get somewhere near the recommended 6-9 hours of sleep. Now, I can't tell you the last time I had that much sleep.

On top of that, I started working part time to pay for tuition and other personal projects, which added to my restlessness, and some work-related rumors about me started popping up which added to my anxiety, and my manager had a talk with me about it, even though I never did what the rumors said. 

To remedy this, I had a talk with my advisor, and she recommended me to my school's mentoring program which I signed up for to help managing my time and catching up with school work, and as for my work issues, I will just do my job to the best of my ability and hope the rumors stop, if not then I will talk with my manager about it before it becomes a larger issue. As for my sleep issues, I have no idea what I will do.

I am under suspicion that a lot of these issues come from mental health issues, but when I asked my parents if I could go to therapy to have these issues addressed and clear up any confusions about it and maybe get a diagnoses if I *do* have some mental health issues, they just said no.

Did I do the right thing to address these issues? What else should I do?

Bad friend is hooking up with my Tiffany‚Äôs ex of 5 years and lied to her about it while cheating on her boyfriend of 4 years.

I let my landlord know right away, and it's been on the work order list for 28 days now.

Any temporary solutions that might work to at least get my package? It's a collectors item that is in high demand and sold out, so if it goes back to the seller (Target), I might never be able to get it.

Contacted the seller, Target, and they said they can't change it and to contact Fedex... So besides sitting in my car outside my building all morning tomorrow, I'm not sure what else I can do.

Any ideas to at least get this package are greatly appreciated! Thank you!",29Oct2020,1
227,"This is pretty long and idk if it goes to this but here it goes

The issue: My(26f) brother (23m) asked how I would feel about our father being at his wedding. He said he wouldn‚Äôt invite him if I said no because I‚Äôm more important. I wanted to talk to my mom about it, to express my feelings, but as soon as I mentioned him being there all she kept repeating no and that she would refuse to go. 

The reason: I don‚Äôt have a relationship with my father. When I was 13 my father did something to me that he shouldn‚Äôt have (could have been a lot worse). At 17 the truth came out and he was arrested but I couldn‚Äôt relive what happened to me to strangers especially since the cops that interviewed me asked what I was doing that made him do what he did. Also all my life I dealt with anxiety and depression. Also during this time my mom and I had a bad relationship( almost went NC and then she moved away and that distance helped our relationship). And at 14 I started to self-harm, it was my addiction. As well as dealing with an eating disorder.... I had a rough childhood. At 17 I contemplated suicide while I was at school because I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with anything and I was in so much pain. As soon as I had the thought I ran to my teacher, showed her my arms and got help. The thought scared me. My brother was NC until several years ago. He hangs with our older brother and our father lives with him. My brother doesn‚Äôt know what happened. We never told him. All he knows is that he did something bad to me. My brother was angry for the longest because he believed he failed in protecting me. He does what he can to watch out for me now. 

The feelings: of course my mom hate our father. That‚Äôs understandable. He hurt her baby. What he did was unforgivable. For the longest I did too. It took a long time for me to let go of that anger and hatred. It wasn‚Äôt healthy for me. I finally forgave myself. I forgave myself for hurting myself physically, emotionally and mentally and since doing that I have gotten better. I still relapse sometimes with self harming. My father wrote a letter to me last year saying I did right for telling the police ( it wasn‚Äôt me. I don‚Äôt know who did). Idk how I would feel about him being there. The thought of him now makes me sad. All the what if‚Äôs. Sad how he has a sick soul. I would never let that get in the way of him and my brother though. He never did anything wrong to him. I‚Äôm just confused now I‚Äôm what to tell my brother. If I say no then it‚Äôs no but he‚Äôs confused too on if he wants him there. And of course if he comes our mother will not. Which means she will miss the chance of seeing her only son get married. 

This is kinda all over the place. I don‚Äôt know what to do, what to tell him. I don‚Äôt even know how to feel. Though there is slight anxiety. I want to say that I am willing to push all of it aside if my brother really wants him there but at the same time I haven‚Äôt seen him in 10 years. What if I have a breakdown?

Also, as I say, I am 2 months ‚Äúsober‚Äù. I‚Äôve had the urge and some anxiety attacks and depression episodes but I‚Äôm holding on. My son(4 months) gets me through.",29Oct2020,1

229,"I‚Äôm (16f) and I grew up with many pets. I had a golden retriever named Buddy when I was a kid. Unfortunately, we had to give him away when we moved. This was years ago. We moved into my current town, and we got a puppy for my dad. He was a mix of a King Charles and Japanese chin. Really sweet dog, then a year or two later we got my mom a golden retriever puppy. We named him Buddy. We had these two dogs forever(like 7 or 6 years, Buddy is only like 4). Until recently my mom left and my Dad not only gave Buddy away, but didn‚Äôt tell anyone until we asked where he was. The King Charles died a little bit ago and I lost my kitten two months before. That is 3 pets in the span of two months. He doesn‚Äôt seem remorseful and gets upset when I mention Buddy. The people said we could visit but my dad never said who he gave Buddy too. He also has pointed at two different houses saying ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs there.‚Äù I really miss him and I am really lonely. Buddy was so sweet and cuddly. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

236,"It's kind of my fault but he exaggerated things. He asked my opinion and I said ""I don't know"" twice, just because I didn't want to explain myself (I wasn't sure how). At the end of the class he told everyone that he didn't want us to respond like that, and that we have to think, why would we ever want to be at school if we don't want to think?, that it was a disrespect for him... And he just started rambling and said some curse words that made me feel so, so stupid and so humiliated. He didn't mention me, but it was painfully obvious he was referring to me.

I've been trying my best all year, doing a lot of stuff for my ""personal growth"", learning and reading more than ever before, but it's never enough. He actually thought good things of me and my work before, but today he said ""if you (we) answer me ""idk"", I'll put you at zero, I don't care if i had you at nine"" (idk if this makes sense in english, but he meant that he had a good image of me, but with this sort of things, that can change). This is the first time he has ever reacted like that, and it was my fault.

My friends didn't help either, as one of them said that ""he got mad (at me) too"", god I just felt so stupid. I couldn't think of anything to say.

Maybe now it's me who it's exaggerating, and maybe it's not a big deal, but I feel like a complete shit. I've been feeling a little depressed since the last weekend, there are some things that I felt again that I didn't for a long time, and this was the cherry on the top.

I feel like this was a reminder that I'm still a piece of crap that knows nothing. I have a really low self-esteem, I struggle to see myself in a non-negative way, or to think non-negative thoughts, but I've been feeling pretty good this year, except for just some bad days. I actually thought my depression was over.

This is the worst mental breakdown I had this year, I really feel like I want to be alone, and entertain myself with shit like youtube, reddit or tiktok forever. I don't feel like doing anything for school, or talking ever to my friends. This is not the first time, but it's the first in a lot of time. I feel I'm back at being depressed and being a loser that doesn't do anything good with her life, or that is never going to archieve anything.

Maybe instead of ""my professor made me feel bad"" this is more like a ""help I'm back on my bullshit how do you move forward again"".

His front half seemed ok, but his back half not so much. During this, the neighbors who saw me ran over, began to search for his owner, and was calling around to emergency animal hospitals. Right when we finally got an animal hospital that would take him, the owner finally responded. She ran out with her kids. The way the kids looked at me.  I was already sobbing and holding the dog.

243,"My friend recently came out to me as bi. And it's been a bit of mixed rollercoaster, because I didn't know how to react. Have you seen when Micheal Scott kinds just like looks detached and like is confused. That was me. Now I never excluded him in anyway, we still talked about things and whatnot. Still a good friend of mine, I respect him dearly. But that's not why I'm making this post. It's because lately he's been exhibiting some strange behaviour like constantly making suicide jokes, making jokes about how he wants to hit his brother, and just more. Another close friend of mine reached out to him and said that we're here for him and that if he needs anything we're here, and my friend (bi one) acted very strange. He went on this like mumble rant about how no one understands him, and how he'll be fine. He became very detached from the conversation. What I do know is that his father and him don't get along. His Dad beats him often for no reason at all, there'll be times when we're talking on discord and then you just hear him yell""No Dad No"" and smacking noises happen. And I can tell he doesn't like brother as his brother is close and his Dad idolizes his brother. And I guess maybe he's jealous of it but I do know one thing, he is not good mentally. He went to go see a therapist for his issues but his Dad pulled him out for the belief that nothing was changing. And I forgot to mention that his Dad found out he was Bi and his Dad hasn't handed it very well. His Dad beats him often because of it. And this carries on to him. But my concern how do I help him. He's in a fragile place mentally, and he had admitted to being very fragile he hides it behind jokes but its clear to see. So how do I help this bi Friend? I'd want to help him because he's a good friend that I sincerely respect. I don't want to lose him.

For context I don't really like my last name, or the family it represents. I also don't want any relatives to contact me because I have said last name.

In case you want some backstory, I have an extremely tense relationship with my family on that side, and I don't want to be associated with them. Another reason I want to change my last name is because if my family members hear what I want to do with my life, they can easily sabotage me, and I would not be able to have the career I've always dreamed of.

Right now, I'm under eighteen, and won't be eighteen for a few years, so I've got some time to think about if I actually want to do it, and if I do what it would be. (I don't want to change it before I'm eighteen) My parents would most likely be okay with it, but probably a little disappointed that I'm giving up the name. 

If I were to change it, it probably wouldn't be close to anything from either side of my family, so I'd have to come up with something new, probably from a tv show or book.

246,"I've been having issues with my hands for a few years now. At first they thought I had thrombophlebitis, then some nerve issue.. a few dozen tests later its looking really likely that I have Vasculitis and that this will be a chronic issue ill be dealing with for life and not something that can be fixed with surgery or physiotherapy. Because i'm young (26) my doctor can't put me on steroid treatments for very long due to the long term health issues that chronic steroid use can bring on.   
When I took the first round of treatments I felt a lot better, the issues didn't really go away but it was more tolerable. I was able to hold a pen, spoon, cub and type on my laptop without the excruciating discomfort I usually have. But after the course of steroids had run out, the issues have come back full swing. The specialists/doctor don't want to put me on any immunosuppressive medications yet as that can cause more issues as well. But its left me feeling pretty hopeless.   


I love art, I use to draw very regularly and make money from my work. But now Im struggling to draw at all. There are weeks where I cant pick up a pencil at all. I feel so defeated. I got let go from job recently, partly due to covid and the company having to downsize staff but partly due to my performance issues. My hand means I cant use a mouse or type with ease or agility like I used to be able to so a task that would ordinarily take an hour, could take me double or even triple the time. I had told my boss about these ongoing issues but they where pretty unimpressed, and I get the feeling they didn't believe. Mind you.. the veins in my hands bulge and are a deep blue, you can even see the pulse in them, they've become so inflamed its pretty hard to look at my hands and think they look normal.  


Now jobless, I have no idea what to do with my life. Art was everything. But thats no longer an option, I cant sustain working as an artist and be consistent with this illness. It's crap because most jobs require some kind of manual labour or typing on a keyboard and using a mouse etc. I don't even know where to start in terms of finding a new interest/hobby and job and also grieving something that was so important to me.

Well the relationship ended.

254,"I met this man on an anonymous app and our conversations at the beginning was pretty good, we seemed to have a good connection. I remember him sending me pictures of himself and me initially thinking he was low-key alittle ugly so I friendzoned him and told him that I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship. When I sent him a picture of myself, he thought I was cat fishing him (not to sound cocky but I wasn‚Äôt) so he told me to send him a Live Photo of myself. The problem was that I was already in a bath when I was texting him so I got up, dressed, took a quick picture and sent it to him. He wanted to meet up straight away which was mistake number one, never meet up with strangers you meet online straight away especially since you don‚Äôt know who they actually are. Btw for further context, I‚Äôm not a child nor am I a teenager, I‚Äôm 23. 

Anyways, I don‚Äôt remember if I met up with him on the same day or the next day but anyways I remember getting dressed and meeting up with him at the shisha bar section of a restaurant I had already been to before, with friends, of course. I had to go through this weird entrance which is like an alleyway but isn‚Äôt (don‚Äôt worry there were people around and it was broad daylight). I have really good recall of people‚Äôs faces but it took me a while to recognise him because he was sat facing away from the entrance. I had to walk around until I saw him. Normally I keep my cool when meeting guys online but for some reason I felt butterflies in my stomach. He looked way more handsome in real life!

We talked, he told me the real reason why he was on that site - something about it being a joke with his friends, I honestly don‚Äôt remember. The conversation wasn‚Äôt as connecting as the conversation on the anonymous chat, if anything it was superficial enough to be forgotten about. I really felt like I should‚Äôve just blocked him and kept it moving but for some reason, I got his Snapchat. We took a funny 5 min taxi to the park, and as we were in the taxi he turned to face me. I got giddy, sensing finally things are about to get interesting. He suggested truth or dare and I agreed. The game was pretty boring in the taxi since we couldn‚Äôt do much, but when we got off and at the park I walked past a fenced off area and I dared him to jump over. He refused, then I dared him to kiss me. 
Okay now that I think about it, I don‚Äôt remember any of the dares or truths he gave me just mine. He was shy at first but when we got to a secluded part of the park, he leaned down (he‚Äôs 5ft8 I‚Äôm 5ft3) to kiss my forehead and hand. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚ÄùI said 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He was confused as to what I wanted so I said ‚Äúlet me show you‚Äù and pulled him in for a kiss which got hot and heavy. 

One thing bothered me, well several things. He saw his cousin walking his dog and suddenly told me to stop because he thought he saw his cousin. I turned to look, ngl his cousin was fit af. Another thing that bothered me was when he shushed me and started walking away from me, pacing back and forth when his dad/mum called him. I wanted to piss him off so when before he got me a taxi home, I told him I thought his cousin was fit and that if he didn‚Äôt treat me right I would move to his cousin. (Firstly he‚Äôs just a friend, we‚Äôre not in a relationship so chill and secondly I could never move to my guys family members or friends).



On the second time we met up, I told him my abaya was slightly ripped and I didn‚Äôt realise so beforehand I told him to get a needle and thread from his house as I was already omw. I left the bus to a business industrial area and got lost. Luckily there were two men whom I asked for directions. When I got to his office and he gave me alittle office tour, then I told him to give me the needle and thread he bought and went into his little office bedroom, told him not to come in or peek and shut the door. Before I stripped, I checked to see if there were any cameras installed, luckily there weren‚Äôt and stripped. Never have I felt more exposed and vulnerable in my life then in this moment since the bedroom door had no lock.


I tried to sew as quickly and efficiently as possible, got dressed and went into his office. We spoke about what we liked, our interests and then I got curious and asked about his browser history on his computer. He showed me everything, nothing suspect and told me how to access deleted history.

‚ÄúEven porn?‚Äù I asked 
And he just gave me a shocked look, I think he thought I was innocent enough to not watch any of that stuff. Oh please, this is the 21st century. 

We flirted for abit and ended up in his office bedroom. I was sat nervously at the edge of the bed while he was lying on it. He patted the bed and I walked toward it and lay down next to him. Then he moved me closer so my back was pressed against his chest and he started drawing shapes on my belly, slowly touching my breasts. He told me if I wanted his hand to go lower and I kept saying lower and lower since I wanted him to touch my catüòâ I turned to him, looked him dead in the eye with as much seduction as I can muster and kissed him. 

After a while, I decided I was hungry and told him let‚Äôs go eat. We got a taxi and as we were walking he told me he knew what I was trying to do and I just smiled. I was heavily turned on. When we got in the taxi, he started speaking Urdu to the taxi driver and then started trying to put his finger in my mouth, to tease me but I wasn‚Äôt having it. I just wanted to put my mask on because unlike him.

On thing I need to note that‚Äôs a consistent trend here, every time we meet up it‚Äôs at a shisha place and he almost never orders a meal (his excuse- I‚Äôm going for a family brunch or I ate earlier on) it‚Äôs always just a drink and shisha and he never lets me split the bill. 

We hooked up three times in a hotel room but never had s*x. It got to the point where I told him I wanted to be more than friends and he just wanted to be friends so I blocked him. Instead of moving on like any normal person, I unblocked him. We sexted and when I asked if there was potential he said he only saw me as a friend, he didn‚Äôt want a relationship because his racist Pakistani family would never let me, a black girl, marry him so he thought a relationship would be pointless. We fought about this and I would block and unblock him. I blocked and unblocked him over a extended duration of three months that we‚Äôve been talking off and on.

Deep down I know I really like him. There‚Äôs something about his energy and vibe that I really like, he doesn‚Äôt give me everything like most guys do and gives just enough to want more. I know good things in life take hard work but I really wish he could stand up to his parents and actually just let us be potentially more than just friends.

Any advice?",29Oct2020,1
255,"I'm running out of options but, I'm starting to spiral downwards and lose hope once again.. in highschool for context

I've always been uncomfortable at home but, it's intensified the past 4 years ever since my brother left the household. My parents have been focusing on me all the time and I never get a chance to breath. They, more like my dad, watches my every action and if I do something he doesn't like... He gets pissed. I don't like it when he's pissed because I feel like he's pissed almost all the time. He will yell and try to make me feel like everything is my fault and I'm hurting him so bad with what I'm doing. Like how once I got a B on a honors science test and he flipped out on me... Telling me that I couldn't do the honors work, that I wasn't good enough for it, and that as soon as we got home (this took place while we were driving) He was going to call my science teacher and tell her to stop giving me honors work.. I cried and he didn't care but that's nothing our of the ordinary.. He actually did call her and was going to tell her such things until she started to say how proud she was of me for doing work several grades above me. He apologized but now I see that he expects me to get everything right or else I'm not ""smart enough"".. he keeps setting me higher and higher standards.. After that day, I have gotten very bad test anxiety and I doubt myself academically. 
Besides that, he accused me of being on drugs after I pulled an all nighter. Sure, I should have gone to bed but I was binging a tv show. For reference, I was about 11? At this time.. he knew I had no friends and lived pratically in the middle of nowhere with no possible way to get drugs. He said that him and mom thought I was on drugs.. and when I cried... Telling him I was not..he said that he doesn't know that.. My dad has worked with recovering men who drink or do drugs for years.. He knows the signs and still thought I was on drugs..
He tried to take our dog away because I was not taking care of her...She didn't starve, I gave her baths and let her sleep with me. I was in a bad headspace and didn't give the most affection but it wasn't just my dog.. nothing to warrant a dog being taken away. .. He told me to take Sandy with me in the car to take her back to the place we got her and my mom didn't bother to say anything against it. After he ran outside after she was inside the car to tell me to bring her back in... He gave me a talking to about how mentally it would have messed her up if I gave her up.. like it was my fault. He also brought up the true reason why he was acting this way, because he felt like I had been treating him poorly. I should have been kinder but, I wasn't disrespectful and always did what he asked. He said ""Am I a bad father? Did I do something wrong? Do you not want me to be your dad? Would you be better with someone else"" and things like that.. 
I am not an affection oriented person and told my dad that I didn't like hugs. I don't, truthfully but he got pissed real fast. He gave me the cold shoulder and called me into his office many times to talk to me about how much I hurt his heart... It got really bad and I had to lie saying I didn't mean it after a few days because my mom told me to or else he'd keep giving me the cold shoulder. I don't want him to touch me like hugging or anything but he would be upset If I told him.
I used to tell him all the time how I felt and what made me uncomfortable but they always brush off how I feel or what makes me uncomfortable and just tell me to get thicker skin. They brushed off me getting bullied at school (they fought more for me to get in the honors class) names I didn't like being called, the hug thing, my medical problem, me being sick (I've been feeling sick for the past few weeks and my mom has just said ""you're always sick"" or that she doesn't know what's wrong instead of taking me to a doctor) and everything pratically. So I don't tell them anything like how awful I feel mentally. Or how I'm gay because I'm not sure if they would kick me out or try to fix it (they're homophobic)
Those are just a few examples but I'm scared of my dad honestly. He's never been physically abusive but I still can't help to fear him. Everyday, I walk on eggshells at home all the time and fear what I say or do may set him off... I try to gauge his moods but it's so hard to and it seems like no matter what I do I always upset him and it's my fault... After all, he always tells me he loves me and jokes with me.. whenever mention something I don't like they do, he also gives me the ""look what I do for you, I could be a bad dad but I'm not"" talk.. I appreciate what's he's done for me truly.. I just dread coming home from school, and I do dread school as well... I don't have anyone who really cares except my one online friend..I don't have many friends, I have moved schools almost every year these past 5 years.

Mentally, I don't want to be here or alive really... I have felt this way for years. I am so paranoid, anxious and just filled with suspicion against everyone around me because I feel that it's me against the world... That I have to look out for myself or nobody else will.. my online friend and I to some degree agreed that I should go to the school counselor about my mental health but I don't know if my parents would get upset or mad if it came back to them. I really scared but I don't want to feel this way anymore. Should I send the email? And what about my situation? Am I just in the wrong and my parents are right? What is the best course of action? I don't know.. thanks for reading this far.",29Oct2020,1
256,"Just something i need help with and spill. My younger cousin (female) who i grew up with and was really close to blocked me on all forms of social media recently. Such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. I tried to add her on Facebook the day before yesterday, and i checked on her account to find i can't send her anymore requests. On Snapchat, she flat out blocked me. On Instagram, she has multiple accounts but won't accept my request, or blocks me. I'm done trying, if she want's to be like that, so be it. I'm not gonna call her out about it or ask her about it if we see each other in person again. It just strikes me as odd, because we were both pretty close growing up and did a lot of things together and went to each other's birthday parties and such. It kinda hurts that she would come at me like that and act like i'm a stranger online. Anyone know why she's doing this?",29Oct2020,1

260,"So as the heading says, I have no idea what I am/want to do with my life. 

I (20m) am extremely depressed, unmotivated and can‚Äôt seem to keep concentrated or interest in absolutely anything I do. I have a job currently but I‚Äôm only in my 4th week and starting to lose interest and motivation.

For a bit of background, I‚Äôm 1 of 6 kids to the same mother with 4 different dads between us. Mum drank, smoked and did stupid stuff while pregnant and we all have a predisposition to mental health problems. The eldest is Aspergers, 2nd eldest is a drug addicted schizophrenic, 3rd (me) is depressed but the most functional, the 4th is a recovered drug addict, the 5th is autistic and the youngest has ADD and some other issues.

We were all subjected to emotional and verbal abuse, I was sexually abused by a family member, my drug addicted brother caused a lot of problems including but not limited to:
Getting into fights
Doing drugs in front of me
Getting into a fight with stepdad
Being thrown of a bridge (I watched)
Shooting up in front of me
Cause my stepdad to narrowly miss being stabbed by a druggow on my sisters birthday
Much more

I‚Äôve been out of home since 15 and I‚Äôve struggled greatly with depression, anxiety and alcohol. I‚Äôve always held a job but can‚Äôt seem to find a job that doesn‚Äôt bore me or make me depressed. I‚Äôve tried 10 different industries and still haven‚Äôt found my niche.

The only reason I‚Äôm still alive is because I don‚Äôt want to traumatise my younger sisters. That‚Äôs it. I have a partner who I care dearly about but I struggle with expressing emotions so we have some ups and downs.

What the fuck do I do? How do I fix myself? I‚Äôve tried therapy, didn‚Äôt work. Tried taking some time off work, didn‚Äôt work. Tried moving away from home, didn‚Äôt work. Tried being single, didn‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll be a depressed, anxious no life for the rest of my days if I don‚Äôt find something to do with myself.

What do I do?",29Oct2020,1
261,"TL:DR - Neighbours made relentless amounts of noise, I cracked down on it. They got upset, started being petty. Now they are opening there window and talking to whoever knocks on my door.


Shortly before the UK went into lockdown back in March, I moved into a new flat. What was once a terraced house has been converted into two flats; I moved in to the upstairs flat. 

My immediate neighbours below are typical wannabe hippies. They wear the clothes, put on the stoned voice but it‚Äôs very clear they come from very middle class backgrounds and have never had any form of discipline. I won‚Äôt reveal their real names, but I refer to them as John and Yoko to my friends, so we‚Äôll stick with that. 

From day one, John and Yoko were a pain in my arse; loud music each and every day until the very early hours of the morning, obnoxiously loud sex moans, having extremely loud conversations as if they were shouting from one room to another and having no respect for myself or any other direct neighbours. 

After many months of trying to be polite about it, I finally broke. After many sleepless nights and rude awakenings, I confronted John after they turned the music up after I complained to them. Yes I may have been visibly angry, but I did not say anything threatening or show any signs of aggression toward them. I kept two metres apart, and told them very bluntly how things were going to roll out. 

I also sent a big email to our mutual landlord with recorded evidence attached after the confrontation just in case they decided to run to them chatting rubbish about me. 

Afterward the confrontation; the music stopped, as did the obnoxious moans but they decided they were going to play the petty game. Because of their nature, they don‚Äôt like authority, it‚Äôs all part of their mentality. They figuratively see me as ‚Äúthe man‚Äù telling them what they can and can‚Äôt do so they must get their revenge. 

So now they are making noise to disturb me, but they‚Äôre being tactical about it. Turning the washing machine on at 3am, making sporadic bursts of banging on my wall in the middle of the night when they think I‚Äôm asleep and so on. 

Really childish shit, and recently what I‚Äôve found most annoying of all; they keep intercepting people who knock at my door and try to speak to them usually about me gaslighting them into believing that I‚Äôm the one being out of order here. They‚Äôve done it to friends, my mother and even delivery drivers. 

They tried to claim to my mother that I had ‚Äúthrown a punch‚Äù at him and broke their fence when I confronted him that day, and all sorts of other tripe painting them as the victims in the situation and as if I‚Äôm some sort of brute. 

Overall I‚Äôm stuck on what to do. They truly believe that they are in the moral high ground and that they‚Äôre good people when all the ever think about is themselves. Should I talk to them? Or should I avoid them and bang on the walls back when they try this petty stuff?",29Oct2020,1

264,"When I was a kid I lived in a small community. I was the best at everything and everyone told me things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so smart, you‚Äôre so so good at everything‚Äù I don‚Äôt have any friends nor did I want any. And from that time I took the habit of trying to be better than everyone at everything. Of relying only on me. I‚Äôm also really curious by nature and want to know more than everyone else.

I‚Äôm sure you can already see the problem with that. I also relied on the fact that I‚Äôm a fast learner to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in class. Naturally as time went on my grades degraded, there‚Äôs only so much you can get when you don‚Äôt study and rely on your previous knowledge. 

By the time I got into my 2nd year of college I had pretty much all Cs. But at that time I didn‚Äôt really care. I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do in life and I just took it easy. 

And somehow, a few months ago, something clicked....

I am nothing and no one. I know nothing, I have no skills, no future. I who used to be so confident, have shattered the mirror and the image that I had made of myself and I see that it is all lies. Everything I have been told is lies. I am not smart. I am not good.

Everything I love to do, I suck at. Math, physics, philosophy, art. All of it. I don‚Äôt know anything, about anything and I feel like I never will. 

There is one person that I know, and she is better than me at everything. Heck she is 2 years older than me and she has a masters, she can code way better than I, she sees and understand everything better than I. She can math and physics better than I. She was a straight A student. She has become a friend to me, and that is rare because in my entire life I‚Äôve only had 3.  Yet as much as I admire her I despise this friendship because it shows me what I am not and what I may never be.

And if there is one of her in the small sample of the population I‚Äôm part of, then there is no telling how many more people are better than me.

How can I ever hope to accomplish anything when people like this walk the earth and when I have already wasted 20 out of the 21 years I‚Äôve been given so far? I now have a goal, greatly ambitious but I lack the confidence I used to have and I lack the knowledge and skills to achieve it.

I want to know. I want to know everything and be good at everything. I don‚Äôt know how. This girl has proposed to me and a couple of others to move out together when we graduate in a few months. I should have been the one to say that. I am always the captain of the ship, I am always the one that lends a hand, I am always the one that says where to go and what to do, but when faced with someone better I just fall apart. Even things I know for facts I am afraid to say. 


Somehow I must always be the best, I have to succeed in everything but so far I‚Äôve failed at everything. And I have asked people before. They said something along the lines of ‚ÄúEveryone is good at their own thing‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great at x , you just don‚Äôt see it‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt compare yourself to others‚Äù
I don‚Äôt want this bs. I want to be better , and I need help understanding how...

I think I just need to regain that confidence I once had, but I don‚Äôt know how. 
I will do literally anything for it. But if ai have to be honest I don‚Äôt know that I will be able to do and I would rather die than know that I will always be average.

There‚Äôs a cliff nearby and many times I‚Äôve gone to it , wondering what the point of it all is. The only thing that‚Äôs kept me from jumping is that I also hate giving up and I don‚Äôt want to give up on myself.",29Oct2020,1
265,"My daughter and I were talking and she mentioned that she never wants to have kids. I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ok, but you might change your mind when you‚Äôre older.‚Äù Then she crossed her arms, smiled in an grossed out kind of way, and said ‚ÄúNo, never, I‚Äôm going to adopt.‚Äù 
I realized then that she probably knew more than I thought. So I asked her ‚ÄúDo you know where babies come from?‚Äù She said yes, but she didn‚Äôt want to tell me.
So I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm just curious, I promise I won‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Äù And then she smiled goofily like little kids do when they‚Äôre talking about this stuff and pointed ‚Äúdown there.‚Äù

Sooo I‚Äôm not sure what to do or say. I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to know anything about this this early. I don‚Äôt even know how she found out, but I‚Äôm assuming school. Do I just say nothing? 
She seems pretty grossed out by it so I‚Äôm not sure if she needs to know any more right now, or if it‚Äôs important that she does because she knows about it now. And if I talk to her, what do I say considering she‚Äôs only 7?

They called the cops but I was left with no charges and after I met the guy I realized that my neighbor may have been lying.

Basically, a majority of the friends I‚Äôve made throughout my life have been...well...arseholes.

They‚Äôd tell me what to do and I‚Äôd do it and when they treated me badly or stopped talking to me I just assumed it was my fault.

268,"Hi all, not sure if this would be the place to ask.

271,"When i was a senior in high school I had *amazing* options for where I wanted to go to college. All great, well-known schools with rigorous academics and extremely generous financial aid packages. I decided to go with the college where I thought I would be the happiest; they were ranked as having very happy students, they had a reputation for being ""collaborative, not competitive"" and the students I knew told me that it was basically paradise on Earth. 

Of course, these high-ass expectations didn't pan out over my first semester. Neither did my adjusted expectations for the second semester. Or even my rock-bottom, open-minded ""just put yourself out there"" attitude that I decided to approach this semester with. 

I'm just so lonely. I've always been the kind of person to *crave* affection and external validation. I loved being the center of attention and having people compliment me, but I just don't have that here. I don't have friends here, or anyone to talk to at all, and it's not for lack of trying. People are always uninterested or I fuck up somehow‚Äînot even In a toxic way, I'm just awkward and shy‚Äîand boom, back to square one. I don't have this problem in other places, so I really don't get it.

and then I feel so out of place. All these rich kids and their fancy ass vacations and the know-how to do all this shit because they went to fancy private schools or had parents that could guide them through it. I didn't have any of that shit, and I just always feel so behind everyone. it's so hard to go from being the absolute top of the pack trying my absolute hardest to be top-of-the-bell-curve. 

and on that note, I just can't win here. everything I apply to, I get rejected from. even the ""dont worry, applications are just a formality!"" type of things, and it's seriously screwing with me. I can't do the things I loved in high school because I didn't make the team, I can't get involved in organizing for a few orgs because I lost the elections, and I can't join this stupid-ass forum because they rejected me a couple nights ago. it might not sound like much, but holy shit does it hurt after a while. I used to be so special, but now? Nothing.

it's just all so, so overwhelming. the isolation, loneliness, the imposter syndrome, the way they're all so damn *happy* all the time. they're singing this guy happy birthday outside the door right now and all I can think of is my birthday, two months ago, which I spent choking back tears while I tried to eat the little sundae I bought for myself. 

this has just turned into a rant at this point, which I'm sorry about. Idk, I just can't stop wondering if transferring to a whole different university, one where I actually have friends, might make me feel a lot better. it's not like I'm connected to the culture on campus here anyways. 

I love the academics though, so at least there's that. my classes and professors are all great and I'm never bored.

I just want to be happy, though. that's all. I wanna smile and laugh and feel appreciated and loved again. I miss it so much. someone please help me figure something out, it's getting to be too much for me. everything hurts. I just want to go back to smiling.",29Oct2020,1
273,"So to begin with I (22M) am not a parent, but let's say things aren't very normal for me in my house that is. Recently Khabib Nurmagomedov (UFC lightweight champion) retired from the sport because recently his father passed away and he didn't feel like he should continue without him. In his speech he told everyone and mainly his opponent (Justin Gaethje) whose parents were present there, to love their parents as we don't know when they might not be there. This event sparked what i am about to write and have been thinking a lot on it.

I've had a very normal and loving childhood up until I was in High School and that's when all the trouble began. Right about when I was finishing my freshman year my mom started cheating on my day and I kinda knew it was happening but didn't want to believe that. Fast forward to the middle of my junior year my dad found her texts and all hell broke loose in the house. The stress that was inside our house for the following six months was off the roof and I believe that that time changed me forever. Finally my dad was ready to accept this and chose to let this go by, I guess just for my sake.Now I don't know why she did that and she refuses to even acknowledge that that ever happened but yet I don't mind much. Recently, I had to order something and wasn't able to do it from my account so I picked up my mom's phone and found out that she was texting with yet another guy online nothing lewd but I didn't want to read more. Now she's a stay at home mom so I'm quite sure she didn't have any physical relationship with someone else other than the previously mentioned guy but she's still texting with other men I don't know why. I confronted her about that and she still denies that it happened but I told her if it's happening it should not continue and ended the conversation.

Now, my dad isn't a perfect man either he's a border line alcoholic and has been that way even before all of what my mother did happened. He doesn't make a lot but makes enough to make us live decently. The other thing about him is he's very poor with finance and is in a lot of debt (approximately twice of what me makes in a year and that is excluding the mortgage on the house), I mean with what he's been making he could have been in a much better place if he just handled his finances well. Even now when I advice him on handling it well he chooses not to listen to me and if I ask him to quit alcohol he says he'll go into depression and die in about 6 months if he does that or sometimes even says that he'll commit suicide if anyone makes him quit alcohol.

Now if I put all these issues aside they both love me with all their heart and would do anything for me (literally). They both have always looked after all my needs and have sacrificed a lot of things for me. My conscience tells me to love them with all I've got and even my religion tells me to do the same but for some reason I'm holding issue to this because of all that. Now I'm not materialistic but I would be having it very easy if only they both kept their matters in check, I mean we don't own a car which isn't a big deal but it hurts when I feel we could've owned one. I have my own problems with finding what I love in life, graduating college, finding a job, paying my student loans, and many more but instead I'm also worried with all of that. Now with the economic situation I discussed before you can guess they'll be left with nothing after my dad retires so I'll be taking care of that as well. I feel like all the people my age that are around me are being propelled by their parents when I'm being held back which fucks with me a lot. I've had such lows in my life that at one point when I was contemplating suicide, my parents were the only thing that kept me going. The thought that what would they have to go through if I did that and who'd look after them made me not do it. But to love them is something I think I would never be able to do (even though I do).

I've lost my train of thought but this should explain it quite well. If you read this till here, I really wanna thank you for your time.",29Oct2020,1

I dont know why Ive said that i was there. I really dont know, but that was a hugs mistake. I really regret going there right now and iam so scared. I tought that it will be safe since we all have to wear face masks all the time, but that was so stupid. My mum yelled at me because me and dad can alllegedly face problems at work.

I called then back yesterday when it all happened and startem makeing up that originally i was just out with friends and we just wanted to see whats is going on, that i didnt participate (Please dont judge me, i just want things as i used to be) but they were so angry that it didnt worked. 
It is the next day when im writing this. I definitley going to call again and i will be apologizing again. I jus want things as they used to be so bad.

As I said previously I cant think straight right now. All I want to do is to cry and vomit and hurt myself. But I have to go to work and I dont know how im gonna make it. 
I cant talk with anyone about it. I dont have friends whom I can trust and i dont know how to talk about it. And I have to act quickly. 
Ive write about it here and in another language (so please excuse any mistakes i know there is a lot of them) cause i desperatley need sense of anonymity and advice. Just Please dont say ‚Äûfuck them‚Äù. Im not in a p≈Çace to do so. I live in a flag they bought me and I have work thanks to my dad.

276,"It‚Äôs a very long and complicated story so bear with me.

A little over a year ago I joined the worship band at my church. I love the people and I love going to church and playing guitar and singing. My problem is that I have severe stage-fright when I am up there by myself or even a duet. I have no problem playing guitar, but singing by myself in front of everyone is not my strength. I‚Äôve done it a few times, but not very often.

Most everybody else is a loud singer on the team. Except me. I am a very quiet singer but I‚Äôm working on my volume. It‚Äôs just taking a long time. Everybody else, however, is super loud even with their mics off. 

I‚Äôve constantly been told for the past year or so that I cannot be heard singing. It‚Äôs irritating because nobody ever tries to encourage me or make me feel more confident but instead always tell me in a rude or somewhat rude way that they cannot hear me. I‚Äôm constantly being poked fun at for it and I understand they‚Äôre joking but they don‚Äôt realize how much it actually does hurt my feelings. Whenever I‚Äôm told, it‚Äôs usually in a rude but ‚Äújoking‚Äù way, and sometimes I even want to cry. Although I hold it in cause I don‚Äôt wanna start anything. I‚Äôm always the butt of the jokes when it comes to me singing up there.

Something else irritating is the fact that they constantly tell me they can‚Äôt hear me, but when I am not going to show up one Sunday for worship I get ambushed by certain people for not being there because I‚Äôm ‚Äúneeded.‚Äù If you can‚Äôt hear me singing or playing then why am I needed in the first place? 

Our band is short on members. We play for a small church but we only have two guitars, one piano, and everybody on voice (normally 5 or 6 people). 

I just feel the environment is very toxic and I need to leave ASAP. I‚Äôm just afraid of getting complaints for taking a break at the very least, but I know it‚Äôs probably what I need right now. If it‚Äôs making me upset to the point where I‚Äôm coming close to crying then that‚Äôs probably a sign that I should leave. At least that‚Äôs my point of view.

279,"My girlfriend‚Äôs best friend and roommate has a 3 year old daughter with a woman he dated for several years. Speaking from personal experience she is a shrill, spiteful, deceitful and manipulative person. She has openly admitted to selling cocaine and had other dealers inside her house while her daughter was there. She has destroyed a television in a fit of rage that belonged to the daughter, and on several occasions has opted out of picking up or watching her daughter, when it was her turn, at the very last minute for unknown reasons. The father is not a drug user (other than weed, which is legal in CA, but has never used it around his daughter). 

Well, after months of a set schedule agreed by both parents, the father has decided to take full custody for the betterment of his kid, all while still letting his daughter see her mom on occasion. 

Initially it had seemed he was going to be able to take her for the foreseeable future until the official court date. However, earlier tonight I just got word from my girlfriend that somehow the mother filed paperwork to take her daughter on the same day he filed, and apparently it cleared before the father‚Äôs paperwork did. The police arrived with the mother and they took the kid just a few minutes ago. 

As I stated she is a evil woman, and does not have the proper temperament or responsibility of a parent. I personally have seen how the father raises his daughter and he‚Äôs exactly the type of dad anyone would want. 

The court date is set for November 19th. What else can he do? Does anyone know family law in California that can help? Where can I be directed to if this is the wrong place to post this?

So, I would say that I try to be a creative person, I do a lot of artsy things such as digital drawing, writing short stories, and photography..

I think another thing I should note is that I‚Äôm diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

But about after an hour, no matter how much work I have done, I begin to feel really angry.

My dream is to someday either get something published or to hone my art skills enough to where I can do commissions for people and feel proud of the work I did for them.

284,"Hi everyone, 

So recently I posted about a mama kitty who‚Äôs been visiting and hanging out and the owners are dirt bags. My boyfriend and I also found a male cat who was not fixed, dirty, hungry and covered in scratches. For the past week he‚Äôs been living in our house not wanting to leave or anything. We bathed him and got him checked out at the vet. Got his vaccinations and flea and tick prevention as well. Also checked to make sure he wasn‚Äôt chipped. 

Apparently the same dirt bags that own the mama kitty and about 15 other underfed dirty cats claim that he‚Äôs theirs. I‚Äôm so upset. Tomorrow were giving him back to them but I‚Äôm so worried about him. It‚Äôs so cold here and they weren‚Äôt taking care of him. We live in an area with coyotes, owls and by a busy road. Four of their cats regularly come over to me and the neighbors house to eat because they don‚Äôt feed them. 

They‚Äôre scary people and harassed me for my address and we‚Äôre very intimidating when they saw that I had him. Tomorrow I will be giving him back. This is more of just a sad rant than anything else. They‚Äôre going to let him back outside because that‚Äôs what they do with all of their cats and he‚Äôs gonna come back. (I hope) I plan on calling animal control tomorrow so hopefully that helps. I just want to keep him even though I know that‚Äôs not right. I‚Äôm just feeling really down because he‚Äôs made a place in our house and hearts. We even had an appointment for getting him fixed and chipped and weren‚Äôt planning on letting him outside anymore other than with a harness. 

If he comes back i don‚Äôt know if I can just watch him sit at our door crying. He‚Äôs been in and out a few times before he made permanent residence here and didn‚Äôt want to go outside anymore. If he comes back I‚Äôm thinking of just keeping him. Please just scold me if you think that‚Äôs wrong I feel like I‚Äôm not thinking right. I just love him so much already and he‚Äôs so happy here. They didn‚Äôt post or anything about him and weren‚Äôt searching for him. Just stumbled on a Facebook post of mine. 

If these people were responsible pet owners and actually cared I would be so happy to give him back. But they‚Äôre not and I don‚Äôt want to give him back but they‚Äôre honestly scary people and have lied about they‚Äôre animals so many times. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want them to get the police involved and all that and he‚Äôs rightfully theirs even if they don‚Äôt care for him properly. 

What would you guys do in this situation especially if he turns up at my house again? Be brutally honest I‚Äôm being selfish in wanting to keep him but at the same time we‚Äôre taking such good care of him. Thanks guys.

289,"(I posted this on my personal profile but this still is on my mind and I could use advice and support.)

For the past two years, I (24f) lived with my sister (29f) along with my parents, my younger sister (17f), my sister's boyfriend (29m), and their two kids (7m, 6f). Now, my family has a history of being highly dysfunctional with each other and it has affected my mental health from a young age, along with being bullied heavily by my peers. As an end result of my childhood (the details of which are incredibly long and traumatizing), I have clinical depression, GAD, and PTSD, diagnosed by my therapist. I told my family this and I got mixed reactions, ranging from support to the the ever infamous ""get over it"".

Now for the past two years, my mental health has gotten increasingly worse. I felt like I was useless and couldn't do anything right, that I wasn't worth the space I took up. Not to mention that my family's constant fighting made me on edge. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells to not make someone mad and that didn't even work. My sister would constantly berate me for everything and would scream at all of us on a regular basis. She even threatened to physically hurt me more than once.

Her kids and boyfriend were no better. Her boyfriend is very abusive towards her and tries to intimidate the whole family (he constantly tried to fight my dad, fought with my uncle on Christmas, ruined our Father's day bbq). The kids refuse to listen to anyone and were highly disrespectful to everyone (they scream in my parents' faces, lie on us, and my nephew just won't Respect me in particular, calling me by my name instead of 'Tia' like the rest of my nieces and nephews). 

I had a few mental breakdowns because of this and a few times, I came close to taking my own life. All of this stress came to a head last month when my parents decided that they had enough and left, taking me and my younger sister with them.

Fast forward to two weeks ago; I was hanging out with my best friend (24nb) and they were stressed out because of all the driving they were doing. Part of my anxiety makes me very apologetic and that stressed them out even more (I kept saying 'sorry') At one point, when I apologized and they snapped at me, saying ""Friend, stop it!"".

I flinched pretty hard and basically froze. My heart was going a mile a minute and I thought that I was going to cry. My friend realized that they had triggered me and apologized profusely, because they never wanted to hurt me. They know what my life is like and they want to be my safe space (and I would do the same for them).

But that moment made me realize just how much living with my sister affected me. I still love my sister and miss her but I can never live with her again, for the sake of my own mental health. Am I doing the right thing in moving out? She's blood so I'm conflicted big time since she's stuck up for me in the past but I cannot live with her temper, boyfriend, or kids (whom I also love but like I said, they wouldn't listen to me if I was the only other adult in the house).",29Oct2020,1

295,"I've been crying for hours now and my heart felt so heavy and tight all morning. I apologize if I don't get to articulate my ideas properly.

TL;DR: Passive-aggressive mother keeps on humiliating me in front of others and has a hold on my only source of money to possibly get away from here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a passive-aggressive mother who instead of talking about the problem, shuts down and gives us the silent treatment instead. I just recently realized that I got these traits from her being like this towards my siblings and I whenever a conflict arose. 

So yeah um right now, I could've had a financial means to get out of this situation. I have a scholarship with monthly stipends but she has taken the debit card. I really tried to resist giving it to her but she said it's just so she can monitor how I spend my money and that she'll give me the money when I ask for it. I now realize that maybe she did that because we have been having fights a lot recently and she didn't want to give me a way out. 

Also, I noticed a pattern stemming from when I was still young. I would open up to her about something embarrassing because yknow she's my mom and then she would tell it to her friends in front of me. It's been engraved on my mind because I still remember how embarrassed I felt. It's happening again right now on multiple occassions. I have braces and we always go together for the monthly adjustments. My dentist is actually a friend of hers and they would talk about their kids during my adjustments. Sometimes, my mom would slip some information about me without directly saying that it was me but being there and having to hear about it is enough to feel humiliated. Also when I didn't get in their dream university because I didn't pass the interview, she called her friend and said (while the whole family and I were on earshot) that it was funny how brutally honest I was with my answers. I could've just lied on the interview and said what they wanted to say but to be honest, I don't like lying just to gain something that's not really for you. I confronted her about this but what she said is that, ""that's just the way mommy is,"" and that I shouldn't take her words seriously. Anyway, I think she apologized? But it happened again recently hahahaha the bottom line is she embarrassed me again in front of other strangers. It sounded like she wanted everyone to hear it with how loud her voice is. I just kept quiet the whole time and I confronted her about it once we were all alone. She kept apologizing without really listening to why I was upset. Like she was just apologizing just to get me to shut up. When she realized I wouldn't accept her apology, she closed off and shut down the conversation. I just wanted her to really realize that what she did was wrong. I'm just so frustrated at this point. Everything I do seems to disappoint her. She doesn't like that I play mobile games to destress, that I do art, that I cry too much, the school I'm studying in, etc. I just feel like proving myself to her is pointless now because I'll never be enough for her.

I have told my dad about this but my dad is an enabler. He just listened to me and didn't really say anything to comfort me. Just listened silently and stood up from the table once he was done eating. He's aware of my mother's desire to control the entire household but it seems like he has given up and just wants to stay silent to keep the peace. My older sister is the same way. She has learned to adapt to my mother's behavior that she's starting to act like my mother sometimes. She used to be my ally but now whenever I want to vent out, she doesn't want to listen or just shuts down the whole conversation altogether. But when it's her who needs me to listen, I do my best to help her with her problems. It's frustrating. My younger sister is my only ally in this, I think.

298,"Hello,

for the past couple weeks I have been feeling really guilty. It kicked off when I made a really stupid mistake:

 I'd been kinda just slumpy the last few weeks and havent been catching what people say so well. My gram and i were at walmart and we split up to get stuff. I was done and she had 2 more things to get when we next met up in store, so I was gonna peruse clothes while she got them. We were gonna meet up at registers. I wandered a outta clothes for a sec and went back in. I wasn't even looking towards registers, i was just deep in clothes. never saw her (bc i assumed shed cone get me?? idk i just did) and then sat down in shoes (which i consider clothes but she doesnt, and it was too far away to see registers anyways). Im sitting there, try calling her 3 times but she left her phone home. (She had told me in the car but I did not catch this.) She had waited in line for me for nearly 30 minutes, making her back ache quite badly. She was pissed off and rightfully so.

Later we get home and I go downstairs to clean up my area + the rest of the basement (my bday was in a couple days so it was gonna look spiffy). Anyways she says in 2 hrs that she will come get me to help with some other stuff. 2 hrs pass and I had barely cleaned. She was again pissed as was my mom. I did pick up the pace and get it all done after this but it was out of guilt.

Idk why I even puttered that slow, and got distracted so much. I just wasn't thinking. My mom asked what was up with me and I literally just, do not know. I just didn't think. It's so stupid.

Que to now: my mom passed on plant watering duties to me and the plants are nearly dead bc I haven't done it since she passed the job to me. I also left a pile of my hair near the sink a day after cutting my hair, which my mom found absolutely disgusting (can't blame her).

&amp;#x200B;

This pattern of laziness and stupidity is not exactly unussual. I just don't fucking think and haven't much since I was a kid? I want to never be like this again. And I tell myself that evvery time and it's fucking pathetic. I thought I had changed, bc I hadn't had shit like this comming up so much (aside from sleeping in a room full of fucking garbage, as per usual like since I can remember) and I thought I was doing at least better. But the past two weeks have been like a revisiting of every fualt and issue I thought I had grown from. I hadn't. I hadn't grown. And I want to.

As of now idk how to keep myself active in listening and cleaning skills without nagging guilt behind me. I feell like I have to face some kind of concequence, but I know if my mom or gram saw how I am handling this it would be yet another problem:

I stepped on the herbs so smash, I stop the offending food. Hadn't been watering plants? Soak my new wonderful slippers after watering them. The tomatoes have a lot of dry stems now? Hit arm until striking a nerve and send fucky shooting sensations up and down it. Cats not fed on time? Scratch arm with the utinsle used to get their food out. I also have i the past used my wartenberg wheel to strike and punch my legs red and blue with. It just feels like what I have to do? As a kid I did the same but with pencil scratching anf head banging.

I shouldnt do this and its so fucking pathetic that I even go so far as to do that and not just move on. Not just do what Im fucking supposed to. How do I not hate myself while I have so much I have to fix? How do I fix it without hating myself?

311,"to give some context

&amp;#x200B;

its someone that liked me.. a girl at my college..

and i didn't like her, didn't show any interest in her... if anything, there were times that i even almost avoided her.. (i think she'd catch that)

she'd look at me or try to stand at a spot where i could see her, and stuff like that..

anyways till the last day (before corona happend) she kept doing it... after that, its been like 10 months.. i dont even have social media so she wouldn't even be able to see my face virtually..

and honestly, even at that time, when i was around her, i wasn't entirely sure if i liked her or not...

and i've already made up my mind.. i do..

&amp;#x200B;

tho.. im not sure... well, i'd be surprising even if she still liked me... but, i've been kinda thinking about her ever since... and i dont even know how to deal with this feeling...

&amp;#x200B;

i mean. the worst part is corona and online studying.. it will be over soon tho here... but i dont know what to do till then.. 

its hard to know that she doesnt care.. but i mean, she doesn't even have any idea that i even like her... 

tho, regardless, it feels like she does, and her not caring almost feels like a ""fuck you"" to me.. (i know that its not)

anyways what should i do?? lol its actually kinda frustrating (i gotta forget it till i meet her again)",29Oct2020,1

My boyfriend and I were in a long distance relationship, we met and we were really good friends and I had developed feelings for him. We dated for a good year and a month, and I thought things were going okay.

He had started discord calling a girl he knew in real life, and I thought nothing of it until my insecurities got the worst of me. I told him she was gorgeous and that since that was the way we connected that I was worried his feelings for me would waver.

And then he broke up with me. He said he needed to think about things and just this morning he told me he didn‚Äôt want me anymore, that they were already talking.

I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this in any way, shape, or form. I did a bad thing, telling him I hated him before blocking him, but my feelings got in the way considering this wasn‚Äôt the first time happening and he knew that. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I keep blaming myself saying I didn‚Äôt make him happy enough or that I just wasn‚Äôt enough. It makes me sick, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them together.

We definitely flirted to the point they told me I was attractive to them and if they weren‚Äôt in a relationship they‚Äôd go on a date with me. Obviously that hurt a little bit but I moved on. A few months later drunkenly we hooked up and my attraction for them grew immensely from that point.

Okay so basically Ari earned her A.A. degree spring 2020 and started grad school this fall, and she's been worried and stressed lately because she 1) doesn't know if she's picked the right career path (I forget what it's called but basically u look after the physical health of a sports team) to go down and 2) she's been very unmotivated, to the point where she says she can't even dream about a career path better for her... Ari jokes about it mostly, but I can tell it really bothers her. I've tried asking her if talking about it would help, but usually she says she'll be okay and I don't push her further because I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

It doesn't feel like he's monitioring me like a normal boss would. He's also been talking to me a lot more than he used to. Everytime he sees me he starts a conversation and smiles a lot almost like subtly flirting? But the actual incident that is confusing me happened 2 weeks ago a couple days after I had turned 21 (he's 28) when he kept offering me alcohol at work, literally all night. And constantly saying I need to drink more. As well as telling me we should go out drinking after work. But the whole night he just kept trying to make me drink and kept talking to me a lot. When I went to sit down alone he shortly followed me to continue joking with me. That night I had a dream he was all over me like touching me, flirting etc. It felt a lot like it did at work that day but without the touching. Ever since that dream I really can't stop thinking about the whole thing. And since then everyday I work with him I just feel this weird tension in the air when he's near me I feel so awkward and nervous.

333,"Pretty much what the title says, but there‚Äôs a bit more detail.

I have a large group of online friends, and I hold them close to my heart. There‚Äôs one guy, let‚Äôs call him R. R is great, I talked with him multiple times a week for hours on end for five months. We were close. He has a sense of humor that can push the edge of acceptable though, and is autistic.

I‚Äôve been picking up signs here and there that he likes me, and about two months ago, he told me he had a crush on a 15 year old girl and asked what he should do. I told him to ignore any feelings he has for her, cause it‚Äôs weird. In that moment I was kinda sure that he had caught feelings for me. Just the fact that he would always talk to me, compliments and stuff, yada yada. A few days ago, I joked about fighting him if we ever met. He said sure, and I then typed ‚Äúcool, deal lol‚Äù. He thought that I was asking for conditions, so he said that if he won, I would be his servant for four days. And idk why, but that really rubbed me the wrong way. I left the call and sent R a message saying that he crossed a line.

I was suddenly uncomfortable being around him and asked some of my friends what to do. They said that I should tell the other people in the friend group. So, a few days later, I put something on a private Instagram story about it. Only three people saw it before his best friend (someone he knows irl) responded to it. He said that he knew R meant no harm, R is autistic and sometimes doesn‚Äôt quite know where the line is, and that he understand how I‚Äôm upset, but it‚Äôs just not okay to say something like that about his best friend. I realized that I had made a huge mistake. I told that guy in a flurry of texts that I realize that I fucked up big time. He told me to take some time to think about what I wanted to say, basically implying that I had to get myself out of this mess.

I cried for the next two hours, I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of any harm coming to R, I just wanted to talk about what had happened somewhere, I didn‚Äôt want anything to come of it. I don‚Äôt know why I said all of that, I‚Äôve had people creep on me a bit in the past and I was so scared that some stupid crush was going to ruin a friendship again. I unfriended everyone from those servers, deleted all photos of myself on the servers, and left the servers. I also unfollowed all of them on social media and removed them from my followers list. I have effectively cut them all off. They can still message me.

I told the other two people who saw the story to please just forget I existed and forget everything I said about R. I know it‚Äôs overboard and more about me than fixing what I said about R, but at that point I just didn‚Äôt know what to do.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Should I try to mend things with this friend group? I care about them a lot, but I‚Äôm scared. If so, what can I do to fix the mess I made?

Since the traumatic incident,  none of family came forth and expressed how they won't do anything like this to me, etc... I instead had to approach them and ask if they would ever do anything like this, and they assured me a ""no"". 

What's very frustrating, is that all of them give the same frustrating answer like ""have I done anything?"", instead of PERSONALLY adding weight to their answer...

Personally expressing how they are a person of integrity, or how they value respect etc... 

They all believe a simple answer should be good enough, when I am a ""words"" person, the MORE personal, the BETTER and yet they still just give very brief and emotionless answers.

I've talked to each of my siblings separately, and they all give the same type of answer as my dad does which is so frustrating... it's like I""m the only one in the family who values personal expression.

In high school I had a good friend (m) that I spent a lot of time with. At first I didn‚Äôt know he had a girlfriend because he never mentioned her and he would spend a lot of time with me. We had been good friends for about 3 years by then. He started making comments about me sexually and at first I was weirded out. Eventually I started giving him oral sex and he would touch me (over my clothes). Months later I found out he had a girlfriend of almost a year at that point. I told him to break up with her and he told me he didn‚Äôt love her (and I think he said he didn‚Äôt even like her) and he didn‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt want to break up with her. He spent way more time with me than with his girlfriend and I never wanted a relationship with him and he only wanted a physical relationship/hanging out all the time but not a real relationship with me. The girlfriend hated my guts because he spent more time with me (understandable). She would tell him he wasn‚Äôt allowed to be friends with me anymore and he would say that‚Äôs not fair because we had been friends with for years before she came around. She accused him of cheating on her. The guy friend was an abusive friend to me and sexually assaulted me when I told him I didn‚Äôt want to continue doing things with him.

339,"FYI: my crush used to be my friend. She ended our friendship because i did something wrong. I think it's something petty. She thinks otherwise. I respect her decision.


So basically, my crush has a boyfriend who treats her very nicely but he only treats her and his friends well. Before I used to talk to him, I was just jealous of him but now I kinda hate him because he has been a dick to me.

He treats me very badly. 

He used to be jealous of me before she was his girlfriend since the girl and I used to be good friends.

The guy shared a secret with me and told me not to tell anyone. I also shared a secret and he went and told my friend (his girlfriend) and ruined my friendship with his girlfriend.

He has been disloyal to me and treats me very badly.

However I am happy for my friend since the guy makes her very happy. I just don't know if it's okay for him to treat me like shit.

Also, as for the disloyalty part, I did something out of jealousy and told the person concerned(his now girlfriend) about his disloyalty. 

She is very strict about loyalty and takes it very seriously. However she is so in love with him that she forgave him without second thought but in my case ended our friendship.

342,"So recently I‚Äôve started taking driving lessons. I was really excited, but also nervous. Had my first lesson, went alright, and the driver instructor is a friend of my parents. Not someone I know well, so I still felt kinda uneasy. 
Anyway, I‚Äôve had a few lessons now, and I hate it. While some lessons go ok, my drivers instructor has been getting mad at me, to the point of yelling for 3 or 4 whole lessons. It makes me not want to go anymore. I hate being in the car with him so much, and when he yells at me I can‚Äôt wait to go home and cry. That one hour driving lesson, sitting in the car with him feels like it never ends. Really makes me feel like shit. My parents don‚Äôt know about this and I‚Äôve already paid him everything, so I don‚Äôt think I could find a new driving instructor.

I‚Äôm  a 30 year old Mom and I‚Äôve trusted my daughter with a phone starting this summer and she‚Äôs been super responsible with it. So much so that she showed me her phone when one of her little friends at school sent her messages that he was ‚Äúin his bed doing something in his shorts‚Äù(the message included a üòè emoji) and then proceeded to tell her he had sex with his cousin in Mexico before she responded that his message was disgusting and made her uncomfortable. The next day the boy denied his intention and simply said he was recreating a Tiktok dance move on his bed and that my daughter was misinterpreting. However, I‚ÄôM not naive and those messages were absolutely not innocent. This happened 2 days ago and he has been an absolute nightmare towards my daughter since. Because of covid the children in her class do Google Meets to socialize. There was another child that wasn‚Äôt supposed to join for reasons unknown to me and this little boy pointed blame at my daughter who didn‚Äôt have anything to do with it and created a different google meet group, refused to give my daughter the code, and when she tried to reach out to him as to why she couldn‚Äôt join he told her ‚ÄúI said no, and stop talking to me!‚Äù I‚Äôm INFURIATED! Not only is he sending my child unsolicited messages but he‚Äôs trying to alienate her from their friend group.

346,"hi guys. i‚Äôm on mobile so sorry if anything is messed up. 

here‚Äôs a little background. so i (15 f) have been taking care of my sister since she was born. i feel like her actual mom because our mom (35 f) and dad (46 m) haven‚Äôt been the best parents to us. mom and dad divorced a year after she was born so we go to each of their houses every other week. because of this i care about her more than anything else in this world. i will always put her well being above mine. i make sure that she is always cared for and she knows that i love her very much.

we‚Äôve been doing online school since the beginning of this school year and for the most part it‚Äôs been fine. she‚Äôs very smart so i just get her up and ready in the morning and put her in the play room with her computer while i do my work. this works out because she can just come to me if she needs any help and i can check on her periodically.

now on to the problem. i am deathly afraid of her or me getting covid. which is the whole reason we went to online school. now out of the blue, my mom says that she‚Äôs sending her to in person school. this shocked the hell out of me so i asked her why. she said that‚Äôs she‚Äôs tired of having to help my sister with her work. but the whole thing is that she doesn‚Äôt even help her, and even if she did it‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt be too much trouble because she‚Äôs only in kindergarten and she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of work. 

i‚Äôm so scared of her getting covid that i‚Äôve been getting sick over it. i‚Äôve been throwing up and having massive headaches because i get so anxious whenever i think of her getting covid. i‚Äôve tried everything to get my mom to reconsider but she won‚Äôt budge. and she keeps on teasing me about it saying things like ‚Äúi can‚Äôt wait to dress up ‚Äòlittle sister‚Äô for her first day of school‚Äù and it makes me feel horrible.

So I always seem to end up on my phone, looking at social media when I should be studying.

I study mathematics at USQ, but this semester hasn't been my best (May have to repeat both subjects)
When I study, I'll do a couple of questions and, feel comfortable and then not do any more.

It's like those bad thoughts are stuck in my head that person A worked hard for something that I want but im trying to justify why I couldn't do the same.

Now I won't get into the details, but my concerns involved my family putting drugs in my food or drink...

Since the traumatic incident, none of family came forth and expressed how they won't do anything like this to me, etc... 

I instead had to approach them and ask if they would ever do anything like this, and they assured me a ""no"".

What's very frustrating, is that all of them give the same frustrating answer like ""have I done anything?"", instead of PERSONALLY adding weight to their answer...

Personally expressing how they are a person of integrity, or how they value respect etc...
They all believe a simple answer should be good enough, when I am a ""words"" person, the MORE personal, the BETTER and yet they still just give very brief and emotionless answers.

I've talked to each of my siblings separately, and they all give the same type of answer as my dad does which is so frustrating... it's like I""m the only one in the family who values personal expression.

356,"One of my closest friends is a twitch streamer, he is small time but gets pretty decent numbers (15-30 every stream so far) and makes money from it too. He is also hyper sensitive to anything you criticise him for, even if he asked for it.

An example of this, I approached him some months ago because I could see he has a talent on Twitch and said to him something along the lines of ""do you want me to be an unofficial advisor? I could let you know when things aren't working"" (As I was a streaming for 2 years prior) and he said ""Okay, sounds good"".

Fast forward to last night where he is live and I'm lurking. He has 17 viewers and he is moaning about not having enough viewers. I message him on discord verbatim ""dude stop talking about wanting more viewers, it makes you look like a whiny streamer"". 

Well, I got a message back saying ""Okay, thanks for calling me that"". Very passive aggressive and I feel not necessary. 

I replied ""Oh come on man don't take it to heart. You wanted me to advise you right? That shit is annoying"" and I have been blanked since. 

What do I do about this? He is one of my best friends and I've already had to cut him out of my life once because he took something the wrong way.

361,"Okay, so I went to one of those public high schools that are really competitive, had most of the kids take AP classes and stuff. I took a bunch of honors and 2 AP classes and I wasn't dumb, but I considered myself while not smart, above the average. Then before my 12th grade started my family and I moved to a different country(work-related). Now I completed my 12th grade in this new country but I spent most of the year kind of in some weird depression, lonely phase due to having missed my 12th grade with my friends back home. My grades were not so hot and I felt like all my old friends had moved on and I stopped talking to them as well. So for University, I went to a college in this new country, but far away from where my parents lived so, I could really experience the dorm life. Now I am in my 3rd year and I have had an absolutely fantastic time with dorm life, I have made a couple of really close friends, but the environment just doesn't feel competitive. I feel like I have just stopped doing academic work that was hard. I can finish an assignment 3 hours before its deadline and I feel lazy. Then I remember AP English classes and the torture it used to be and I feel like I have stagnated and just stopped getting smarter and in fact grown dumber. There are all these people around me that use their time so well and people begin start-ups or play sports, or travel during breaks, while I just chill out with my buddies and enjoy most of the time. I get good grades, but I don't strive to be good, I am average and this scares me.

My sister left home about 10 years ago and moved to a country that isn‚Äôt known as the most tolerant. She made friends and got married with someone really sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, ... (To give you an example, I had a conversation with him in a car one day, and he told me that if his son or daughter turned out to be gay, he‚Äôd disown them. Also he told me that if they game back home with an Arabic guy/girl he‚Äôd kick the shit out of them. And other lovely stuff like that. And to give an example of how sexist my sister is: she told me that I wasn‚Äôt really a girl bc I enjoy video games and bc I study engineering. She also keep criticising her husbands sister for ‚Äúdoing nothing at home‚Äù when her husband just sits at the table and does literally nothing, but that‚Äôs bc it‚Äôs a girl‚Äôs job...)

I have been babysitting for this family for the summer, asking 5$ per hour less than what my country even requires as for me it's more about the experience, but have had issues with them ever since I started. The family is top 1% in wealth, and their children have everything. They also receive no discipline, so are quite hard to manage, as any order I give them (wash hands, eat veggies, clean up, put your shoes on) is met with dismay. (They are 4 and 8, the younger still needs to be dressed and undress completely, and the 8 year old has never set the table or brought the plate to the sink). The kids can be quite violent (pushing each others in front of cars, hitting the other in the face with glass objects etc) So I felt it was my duty to use a stern voice to say no (never yelling nor using phisical punishment) when it happenes as it could be dangerous. The mom, who today was home, started yelling and insulting me because it is not my responsibility to apparently tell the kids off, since I also was thinking of quitting as she screamed at me anytime the kids did anything wrong or were rude to her, I gave my resignation on the spot. 

I babysit for another family, who remotely knows this family as the kids go to swimming classes together. The mom of the other family (who is very understanding and nice) asked me why was I not at swimming lessons, and I need to explain I gave my resignation to the other family, however I am not sure how much details to include.

While we fought a lot when I was a teen he got a lot better and had a stable job as a truck driver. But when I moved out he divorced his wife at the time and eventually started dating a very erratic women that he has been with a few years now. He would sometimes call me terrified saying things like she was threatening to beat herself and have him arrested for domestic abuse because he wanted to leave her and would act like everything was fine the next day. Despite having a vasectomy shortly after I was born she apparently also got pregnant  this year but the baby died inside of her. But they did confirm it was his via some sort of DNA test before that happened. Would have been my only sibling (from him).

I started rotating use of exercise, zzquil and melatonin to try and get to sleep, and it worked back when I was working 12 hour days 14 days straight, but with this constant changing schedule, I'm barely functioning even though the hours are so much shorter and I have more time to spend for myself. My job is safety sensitive so I cant get into the use of weed to get to sleep, and I live in a bear heavy area so dogs are almost always barking at night and my toddler nephew lives upstairs so its hardly ever quiet in the day.

374,I‚Äôm 16 and I have friends that I‚Äôm pretty close with they always include me in things and are generally pretty nice towards me but recently they‚Äôve just been attacking me always telling me to shutup always making fun of me making me feel like shit for being too skinny and being too tall I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 btw always calling me lanky making fun of me for the dumbest things like not having a lot of leg hair or my hair anything to make me feel like shit I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done to deserve this they always just joked around with it but now it‚Äôs not and I can‚Äôt remember the last time anybody was actually caring towards me I feel so lost I just want to lay down and die,29Oct2020,1
375,"I (29m) met up with a friend I haven‚Äôt seen in ~5 years tonight. She‚Äôs one of my favorite people to talk to and most valued friends so I was looking forward to it. She brought along her close friend and roommate. It sometimes takes me awhile to warm to strangers but me and the roommate got along really well and I thought we all had a pretty good time. It was the first time ive been out drinking with people in about a year. It was nice and needed.

I had a long drive home and about ~10 min I get a text then a call from the roommate friend (R). She‚Äôs quite drunk and most of what she‚Äôs saying is unintelligible ‚Äî very much not the state she was in when we parted. My friend (P) then texts me to ask if R had called me - I said she had and that she made need some help because she seemed quite drunk. Later R calls again and it‚Äôs difficult to make out but she‚Äôs saying P is very pissed off at her for calling me. It‚Äôs a pretty quick call but I basically said her friendship with P is important and not worth upsetting, and my friendship with P is important and not worth upsetting and that we shouldn‚Äôt be talking. Then i see the texts from P -

P and I had been in a brief relationship those ~5 years ago but have remained in touch on to talk since then. It seems this was brought up sometime after the three of us parted ways. From P (my friend): 
‚ÄúShe did say ‚Äúyou fucked my bestie‚Äù and when I asked her to stop she threw a tantrum‚Äù 
‚ÄúShe just threw my stuff across the room while scream-crying‚Äù
‚ÄúDude you better fucking stay out of this or I swear to god‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been so obviously gaslit and verbally abused‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm honestly incredibly pissed you answered her call and fed into it‚Äù
‚ÄúAll I said was to not talk about my sex life with you and she spun it into this because I ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù her‚Äù

I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this. I told my friend (P) how I was very sorry and that I‚Äôm open to talk, listen, or do whatever I can to help. Frankly, I don‚Äôt know how to proceed from here though. 

I really, really value this friendship. It‚Äôs too early to know what the fallout from this will be, but Im terrified that she‚Äôll stop talking to me. I‚Äôm also worried for their friendship - at drinks, I really admired their obvious closeness and the way they communicated. They even mentioned they‚Äôve rarely fought.

I‚Äôm still so confused about what even happened. First of all AITA for picking up the phone? I don‚Äôt think I even thought about it. Is there anything I can do to comfort or help my friend? Is our friendship doomed at this point?",29Oct2020,1
377,"I went to high school with this creep. I'll refer to him as J. J and I dated this year briefly for 3 months long after graduating and I immediately found red flags in his behavior towards me. Mind you, he's a church boy. Pentecostal. Draws a lot of anime and DBZ art on IG. His parents are the church band. J is the drummer. He grew up in the church. 

So upon simply looking at his IG following, I realized he followed a lot of anime, mouth/vore, feet  and softcore porn models and decided to dump him. Blocked and gave no second thought. Weeks later an account messages me, asking me if I know J. It's an underage girl, 17, called H. She mentions that she found my account because he apparently mentioned me on his story with my selfie and @ (i had no idea since i'd blocked him). She tells me that she's had enough of J cheating on her and ""messing around"" and that J has been messaging her since she was 14 in 8th grade and he was 19. Lives in Colorado, went on to explain that last year he convinced her to sneak out while on vacation with her family in Orlando so he could pick her up. He rented a motel room and raped her twice that night and in his car. 

She sent me at least 3 pictures of him and of him laying in her lap while in his car and the Snapchat map clearly shows her location/date being in Orlando. H said that J has been emotionally abusing her since she was 14 and manipulating her into sending him ""hundreds of masurbation videos/nudes"" and ignoring her if she protested. 

I carefully reviewed J's account a second time, rounded a list of over 10 minors he was following (girls who either upon clicking their user had their name and/or high school clearly stated in bio, showed pictures while in class) and noticed many were groomed to run ""mouth/tongue fetish accounts"" which is mostly what he seemed to be following certain minors for. These girls were being groomed by vore fetishists like him. I have DM/screenshot/video proof of stories/accounts from multiple minors in different states completely unaware of one another who have been violated online by J and all gave me explicit permission to share their convos between him and them to the police. 

I collected over 160 photos/screen recordings of countless convos from him messaging these girls sexually and asking/joking with them about masturbation, getting lube, sharing a bed, ""disabling"" one girl, etc etc. I even have proof of one local 16 year old he planned on ""picking up for church"" and the girl ghosted him after getting a gut feeling to block him. The cops are no help, I even blocked out all girls' names for safety and asked H to tell her family and call the police in her state since he actually did rape her on top of molesting her online. She told me they kept her on the line for half an hour and refused her just the same as me. She's in counselling and I'm not sure if the others took my advice in doing the same. I tried telling a former mutual friend and he claimed he would take the proof to J's older brother (named G), so that G could confront J and tell their family. It's been 3 months and I've heard nothing back. I feel sick.

TL; DR : I discovered my ex is a pedophile who lives directly across the street from the high school we graduated from and has raped one minor and virtually molested at least 6 others (that I have proof of). I reported to the authorities and even former friends of my ex won't help or alert his family. They seem to be covering it up. How could I make others aware he is an active threat?",29Oct2020,1
378,"So I dropped out of college in 2014 (freshman) and haven‚Äôt been back since. I finally go back this year because I felt like COVID has really made my life feel worthless. With school i‚Äôve been really busy and productive and finally have meaning to my life. It slowed down my content creation on Twitch and YouTube but i‚Äôm not too big on there anyway. I‚Äôm getting straight A‚Äôs and i have so much drive to finish school and finally feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something in my life. But my major is Graphic Design and I‚Äôve been told by so many in the field I don‚Äôt need a degree to get a good job. Just an amazing portfolio. I live with my grandparents and dad and I not only am taking school again for myself but also for them. I‚Äôve always been seen as a failure in my life because of my gaming and have quit gaming numerous times but I still love doing it and love doing content. 
I ended up getting this huge deal that might be a huge break on my content creation and I don‚Äôt know if I should go for it. If i do that means less time in school and maybe even have to drop out or just stay in school and quit gaming. I do really want to do both but it‚Äôs hard to juggle them when i‚Äôm already overloaded in doing freelance graphic design on the side. What if this is my huge break? Or what if it‚Äôs not. What do i do?? If i quit school again my family would look down on me. and in a way i would as well. But if i don‚Äôt, am i missing a huge opportunity that will change my life around? What if it doesn‚Äôt work out. This gaming opportunity is probably one of the biggest opportunities any gamer or content creator can ask for. But i have to choose one and put my all in. What do i do?! :(",29Oct2020,1
379,"This happened a few months ago. My boyfriend 'M' and I are in a long distance relationship. We were texting each other and I have no idea how the whole situation led to this issue but he proceeded to tell me this:

'Do you want to see a picture of a girl I used to date? She's really pretty and has a nice body.'

'Oh, I used to have pictures and videos of a girl and I kicking it.'

'I have pictures from my previous threesome. Wanna take a peek?' 

'I have a picture of a girl s**king my d**k. She looked hot.'

When he was done, I just kept quiet. Asking him why he had those oics with him, he said:

""Why not? They are fond and fun memories to have.""

I was mad, even. I expressed my feelings on this and how he could ask me these kind of questions. He apologized, and told me that he would place those memories into a private album. Like, as if that would change anything.

What's your opinion on the entire situation?",29Oct2020,1
380,"So this is kinda of a weird scenario that i never imagined I‚Äôd be in. I go to UC Berkeley and I live in a Co-op house with 12 other people. I‚Äôve lived here for a year and loved it so far and along with this new semester, new people came to the house. One of them is this person named [E] and they are trans and go by they them pronouns. 
Semester has been going fine (even with things online) and the real reason I‚Äôm in Berkeley instead of home in LA is because of my in person lab research. 
Anyway, I‚Äôve been getting along with most people in the house and people have been getting closer. However, E and a few others noticeably distanced themselves from the rest of the house and rarely tried to interact with others including not showing up for our house dinners. In effort to try to be polite and get along with E whenever I ran into them, I always smiled and said hi or waved, I tried to make conversation and small talk. Every single time, I was always met with simple polite greetings back but nothing more. Whenever I tried to talk with them, they always have short awkward answers and really just didn‚Äôt reciprocate my efforts. I‚Äôd like to add that I‚Äôm pretty socially anxious and that trying to be social is really a difficult endeavor for me. 
Due to this lack of reciprocation, I suppose I stopped trying to make conversation or saying Hi every time we were in a common space, as I assumed it did not matter anymore. 
About two weeks ago there appeared a long message on the whiteboard in the kitchen about denouncing heteronormativity (which I‚Äôm all down for) and other things like asking the viewer to consider actions that they do that perpetuate heteronormativity. At the bottom was the message ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to like eachother but we do have to respect eachother‚Äù which I got the point of but I did think it was a bit odd as it implied the person who wrote this didn‚Äôt like others in the house or didn‚Äôt feel liked which seemed strange either way. Well a few days later, in a dumb tired stupor I mindlessly erased the part that said ‚Äúbut we do have to respect eachother‚Äù since I thought it would be funny if it just said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to like eachother‚Äù. It‚Äôs stupid I know and I regret this but I always felt that everyone in the house got along fine and that this particular part of the message wasn‚Äôt necessarily life or death. 
The next day, E posted in our slack about the message being erased and how they put everything up there due to feeling unsafe in our house due to transphobic actions and how the erasure of that part of the message was appalling. I of course immediately felt awful and regretted doing that. 
Now today, while I was in the dining room, E came up to me and confronted me about the board and I very apologetically explained how I only did it as a poorly thought out joke and how I was extremely sorry and meant no disrespect and it was a moment of me being inconsiderate and stupid and repeatedly, I was very deeply sorry. 
They refused my apology and said that nothing I say can fix this situation and that this was a personal attack on their identity.
I really truly tried to explain my regrets and explain how I had ZERO desire to cause distress or be disrespectful. 
Eventually they said that they originally wrote everything in response to my actions and how I made them feel unaccepted in the house by not talking to them, making eye contact with them, acknowledging their presence in a room, etc. 
I really wanted to explain how from my perspective, I HAD tried to do these things and I HAD tried to be as nice as possible but I just assumed they didn‚Äôt really care about these gestures or politeness since they didn‚Äôt reciprocate. I didn‚Äôt say this however since I didn‚Äôt want to seem victim-blamey and since they seemed to be truly hurt in the moment and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything other than apologize. 
Now this is all I can think about and it‚Äôs giving me the craziest anxiety and I can‚Äôt sleep and I really don‚Äôt feel comfortable at all In this house. I feel awful that I made someone else feel unsafe but I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong here (aside from me stupidly erasing the board) but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I REALLY now have no idea how to act around this person and since everything‚Äôs online in heavily considering going home for the rest of the semester, even though this would mean I wouldn‚Äôt be in my research lab. 
Any advice or thoughts on this would be super helpful, I really don‚Äôt know what to do.",29Oct2020,1
381,"My husband works from home. His PM asked if he was on speaker phone when I popped into his home office. He said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù She then asked if she‚Äôs always on speaker phone. He again, said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù She knew I was right there and that she was on speaker and responded with ‚Äúexcellentttttttt, greeattttttt‚Äù like she was pissed off. I instantly wanted to rip her head off; however, I walked away. My immediate thought is what the fuck are you saying to my husband that you don‚Äôt want me to hear?! I felt so disrespected. Of course as a man, he didn‚Äôt even pick up on her tone of voice. He has told all his coworkers they‚Äôre always on speaker because he doesn‚Äôt like to use ear buds, so he‚Äôs thinking she already knows this. 

This girl‚Äôs fianc√© seems to constantly be working so she has decided to take it upon herself to keep my husband on the phone for as long as she can, and they talk sometimes 3 times a day. The lack of boundaries has become a major issue for me.

I am obviously not a fan, but this incident was my breaking point. He works 10 hours a day and also has side jobs. The time she takes up of his, is time taken away from me- at least that‚Äôs how I view it. 

My husband is not the problem. I hear their conversations 90% of the time. I trust him entirely. However, he is too nice, has tried to set boundaries and they don‚Äôt seem to do much.

388,"  

Hi, I‚Äôm new here (19F). Will try to keep this short and sorry for the bad English.

My parent left me with my grandparents when I was 8 months old. They went to another country to earn more money. We met once a year and they did send me a lot of gifts.

They returned when I was almost 9 years old and dad opened a restaurant with the money that they had earned. The restaurant failed badly. They lost the majority of the money and had to start afresh. Basically, the past 8 years for which they had kept me away went to waste.

Dad started another business with some help. Thankfully it went well.

Soon after that, My mother was pregnant and my baby brother was born. They also brought me to live with them. It was weird for me, my parents were almost strangers to me and their focus was mainly on my brother. Dad got really busy with his business. My relation with him was always okayish. I always knew that he loved me.

But my mother was always at home, always busy taking care of my brother. Our interactions were limited and bad. She helped me with homework which ended in her scolding me. I felt really really alone. I felt as if I have no one. I wanted to go back to my grandparents. But I didn‚Äôt have the option. I didn‚Äôt rebel. I didn‚Äôt want to be a problem. 

So, mom was the only grown up in the house. My relationship with her was getting worse. I felt as if she hated me. As if I was an unwanted burden. Almost every day, I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Sometimes I even took a knife with me. I wanted to die. But couldn‚Äôt gather the courage to kill myself.

Mom acted like everything was a favor being done on me. Whereas she was so gentle and happy with my brother. I kinda felt jealous. I helped around the house a lot. But nothing was enough.

it's been 10 years now. she doesn't understand me at all. I had tried many times to make things better. I spoke to my grandmother, I wrote my mom a letter. but everything always backfired and she made things more worse for me. she talked shit about me to teachers and I was always crying. there are so so many bad events like this. she is normal at times. but the negative events are so many that I forget the normal and positive events.

this all has had a serious effect on me. I'm scared to be in relationships. I'm really quiet now. I barely smile.

but now it is enough. I want to turn my life around and be the real me.

things are kinda better now because she hardly talks to me. dad has also started understanding me and spends more time at home. but my mother feels that everything was my fault and that I'll understand when I'm older. she tried to ruin my relationship with everyone but thankfully that didn't happen. there is a big trauma inside me. my mom has my brother but I don't really have her, I feel that she hates me and I hate her too. I cry myself to sleep nowadays. I just wanted the mother that my brother has. but it won't ever be possible. I am not looking for an escape. I just want answers. who is wrong here? was it my fault? am I thinking too much?",29Oct2020,1
389,"So basically, I am a huge dog lover and I often ‚Äúbabysit‚Äù other peoples dogs or take them out for walks. I would love to have a dog one day, when I get older, but I am afraid, that I will worry myself everyday if it is still alive. Because when I get attached to it, I will never be ready to lose him/her. What would be your advice for me? Thanks in advance",29Oct2020,1
390,"I was a really positive, happy person who didn‚Äôt care too much about how people thought of me. 

The toxic friend I mentioned was a close friend of mine. He was self-destructive and really pessimistic and negative. He had abandonment issues and was going through depression and anxiety and I tried to give him advice and listen to him and all that but after the third try, I realised it was extremely tiring for me because he was just going around in circles, wallowing in self-pity and didn‚Äôt want to help himself. 

He displayed a lot of red flags, gaslighting, self-pitying, self-victimisation and now I realise what a truly terrible person he was. When I cut him out of my life, it was messy because he contacted me after I gained closure and it caused me to lose my closure and led to a lot of anger. So I told him off repeatedly and blocked and unblocked him until I was so exhausted that I sent a last message, blocked him and never talked to him again. I sent 5 messages, blocking and unblocking him repeatedly because I felt like although what I said was warranted to true, it was harsh and I wanted to end the messages as kindly as I could because I wanted to end it kindly with encouraging words so he doesn‚Äôt give up all hope. 

He insulted me even though I wanted to end things on good terms and said that I act high and mighty and my healthy boundaries, that I keep to protect myself and to be happy, were walls that block people out and to ‚Äúbe careful not to suffocate from them‚Äù. 

As somebody who put in a lot of effort into self-love and healthy boundaries, it was painful and terrible to doubt them and to doubt myself. I started to feel guilty for loving myself and responsible for the well-being and emotions of others. I have a harder time separating my emotions from other people‚Äôs now, especially if they‚Äôre extremely depressed or anxious like he was, and as somebody who is highly empathetic, it‚Äôs just unhealthy. I start expecting the worse from people even though I saw the best in them before. I became more negative or at least, hear his negativity somewhere inside of me even though I know it‚Äôs not actually how I feel. All because of my experience with him. 

There‚Äôs so much more but it‚Äôs hard to summarise but basically, I feel his negativity and pessimism affect me even now. I feel like I carry him or it with me and I‚Äôd like to let it go and get the poison, his poison, out of my system. I want to improve, set stronger boundaries again and love myself. I want to get rid of the self-doubt that has built up. I want to unlearn all the bad things, move on, heal, let go and grow. I want to be happier again, I want to be better. More positive. 

Question is, how? Any tips or advice? Thanks so much for reading in advance.",29Oct2020,1
391,"I (25F) have been seeing a therapist since February. This wasn‚Äôt my first time in therapy, but it was my hardest bout of my depression and anxiety in a few years. 

A couple of weeks ago she contacted me to let me know she was in the hospital, and yesterday I got a call from the psychology group that she had passed away. I am absolutely overcome with grief about this, naturally.

392,"I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old girl. For these last couple of months I've been talking to this guy that I met online. We've been texting through snapchat and after a while we started to call eachother. After almost 5 months of talking to eachother we decided to meet irl. I already started to develop small feelings for him, but right before we started to meet irl I noticed that my feelings dissapeared a little, and he said the same thing, that's why we started meeting irl. The reason why I took so long to meet him was because I was insecure and I thought I was going to screw it up. The first date went amazing and the second and the third. On the third date we kissed, and I felt amazing afterwards. After every date we had, I gained more and more feelings for him, but something happened during the fifth, sixth and seventh date. I noticed that I didn't feel the butterflies and I didn't feel anything anymore when we kissed. It worried me a lot and I said that to him, we both were insecure about our feelings and last week we decided to take a little break from meeting eachother. Yesterday I texted him and said that I didn't have romantic feelings for him and that we moved forward a little too quick, I also daid that I can't imagine a relationship with him. We talked about it and he said that there's no point in continue to date eachother and that we can try being friends. I really wanted that because I care about him a lot. We also decided to not speak to eachother for a little while so that all this can sink in. At first I was a little sad, but the rest of the day was fine, but now I have a lot of anxiety and I don't know why. I had anxiety before because I thought that I didn't like him and it felt better afterwards, but now I feel even worse than I did before. I've cried several times, and I want him to be here, I want to feel his warmth, his touch and his lips and I don't know why. When I think of him now I feel warm and tingly and it's weird because I didn't feel this way when I texted him or even before that.

Well coming from a very neglectful and abusive home I pretty much tried to find love and attention from anyone. Well my second boyfriend got me pregnant at the age of 16, I was not able to abort due to lack of resources. Also, before anyone asks I was legally emaciated at this time, but before this my parents had dropped off. I also had custody of my 11 year old sister at the time.

He ended up being incredibly abusive and sexually deviant towards me, right after my son was born I was pregnant again with my daughter. It felt like there was no escape. Well after awhile my older sister was able to help me leave by letting me come to her house. alot of other stuff that isn't relevant to this happened and I was able to get my stuff together. After a awhile of being alone I tried to date again but women don't want to date other women with kids in my area, which I do understand. Well, I reconnected with an old friend that I had known when I was with my kids dad and we started talking just as friends. Well he helped me leave my father's house who is also very abusive to me and feelings started. I've been with him for 3 years now. He is incredible. He took in my children, helped me build a life, and continuously works as hard as he can for our family. I do love him so much. But I feel like I'm living a lie.. it's like my life was so hectic and horrible I never got a chance to sit down and ask myself who I really am, and what I really want. And now that things are so much better, I know I should be happy and content but I just wish I could be who I want. And I have talked to my SO about my attraction to women and how my past relationships have left me traumatized to several different sexual situations involving anyone really but mainly men. He knew before we ever even started dating, he's very accepting. But I have no idea how to go about telling him about this. I feel like to would be so unfair to ask him to accept this situation. And even so, what about my children? How will they even begin to understand my transition? I feel like I either have to lie about who I am for the rest of my life or ruin my family's life. I just don't even know where to start. Thank you so much to everyone who read all this, I appreciate you.",29Oct2020,1
394,"To give some back ground, just in case it helps, there was a worker at a facility (that most people in my small town works at) who was tested positive. One woman who was in contact with the positive one, comes and visits my grandparents (whom I live with) as we babysit her grandson.

Well, both that lady and my grandfather are showing strong symptoms. I'm typing this right after my grandfather had a coughing fit and gasping for air. This has been going on for around 4 days.

With all this, however, they refuse to socially distance or wear a mask and still invite over that woman who is waiting for her test results, like everything is fine. The woman is even still going to work, dispite complaints from her coworkers. My grandparents are retired, and I am staying home from school until this is sorted.

So my question is, how the hell am I to manage this?? It's an all around bad situation that could have been prevented, and I am worried about the saftey of others. Thank you very much in advance, and i apologize for the long post.",29Oct2020,1
395,"New account for privacy reasons. Long post.

I'm 20. About to get kicked out of school. Also 2 years late on my driver's license and quit every job I've worked. Health problems are starting to get to me and I'm distancing a lot from friends (besides one online and one IRL I don't see much now after moving recently). Ignoring messages/calls from worried people (mainly teacher and people related to stuff I'm supposed to be doing, not friends or family, not the first time). 

Spent a year getting my ADHD diagnosis and medication - it works great - stopped taking it for no reason recently.

I've stopped drawing, music, writing etc. completely and pretty much just play games (that I barely enjoy), watch youtube videos and sleep most of the time. 

The worst part is I could finish school - I SHOULD HAVE finished school months ago - by literally just finishing what little I have left to do in math and a few other things that shouldn't take too long. There is nothing stopping me from finishing my driver's license. My hobbies still interest me, it's just I find no joy in doing them at all.

I'm not fucking doing anything and I don't know why and I genuinely don't know anyone around me that I could ask for help knowing they wouldn't just be incredibly annoyed and pissed at me. ALL I want to do is sleep, talk to my two friends occasionally, play games every now and then when they release and eat.

I'm starting to have panic attacks that I normally never had and I'm incredibly frustrated at my sudden inability to function. To be clear - at the start of the year, I was fairly motivated and got a bunch of stuff moving in my life. I just didn't follow through with any of it.

My parents have lost faith in me - feels like I'm at a point where they'd care if I was dying, but as soon as I wasn't they'd be annoyed at the medical bills (which are not high in my country) and start asking when I'd get back to work. They have no interest in any of my passions (play em off as small interests, less important than ""real work) and are generally annoyed by me sitting on my ass - they're also not the type to be able to have any sort of conversation about mental health given their emotional immaturity and old fashioned thinking. For reference they take my ADHD very lightly and passive aggressively make fun of me for taking medication, because meds = poison, corona = fake and all that. I recently tried cooking for them for the first time in a long while and they were both drunk, barely tasted it without changing it up completely and telling me it was ""too salty"".

I love them, but I can not relate to them or go to them with problems at all. I feel horrible guilt constantly for being a money drain (meds, food, expensive stuff every now and then etc.) and completely refuse to get a therapist simply because I can't pay for it and my parents don't believe in therapy so they'd be pissed paying for it. I'm not guessing - I know.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously don't know what's wrong with me. I've been told to ""man up"" and ""take it one step at a time"" and I try and for absolutely no fucking reason at all I just stop and starting up again is such a gargantuan task it feels like my body gives up before my mind does. I keep daydreaming about having like 30 million just drop on my account and being able to leave everything behind, pay back my parents and live out my life until I find my passions again.

Unfortunately motivation is unreliable and discipline is the only thing that works - it's also what I lack completely. 

Seriously don't know what the fuck to do. I WANT to just quit school but given that it'd be the second time, it'd just piss my parents off even more, especially with how little I have left to finish.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't fairly actively think about ending it all - and while I can genuinely say it's not what I want to do - I'm afraid of reaching a point where I will want it.",29Oct2020,1

Lately I have noticed I seem to be getting into arguments and disagreements with more and more people. I just want to get along with people.

I've been trying to self reflect and think of what it is I am doing to cause this. Im thinking it might be because I am coming across as cocky like people have said. 

I value what other people have to say, but I dont think I am showing this. I know I have a habit of going on tangents about stuff I know about and enjoy. It is also difficult for me if someone says something I know is incorrect and says I am wrong, but I try not to be rude about it.

How do I stop coming across like this? I've been trying to just not talk as much, but I know that will only last so long. I would like to be a more amiable person and show people I value what they have to say.

I know as a doctor you loose about 6 years studying and then the rest of your life working tirelessly. I dont think I can take that kind of pressure without cracking.

My grandfather passed away when I was 12, in 2012. I'm 20 now. He was the only person in my entire family i could ever freely talk to. Him and I shared a very special bond, I only felt loved and appreciated with him. He was an amazing human being and I'm grateful for the twelve years I spent with him. 
He had one bad habit, smoking cigarettes. It was a terrible addiction. Every year on my birthday he used to make a promise to me that he'd give it up, only to be smoking the next day. Apart from that, he also had a heart valve replaced which reduced his life span too. 
I never realised I had issues with this, i have friends who smoke, both normal cigarettes and weed, I have friends who drink, again never faced an issue, i drink occasionally too. 

I started dating my boyfriend (20m) at the end of last year, 2019. He used to smoke, both cigarettes and weed, and drink. I didn't think it would bother me, but it did, terribly. He gave up smoking cigarettes for me.  He drinks occasionally now, along with consuming weed in a tea form¬ø ( I'm not sure ) 
Point is, I can't stand it. All I see is, losing him.
 
I know I sound crazy and occasionally doing this shouldn't matter but i really don't know what to do. I can't eat, if I do eat I puke, i can't focus on my work, i feel so terribly guilty for putting him through this yet I can't get this fear of losing him. 

Talking to him, his final decision is that if he doesn't understand my point of view, he can't change it. 

My friends think I'm hypocritical for drinking alcohol occasionally but not letting someone i love do something they like occasionally either. I understand that.  

So what do I do? I can't afford therapy. I don't want to put anyone through any more pain. How do I accept this and not let it affect my mind?

414,"I posted this on jobs but it didnt get any traction so posting here. I am 5 months into my first job out of university. I work as a receptionist for a charity. I currently earn ¬£15,000 a year, and according to Glassdoor the average receptionist salary in my city (Leeds, UK) is ¬£18,000.

Because of COVID we are now running just as a food bank. Now, I do like my job. But I feel that i have been consistently taken for granted and asked to do work which was not in the job description and warrants a higher salary.

For example. Without notice - literally a few days beforehand - I found out I had to co-ordinate volunteers for two weeks because management had neglected to sync up the start date of the new volunteer coordinator with the leaving date of the last one. So for two weeks I was having to manage volunteers with no prior experience, whilst maintaining my normal work. The volunteer coordinator earns at least ¬£20,000. 

Because I am at reception, we get a lot of poor/homeless people who walk in asking for food. I then have to register them, having never been trained to do so, and perform a needs assessment (basically finding out their personal situation and assessing whether they need food). I have never been trained in any aspect of social work/care yet am expected to be able to delve into someone's complex problems and decide whether they get food that day.

Some days I am essentially running the food bank as I am directing people what to do which feels like something a junior manager should do, not an entry level receptionist. 

I don't want to sound entitled and I understand  charities will always have lower salaries due to the fact that they are not for profits and rely entirely on funding bids, but I am beginning to feel quite resentful at how I am being basically exploited to do higher level work at a barely entry level salary.

423,"Throwaway acc bc of friends and SO knowing my main one. 

&amp;#x200B;

So all my life I was the 'artsy' kid - I drew from an early age, picked up music when I was 14 and everyone associates me with being a creative person in general. I've also dabbled in pretty much anything craftsy - knitting, sewing, making cards and origami etc.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the past year or two (I'm almost 30) I've been feeling less and less creative.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been inconsistent in practicing playing instruments. Now I haven't even touched my keyboard in 2 months. The guitar in 5 or 6 years. I know how much more work and time I have to put in the craft to be at least somewhat decent, and it puts me completely off it. I always tell myself I'll get back into it, then find excuses not to. In reality, I think I promise myself to start playing again just to prove to others that I am indeed the 'musical buddy/kid' they've always thought of me as. Also the sunk cost fallacy.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped drawing completely about 10 years ago, then wanted to get back into it around 5 years ago thinking I could make it a side hustle or something. After realising how much time and commitment and online presence that'd take I also got disinterested and don't even have the desire to doodle. It just takes too much time to create something that I'll hide in a pile of paper and never look at again.

&amp;#x200B;

The only creative hobby I've kept is knitting - and I've always followed patterns, never ventured into making my own. I just enjoy making useful things like sweaters and scarves that have clear instructions and progress is easily visible/measurable. I've also started enjoying birding, 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the past months I've started asking myself: am I really creative? Is that something that was just imposed on me when I was young? Or have I simply changed into a more practical and pragmatic person who can't justify sinking so much time into artsy endeavours? Has anybody else gone through something similar?

426,"I feel weird asking this on reddit but there's nowhere else and I want to hear people's thoughts.

I've been thinking about it a lot. Most people seem to end up having kids and most people feel good about it. I love the idea of bringing up babies, seeing them grow and learn, seeing how unique they are. Thing is I can't get my head round the point that any reason to have a baby is selfish and for my own wants. So I can enjoy the child, so I can have family when I grow old, etc. The world is already overpopulated, and it's rare that a child is born who goes on to make a big difference to the world for the greater good. Sure each person has value, but for many pople if they weren't born, the only people who would be affected is the parents for not having children around them. What if my children don't want to live and I brought them into this world purely for my own benefit?

Most people seem to have children and love it and it's such a huge part of their lives. If I don't have children for the reasons I've mentioned, I'll always be jealous of everyone with children. I'll get asked why I didn't have children, or it'll get brought up and people might wonder if I'm unable to reproduce. My answer would be that I don't know if attempts at conceiving would've worked because I haven't tried, that I've fucking love to bring up kids and I feel like there's a hole in my life and all this I'm missing out on, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

I've thought about adoption, maybe one day I'll be strong enough for that, I hope so. I just know it's very hard to adopt babies, and there's all these older children who need secure love and families. I'd love to bring a child up from being a baby, I'm worried if I adopted an older child that they may one day leave me because they might not form the same sort of attachment to me that babies are likely to. I know we don't know how our families will pan out, but it's understandable to want to give it our best shot.",29Oct2020,1

428,"Hi, I am a long time lurker and posting for the first time. (sorry for the long read, but I felt some details might be relevant)

I (33F) am not sure what I can do in my life where I am happy or at least satisfied doing what I like. I come from a south Asian family and my parents believed (still today believe) that social image is of utmost importance and gender roles are to be adhered to. 

My first preference in my career was to join the military of my country, but my father was strongly against it and would not let me. The second most interesting thing for me was doing mechanical engineering, just like my father. I even did exceedingly well in the college entrance exams, but again mechanical engineering was considered a masculine subject, and it's not uncommon to have just 1/2 women in a class of 50-60 students in my country, so he insisted that I join an electronics engineering. 

I guess I was wrong in not standing my ground about my bachelor's degree and picking mechanical engineering. I don't know if I thought that my father knew better or that I did not have the resources or support to go out of the house and do what I wanted which lead to my giving up on my first choice in my degree. (The country that I come from, high school graduates, 15-16yr olds don't have much of job opportunities and the military requires people to be legally adults to join by themselves else parental consent is needed. Also, there are cases of young women being trafficked in the place I come from so I was scared about leaving home without a proper place to live and a good income source to keep myself afloat). So I could not get myself to run away from home, though I considered it at that point in time.

During engineering, I realized that I absolutely hated those subjects and was zoning out and did just enough to have decent marks to not get punishment at home. It was a pretty strict atmosphere at home while there was a lot of freedom in college, so I ended up just hanging around and playing sports and doing random things. Towards the end of the degree when there was a discussion of what to do after graduation, I felt doing an MBA might be helpful in getting away from the electronics field. (I did not want to pursue a master's degree in electronics engineering and there is no way I would have been able to hold a job in the same industry). The other option was that I would be required to marry and be a stay at home wife/ parent (absolutely no option to try anything else or so I was believing at this point). 

So I got admission in one of the top B-Schools in the country and did my MBA, but somehow I felt like an outsider and that I did not belong there. So again I did what I did in my engineering time, doing enough to cruize by, not going above and beyond, or having serious interest. Since I had decent enough scores, I could get a good job soon after graduating. I was doing well ( Not outstanding) in my job too.

I was not allowed to have any boyfriends during either of these durations. My parents had access to my phone too and read my messages with friends. Arranged marriage is a common phenomenon and in their view the best thing to do for a daughter of a respectable family. There was someone I liked, but both my parents shamed me for it to the point that I just broke it off with him just to have some piece at home. Then they started bringing in prospective grooms I did not find to my liking. This time I took a strong stand and was unwilling to accept their choice. So I was thrown out of the home. Thankfully I had a job so I could get a place for myself. 

Despite my parents forcing me into things I did not like, I believed that they had my genuine well-being in their hearts. But in 2017, I met with an accident and broke my knee and no one from my family even came to visit me. It took me a few months to recover but I lost my job at that time. The whole thing shattered my opinion of family and love. I felt I gave my everything for my parents' wishes and yet they could not put aside their pride and support me when I was hospitalized. This whole thing shattered my opinion of family and love. I did end up getting a job after I was well, but it's purely because I need to pay my own bills. I did not hate my earlier jobs, but I am not able to find a purpose in things I do on a daily basis or any sort of satisfaction. 

I am at a loss about how to go about my life. I am not sure if at my age I have it in me to study and write entrance exams to universities to get into graduate programs. Should I even be doing that? Or is there a way I can motivate myself to find joy in the work I am doing currently? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance",29Oct2020,1
429,"Honestly I'm sick of it. I have to see the person who used to beat me, manipulate me, insult me, degrade me, gaslight me and make everyone believe I was overreacting for years EVERYWHERE. In university, when I take the bus...

And there's no way I can just move to another city, I live in a tiny country with 4 millions of habitants, only one nice university and the person who abused me is VERY involved in the university where I study, at the inmigrants' office...

And the worst part is that my family, people who've loved me and supported me my whole life, gaslight me about this too. ""You just have to forgive them because you SHOULD have a relationship with them, you're the one who is overreacting and acting wrong about this"".

I'm starting to feel more depressed everyday and I've lost any motivation I had to keep learning the language from this country. For what? To have to deal with this my whole life? I can't stay here.

Honestly, I want to cut my entire family over this. They're not bad people, they're amazing people, but the way they're denying my abuse by actively guilt tripping me about this is insane.

Would it be a crazy idea if I was done with this semester, packed my stuff, and moved to another EU country? I have my EU citizenship, I just need to pick a country where I can start from the beginning, learn the language, get a job and go to university again.

I'd be giving up several things by moving abroad. My entire family, free rent, a scholarship that cover several free meals a day, cheaper public transport and the entire cost of learning the language here. 

But I wouldn't have to deal with this sickness anymore. I can't see a future here, having to deal with a family that gaslights me and an abuser who's close to any public entity that could help me and support me and possibly gaslight me, like they've done everytime I've tried to ask for help as a kid, teenager or young adult.

Would it be crazy if I packed my stuff and left the country? I can't see myself having a future here anymore. This is sick. All this is sick.",29Oct2020,1

436,"I have to keep names out of this for obvious reasons. My father is in a very fortunate position career-wise that he worked very hard for. Along the way, he has made some very elite friends. I am approaching the age where college applications are starting to be filled out for early admission. My father recently brought up to me that he is very close with the head of admissions for X university, a very prestigious college. He said that if I scored well enough on the standardized tests and kept up fairly well grades, he could speak with the head and have me accepted. Keep in mind that, while my grades are nothing to turn your nose up at, they‚Äôre most definitely NOT of the level this college would normally view as ideal. This college would be amazing for my major, but I really don‚Äôt like the idea. It feels dirty, slimy, and all around shitty to do. Not only am I getting an unfair advantage for doing nothing, I‚Äôm also most likely taking a spot away from someone who deserves it more than I do. With my current standardized test scores and grades, I can get into an above-average university, but nothing even close to the level of the previously mentioned one.

I‚Äôve been trying to decide for the better part of the past two months what to do, and that‚Äôs when I decided to come to here.

The reason being for that is all my life I have been obese and I still am. Her constantly talking to me about her weight and her belly and how she‚Äôs not losing weight is triggering me a lot.

Quick background on family's political dynamics: 

I am: Independent Centrist, lean Rep on some issues, Dem on others.
SO: Independent with very Pro Blue Lives, leans Rep on more issues and Dem on few.
Young family member #1: Pro Blue Lives, fan of Rep party but not current administration.
Young family member #2: Left, very far left (beyond regular Dem, not sure of proper terminology).
Older family member #1: More Dem than Rep.
Older family member #2: Ultra Far right (Q Anon).
Older family member #3: Ultra Far right (Q Anon). 

YFM#2 has very strong political beliefs about police brutality, and while watching a segment on Inside Edition about the gentleman getting shot in Philadelphia for brandishing a knife at the family members for the third time that day (police were called to the residence three times that day) and for brandishing the knife at the officers eventually. In this instance due to budget constraints, the department did not have access to tazors (in an escalation tier, does tazer beat knife even if they had them?). 

Later in the segment, among the footage of the riots and looting, a couple became engaged (with fires and destroyed businesses in the backround) and a comment was made among¬† myself and YFM#1 on how crass and inappropriate it is. YFM#2 became extremely enraged and stormed off, slamming doors. After some time, I attempted to make contact with YFM#2 to see if they would elaborate on what upset them, and Pandora's box of explanations of why the comments about the proposal, the rioting/looting and the shooting of the gentleman was the proper reaction to this case of police brutality and how our comments about the inappropriate proposal and questions about escalation response theory were 100% wrong on a cellular level. 

I thoroughly understand that we will never have 100% of the people agree with us 100% of the time, but I am determined to make contact with and teach the younger family members on how to have a discussion without becoming enraged and enact explosive precursors of WW3. 

Can anyone advice on how to proceed?

I have many self-harm scars but they are old enough that they all whitened. However these new cuts were much much deeper than the old onee and it took much longer for them to heal. 

It‚Äôs been a bit over a month now, nearly two, and they are healed but still very red and visible. They are on my upper arms so they are quite hard to hide and I have to constantly wear a jacket or something. My sister accidentally noticed them the other day and I quickly brushed it off as old scars. 

How soon will they start to whiten? Is there anything I can do to hurry it? What other ways can I use to hide them until then?",29Oct2020,1

I'm not the best writer but here it is. Basically, if my brain was a computer I'd feel like it was running on an old Windows 95 machine with a hard disk filled to the brim with Limewire downloads. I have problems with memory, attention, concentration, sleeping...my thoughts are all jumbled up and disorganised. I'll often start talking and then halfway through I'm like 'wait I think there was a point to this story somewhere...' or often times someone's talking to me and I'll just drift off and then have no idea what they're talking about.

I think these things might be a side effect of not sleeping well for years. What I'd like is to not have my head so full of distressing thoughts all night long and quiet down so I can sleep well. I want to stop overthinking everything and just relax and enjoy my life. 

I've heard of many things like meditation, CBT, yoga etc which is all well and good but I'm wondering if there's someone out there that has dealt with the same issues and what exactly was their solution. Maybe there's a book you read that hit the nail on the head for you. Or a certain exercise/meditation routine that did the trick. Please help if you have any ideas because this shit is getting to me...

I'm on the waiting list for therapy but it's been a lil while now...

461,"Hello everyone,

My dad always had short temper and violent anger management issues. I used to tolarate it when I was younger and I used be less exposed to him ad I stayed at my moms. I am 25 years old now and had to quit my job because of the mandatory army service. Since I had to move to my hometown I needed a space to hold my stuff and my mom offered my old room as my dad refused to hold them because he would be moving soon. This left me with a single option about where to stay and it was my dads place as I could not afford a place when unemployed. And nowhere hires a guy that waits his deployment. Right when my paperwork was done pandemic errupted and military service initiations got halted. My service has been pushed to the march of 2021 and I have to stay longer with my dad. My mom wants me to move back to her and stay away from him. She says she can sleep on the couch while I sleep on her bed but I don't want to stay there as she is almost a minimum wage employee and It would be financially struggling for her. My dad however is a really stingy but 6 figure earning guy but to him there is not enough money for anything(except things that **he** wants, likes, needs etc.). But at least I can survive here without being a burden to my mom. I already developed some bad habbits I guess because of the treatment I get here. I always drink myself to sleep and anxiously leave my room when he is at home because a fight might errupt for some trivial reason. I got punched after a fight for saying I want to meet up with my girlfriend a weekend where he was looking for a place to move as he wanted me to help him arround which I do so during week. He lost his left leg before I was born in a conflict. He is now a retired colonel and spends much of his time at home. I need an advice about what to do. How to approach him. Should I go for a small job something like waiter until I am deployed and let my mother sleep on the couch? What do you guys think?

Firstly I apologise if this is in the wrong subreddit, if so any idea on where to ask?

My problem:

My sister in law and her bf are staying over this Halloween and are terrified of the IT film. 


Im planning on hiding an Alexa under their bed and hopefully setting a timer to play an audio file. 

I was just wondering how I'd go about doing this? 

I know I can ask alexa to set a timer to play a song from Spotify or I could play the sound through the Alexa App but this would make a noise before it played the sound. 

Is there anyway to turn the sound off before it plays a noise through the Alexa App?

Or

Is there anyway to set a timer to play a sound file as I can't just add it to Spotify?

A friend of mine sent me a message today at 5 am, saying ""I think I fucked up"". I woke up and read it about an hour later and asked what happened, she told me that the day before, she got mad at someone and cut herself. She did not tell me everything that happened. 

This isn't the first time this has happened; one day she told me she cut herself after having a fight with her best friend. I tried helping her and keeping her calm. After our conversation, she said she would stop and call someone every time she thought about it again.

Back to today, I talked to her again after she told me what happened. I tried telling her this wasn't good for her, that it was affecting her mental and physical health, and she told me it was normal for her since it made her feel calm and it didn't hurt. She also told me she didn't think of comminting suicide, and just likes to hurt herself.

I'm posting this because I am really worried about her and don't know what to do to make her stop, I told her to go after a therapist and she told me there was no need to. How do I make her notice this is not ok? Or should I just let her do it since she says it's good for her? Am I being selfish here? I really need to know what to do. Any tips are welcome.",29Oct2020,1

466,"I am a Malaysian Chinese male of 19 years. 

Recently, I had a bad case of depression which I've had since March. During this time I had been doing quite a lot of thinking about how I usually conduct myself which, has made me feel conflicted about how I want to continue on with my life.

As a context, I was bullied on numerous occasions without receiving any help from the ages of  7 - 16 (though I did receive more assistance at the age of 15 onwards when I arrived in Australia where teachers did more to help). During this period where I was bullied, my resentment towards my mistreatment caused me to rely heavily on my anger and violence to deal with my problems. 

Notable examples of this include how I beat up a classmate in front of the entire class when I was 11 (which stopped any major bullying towards me in Malaysia) and how I threatened to kill and fight numerous students for bullying me when I was 16 in Australia (these were serious enough that I had to seek a counsellor and where no one dared speak to me aside from the friends I already made before).  

However, once I turned 16, I started to become less reliant on my anger as I had begun to no longer be bullied. As such, I begin making an effort to make myself slightly more approachable. I begin to make some more friends and acquaintances (who are still friends with me today).

The reason I am conflicted is that I feel very vulnerable when I am no longer angry. Although I feel somewhat happier and a bit at peace, I feel as if that by choosing this path, I leave myself vulnerable to being bullied and hurt again. 

Do I go about my life in a vicious and determined manner or do I conduct myself in a soft-hearted manner? I feel as if I have no choice and I wish for some help. I don't even care if I have to make a compromise, I just don't want to suffer.",29Oct2020,1

When he passed, his 3rd wife, contacted us. Told me he passed away. I contacted my sister on Facebook and told her dad passed away, gave her the wife's phone number and my phone number. 

She said immediately that she would NOT be contacting the new wife because she didn't even know her. To which I said, ok. 

I told her that dad didn't want a service and no graveside service, which were his wishes told to me by the wife.

Cut to 2 days later. Thursday.

I don't have messenger on my phone. I only have it on Facebook. So the wife advised me that dad would be cremated on Wed at 2 p.m. and put in the ground. Because there was no indication dad wanted us there, I didn't go. Not to mention me finding out that he wrote me out of the will, so I was very hurt. 

Thursday I go on Facebook and there's two messages from my sister, both which occurred on Tuesday in the afternoon, asking when the funeral is. I've already told her Dad didn't want a service or a graveside service. I already gave her my phone number and the wife's. 

I tell her, the cremation was yesterday, but I didn't go because I was too hurt. 

She freaks out. Says she wanted to go. 

I feel terrible. I tell her I'm sorry, but I didn't get the messages that I only go on Facebook once in a while and that's why I didn't get her messages, and reminded her that I gave her the wife's number and I gave her mine.

468,"Hi everyone, A little background below

Background 

My mom sent me to live with my grand parents in another country for most of my life (owing to her own financial problems, she‚Äôs been doing a lot better these past 5 years), I was educated overseas and even obtained a job in a member state of a regional union the country my grand parents live in is apart of so I have an accent even though I am a natural born American (this also causes anxiety because I‚Äôve met some xenophobic people since returning, who are always shocked I tell them I was born in Houston). I worked in that country for 2 and a half years performing high level data analysis, acted as manager for a few months while my old manager was away on leave and acted as the official representative of the organization to various intergovernmental conferences and meetings. 

I decided after the 2 and a half years to move back to the US to be closer to my mom and other family members that live in the US. 

Problem

Now I find myself constantly worried about appearing incompetent and that I would be fired because of it, even though I know I am far from incompetent within my discipline (give me a problem and I‚Äôll have you a solution within a week sometimes unconventional). What I find difficult is the lack of training on basic wording that my employer asks us to use and the level of unnecessary bureaucracy that was not at my old employer where we were given great leeway on how we decided to do our job, we were even allowed to skip over our manager and go directly to the Director to ask a question or ask for a decision. I also realized the way we spoke and brought over information was quick and to the point, the meetings on average didn‚Äôt last more than 30 mins maybe an hour if it was complex, now? I have to give a detailed history of the project, how I arrived at the decision in detail and pretty much the entire project in detail... every... single... time...  and the meetings on average are between 1.5-3 hours, before it was a simple PowerPoint with a few bullet points. Such as, the original cost was X, the new cost is Y and the reasons for this was a,b,c and I‚Äôve come up with solutions  d,e,f and as a group we would select one option that looked feasible and then a discussion was held on that option regarding what it entails. I also find myself asking a lot more simple questions to my current manager even after 2 years than I did at my old job and it‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs that I wasn‚Äôt told the accepted process in the beginning to start what I need to get done and the procedure to get it done according to the rules and guidelines. Sometimes it‚Äôs a repeat question because I haven‚Äôt done it in over 6 months and there is no document for reference in the process. 

How do I get over this fear? It‚Äôs been causing me so much anxiety and depression lately especially with the way the economy is going I‚Äôd hate for this to be used against me especially with a little one on the way. I expressed to my manager many times I‚Äôd hate to look incompetent and she‚Äôs always told me ‚Äútrust me, if there was a problem that could cause me to fire you, I would tell you long before it got to that point, I‚Äôm a people manager not a micro manager‚Äù but that was when we worked in the office and she could easily just walk over to my office (she never has), am I just letting my fear of looking incompetent overtake reality?",29Oct2020,1

470,"(I wrote the whole story down already but then my wifi cut now it's all lost.)

\-Please read until the end, thank you. (it'll be shortened and quick.)

I met a girl on Wattpad, her name was L and she had an internet best friend named G. (we'll just call her that). We got each other's Instagram and created a group chat. She started talking about her life and how she has depression, social anxiety, and low self-esteem. She also said she wanted to kill herself. (L is 13 and G is 18)

At the start of the story, she was talking about her bullying experience. She added that 'My experience is way worse than anyone's"". She talked about how she got deep cuts because a boy decided to dig his nails into her skin. Then she said she was going to go suicide, which I stopped her and said no, so many people care about you. She replied with ""You don't know what I've been through."" And started talking about how she gets body-shamed by her parents. L said she starved herself for 2 years, no drinking or eating at all. (The human body can only survive 3 days without water and 40 days without food.) I told her that if she died, her parents would be extremely sad and we would be too. She didn't reply but only liked out msgs, she then left for a short while and came back saying ""Sorry I had to do something XD"" 

The next two days were on discord. L and G would spam me every morning to come roleplay with L. She said I needed to RP as Tom Riddle (Voldemort from Harry Potter) and Draco Malfoy. She said that she wants to be in a love triangle with them. I did this for one whole day, and she wouldn't let me take a break. The next day she got mad at me because I was busy (I had to go to school) and I couldn't RP. After finishing studying for my upcoming unit test, I went into Instagram to see many spams telling me to hurry and read discord. The message that L sent in discord was ""If Tom doesn't give me attention, he won't be getting any attention, cuddles, or kisses from me."" I told her I was sorry and that I was free now but she was mad and told me to shut up. So I did and didn't talk to her. Then she called her internet best friend to come to tell me that I was rude for ignoring her. L also sent msgs (but she then deleted it) ""Wow you forgot about me"" and ""ugh"". I apologized and just left discord. 

The next day L was talking about how other girls couldn't like Tom Riddle and that he was only hers. I told her that Tom/Voldemort was incapable of love and she sarcastically said, ""Thanks for clarifying that, (my name)."" 

L was then talking about how she'd die if Tom wasn't with her. The others were shipping L x Tom but all I could think of is, Tom is already dead. I just told her that Tom was dead already and L just told me I was rude and I had to ruin it for her. I just said sorry and went offline.

The next day, me and two other girls, S and M were talking about foods and how we should do voice reveals. Then we started joking about Harry Potter characters. They were talking about the dead ones so I just decided to say ""Dedric, Dedrius, Deddle (dead riddle)."" They said it was funny and it was all jokes and games. L joined and said that I was being mean by saying Deddle. So I just asked her how was that mean? But she just left without a reply.

This morning I got a text in a group chat referring to me from L's best friend, G. She said that I was a mean person and that she doesn't want to be near meanies like me. She also added that she doesn't vibe with meanies and people who think being mean is cool. She also said not to invite her back because she doesn't want to be around me, the meanie. 

I got confused and kind of hurt but just accepted it. I wrote a message saying, Okay, bye bye. And then L came and said ""Wtf (my name). That's so rude."" And I was wondering how that was rude so I just typed ""How?"" L then said, ""I think I get what she means now."" 

Later I got a text this afternoon, from S, saying that she was being forced by L and G. They were forcing her to choose me or them (Idk what was that about). From my viewing, I think if S chooses them, she just won't be allowed to communicate with me. And if she chooses me, she wouldn't be allowed to communicate with them. S said that she wanted to be friends with both of us and I suggested that she doesn't need to choose. But S said they were forcing her so I told her to just choose them and that she can secretly talk with me privately. But S said she couldn't trust me, I told her it was alright and that she should trust herself. S then showed me screenshots from their secret group.

L and G were talking about why I was a backstabber and a bad/mean/rude person. L said that I was mean to her and shit. G was just saying that she doesn't want S to get hurt by me and experience what they experienced. L then said that she does self-harm because of people like me, she said emotional pain was not enough for me and said that I hurt her physically. 

Like, when? We only talked for a few days. We haven't even met in real life. Plus I'm younger than all of them.

L then said that if she died, no one would give a fuck about her. 

And that's all S sent me.

&amp;#x200B;

I still do not get how I was being rude or mean. I just wanted to help out, not try to be rude. L and G, if you are reading this. I would like to apologize for being rude and mean to you.

And if i ask him if hes ok or try to cheer him up, he gets upset and says ""I'll show you angry and we can just stop right now."" All he has to do is sit in the passenger seat while i practice, I know the manuever, but instead he stands outside and yells at me. If i stop *one inch* before or after a cone, he says ""Nope! You failed! Do it again!"" If I'm too close, not hitting but just too close for his comfort, he says ""Failed! Do it again and pay attention this time."" If I'm a little cock-eyed, he says ""Are you even using your mirrors?!?! Pay attention!!"" The list goes on. And he has something to say every single time i do it. So like 2 hours of this and my brain is fried and I can't even remember what i need to work on because by now hed made 1000 comments about everything. I've tried explaining to him that mentioning things that i already know several times, like saying ""you need to be in line with the cone"" 10 times, isn't helpful and makes me discouraged, confused, and frustrated. But he doesn't care, he just says were going to do it my way or we can not do it at all. And i dont have anyone else. I need my license but im so tired of fighting with him.

She didn't receive any unemployment due to being fired and not let go (we tried) and has yet to receive her first stimulus package. 

She recently suffered a seizure and is no longer really capable of taking care of herself. She will be going to live with my brother. The issue is that I discovered many of our bills (rent, water, etc) are unpaid and overdue by several months, even longer than she has been unemployed. Before this I gave her my share of what I believed to be the rent and utilities and such and she said she was paying them. 

Faced with this amount of money, upwards of five grand for everything owed, I don't know what to do in terms of paying it back. I'm aware I was a bit foolish in just assuming she would do what she said she would do and not checking but I am here now. I do not know what to do. 

Do I face eviction even in times of Corona? What are some things I should know? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

479,"I (25F) recently connected with someone (34M) who lives halfway across the globe from me because of our mutual interests. A mutual friend connected us. We became close quickly and have shared a lot about ourselves. This is so unlike me because I am usually very private and reserved, even with the people I know in real life.

So far, we have been texting everyday for hours talking about all sorts of things. Except on a few occasions when he was sick and that time I had a total mental breakdown. He knows that I have issues with depression and anxiety. Sadly, I am not in a place where I can afford professional help. He offered to listen if I ever want to talk about any of it. Very understanding and kind, but I always limit myself on what I tell people. A big part of it is because I always feel like a burden to others and I think that sharing my personal battles with others is unfair to them. No one should put up with my shit except me.

When my mind goes to a dark place, I tend to isolate myself and not reply to any messages from anyone. This has happened twice: first when we had only known each other for a week, and again last night (where I came close to ending my life). He would text me but I wouldn't have the bandwidth to reply. Then when I've quiet for hours he would send another text saying that I can take all the time I need and that he'll miss me. He would usually end his texts by saying that he's glad to have me in his life. All of that sounds amazing, except that my brain always has the hardest time believing it. Not just with this person, but anyone who says anything along the lines of that to me ever. Because of this, I would usually spiral even worse thinking that ""Wow he is an amazing person who would put up with my mess. I don't deserve a friend like this because I probably add little to nothing to his life.""

My friendship with him actually makes me think about all other relationships I have with my loved ones. A couple of my closest friends are also about a decade(+) older than I am, and I always feel bad knowing that I can't pour equally into our relationship because I am younger. I have asked them if I reciprocate enough in our friendship, and they would say yes. But again, my brain has a hard time believing that. At this point I usually tell them to let me know if they ever need anything and I'd gladly help them.

I hope all of that makes sense somehow. I guess what I'm asking is how can I pour more into the relationships I have with friends who are older than I am, and one of them whom I've never even met?

481,"This is a very hard topic for me. I'm not even sure if it's allowed on this platform. 

My (20F) dad (49M)  got a new girlfriend (35F) recently. She's very pretty and younger than him. He proposed to her VERY soon too. I asked him the other day in a text why he did it so soon (curious) and asked if she was pregnant or something. He said no ""she's not pregnant...yet"" so i said ""you definitely don't need to have a kid."" 

but it's not for the reason you're probably thinking...my dad is a child sex predator. he sexually abused my 2 sisters when they were younger. He made me do stuff for him too. and i didn't understand it was wrong because i was a child and the youngest child. there was a case file but it never went through. he never did the same to me, but he has been grossly inappropriate toward me especially since i've gotten older. He has traumatized my sisters.

I texted her and said that he needs to get the vasectomy procedure done and it's very important. and her response was ""maybe üòä""...

I saw contraceptives on their receipt he gave me to return things to the store...He cannot have another child. She's best friends with our neighbors too so they will find out and i'm afraid they will judge me for his actions. I don't know what to do right now. I am also afraid he will kick me out if i tell her and i have a child on the way currently. (I moved back in from my abusive ex's house whom i relied on and am trying to find my own place currently ) I'm in a sticky situation right now. 
I need advice on how to tell her to make him get a vasectomy without having to tell her what he's done.

485,"Hello Reddit, as far as I'm concerned, I've been depressed for quite a long time from now. At start I thought I just had bad days like everyone does, but it started getting worse by each day. I have to mention that my parents broke up by the time I was in my last year of middle school, right before having my high school exam +adding the major bullying caused by my appearance. I think this is where it all started and it grew by each day until today. I'm not really good at socializing since I have really bad anxiety when I'm around new people and my only friends are now starting to drift apart from me unfortunately. I'll start my first year of college soon and I'm scared to death. Me and my friends had a stupid fight over something, and instead of talking like adults we just decided to ""split up"" let's say, and so this is why we're not in good terms any longer. Of course, this didn't help my depression in any way, just made it worse than ever. I don't feel like I am worthy enough to go to this college tho, I did pretty bad in my college exam and so my parents are pretty disappointed on me, adding the fact that they have to pay for my college, telling me over and over that only if I had studied more for this exam, they wouldn't have to pay for my college. And so I came here for any advices, I don't think my mental health is good enough rn, especially with my college starting soon. My anxiety and low self-esteem won't let me approach people or make new friends most likely. And I tried this, trust me, but it ended up bad most of the times. Sometimes I think about committing suicide, and yet I end up changing my mind because I haven't had the opportunity to see if this world is truly worthy to live in. And so I start thinking about suicide again when bad shit happens, and again I change my mind, so this is the vicious circle of my life. I kinda wanna keep on going with my life to see if it gets better, but I always feel not worth enough for people or consider myself a bad person by the end of the day. So if you've been in a similar situation or if you have any advice on improving myself or confronting my depression, it will be more than welcomed!

487,"A year ago I was having troubles with my girlfriend, even to a point where I didn't know if I loved her anymore, and that got even worse when I met a girl that I thought was really interesting. At first it seemed like she was interested in me too, and one night in a party I got really drunk (honestly, the most drunk that I've ever been). I don't remember most of the party, but a couple of weeks after, a friend told me that he saw me trying to kiss the girl but being rejected bc she also had a boyfriend. I've never felt worse in my life, I've never wanted to cheat on my girlfriend and things were starting to get better between us. So, I decided to let it pass because I didn't have feelings for this new girl, is just that she was really pretty and interesting. 

So the thing is that now one of my best friends started to talk with her like 3 weeks ago and things are looking good for them. I'm really glad for him and I'm really happy with my girlfriend, who is also very close to my friend.

490,"As a young gay kid who was relentlessly bullied, I was always shamed for just the way I was. This made me really self conscious about myself to the point I started to believe that yes because I am different, I cannot do same sporty activities that other guys. Those things are meant for 'straight' guys only. That was kind of the belief I was stuck with for the longest time.

In my early 20s, I was still very much stuck in my past traumas. While I started going to the gym, I limit myself to only doing cardio or walking on the treadmill because going to the weights section meant coming across bodybuilders and the other fit guys, which basically was a trigger point for me. I would say well I dont know how to exercise with dumbbells, no one ever taught me, what if I do something clumsy and people laugh at me etc. Basically, I was still scarred from my past traumas of being bullied by straight guys for being different. Seeing a fit straight guy would 'trigger' my past traumas. Hence I would avoid that section of the gym.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways time passed, I started developing more confidence and slowly overcome my traumas, basically got old lol. Some self therapy helped as well. I really started learning about training plans and nutrition plans well late into my 20s going into my 30s. This is when I started to actually train properly. While I am generally pleased with the progress I am making and taking care of my body through training and nutrition, I recently came across  an article saying about how training in your teens and 20s is really peak the time to build muscle and strength.

This kind of disheartened me because now I'm wondering if putting in all this effort now that I am 30+  is actually going to help me with my muscle building goals or am I just way past my prime years.

502,"This will probably sound like a big pity party, you're free to have your opinions, I guess I'm just going to try an paint an accurate picture. I already know I'm a weak piece of shit. 

I'm approximately 30 years old, dropped out of uni (I was shit at it, and I found out university is effectively a ponzi scheme in my country, less than 50% of graduates find full time employment in their field of study. My country doesn't have the economic complexity. That was the big nail in the coffin, I can't be wracking up heaps of debt for a coin toss at a job.), haven't really had a proper job in about 8 years other than some casual work every couple of years, obviously I'm an incel because no woman wants a man without a job.

Don't really know how to get my life on track. I've felt pathetic for years, I'm too old to be this shit in life, I've never had a girlfriend. I've literally applied to hundreds, and hundred, and hundreds of jobs, I use the word literally in the literal sense. For the past couple years I've just given up hope and stopped looking.  This isn't a life worth living. I'm really angry at the government letting so much industry go overseas, but I'm not sure if that's just a coping mechanism to hide how pathetic I am and shift blame from myself. 

I've tried setting up a business, but there is so much red tape and bureaucracy, it's really hard, and it's even harder when you don't have money. 

I've looked at getting an apprenticeship, but I'm mature age and they don't want that, also they have the mind-set that being older they can't teach me and I'd be stuck in my ways. I know people that have been waiting years trying. You can't even go and do the training separately, no teaching institutions will take you without being employed as an apprentice. 

Sometimes I have really dark moments where I think about ending myself. 

I don't know what to do. There's so much I have to do and I don't even know where or how to start again. No one will accept my resume for a job, there will literally always be someone with a better resume than mine, especially with such long job gaps. 

Sometimes I wish I was born in a different time, even if they were horrible times to live in, at least I'd probably be respected in the community and would be able to have a family. 

I haven't really been happy for about a decade. I don't think I'll ever feel love again, the last time I did was in a dream a couple years ago. 

The two proper jobs I did have had so much corporate bullshit backstabbing, one of them brought me to the point having a breakdown from hating it so much and trying my hardest at it but being fucked over, I was either going to die or leave, and I guess my psyche just kinda broke lol (I couldn't leave it for personal reasons so I tried for as long as I could).

It didn‚Äôt help that she has never made it past the talking stage with multiple guys and got ghosted since she only goes after extremely good looking fuckboys. My boyfriend is part of the top 10% in the looks department, and she said he looked like the moon emoji and Prince Charming from Shrek and was a 6.5/10 after I showed her photos of him. I only ended up showing her a photo cause she showed me photos of guys she found attractive first. 

Also, I found out that she tried avoided introducing me to her friend group from high school last year because she was jealous and afraid I would become better friends with them at a party. On our last hangout she literally told me all of their secrets and that was when I knew that she hangs out with everyone separately so that she can talk behind their backs without them finding out.

So far I have matched with a few models, a news reporter from my hometown, and a gem professor and ended up posting an instagram selfie story with all 3 of them. 

All of a sudden, her and her friend group are hitting me up out of nowhere and acting super nice and sweet all of a sudden. What do I do now? I‚Äôm so angry",29Oct2020,1

517,"This is more of a short rant than request for advice but I feel I should do it here. I may delete this afterwards. 

TLDR: Almost every group I get together to play a game runs into an immediate problem, mostly out of my control but anyone else have this kind of issue? 

I'm playtesting a ttrpg game of mine and have written a lot of one-shots (games that are done in one 3-4 hour session) and campaigns and a lot of them don't see the light of day because every group I try to get together runs into some sort of issue. Now it's not all bad because I still have one 4-person group that has played 15 sessions so far in a campaign, they're very supportive. 

But I had a 6 person group that fell apart within a 48 hour period. One person left because of ""work"" (I know it's not but I think he was worried he'd sadden me with not being honest, which I would honestly prefer), one left because a friend of theirs was going through a divorce with a friend of mine (who I've stopped talking to) and thought it might be awkward, 2 of them kept missing sessions last second and 1 kept saying ""if you want to do it that day"" and started treating it like a chore. So that group I surmised just didn't click well and let it die. 

Another group had 4 people, but due to the pandemic 2 of them broke up and 1 of them told me he wanted to be in a different group because their playstyles didn't mesh well and they don't want to do the game over discord. 

Another group I got had 4 people in it and they played one game on discord. Then 1 person couldn't join because of work, 1 couldn't because of some medical issue (he didn't specify and I wasn't gonna prod since that's private), and 1 just recently lost their mother which is out of our control so I understand him not wanting to play or communicate at this time. 

And another group I had I asked only to be 4-5 people and they're trying to put in 6-7 now. But even that group has 2 people that actually communicate and the others don't. Like I gave them a date and got no responses from some of them for 2 weeks and then 1 says ""Sorry I got a show with my band that day"" and I 'm in a band myself, you'd know when you're playing, if someone asks what day you wanna do something that's just something you should know off the top of your head and not day of. And another one said he's busy with work which he's always used as a cop-out (he's also from the first group). But we might be playing on monday with at least 3-4 of them so we'll see. 

This is more of a rant and I've almost lost motivation a few times, and tbh I'm not entirely comfortable with finding people online to try it just because they could steal the game etc. I've been working on it for 2 years now and  I just want to make sure the game works and people have fun with it. I'll admit maybe it's a lot I'm asking for to find a group that wants to do it weekly but I love making these stories and I love watching people solve them, making this game has been giving me encouragement to write again. 

It's just getting annoying, and I understand a LOT of it is out of my control like work and life and not everyone likes to play TTRPG's. I've had groups pull the ""oh yea I'm definitely interested"" approach then don't respond, and at this point if those people don't get back to me within a certain time frame I just consider them out. If they don't reach out when I do it's a dealbreaker. 

It's just after a certain amount of time I'd like to have a good group that could meet weekly and I feel confident they would stick around and find time to enjoy it. To be honest I'm not even sure how long my only group left will last, just to keep the juices flowing I'll after every story arc have my group play a different TTRPG for a session or 2 just for fun and try something new. 

Has any gaming GM's had this issue, what do you guys do or what advice do you give? I don't want to give up because I've been working on this game for 2 years and I ain't about to stop. There's been time's I've wanted to playtest the game myself but that's hard to do when you know everything that's gonna happen.",29Oct2020,1
518,"This is all very hard, things that I have held in for a long time, but I have no family and I got rid of my ""friends"" months ago. I have no one else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24. I have a 2-year-old, $30,000+ in debt and I may just have to file child support even though my ex is now homeless. We were together for 5 years and I should have seen the red flags years ago when I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2016. All of my money was cleaned out from what I earned in boot camp, I had no idea until a week before graduation. That money was supposed to help me become more self-sufficient, I wanted to move out of Mom's house for starters. Get a car, work on my credit. Adult things. We eventually got there, until things just spiraled out of control. It was hard being the only working adult when we had finally settled in and had our child. I just couldn't catch up and I wasn't getting any help. 

We eventually were evicted and we wound up in a Catholic family shelter program, from there we moved onto renting another apartment after staying there for 10 weeks. I found the listing on Craigslist of all places. We were desperate and running out of time as 10 weeks was the deadline at this particular shelter. A friend of my ex who had a child about the same age wanted to move in with us and offered to split up the bills, so we agreed. It became clear after 2 months that it wasn't going to work, the roommate quit their job and my ex still wasn't working. On top of that, the roommate was moving extra people in, including a boyfriend who was wanted on a warrant 2 counties over. It took a lot of back and forth with the court but we eventually kicked them out. Our landlord had offered a discounted rent if I were to help with the property maintenance from then on since the roommate and the extra people were gone, to which I agreed. After 2 weeks it was evident that the landlord wasn't going to honor that deal and basically screwed us over. Another eviction, claiming we failed to pay the full amount of rent. 

At this point in desperation not to go through this a second time, I called my family to withdraw the cash out of my old 509 plan for college. We ended up using this money to move to Oregon the next 2 months after the second eviction process was finished. Unfortunately, we just didn't have the extra money until it was too late. Yay, more debt. But it didn't stop there. Oregon was nice for 4 months and then I realized, this relationship just isn't going to work. Yet after all the work I put in over all this time just didn't matter. My ex's solution was to drop me off at a shelter and take our kid and that was that. I felt completely betrayed. After 5 years and a child and never once stopping to admit their own mistakes and faults, I'm the one that apparently deserved this. I did not want to go back to moms but I had no choice. This was especially hard since COVID-19 had just come to light at the time. I basically stayed at a motel with my son for 3 weeks, trying to wait it out. Eventually, I had to settle for a 3 day trip on Amtrak in coach. Mom was staying in Tennessee at the time, we ended up in Memphis and then had to travel to Knoxville from there. It was rough, a lot happened in the 5 months we were there before we all moved back to Florida. I had gotten into a Xanax binge basically because I just couldn't handle the ever-changing emotional roller coaster that was my life.

Now we're back, funny how this all works sometimes. Back in Florida, the same area, and everything. It's like it was all for nothing. I work a minimum wage job again and I feel like there's no recovery in any aspect somedays. I'm drained, tired, sick of being sick and tired, angry at the world. I can't sleep, I don't eat and most days I just stop caring. Anytime I have a day where it just feels like too much, I get told I can pack my stuff and leave, my mom will then keep my son, just like that, I can figure out my life on the streets. I didn't ask for this, I never wanted to come back, but what my son needs and what I want are two totally different things. As I'm even writing this I just feel less of a care for everything. I just don't know how to handle it anymore. I just want my life back and I feel like I'll never get there.",29Oct2020,1

520,"I'm a 20 yo girl, and I still live with my parents, and my sister (16). We had this amazing dog, Honeybee, a 12 yo cocker spaniel.   
He was an amazing dog, loving, curious and nice to everyone. Unfortunately, due to his old age, he suffered from many diseases : diabetes, cardiac murmur, and he also became blind and deaf. 

Fortunately, due to the recent pandemic, I was able to telework and could stay with him most of the time. 

However, two weeks ago, his situation became worse. He didn't move anymore, and became incontinent. One day, he just stopped eating. Even the things he loved and that we always forbid him to eat (such as chocolate or our cat's food) he just didn't want to eat anymore. I staid close to him the whole day, and tried to feed him multiple times, but he simply refused.

I called my vet to see if I could get an appointment, but he told me it was probably an indigestion, and that my dog knew what he was doing. He just advised me to try and give him sugary water so he would not dehydrate or go into hypoglycemia due to his insuline shot in the morning.

I gave Honeybee some sugary water in a syringe and he seemed to like it. He licked half of the syringe then turned his head away. 

Then I made a terrible mistake. As I was always taking him with me, I took him in my arms to transport him in the kitchen with me. Since I'm a clumsy idiot I accidentaly hit his head on the doorframe. I immediately apologized profusely and let him know everything was fine. He seemed unfazed so I forgot about it. Before going to sleep, I tried to give him some steamed chicken. He ate the whole plate ! I was so relieved... But 10 minutes later, he vomited it all and my hopes went downhill again. 

I tried to go to sleep, but was awaken at 1am by Honeybee, who was turning in circles. I didn't understand what he was doing so I stopped him and pat his head. His eyes were moving like wipers... I released him and he began spinning around again. I rushed on the phone to call the emergency vet, who told me to come to his cabinet right away and woke my father to come with me. 

The vet only took one look at him and said Honeybee had a stroke. Half his brain was already dead and there was nothing more we could do. We had to put him down, it was probably one of the worst moments of my life. I cried for an hour in the car before I could find the courage to go back home, with his ashes in a wooden box.  

When I came back home, I tried to keep my mind occupied and went to see the causes of a stroke on the internet. One of the main causes is a shock to the head... and it suddenly hit me. The doorframe accident. I'm probably the one that caused my dog's passing... 

I feel awful. I don't know who to talk to. Our pet dog is gone forever and it's all my fault. 

How can I tell this to my sister, to my parents ? We all loved Honeybee so much... But I can't keep this to myself... How can I explain that because of my clumsyness our best friend is gone forever ?",29Oct2020,1
521,"First of all I want to apologise for the possible mistakes, English is not my native language and this is my first post.

Some context here : yesterday the president of my country announced that we will be quarantined again tomorrow. Schools will remain open but not the universities. I'm [20F] an university student. This year, I live with 3 flatmates but I only knew one [20F] before the beginning of the year. She and I are pretty close : we eat together everyday, we go grocery shopping together, we do homework together, we go to school together and so on. 
The last 2 weeks, we have been in internship so she is staying at her parents who live far from here. I currently stay in our flat because it is closer to my internship.With the announcement of the quarantine, we asked ourselves where we wanted to live: either together in the flat that we share or each one with their parents. She really seems to be willing to come back here because she thinks it could be funnier for us to study together than on our own and she's scared to be bored with her parents. 
I told her I would stay in the flat if she came back. I told her so mainly because I thought we would really discuss it today, the day after the announcement. The thing is that I really don't want to upset her or be rude to her but I'd rather go back to my parents apartment. In fact, we don't know how long we are gonna be quarantined and I'm not sure what would happen if we lived together for so long. I'm scared to be in a bad mood most of the time, or to just want some alone time. On the other hand, living with my parents is very relaxing : we all have our things to do but we are calm people and the apartment is very peaceful. During the first quarantine, I was with my family and everything went just fine.
I really don't know how to tell her that I don't want to be quarantined with her because she is a very close friend and as I say I don't want to be rude. I feel like I'm completely stuck here and that the choice is up to her. I feel like I should have been more clear yesterday and now it would be mean to tell the truth. I don't know what to tell her so if you have any advice on how to do it without upsetting her I would be very grateful.",29Oct2020,1

Then I think of how the cables on a bridge holds the bridge up and the next thing i know the bell goes.

I also fidget non stop in class. Either im bouncing my leg or playing on the calculator, or with the pens and ruler.

I have told my mom about this and she just says im lazy. My brother had adhd so she does know it exists.

I explained this over text message to X (should have done it face-to-face, really).

540,Watching someone I care about deeply destroy themselves with guilt is one of the hardest things ive ever had to go through. I feel like there is nothing I can do to help. I feel so helpless. I just want to hug them and tell them it's going to be ok but I know it won't help. I don't know what to do or if there is anything I can do. The guilt is partially related to me so being there for them just hurts them more. I don't want to force myself on them so should I just give them time or do something else? I want to help them get professional help but I know if I suggest it it will only anger them. They are far away from me but I would do anything to see them at peace. They don't have much family to go to for this kind of stuff. I'm so lost.,29Oct2020,1

543,"So basically the situation is that post leaving college due to the Pandemic, none of my friends would talk to me.  During college, they would always come to me for info about parties or hanging out, but during the summer quarantine I would always be the one asking how they were, they would never respond or even if they did, they never were the first ones to text.  We moved in together this past fall, and I went through a terrible depressive episode.  From moving in together, they would make jokes at my expense (like calling me stupid) or just be rude to me for simple things.  I admit there were times that I was in the wrong, and I told them that and apologized.  I did become an alcoholic during this time and was very suicidal and when I tried to talk to them about it they either didn't care or listen and called me an attention whore so I just closed myself off.  Now, they are saying I need to grow the fuck up and are basically calling me a shitty friend, which I feel like I deserved during some movements, but at the same time, I basically was just my quiet self when we lived together.  I don't know what to do because I feel that their placing all this blame on me, when they are equally to blame, such as one of the girls slapped me when I was crying or another would just cuss me out, or them just gossiping about me when I was in my room, and them just texting me telling me I'm a shitty person.",29Oct2020,1

545,"I think I need some outside perspective. Please don't be too harsh. This situation weighs heavily on me.

Pros: I've been doing data entry for an office since February making the most money i've ever made before. granted it's still not a lot but I've been able to live comfortably and actually buy myself something nice once in a while. I've been able to actually save money! and I have health insurance and a 401k. I also don't have to come into work until 9am and the office is only 10 minutes from my house. Another pro is that I get to listen to my audiobooks all day and I've been finishing 7 books a month since June.

Cons: I work for my dad and it's made me hate him. We're constantly butting heads on almost everything and ergo we haven't talked in months and me working for him has greatly strained our relationship. He'll yell my name across the building, he's tried to kiss me and hug me in front of my coworkers, and generally makes me feel unprofessional in a place where I already know I was hired due to nepotism especially since he never does that with my brothers who also work for him. I also don't like my job.  Sitting in my cubical all day copy/pasting numbers into an excel sheet is numbing my brain. (there's other very personal stuff going on with my relationship with my dad that I won't include here but it's the stuff that makes me disgusted and embarrassed to the point where I haven't talked to my dad in months. Please trust that it's not frivolous stuff) 

**I have an interview for a job i'm actually interested in** but the pay cut is dramatic and I'd be making $12-13 an hour like I was before I graduated from University. And the commute is 40 minutes into the city at 7 in the morning and driving to the city makes me nervous. I'll also lose my benefits. And it's just an interview and I don't want to count my chicks before they hatch.

I know I'm in a very privileged position to be able to quit my job during a pandemic but I'm afraid that if I continue on with this job I'll hate my dad and myself. I have a degree that I have no interest in using and therefore all the jobs I actually like are entry-level jobs paying $12 an hour with no benefits. 

**Also, COVID has made my field of interest kinda stagnant. I eventually want to be a flower farmer and I think working at this flower shop is a way to dip my toes into the job I'm actually interested in. Should I wait more months for the pandemic to settle down or should I take the leap?**",29Oct2020,1

I'm in France, so after high school, you have a wide array choices in terms of orientation. I picked something called a ""CPGE"" which would translate to ""preparatory classes"", which are renowned to be extremely demanding in terms of work and investment - you're basically to do nothing but  work for two years in the hope to get into one of the best ""schools"" in France.

My hopes were that such high stakes would motivate me to give everything and basically get to work. 2 months after the beginning of the school year, it's not going so well.

I don't revise for my tests - which I fail, I start my homework way too late, I spend my time doing nothing because I don't have the energy to work.

Now 2020 has been hard for all of us and life has a bad habit of kicking us while we're down but this girl is at her wits end. Shes lost her Dad, her grandfather (dads side), her house in a fire, her dog in that fire, her car due to mechanical failure. 

2020 has taken its toll on her and I dont know how to be there for her when I want to be.

552,"Yesterday I submitted my letter of resignation to a company that I have worked for since I was 15. I am 24 now. 

Needless to say, the people I have met have had a huge impact on my life. My job is also high profile, so everyone knows what I do and they can hear my work in realtime (that‚Äôs the best hint I‚Äôm going to give you as to what I actually do). 

The emotional abuse started two years after I got the job. I was young and impressionable and they knew that I wanted to be at that company so they took advantage of me. They had me work off the clock for about two years, would pass me up for job opportunities but tell me that I am an ‚Äúasset‚Äù and I am an ‚Äúexcellent worker‚Äù. 

I have talked to my supervisors multiple times in the seven years I have been there and they have always gave me the run around about the budget. Then, they would go and hire other people. As of this writing, I am still making minimum wage. Not. One. Raise. In seven years. 

After COVID, things got worse. My superiors were let go and the people who came in shook things up. They are manipulative and everyone is miserable. They made me do things that a full-timer should be doing, and got verbally upset with me when I had questions or comments. They would openly ask us for ideas, but would promptly shut them down when we gave them. 

Yesterday, I had enough. In the spur of the moment, I resigned. 

I had a mental breakdown this past Saturday about the job and I knew at that moment that I needed to leave. 

Everyone knows I work for this company. It‚Äôs very prominent in my community. How do I deal with that? How do I deal with that anxiety of when someone asks me why I am not working there anymore? 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

553,"TLDR; I suppress my emotions and my family is worried.

&amp;#x200B;

So let me preface this by saying I'm not religious at all. It would be atheism if I were actively disbelieving, but really I just don't think about religion or let it have an impact in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

This is relevant because I was in a vehicle accident about 3 weeks ago where I struck and killed a young woman who was walking in the middle of the road. Officers ruled that she was at fault but I admittedly still feel awful and guilty over it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my dilemma is that my family wants me to speak with a family friend that is a pastor. I don't know this man besides meeting in passing a few times. He seems very nice and I have no issues with him in general, not to mention he has gone out of his way to request to speak with me to make sure I'm okay. I don't like to talk about my personal issues, much less with someone of faith as I'm concerned the conversation will steer towards that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a somewhat advice request, and somewhat a AITA if I tell my family I don't want to talk to him. I admit I do need to speak with someone, but I just don't feel comfortable talking to him. Also, know that this will cause some family member's feelings to get super hurt.

My boyfriend and I are both college students in a college town. Clubs are open. House parties are raving. Covid pretty bad in our part of Florida... My roommates and I are only hanging out with our close circle of friends (3 house holds) and have made halloween plans for the group of us. My boyfriend, involved in many things that can‚Äôt be converted online, is with his groups of people that I know don‚Äôt hold the same covid standard. I feel very guilty seeing him and knowing that he‚Äôs probably not being as safe as my roommates and I agreed to be.

Also, my roommates are clear that I can do what I want, but I find it hella disrespectful blatantly going against their covid values.

556,"So I was talking to my crush and we were sending snaps having a convo. I will note he was being off. His energy was weird but I pushed it off. Then I get a snap and I opened it. The pic/snap was of a text ‚ÄúüëÄ‚Äù and the picture in the background was showing his crotch. He was wearing pants, not showing a bulge it anything. Like it was panning down showing his crotch. Idk why he did that.

Chores? Has to be done my way, and his way is never good enough. It seems no matter how many times I tell him how to do it he still won't do it right. Cooking is the same thing (though he seriously cannot cook). Part of it stems from how clumsy he is, he regularly breaks something in the house at least once a month.

562,"So this is actually the second undocumented immigrant I've dated (I guess I have a type lmao) and I should mention that my prior experience and other trust issues are coming into play.

We're pretty early on in the relationship, a few months in, and we were friends before but I know that it's still going kind of usually fast. We're both very honest and direct people. I don't want to be a cynic but I understand that there's a reason he's dating a younger white girl in Utah, and so I've made my goals really clear from the start. I don't plan on getting married at 19, or 20, or 21, or even 22. I'm not sure I want to get married at all and I'm too young to feel like I should be focused on that. I'm working on my degree and I have other priorities.

When I first talked about this he made some disappointed jokes but he recognized that he's a few years older than I am, and we just started dating, and he gets that I might have a different life plan. He mentioned that my ex (the other undocumented immigrant lmao) probably scared me talking about marriage so early on, and he's not even sure he sees himself being married soon.

The other day we had another conversation about his background and his plans, and I got a little more worried. To move forward with his work goals he needs a certain kind of license that he can't get without papers. He told me about how he once offered this girl $10000 to marry him, and he said that he'd do the same for me if I ever wanted to marry him for the papers, even if I didn't want to be with him. It wasn't a clear proposition, just a ""this is on the table"" but the conversation was uncomfortable and now I'm starting to worry that it's the only thing he's sticking around for. 

I think he could tell I was uncomfy and he made a little joke about how ""Now I must think he only wants me for the green card"" and I didn't say anything because this is exactly what I was thinking.

To be clear I don't care about his background, that he broke the law coming here, etc. He was a child and his family did what any reasonable people probably would have done. He has a clean record, no drugs or crime or anything, and he's a good person but he's trapped by his circumstances.

I know we need to talk about this but I don't really know how to approach it. I want to be sensitive and respectful. I don't want him to think I'm making generalizations because he's undocumented or that I don't have any trust for him. I just want to make sure he still understands that I'm barely out of childhood, and I want to pace this relationship slowly as planned, and I don't even really want to talk about getting married until we've been together for a lot longer.

She offered to babysit our son for free since she‚Äôs living with us. 

She has a part time job as a waitress and in the summer as an assistant photographer. We told her we‚Äôd pay her if she can watch our son when she‚Äôs off and we‚Äôd reimburse her any expense. She helps pay our water and electric bill and buys her own food. Because of her only working part time and going to online school we feel the need to help her by paying her to watch our son so she has extra cash for herself.

I continued to pay for everything all while we wait for his apprenticeship program for the local 58 iebw..... before he got into the program I left him because I was sick of taking care of him and my child (simple enough) I DID NOT leave my child with him when I left because he was financially incapable himself.... when I left, his mother funded court motions and an attorney and he said I was unfit to mother my child. (I did not know until later) A couple days after I left, our son told me he wanted to see daddy... I took him.. when I was getting ready to leave after visiting he called the police and had me removed from his mothers property (where we were visiting with him) WITHOUT my son.... during court proceedings it was being ordered that I pay child support... I felt defeated and allowed daddy to come back home, at this point we were trading our child week on and week off...

I was in a shop trying to pick up some rice when a boy, who looked like a very young doppleganger of the masseuse came in, and I literally ran out with my body clenched and frozen. after going to the police, I felt absolutely ridiculed by the female cop who, when told her I was sexually violated (I whispered it sort of, shame on my end of course) took out a piece of paper and with random people and other cops around, asked me for my story. i had tears in my eyes, and it wasn't a story I wanted to shout. I practically had to beg her to bring me to another room aka an active hallway, but at least that felt more private. it was clear that she thought I was an idiot and upon initially feeling like I had been violated (I wasn't sure and I was hoping that things weren't going there- which of course now sounds so damn stupid), asking me things like ""wait so you let him continue?"". They were so deterring, I was given a case number, and intended to follow up, but depression and then learned my dad's house was being foreclosed upon. I had to leave the city, and am going to vote tomorrow to feel empowered, then go to speak to the detective. i hope the case can remain active, as I know many things are dismissed with time. in ny state, it seems sexaul assault is open for 2 years, but I am not sure what to classify what happened to me as.

this might be really silly, so if anyone does read this, please share honestly. as a result of helping my dad, I have no money. things are bad in my state, and I worked lovingly in hospitality for years. i miss it so much, but live with and care for immuno-compromised now. i am angry that i wrote a letter to the owner of the business and left a message, and never heard back. i am angry, maybe most with myself, for paying and tipping. i am enraged and crying, knowing that i have zero dollars in my bank account and that I gave that stupid $60. i want to run in there and demand it back because I need it, and they don't deserve it, but I don't think that's an option. i just don't know what to do here, and I know it seems like a terribly dumb thing to focus on, but as I sit here, reveling in the hurt from all this, I also just feel robbed.

584," Hey there all, been having issues with a badger between two people. A badger has been making craters in the back yard, and the people don't know where it is currently hiding during the day. One person wants to call in badger experts to relocate it, while the other wants to keep the badger in the area to quell the local mouse and rat population. So they've come to an agreement; find a way to keep the badger in the front yard and out of the back.

How can they do this without involving pest control or a relocation group? The main reason the first person wants the badger out of the back yard is because (well, obviously because of yard destruction, not much is in the front yard) they have chickens which they are afraid the badger will target as soon as possible. They've been trying their best to reinforce the fencing and such for the poor birds, but badgers will get in however they want from what I know.

Any advice on how to convince the badger to look for food in the front yard rather than the back? Any affordable methods such as deterrents (I mean all I find are crazy methods like using lion urine--where would they get that without spending a fortune?!), trapping methods, baiting, ect?",29Oct2020,1

590,"WARNING: This may be insanely misogynistic, Hypocritical and lastly unfair, but today I don't care anymore.

I am a 19 year old, straight cis-male

Where does this post come from? Frustration and Realisation

I considered myself to be a romantic and was also raised in a conservative house. Sex was viewed as vulgar, still is. I learnt it's a pleasure for women, a little too late.

Always prided myself as a gentleman, That I would never hurt a lady's Honor (by sleeping with her), just to satisfy my lust. In fact I thought not acting on my lust was my strength as a genteel.

Then I was met with reality. That I am nothing but a nice guy. That girls are going to sleep around. If it's not you it's someone else, they won't regret it.
If they find out that it makes you uncomfortable, they'll lie about it.
That people began having sex at 12 and you're a Virgin at 19, I am truly disgusted by them, yet I envy them.

No one's waiting for marriage to give away their firsts and to make it special for each other. To them, all of them, Sex is just a fun act.

I still can't get that into my head. So I am going to play by their rules and Still come out on top.
I want to lose my firsts to women who absolutely don't matter to me. I want to go out there and have sex with as many beautiful women as I can. I want to drown myself in sex and numb myself.

**No, I am not insanely handsome, nor do I have a big dick, But that's the whole point of it all. I have been looked down upon and called names. I have not felt worthy for a long time**

I don't want to get good at Sex, I want to be the fucking Magnus Carlson of Sex. I want to make you feel that sleeping with me is a blessing and you wouldn't mind miss it for the world.
**I want to make Women feel special.**

And at the same time, I want to get back at all of those who had an advantage over me, They are richer, more handsome and prolly have bigger dicks.

**And I want to trump them all**

I want to get even with those who had a headstart in their sex lives(started early). I want to fuck around and explore everything about myself and Learn everything I can. So that when I get married and in a monogamous relationship with my wife, I won't ever be retroactively Jealous of her past. Who she fucked, How good they were, Because I had my fun time and I know I can do my best to make her feel special and the best. So that I don't have a constant pressure of not being enough, because if I am not enough for her, There are others who do want me!.

**I won't ever fall ever fall short of her exes and not be able to give her what they could.**

**In fact all I want is to be her best**

Her absolute best in all aspect in Life and Bed.
I want to become the KING OF LUST AND DESIRE.

**Yet, I am hypocrite. I don't want my sister to get messed up with Sex. She's still 10 years old. I'd be happy if she came out as gay but that's not my decision. The only thing that stops me from my actions is KARMA and setting an Example.
I don't want my sister to become a slut.
I don't want her to follow this example of mine.**

594,"TLDR: owner of bar propositions staff and customers, as well as ignoring covid guidelines 

I work in an independent bar, I've been there now for 2 years. When I started I was warned about the owner by other staff members saying that he's a creep. About 2 months in of me starting I bumped into him on a night out, he ordered me a jaegerbomb and then asked me if I wanted a threesome with him, I just smiled laughed and walked away. Since then I've witnessed or been told about many other things that he's done, for example trying to kiss a member of staff 3 times whilst he was drinking and she was working. He'll come into work and drink and hit on young customers (I think he's about 40 and these girls are usually 18-early 20s), usually he'd open with 'I'm the owner, I can get you free drinks' before sitting down with them, and later asking for them to have sex. He touched a customer leg and asked her if she'd like to go back to his and have sex and he'll give her some coke. This is also during covid where table hopping is not allowed. 

He'd come into work and stand at the bar (again a break of covid guidelines) with his friends, or sometimes with paid company, making out at the bar in front of staff and customers, making some feel uncomfortable. Occasionally he'd make us stay open longer because he wants to continue drinking, this means on those nights some go without a break when working for 7hours.

He makes a lot of staff and customers feel uncomfortable, but he doesn't do this when sober, only drinking. I spoke to management about it and they told me that the owner has no say in staff related matters, I don't believe this is true. I'm going to talk to citizens advice as soon as I can. 

He's a manipulative creep, and I was wondering what any options could be, if there is anything that can be done? I'm not sure if this is enough for a sexual harassment lawsuit? If it is, what would happen to the business? Would they be able to get a new owner?

Months ago, a relative took photos of all of my senior mother's ID (passport, social insurance number, health card, driver's licence and citizenship card). She claimed she was helping my mother sign up for some bonus senior financial assistance. The relative came back weeks later, and tried to get her to sign a document without letting her read it.

598,"So at first I'd like to give you a short summary of the background.
I moved from Germany to Australia to study before I left I fell in love with a girl which is 6 years younger than me. One of my ex girlfriends broke up with me because she felt like missing her life being in a relationship (which was a part time long distance relationship as well). Later she dated a guy I knew and that really hurt me. I really don't like when my exes hang out, date or hook up with people I know or even friends. For me it's really disrespectful. 

So fast forward to my current girl. I broke up with her because I feared that she'll do the same thing like the ex before and she know everything about my ex, I also told her that I still love her and will probably regret that but didn't wanted her to miss her life. 
Now we started to text again (2 months later) and she told me she f*cked a guy I know in the week after I broke up. She definitely knew that I'm befriended with him because we all went to the same gym. But he told her that we know each other just from seeing not more. She saw me talking to him multiple times in the gym and so on.
She says she's regrets it and loves me. I started to ""fight"" to get her back because I noticed that it was a mistake leaving her. But these news are changing a lot. I feel betrayed and disrespected from both of them. 
She wants me back but I'll probably be in Australia till next year October. Any suggestions? I really don't know what to do. I want her back in my life, I've never felt for a women like that before in my life but that's a really big betrayal for me.",29Oct2020,1
599,"So I went through something very traumatic a few years ago, something that took away all trust I had in my siblings and parents...

Now I won't get into the details, but my concerns involved my family putting drugs in my food or drink...

Since the traumatic incident, none of family came forth and expressed how they won't do anything like this to me, etc... 

I instead had to approach them and ask if they would ever do anything like this, and they assured me a ""no"".

What's very frustrating, is that all of them give the same frustrating answer like ""have I done anything?"", instead of PERSONALLY adding weight to their answer...

Personally expressing how they are a person of integrity, or how they value respect etc...
They all believe a simple answer should be good enough, when I am a ""words"" person, the MORE personal, the BETTER and yet they still just give very brief and emotionless answers.

I've talked to each of my siblings separately, and they all give the same type of answer as my dad does which is so frustrating... it's like I""m the only one in the family who values personal expression.

603,"So my family has been living on one side of a duplex for years now. His parents have always lived on the other side but their name is on both, so we decided to just go ahead and move to the other side. Our name is not on the lease but the landlord didn‚Äôt seem to care and we do pay our portion of the rent and bills to my boyfriend‚Äôs mother. Over the years the landlord has turned out to be pretty shit. This is a rental property but she demands we fix anything that goes wrong. Windows broken? Fix it. Toilet broken? Fix it. Plumbing, electric, etc we need to fix all that ourselves because we get a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù on rent. So over the past year, and let me just preface this by saying this shithole has been deteriorating crazy over the past decade anyway. We keep planning on moving but the rent in our area is outrageous and things keep always coming up so we‚Äôre never able to really save the money, like vehicles breaking down and needing hefty repairs, family emergencies that we have to pool money together for, etc. So anyway, over the past year the floors have been rotting to the point that we literally fall through them. Literally. My boyfriend is pretty heavy footed and has caused two giant holes that we repaired, but still. The foundation for this shithole are just wooden beams that go about two feet to the ground. No actual concrete foundation or anything actually sturdy. So basically, we‚Äôre living on top of a ticking time bomb. The floors in every room dip and curve to scary degrees. We‚Äôve brought this up repeatedly to the landlord and she began to then threaten us: if we don‚Äôt fix it ourselves, she‚Äôll just have the house demolished, ‚Äúif it‚Äôs that unlivable!‚Äù So, being desperate people in a desperate situation with not much income and everything I do earn goes towards groceries and repairs for this piece of shit, we clenched our teeth and continued to bear with the increasing issues. As of now the bathroom floor is constantly flooding with water, of which we can‚Äôt find the cause, the kitchen faucet continually runs, of which we found a temporary fix. The floors are so bad we have laid plywood over almost every inch to at least give us a little added security of not falling through, until the wood beams go out of course. And this morning our landlord paid a visit. She wants us to clean the back gutters (my boyfriend already did this but she wants him to do it again), take down our Halloween decorations (because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre off-putting and ugly‚Äù), and. Get this. This is the final thing. I can‚Äôt do this shit anymore. I can‚Äôt bear with it. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt. She demands that we keep our windows shut. We live in Tennessee. It is averaging 80 degrees still. There is no central air, heating, etc. I have already taken the window AC units out and put box fans in to bring fresh air into the place. And she‚Äôs demanding we close the windows and roast. I‚Äôm done. When I started to raise my outraged HAHA YOURE FUCKING KIDDING ME voice, my boyfriend‚Äôs mom gives us a look to keep quiet. Seething, seeing red, already pissed because our card information got stolen online, I just thundered back over to our side, tripped over the shitty sunken in floor, and am now typing this in tears of desperation and rage. Again, we aren‚Äôt rich people. We aren‚Äôt particularly lucky people either. Sometimes I‚Äôve thought of just grabbing my son and running back to Ohio to guilt my dad into taking us in but I don‚Äôt think my car will even make it there. So I guess I‚Äôm just here asking for opinions, thoughts, anything. 
Am I overreacting? Should we really just basically rebuild this shithole from the ground up? And go so into debt doing so that we‚Äôll never be able to leave? But then what‚Äôs the other option? Homelessness?

609,"This post might seem like a rant, but it's not, It's my thought process.
I am angry, hurt, jealous and I know what I have said ahead maybe wrong.

I'm here for advice, not criticizm.
Please be kind.

WARNING: This may be insanely misogynistic, Hypocritical and lastly unfair, but today I don't care anymore.

I am a 19 year old, straight cis-male

Where does this post come from? Frustration and Realisation

I considered myself to be a romantic and was also raised in a conservative house. Sex was viewed as vulgar, still is. I learnt it's a pleasure for women, a little too late.

Always prided myself as a gentleman, That I would never hurt a lady's Honor (by sleeping with her), just to satisfy my lust. In fact I thought not acting on my lust was my strength as a genteel.

Then I was met with reality. That I am nothing but a nice guy. That girls are going to sleep around. If it's not you it's someone else, they won't regret it.
If they find out that it makes you uncomfortable, they'll lie about it.
That people began having sex at 12 and you're a Virgin at 19, I am truly disgusted by them, yet I envy them.

No one's waiting for marriage to give away their firsts and to make it special for each other. To them, all of them, Sex is just a fun act.

I still can't get that into my head. So I am going to play by their rules and Still come out on top.
I want to lose my firsts to women who absolutely don't matter to me. I want to go out there and have sex with as many beautiful women as I can. I want to drown myself in sex and numb myself.

**No, I am not insanely handsome, nor do I have a big dick, But that's the whole point of it all. I have been looked down upon and called names. I have not felt worthy for a long time**

I don't want to get good at Sex, I want to be the fucking Magnus Carlson of Sex. I want to make you feel that sleeping with me is a blessing and you wouldn't mind miss it for the world.
**I want to make Women feel special.**

And at the same time, I want to get back at all of those who had an advantage over me, They are richer, more handsome and prolly have bigger dicks.

**And I want to trump them all**

I want to get even with those who had a headstart in their sex lives(started early). I want to fuck around and explore everything about myself and Learn everything I can. So that when I get married and in a monogamous relationship with my wife, I won't ever be retroactively Jealous of her past. Who she fucked, How good they were, Because I had my fun time and I know I can do my best to make her feel special and the best. So that I don't have a constant pressure of not being enough, because if I am not enough for her, There are others who do want me!.

**I won't ever fall ever fall short of her exes and not be able to give her what they could.**

**In fact all I want is to be her best**

Her absolute best in all aspect in Life and Bed.
I want to become the KING OF LUST AND DESIRE.

**Yet, I am hypocrite. I don't want my sister to get messed up with Sex. She's still 10 years old. I'd be happy if she came out as gay but that's not my decision. The only thing that stops me from my actions is KARMA and setting an Example.
I don't want my sister to become a slut.
I don't want her to follow this example of mine.**

Hell, I wouldn't be here in the first place, If people just fucked the person they married and were their goody goody selves...",29Oct2020,1

611,"There was a guy in a local rabbit owners Facebook group that made a post about not having any food or hay for his rabbit until payday and asking for help. I messaged him and told him I would give him some if he would meet me at a grocery store. He claimed not to know where it was and not to have bus money and asked if I could drop it off. I was uncomfortable about it so I said id think about it but probably not. The next day he messaged me and was like hey are you still going to drop that off and i said i couldn't. This was in August and i haven't heard from him again until now.

The past week or so hes been sending me scammy messages about the government is giving away free money, text this number to get your free money. It also included a video of him supposedly getting his check from fed ex. I figured some kind of bank account scam so I blocked him on messenger. He never sent a friend request or anything.

I told my coworker and he said it sounds like a possible kidnapping attempt because the guy asked for rabbit food and then didn't want to meet in public to get it. Also we never saw any pictures of rabbits on his profile or posted in the rabbit group. Does this sound like a scam or worse? What should I do to protect myself now?",29Oct2020,1
612,"I'll be 30 in a month. Male. Grew up in upper middle class family, never worried about money, got spoiled to a really bad degree by mom. Really intelligent, went to gifted school, ended up with a 30 act. But barely passed high school because lazy. Went to community college because I didnt want to lose friends, ended up failing because lazy. Got my first job ever at like 21 because my dad got it for me at his company, worked 2 years then was let go because lazy. Fell in love with a girl from another country but eventually it didnt work out for various reasons. Wasted a few more years being totally financially supported by parents while doing drugs and shit. Eventually went back to school, met a new girl, had a great year or two, but then she left because i'm a loser and i ended up in a psych hospital. Wasted more time, then eventually did enough school to transfer to a university. Moved out for the first time at like 27, going to university, when the first girl from another country came back saying she always loved me, and i reciprocated. Felt i finally had life figured out, i wanted to marry her, finish school, and move to her country. Then i failed school again ane got kicked out because lazy, girl left me for it, then since shes indian and almost 30 she decided to have her parents set her up with some guy and a few months later she married him and moved out. Didnt marry for love but just for status basically. I havent been the same ever since and the only emotion i really feel anymore is anger. I tried staying friends but once she was officially married i just couldnt do it anymore and basically told her i hope she dies and stopped texting her. My parents finally stopped paying for school although they still pay my rent and everything. I'm too lazy to look for or work a job, i have no friends, i cant really go back to school, i just sit in my apartment watching and reading stuff till i get tired and pass out. Still think about the girl constantly though its almost been a year since she got married. Cant even find any energy to talk to anyone else and nobody matches with me or has any interest in me anyway. Parents are both retiring in the wake of covid so the money will be cut off soon. Tried killing myself awhile back but ended up pussying out so ive given up on that idea because i know i cant go through with it. All i want is to be normal, have a decent job and be able to live on my own, i want to get married and start a family. But I know its never going to happen now, i already blew my chance.

614,"To elaborate, I teach myself and brainstorm about photography (technical, artistic, actually doing it), computers, electronics, macroeconomics. I have a composition book for handwriting ideas and ruled out most of them later. I read books on business and self improvement. New areas I'm teaching myself include a little bit about the energy and optics fields. I hold a provisional patent related to optics and digital imaging.

I learned many lessons from running a travel photo business. I sold cards, calendars, and prints. I sold face to face at the school. I'm very outgoing.

The problems come in which in college, I was far better at applying knowledge than learning at first hence my many C's. My only high level counterintuitive technical knowledge comes self teaching. Some people view those with a BBA as people who come up ideas for ideas sake or mismanage. Ironically, I look for problems to solve based of what I teach myself. I think in terms of pros **and** cons. I'd like to critique product lineups to think in terms of what to remove.

I'm not comfortable working for fossil fuel companies **unless** they're investing in clean energy like nuclear, wind, solar.

I have too many ideas for my own benefit. I want to work for a highly innovative company so I gain good experience for starting my own. I read about what's a wantrepreneur and it's too accurate for me.

I'd go back to school but I lack good self discipline, money, and time.

How should I go about networking the right way (I read a book on it but still)? How should I narrow my ideas and decide what to delay, do now, or abandon. I'm aware of the sunk cost fallacy. I'm struggling to get properly organized, focused, and motivated.

What's your advice in general?

So, I asked her if she was mad and I apologized and everything, I see that I am blocked so I have her brother added and ask him to tell her if she was mad or not. The next day she just texts me saying that ""Why are you talking to my brother and etc, like I am not your girlfriend or anything"" and I said I am sorry it wasn't what it looked like that and that I was just worried.

620,"Sorry if the title is a little confusing. So since February (quarantine) my parents and our lovely german shepard, Miley, have gone to live at our cabin 2 hours away. For the past 8 months I have been alone in a 5 bedroom house (except for my small, unsocial hamster). I am incredibly lonely and unfortunately cannot visit my parents as I am a full time student. I recently started thinking about how I could have a kind of animal friend without full on adopting/housing it. I would love to have a cat but our dog wouldn‚Äôt tolerate it and my dad hates cats. 

What I need advice on is if it would be messed up of me to scoop up a cat thats been abandoned and living outside of my local shelter and move it to my neighborhood. I could feed it and sit on my porch and play with it when they come around. Right now I‚Äôve just been visiting the shelter parking lot since it‚Äôs closed and been feeding all the cats there and one of them actually allowed me to pet them.

621,"Gonna delve straight into it. I broke up with my (20F) ex boyfriend (20M) over a year ago after a long relationship that started from school. I was not attracted to him anymore and didn‚Äôt want to be with him so ended it - and he took it really badly. I believe from what I‚Äôve heard from him and others that he‚Äôs now blamed me for all his mental health problems and issues (which he should‚Äôve been seeing to before anyway), and he spiralled.

It‚Äôs been well over a year since the break up and I‚Äôve met someone new and am extremely happy with them and don‚Äôt think about my ex at all. Unfortunately me and my ex were both from the same friendship group, so now we are out of school we meet up with friends every so often. We both went to our friends birthday in august where he was very awkward with me when I asked how he was he shrugged and didn‚Äôt say a lot and we just stayed away from eachother the rest of the evening. 

Recently we‚Äôre all in our home town thanks to covid and the past few weeks my group has been meeting him in the evenings weekly without inviting me. I don‚Äôt mind them meeting him at all as he‚Äôs their friend but it‚Äôs become the official meet up of our group now and they don‚Äôt do anything else as a group so I don‚Äôt get to see a lot of them unless I meet up with everyone individually which is a nightmare to arrange. 

Today I met two friends, and one who was going to see our group tonight invited the other out. I caught them speaking about this and asked casually if I could come along as I miss everyone and she said of course I could and it‚Äôd be fine, so I was happy. But then a minute later she said she‚Äôd need to ask my ex if I could come .. then later text me saying my ex doesn‚Äôt want me to come so I should stay at home. 

As I said I don‚Äôt mind them meeting up with him but it‚Äôs been over a year and I‚Äôm happy to hang out with him and talk to him yet he won‚Äôt let me come to things he‚Äôs going to with our friends. I‚Äôm happy to meet my friend group at other times but as I said with covid it‚Äôs awkward organising meet ups like this twice a week (so they can see both me and him) and it‚Äôs making me angry that he‚Äôs not letting me come and meet them and they don‚Äôt want to have to meet as a group twice a week just to please us both. 

Am I being unfair by letting this get to me or not? One of my friends said that it‚Äôs his problem and he‚Äôs being unfair but I feel like I might be in the wrong and can‚Äôt see it? Can someone tell me what they think of the situation please?",29Oct2020,1

For example, my mom asked me to make a pot of tea before bed so me and her could have some ‚Äúbonding time‚Äù. Things happened, I forgot to put the pot‚Äôs lid on, which was made of glass, and my dad dropped it off the table but it didn‚Äôt break fortunately. Just a small problem and I thought we brushed it off. Dad went to sleep and we had tea in my room. We haven‚Äôt even touched our first cup of tea and my mom has been going on about how the problem with the lid was all my fault, linking to how messy my room is (I tried my best) and how clearly that all my friends, houseparents and teachers back at school obviously hated me for my shit personality (they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôve been around them all the time, I can tell... or so I thought). I‚Äôm an international student so I have been spending my quarantine time at my house where I grew up, in which for some reasons always give me physical symptoms of depression now and then. Plus a fact that I have quite some traumas growing up like unable to fit in (until I go abroad), bullied (unconsciously from family members and school staffs) and some family issues (emotionally). Sorry for the whining I just want to say that being brought back here after having experienced my ‚Äúown life‚Äù just kinda messed me up. I‚Äôm ‚Äútired‚Äù all the time and struggle to get enough sleep. I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to open my mouth for anything but listening to my mom. My head feels like exploding plus I‚Äôm having an allergy flu so I asked my mom if she could finish her tea first. She got mad and assumed that I was trying to kick her out of my room (I‚Äôm not gonna lie I wanted to) but I just continued to ask if she had another topic to talk about. Mom finished that cup of tea saying I‚Äôm being really impolite and uneducated and slammed both my door on her way out. I could hear her slamming her door. A lot of time that similar things happened with my dad regularly and it always appears at unacceptable to people when I tell them about it. As an only child I have always had to apologise for the other parent or someone else‚Äôs fault to my parents to ease them. I think it also gives that my parents have to deal with a lot of stresses, too.

I‚Äôve never had to ask anyone to give me back my personal space like this before. I deadly want to seek therapy either telehealth or physically is fine. But I‚Äôm not allowed to go out alone along with the fact that stigma being a cultural thing prevented the therapy industry from any further growth in my country.

(For contest, I'm a 22F who lives at home to save on money and is able to get to university by carpooling with friends. )

Given 2020 has been a \*itch overall, I have had to do complete remote learning. I do not mind honestly, as it gives me more time to better prepare myself for exams. However, I am drawing near the end of my education, meaning I have been looking towards Grad school.

I've found several good options, many of which are out of state. They provide scholarships I am eligible for and there are excellent job opportunities near by. My mom is all for me moving out and finding my own way once the virus dies down and I complete my schooling. My dad however is more difficult.

Any time I bring it up with him, he either straight up ignores me or states ""Why can't you stay here maskedghostwolf?"" or ""You aren't going to be happy anywhere else. The grass isn't always greener on the other side.""

I detest my state due to a number of personal reasons including family drama from the fraternal side (basically they are money hungry, hate me as I am 'devil spawn', and will, the second both my parents die, will try to buddy up to me to get anything I receive from my parents), including a mentally insane uncle (who has all the making of a serial killer), and a pathological liar of a grandmother. They avoid us for the most part, but I want nothing to do with them and want to avoid them at all cost. Similiar things goes for the maternal side. Both my parents are fine, and I love them dearly. 

I also understand the complications of moving out:

* I will have to be financially independent and pay my own bills. I know how to do this, and have established good credit.
* I will be alone for the most part and will have to fend for myself.
* I will have to purchase my own groceries.
* I will no longer have the same security I have at home.
* I will have to drive/fly by myself to visit my parents.

I have a job offer for a local therapy office as a therapy aide. The office works with peds which is what I have always wanted. However I am afraid that the job will be just cleaning up after therapists and not much more. In my current position, I am in charge of merchandise and social media and am responsible for so many aspects that help the store run efficiently. The therapy job pays .25 cents less but that equals out to less than I pay for parking at my current position so it would actually be more money.

644,So I just switched phone carriers recently. When I went to the new place they told me they had a promotion for a phone and that iw would be 10 bucks a month for 30 months.

I just checked my bill and I'm actually being charged 30 for the phone and 85 for the plan. What do I do now? I called them and spoke with someone who told me there aren't any promotions like the one I was sold and that I should go talk to the store. The problem is I didn't get any of this down in writing.

646,"I (22M) am an Engineering graduate from one of the most reputed colleges in India. I graduated few months ago during the the lockdown, and ever since I had been waiting for my (to be) employers to mail me with the details of my WFH (work from home) schedule. 2 months had passed and no call/e-mail. Then one unexpected afternoon, they emailed me and my colleagues saying they have been incurring major losses during the pandemic and therfore, they will only be hiring 2 of us, and the rest 7 of us can fuck off. 

Me and my unplaced colleagues were only contemplating our options on what to be done, when 2 days later They sent us another mail, this time saying they're interested in hiring all 9 of us! Oh the ecstasy !

They sent everyone the Letter of Intent and some other corporate obligations and stuff, except, I did not receive any of that. After following up on that, I learnt, with another blow to my heart, they only had 8 vacant spots and had to downsize by 1 candidate. 

My heart had sunk. And I was lost.

Seeing my peers having started their work and posting stories of their first ever salaries filled me with a sense of agony mixed with paranoia..I was sitting at home after graduating from an institute people dream of getting in.

Cut to today - 

I'm preparing for an exam called CAT, to get into business schools. I am motivated again, this time not for a job, but for an MBA. The exam is on the 29th of November. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had started preparing about a month after the above incident. I feel confident and prepared enough to ace it. During this period, I also started sending out Resumes to companies who were hiring and after a dozen applications and some tests I have been shortlisted for a job interview! It's on the 4th of November. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only this time (and here the story is coming to the point) I am not ready for a job. My parents are wishing well for me, they want me to crack the interview, which I want too, except, I am not ready for a job and I don't know why! It's stupid. I have always wanted to earn and be independent and now I don't want to work, I just want to clear the exam and keep studying! I feel if I started working somewhere I would have to give it my loyalty, my sweat, my hours, my priorities - and right now I feel more like keeping to my comfort zone where I can work (study) when I want, how I want and be my boss because I have always studied on my own and have gotten kinda good at it. This feeling of freedom where I am good at what I do WHILE GETTING TO DO IT MY WAY is keeping me from wanting to earn and be independent which I have always wanted even more so as my friends are earning and buying cool stuff for themselves, their families and investing it and stuff!!

&amp;#x200B;

647,"I was bullied for a long time in middle school and high school. As a nerdy, shy bookworm, I was always picked on, but never as bad as on the bus. Kids in my neighborhood would take photos of me and pass them around, thinking I was unaware. But I could see them raise their phones and chuckle as they pressed the button. This happened for at least two years. 

Since then, I've always been paranoid of phones, especially on public transport. I duck out of the way, raise my backpack, etc.

I am a first time mom to a 9 month old and have been married for 3 years. My husband and I aren't as close as we used to because we never sleep because our kid never sleeps and we just don't have time for each other anymore - especially with COVID in the mix of things and protecting our family. My mother, for whatever reason, gets defensive when I vent to her about what is going on in my home. I'd rather not even talk to her about her because she always ends up raising her voice at me when I really just need some comfort. I spent my lunch break today crying in my car because I attempted talking to her. I don't have close friends since having a baby. I have 2 siblings but they have their own families and they're closer to each other than they are me. I have never been included in their lives really. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here other than help or to vent. I just need to get how I'm feeling out there without judgement. I tried to tell my husband at 3am how I was feeling but it didn't go well on either end. I'm honestly not sure if he would be better off not being married to me anymore. I really try to make things good at home but so much of my attention goes to making my baby happy that we just somehow got left on the back burner for too long. I love him. I love him so much that I don't want my issues to bring him down and I feel like that's what I'm doing.

Yesterday i left because i can see she was mad and i didnt want her breaking more things. She compared me to her friends bfs and insist they are so great and im the worst and im a loser because i play video games (ill get to the video game thing later down the chat)

Anyhow she insist that everyone else have a better relationship than us and i do nothing for her. But when i do try to do thing for her she complains. One morning for example, i woke up cooked her breakfast because she complains she does all the cooking.. she seemed mad after i cooked breakfast and wouldnt tell me whats wrong. Then she  says shes mad at me because i wasted food and shes not going to eat it. 

I try to take her out to do things but she alsays ends up mad or fighting about something small. 

Im going to upload a pic of a text of yesterday she was going to cheat on me because she thought i was ‚Äúcheating‚Äù

(She tells me to leave her alone when shes angry and so i did , i didnt reply to her text for 4 minutes , and she assumed i was cheating , i didnt reply because i was driving . I went on a long drive)

Anyhow she then brings up the fact i dont let her check my phone.. 

Which i dont let her anymore because im tired of having to prove my loyalty to her. She sees me ignoring girls who message me. Ive even cut off girls who are friends in my life to make her feel re assured i wouldnt cheat on her. But she goes on about how they shouldnt be on my phone because i have had ‚Äúhistory with them‚Äù

Well now she brings up the fact i havent let her check my phone and shes been mad thinking im cheating on her and i dont love her , and that she cant trust me. Etc .
 
Currently im sitting in this couch wondering if i make it better by doing more with her like she asks, more cute shit and making her feel special if that will change how shes acting if she‚Äôll acc be happy..
But im also batteling thinking will she ever be happy. 

As i said about the video game thing earlier ive been playing alot more cause in this city i know NOBODY i have no friends here . My home town is 2 hour drive away. She has told me how she hates me playing the video game and i have told her ill cut down and stop but it seems it drags me in and when my friends say one more game it turns into 3-4 games. Anyhow heres the texts from yesterday idk if i should just give up and finally try to move on from the one i love or just sit here And be unhappy when shes mad and only be happy when shes happy .

Update: cant upload pics somehow , but yea she says she deserves better etc . I hung out with her friends the other day and they all got mad i crossed the street without them. And saying im a bad boyfriend? I feel like these are such small things . Im 22 shes 21 i feel like we shouldnt fight about this stuff but idk . Maybe it is all me .

So, my aunt opted to take me to Walmart every Tuesday to buy 7 Hungry Man dinners, one for each day of the week. We've been doing that since late August I believe and everything was fine until yesterday.

I usually pick up one Hungry Man dinner and scan it 7 times, so as to avoid having to scan each individual item. On Tuesday of this week, I think I saw in my peripherals a woman that worked there was watching us at the self checkout, and I scanned one of the dinners 7 times, as I normally would, and then I put the rest of them in plastic bags. I don't think she saw me scan the first item 7 times, so it looked like I was just skipping the process of scanning the items and putting them straight into the plastic bags, as if I was trying to steal them. I wasn't. The item was scanned 7 times, and we paid the full price. She didn't say anything to us, and as we were exiting the store, I could've sworn I heard a description of me on an employee's radio, and that we were going to be intercepted as we exited the store. We weren't. I had already passed the employee whose radio I heard by the time I heard it. I wasn't sure whether or not I should've went back with my aunt to show them the receipt, but looking back, I probably should have.

I still have the receipt with me, and I'm not going to be throwing it away any time soon. It shows that I scanned the same item 7 times and paid for 7 of the same item. Should I just walk up to an employee and tell them about what happened next week and show them the receipt so I can clear up any suspicions of thievery? Because I don't want to walk into that store feeling like there's a manhunt for me. I'd attach an image of the receipt if I could.",29Oct2020,1

It's been affecting me for more than over a year now, to me I think that I should've moved on by now but for some reason, I still think about it to this day. Let me get started with the full story and context.

I'll start with how I came to meet this person. September in 2018, I started college, and I got into a relationship quite quickly. Being 16 and my first proper relationship, neither of us really knew what we were doing, and there was a lot of immaturity between the both of us. Because of this, there was a lot of problems my end, and it got to the point where it was affecting my mental health. And for someone who has struggled with a lot of family problems, anxiety and contemplates suicide often, it made it significantly worse.

On Christmas day 2018, I first messaged Mike (this will be their name for this story as I don't want to use their real name). I had already met and knew Mike, but I wasn't very close to him. Since Christmas day 2018, I was quite close to him, I had unloaded a lot to him and he helped. Now because my ex wasn't paying any attention to me, and I never got to see him, I very quickly spent more time with Mike and got feelings for him. Out of respect, I told my ex and broke up with him, not because I liked Mike, but because of the problems and it wasn't fair on either of us. I then got him with one of my life long friends as an apology and they're still together to this day. 

Now, Mike and my ex were and still are friends, as well as the whole group we use to play games with. They were my ex's friends in the relationship more than mine, but I spent a lot of time with them and by the time I broke up with my ex, in January 2019, I considered them as family. But as you can imagine, when I broke up with my ex, things started to get weird. Not because they made things weird, my anxiety got really bad and I thought that they were being. Anyway, fast forwarding a little bit, I said something horrible - they all ditched me because of this and for a very good reason. 

When this happened, I was crying constantly for 3 days, throughout mothers day and ruined mothers day for my family. But this was my fault, and it's in the past. After these 3 days, 2 people came back out of this group. One was Mike, and the other was Sky (once again, a fake name to represent the person). Now, Mike helped me a lot throughout the start of 2019, got me through everything that happened. Sky left not long after coming back because of personal business between them and Mike - which didn't help my mental health either. 

I grew to have very very strong feelings for Mike, and very unhealthily dependant on him. He was all I had, and I was so scared he was just going to leave one day because of me. Mike never felt the same towards me, this hurt me a lot as it would. Between June to September 2019, Mike really messed with my head. I knew something was wrong, and he wouldn't tell me, instead would become slowly distant to me. However, in September 2019, he told me that it was because he had met someone, and they were together. He said he didn't want to hurt me because he knew how much I cared about him, and then said he wasn't comfortable with having someone as attached to him as I was, while being with someone else. It hurt a bit but I respected that and we cut contact. I very quickly started to move on and got over him, I was doing really well, then he messaged me again....

A week and a half after cutting contact, he messaged me to apologise and said he felt bad, and that he wasn't sure what to do. Luckily, I didn't get feelings for him again, but I did start to care about him a little more because he was still a close friend of mine. Then he started to become distant again, and left for 3 weeks during/after Christmas 2019. During the 4 or so months, 2 of my school friends were stabbed to death, and I had got in and out of a toxic relationship. During the 3 weeks, I had met someone else, May for this story, and I was very happy. It hurt him leaving out of the blue, but I knew he was having problems in his life so I tried to respect it as much as possible. 

After these 3 weeks, I messaged him because I missed him, and was confused to why he left without any warning. In my surprise, he answered and apologised once again... but had no explanation. In the next month, May had died in an accident, I had my 18th birthday, which wasn't very good because my family had no money, and he left once again. The last messaged I had sent him was about the fact I got a new job, he knew about May dying and my birthday. But he just left, never answered. I had never been so confused and hurt in my life. 

In the following 6-7 months after that, I met my current boyfriend, and I love him to bits. He, of course, knows about all of this, and he's been very supportive through it all. But there hasn't been a day that's gone past that I haven't wondered what I did wrong, if he was okay and what he's up to. I'm in contact with a few of his old friends (my current friends), and they as well as my boyfriend told me to message him and let him know what he did, and how I felt. So I did....

I finally got an answer, he told me he just wasn't comfortable having someone so attached to him while in a relationship, and apologised for just leaving, said he wasn't good with this sort of stuff. I once again respected this, and now me, him and his girlfriend are all on civil terms.

Unfortunately, I still think about him and almost regret every way I acted towards him last year. I keep thinking if I had done something different, we would still be friends. I want to move on from him, and forget about everything, but I don't seem to be able to. I care about him too much, and it is affecting me. Thank you if you've gotten this far down, and thank you for reading it all aha. But I was wondering if anyone had any advice to what I can do to at least help with this?",29Oct2020,1
674,I've finally come to realize that my current friends are not good for me. My relationships with them feel very one sided and the times that I've talked to them about it in the past have not made a difference. I am exhausted and it's ultimately time for me to let go of them. Here's my dilemma. And it's such a small stupid thing... I'm in a snapchat group with them (they're long distance friends) and I want to leave the group. I need snapchat for some other important groups that I'm in so I cant delete the app. I have muted the conversation as of right now but you still see the notification when you're in the app so it's making it harder to distance myself from them and move on. So I'd like to leave the group but I don't want to stir anything up.  Should I suck it up and just keep it muted? Or should I just leave the group?,29Oct2020,1

Then I got some light pain that only happens during the evening time, during the day it's not present, so I went to my dentist again and he took an X-ray of the tooth.

All normal according to him, gave me some Colgate Duraphat to use on the tooth to help it heal.

Still, I have some minor pain in the evening, and sometimes at night, like last night I had none and now I have some after using the said tooth as a test again.

I think I should keep chewing with my right side and leave left for what it is to allow the nerve to calm down. Like I said, during the day I have no pain and can drink coffee and cold water all I want.

Even in the evening, hot and cold fluids don't bother me at all.

What would my best step forward be as of right now, 1 day before the weekend? (I really don't want a root canal done, as my dentist didn't want to do it either because it makes the tooth weaker).

683,"Howdy y‚Äôall. Last night my friend posted some political post and ended it with ‚ÄúHomeless people just need to get a job.‚Äù This morning, I seen the post and messaged her saying that the post wasn‚Äôt very nice and in poor taste. I was telling her that I was coming to her as a friend, who was very sensitive about the issue, and wanted to let her know it was an uncomfortable post.

Now I know that she‚Äôs 100% entitled to her opinion even if its against what I believe. I never told her to delete her post or said she was a bad person in any capacity. She tells our group constantly that if she says something off, to come to her about it. 

Well, I came to her about it.

She started saying that I needed to ‚Äútread lightly‚Äù because she was nearly homeless once. I told her why her post effected me, and she twisted it around and said that I thought she wasn‚Äôt sensitive to those issues. She started to put words in my mouth and acted like I was in a position that I wasn‚Äôt in. She started acting like I was the bad guy for coming to her when I said repeatedly that I wasn‚Äôt attacking her, just letting her know as a friend that it bothered me. I felt like she was trying to fight me while I was trying to deescalate her the whole time.

689,"It‚Äôs more one sided because I am really bothered by this. 

We have a presentation due in 3 weeks and we have been randomly grouped with people to do this. 

I won‚Äôt get into too much details but around a week ago me and this girl were giving ideas via WhatsApp. 
Both me and her were contributing, while the other 3 people weren‚Äôt. 

We decided to pick a topic and out of 5, 3 of us agreed to work on this topic for our presentation. 

I had to email the course leader because I couldn‚Äôt get into contact with one of the guys and he told me to contact the lecturer because this was his presentation work. 

I am not a fan of my lecturer because he doesn‚Äôt respond to my emails when I have questions. I work remotely, so it puts me off from asking him stuff. Later on that day he was added to the gc. 

Fast forward, a couple of days ago one of the girls was talking about a tutorial with our lecturer to which I misunderstood as a one to one with our tutors. As we each have specific days with our tutors. 

The next day, she messages the gc and picks a topic which we didn‚Äôt agree too. She in detail explains what we have to do for each section. Almost like she already did research and everything, except she didn‚Äôt share this with the gc. 

I thought this was weird because I know we voted for another topic. Later on in the day, I realised that she was the only one who attended the meeting as none of us made it. 

I didn‚Äôt receive any emails and Black board collar isn‚Äôt the greatest. The only reason I found out was because I checked my email and the lecturer said we missed our appointment and the only person who turned up was the girl. 

When I realised this I immediately messaged her and said I was sorry and etc. Then she responds and I totally understand that it wasn‚Äôt fair on her. 
I admit I misunderstood and apologised twice, but her response to my apology hasn‚Äôt been nice. She responded by making it sound like she was clear except she wasn‚Äôt, she didn‚Äôt specifically mention the time or who we were meant to have the meeting with or what for. 

I have been feeling pretty bad because she had to do this meeting by herself. I completely misunderstood as communication wasn‚Äôt clear at all! 
I just feel like crap because I have been trying and been worrying over my other work. 

She has chosen to look at a specific line of movement which I am not great in and I am wondering whether or not I will even do good. 

Communication is really bad in our gc because we have one or two contributions and then it‚Äôs dead for days. 
I also feel like two people in group don‚Äôt understand what we even have to do.

690,"My dad and his wife moved in to an apartment almost a year ago. A while after they'd moved in my dad was starting to get really dizzy, to the point where he's been to the doctors a couple of times because of it. But the doctor's confirmed there's nothing wrong with his health. And lately also his wife's been getting very dizzy out of nowhere, she said it was to the point where she almost was about to faint one time. 

Today I was visiting them and was there for almost a whole day and when I was heading out I felt a headache, I was really nauseous and light headed. I also want to add that I very often feel tired or sleepy when I'm at their place. 

I suspect there could be something with their apartment that causes this, maybe bad oxygen, mold or something else. And I should add that the previews owner was a chain smoker and had been smoking so much inside that the walls, the wooden floor and even the window frames had turned light brown. The walls and some of the floor are redone now but there's still the same wooden cabinets and wardrobe from before. 

So to my question, what could it possibly be that causes this, because I'm pretty sure it's something with the apartment. Im curious if the smoking could have had any bad impact on the wooden parts of the house when it comes to mold growth or maybe that's two separate subjects? Or could it possibly be anything else?

691,"(Hey y‚Äôall, this is my first time on Reddit, so I‚Äôm making a throwaway account or whatever it‚Äôs called lmao)

   Alright, long story short, I (16m) was in an unhealthy, toxic relationship with this girl (17f) for about a year. Through a long state of reflection, I realized that 95% of the issues were my fault (manipulation, control and trust issues, etc) but 5% were also her fault (threatening self-harm, using me as an ego crutch, etc.) After realizing this, I checked myself into therapy and have spent the last several months understanding and working on root issues with my behaviour. We cut off contact from each other after the split in order to heal.
   A couple months later, I sent her a quick message explaining I‚Äôd like to have even more space, indefinitely. She lashed out at me and proceeded to throw some pretty mean insults my way (none that i feel comfortable sharing). Ever since then, I‚Äôve been receiving random texts from random numbers with messages from her attached. She calls me horrible things, tells me how broken she is now, and even sends death threats. Last time, even after I told her to stop, I still got three random numbers texting me the same message. She has her friends, her family, and her new boyfriend providing their numbers to her so she can text me. I mean, one message to convey her feelings is okay, but I‚Äôve gotten so many that this whole situation is getting out of hand. Since then, I‚Äôve had to block a bunch of numbers, and even change my own number in order to stop them from coming through.
   My main concern now is that we both attend the same school and I‚Äôll be returning in a couple weeks after a leave of absence. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll try to confront me, but I‚Äôve heard that she‚Äôs also been spreading rumours about me to our mutual friends. This is my senior year, and I don‚Äôt really feel like switching schools because I love my friends and I‚Äôm already two months in. I just don‚Äôt want anymore drama to unfold between us and just want to live our separate lives in peace.

He also bullies me with why I started crying when I got salted and sticky Water in my eyes.. It was not him but the guy that did that gone to Jack told him. Now always when he sees me he's like: ""why u started crying when water in face and clothes"". I told him twice now but he won't stop.

694,"It‚Äôs kind of complicated so I‚Äôll explain the living situation right off the bat.  I live in the bottom half of a duplex with 2 roommates and he lived upstairs with another roommate.  Him and I dated for a few months and broke up a few weeks before he passed away unexpectedly.  I still loved him and didn‚Äôt want to end it but had to. Keeping his room open and using it for something good like we planned was very important to me and now I‚Äôm really sad and disappointed that it isn‚Äôt working out.  The thought of someone else living in that room makes me sick to my stomach.  

The original plan was supposed to be 4 of us splitting $300. It was me, my roommate/best friend, his roommate, and his sister.  His roommate dropped out first because she didn‚Äôt want to pay more in rent and already had a space for her art.  Then his sister dropped out because she couldn‚Äôt afford it.  My roommate and I were talking in person with his sister when she told us this and we both heard it and agreed that we could do $150 each.  

His sister wasn‚Äôt emotionally ready to clean it out so I told her to take her time and that we‚Äôd handle it.  My roommate was with me when I said that, and I remember her agreeing.  In hindsight, I should have talked to my roommate about that first.  I didn‚Äôt think of that at the time and just wanted to help his sister.  I also had plenty of money at that time and could have paid it all myself if it came down to it. 

The day it was due I asked my roommate if she had it and she acted very surprised at the cost and seemed like she wanted to say no but felt like she had to... I didn‚Äôt really know what to do, I know it‚Äôs more than the original plan but she heard and agreed to it so I was annoyed that she was so upset about it the day of.  It was really weird.  

I helped clean the room in the middle of October but there‚Äôs still some furniture left so we haven‚Äôt used it yet.  His sister told me she‚Äôd arrange for the rest of the furniture to be taken care of within a few days but it‚Äôs now been a couple weeks.  Because of that we haven‚Äôt used the room yet.  

Now the rent for the room is due again in two days.  Two days ago I checked in with her about it and asked if she was going to be ready to pay it again, and she acted super surprised again. ‚ÄúOh shit, how much is it again? Oh man. That‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù Kind of thing.  Then she told me that she can‚Äôt do it and I was really upset but didn‚Äôt want to be unfair so I just said ok.  

She‚Äôs allowed to say no and she can back out if she wants to.  But like... she knew about it for a whole month and didn‚Äôt say anything until I asked her.  I also know that she does have the money and it isn‚Äôt a matter of can/can‚Äôt like she said but that she doesn‚Äôt want to.  This is just a personal annoyance but while she‚Äôs  allowed to not want to, that irritated me in the moment.  I wish she was just straight up with me about it instead of wording it in a way to make it easier for her.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do.  My unemployment is now only a couple hundred ish every two weeks, so paying for this room is nearly half a month‚Äôs income and I‚Äôm already stretching every single penny of it.  It‚Äôd be impossible to pay for this room.  But I‚Äôm under an obligation to, as his roommate is counting on me for it since its because of my plan that she didn‚Äôt get another roommate to pay that portion of rent.  AND the rent is due in two days.  But I just don‚Äôt have it.  

I either need to come to terms with giving up the room and explain it to her and try to help out with November rent maybe over time or I need to find $300 I can give her every month.  I feel like I cannot let that room go.  I also cannot find that money every month.",29Oct2020,1
695,"I started playing on a volleyball team with a girl from my hometown last year that I always thought was cute, but we never really got to know each other because she‚Äôs a few years younger than me. We got along really well, but she had just started dating a guy I knew from back in high school. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it then because I would never want to interfere in a relationship even though I kind of thought that she was out of this guy‚Äôs league. 

The volleyball season ended when COVID started, but my buddy and I ended up getting her brother a job with us for the summer and fall and he even became one of my roommates. Her brother and I are pretty decent friends now and she‚Äôs come up in conversation a few times. He‚Äôs not really a fan of her boyfriend and I‚Äôve heard a few other of her friends talk poorly about him. Basically he‚Äôs kind of flaky when it comes to events he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs coming to and he doesn‚Äôt always have the best attitude. Nothing super crazy. I even came to an event that he bailed on last minute and she had to ask me to go buy the snacks that he was supposed to bring. She didn‚Äôt seem very impressed with him. 

Fast forward to the last six weeks or so. Our volleyball league started up again and we‚Äôre on the same team. All of a sudden it‚Äôs the highlight of every week for me. Her and I are getting along really well. I never bring up her boyfriend because I‚Äôve seen others do it and she kind of closes herself off.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I can‚Äôt help but to hope that she leaves her boyfriend. I‚Äôm starting to lose sleep and my motivation to do my schoolwork for uni is suffering too. I find myself over analyzing all of our interactions and I‚Äôm even starting to have dreams about spending time with her. I‚Äôm 25 and this is probably the hardest I‚Äôve fallen for someone since I was 19 and started dating a girl who I stayed with for 2.5 years. I might be putting too much pressure on myself, but do I tell her how I feel? Our social circles are pretty close together and I don‚Äôt want to create tension or awkwardness, but I‚Äôve heard from her friends that she‚Äôs notoriously bad at ending a relationship so I don‚Äôt know if I should just wait and see what happens.

703,"TW: Animal abuse

&amp;#x200B;

Getting into it, I was very fortunate to grow up in an upper middle class family with loving and supportive parents. I have always had a good group of friends though I tended to make an entirely new group of friends every couple of years, and did very well in school and had a good rapport with my teachers. In high school and college, I participated heavily in extracurriculars and maintained multiple leadership positions in different clubs, including ones focused on community service and was well liked by my peers. I think of myself as a good person now since I always try to do the right thing. I'm now well into my late 20s with a solid friend group, a loving boyfriend, and through a combination of luck and hard work I am actually well beyond my age group in terms of my career (don't want to give too much away, but I essentially made ""partner"" in a very male dominated field despite being a relatively young woman). I am also a huge animal lover now and donate heavily to local rescue groups, which brings me to the main issue now. Between the ages of 10 and 13, I used to hurt animals very badly. They would be birds, lizards, turtles, strays. I don't want to get into the details of it but these animals did not live after. I do not know why I did what I did, when I look back at it I am very much horrified but I cannot recall why I did it or what I was feeling when I did it. I actually do not have very many emotional memories from my childhood, and I honestly feel like I only became a ""real"" person with a consciousness in my mid to late teens. The only other thing I can connect to this is that in elementary school, I was the ""ringleader"" of a group of kids my age and we did things like tie wire so tightly around our wrists that it would break the skin. I am not a psychopath as now I feel a lot of empathy and have kept it as my deepest darkest secret that I did what I did before. Is this something that I continue to just deal with silently on my own, or should I talk to someone about it? Does it mean there is something wrong with me now even though I've lived an otherwise normal life?",29Oct2020,1

705,"I grew up learning two languages, however I could never keep up and end up not knowing either one properly. Although I prefer English, as of late, my speech has gotten really bad. I forget to say key words, I stutter, and my words don't come out properly. I would have to repeat myself frequently which isn't helping. Now due to the covid situation, it's gotten even worse. I decided to record myself talk and have a conversation with myself. I was horrified when I replayed it. I could barely understand what I was saying! I started crying, I felt so much guilt. I can't believe people had to listen to me talk like that.

I don't even want to talk anymore and when I do, it gets so bad, I have no idea what I'm saying. It has seem that I had forgotten to even socialize. I interrupt people, I can't deliver ideas/presentations, and I still mess up when I read straight from a book. This has made me hate talking to people and I'm pushing anyone away to avoid talking to them.

I love talking to people and making connections. But this self-loathing has made it nearly impossible. I feel like such a burden. My question is, what are my options? I'm already going to therapy but do I need to go to speech therapy too? I want to improve my speech, and I want to talk to people again. Anything would help

713," 

Basically I'm a 15 year old male, and everyday is a struggle. I've got some horrible things on my conscience and I'm not deserving of any kind of sympathy I know, even if maybe I am looking for it. I don't know how long this post is going to be because I'm going to type what I have on my conscience right now.

I was messing around with my little 5 year old sister, we were just boxing and lightly punching each other and when I lightly jabbed her in the chest, I felt like a sex offender and feel like I did it because I wanted to touch her up or something. I'm honestly so scared and feel like a horrible person.

Whilst I was having sex with my girlfriend, I think I came inside her on purpose. When I say this, I mean as in getting to the point of the start of cumming (pushing it as far as possible) and then pulling out. Meaning that maybe the first bit of cum went inside her. I understand this was stupid and I don‚Äôt know why I did it and I‚Äôve also spoken to her about it and she wasn‚Äôt mad, but I feel really guilty. Maybe I was just pushing my luck I don‚Äôt know, but I have bad anxiety and now I‚Äôm panicking that it‚Äôs sexual assault or something.

I was masturbating the other night, when I came across a friend‚Äôs snapchat story, with a picture of his dead sister(who is like 5) captioned ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù. I‚Äôm pretty sure I felt guilty for even viewing this whilst I was doing what I was doing, and furthermore I think I had a sexual thought about it. My heart aches. I don‚Äôt even remember the facts anymore. I feel like I tried to push it out of my head. But maybe I didn‚Äôt. Maybe it got me off. I don‚Äôt know how I can ever live with myself after this. I‚Äôm disgusting. I'm not even attracted to kids or anything like that.

Something that happened with my girlfriend, we were in bed and I was rubbing her ass, and eventually I was rubbing her clit area, I don't think I actually fingered her but maybe I did I don't even know anymore. At this point she had fallen asleep. I don't think I was even aware that she had fallen asleep until she 'woke up', but again I don't know, I guess I never do. I felt so horrible and told her what happened. She told me it was okay and that I didn't violate any of her boundaries. We then established some boundaries, and this leads me onto my next misdeed.

Once again, I was in bed with my girlfriend, this time it was early in the morning and I'm pretty sure I was still half asleep. I had my eyes shut and then I felt her giving me head. I opened my eyes and she wasn't, she was turned around, facing the other way presumably asleep. Now I don't understand why I felt that, was it a dream? I really don't know, but then I had a thought that maybe I was fucking her whilst she was sleeping. This thought ripped me apart and I know that it seems unlikely but my brain really wants me to believe it. And I guess sometimes I do. I feel horrible. I told my girlfriend about this too, and she said that it didn't happen. She said that she would have woken up and it just all sounds like a complete long shot. She said that even if it did happen, she isn't hurt and she doesn't care whatsoever. My brain can't accept this. The fact that I don't know what truly happened is killing me, so I am just assuming the worst and my brain keeps adding more complexities to the situation that further criminalise me. Maybe I did put my dick inside her purposefully, I can't remember any of it and it's making me hate myself.

I also feel horrible for some thoughts that I have, unspeakable thoughts. Thoughts about incest, rape, and more fucked up shit. Nothing I'd ever do. And I know for sure I would never do these things with intent, but the thoughts make me feel so horrible. I truly believe I'm a disgusting person.

Another thing that happened, My sister, who is thirteen (nearly fourteen), was lying on her front in the middle of the floor. As I was going past, I stomped on her foot a few times (not hard, just messing around I guess) and her ass moved. I looked. I feel so disgusting. Why would I even look at my sister like that. It's fucking disgraceful. Maybe I did it knowing her ass would move. It doesn't matter. I'm a freak either way.

I also hit my girlfriend once. She was sat on top of me and as I sat up or moved or whatever, I hit her. Now I'm pretty sure it was an accident. But again my brain convinces me otherwise and maybe it wasn't. I cried pretty much straight away, It upset me because she's been through so much and I don't want to cause her pain. She's the most amazing girl and she's been here for me through absolutely everything, no matter what, she's never left my side. She's a blessing to this cruel world.

Yesterday, I was struggling so I decided to text a helpline. I texted to the woman for a bit and I was on my computer at the same time, I think at one point tho (whilst I was on my computer and waiting for responses), I got in one of those moods and I ended up having a wank. Now I feel so shitty because what if someone was going to commit suicide and really needed the help but I denied them that and they actually did. I feel so horrible and guilty.

The other day I had a thought and it makes me feel disgusting. The thought was of me fucking my sister and I don't even think it turned me on it was just lingering in my head. At the time I was also really horny and fancied a wank. I got scared because I didn't want to think this thought whilst I did that, I'd have felt really horrible and guilty. I was really horny and I stroked my dick a few times, not even masturbating I guess, but the thought was still in my head at the time. In the end I was too scared and didn't masturbate. Now I can't get over this, and I feel so guilty because I basically thinking about that thought, considering I kind of stroked my dick. It's so wrong and I feel so guilty.

Will I ever be able to be guilt-free, even if I'm being selfish and I deserve all of the guilt anyway...",29Oct2020,1
714,so for the past few months I've gradually gotten into drinking alcohol. It's been pretty fine for the most part I don't think I've been over doing it until recently It's been an everyday activity for at least a month. anyways not sure what it's related to but the last two times I've had drinks with my friends I've gone into having uncontrollable body spasms or convulsions. I'm not sure.. this has never happened to me before anytime growing up at all. It's kind of a like an overall body thing but it feels right in my lower abdomen that tenses up and releases.

715,"Hello, I've had this doubt for many years, and since I first thought of it, it just grows inside my head. I know many people are like me, they aren't good in some things, like social interaction, how to behave at certain situations, it's something normal. But since my childhood I just couldn't understand exactly what people meant most of the times.

Yeah, I handled everything that came into my life pretty well, I guess, but most of it I consider being just luck, I just go with the flow, and things just come to me without thinking much. The thing is that I don't understand most situations well, I get everything too literally, I get confused a lot when interacting with people, I don't know their intentions, if they mean what they are saying or if it is just an example. I didn't get in too much direct trouble with people through my life. But I've always been left out and sometimes even disliked by almost every group I've come in contact with, the schools (four to be exact), family, college and friends, even if I was ok with them, at some point I would eventually become more and more ignored or confronted and then they would think and talk bad things about me.

It happens that I don't exactly know why such things happen, at some point in my teens I seriously thought that there could be something unusual about my appearance or my speech that I wasn't aware of, and I sincerely asked this to my friends at the time, and they assured me I was normal.

Recently I've getting into some mild arguments with my SO because there are times when I don't get exactly what they are trying to tell me or what they expect me to do at certain situations, and I ask specific questions and they get upset. And in one of these arguments I told them about all of this and that they should consider this when dealing with me, but then they suggested I go see a doctor because maybe I was an autistic person or something like that, in their words. I didn't really get if they were joking or not about this, and I would like to know what some of you might think, if it's reasonable for me to actually go see a doctor or if I'm just overthinking this too much and I am just ok and these things are common.",29Oct2020,1

Now tonight I had a phonecall from cats protection who then passed my details on to the lady who has him. I've just been thinking he's been out doing his thing and actually he's been living at this woman's house, she's put a collar on him and says he's got his own bed and food bowl and stuff and has offered to buy him off me and care for him and right now I'm totally torn as to what to do. 

What if I was just a passing house to him and he had other homes? 
She also said that several other people on the street have said they also feed him and let him in. 
If I go get him and bring him home and keep him inside he'll be sad, he loves to be outside, even in the rain and snow. 
If I let him out he'll just go around to all the other people who also feed him and then back into this woman's house again..

backstory

so i was 12 years old when all this started. around the start of year 8 last year i started feeling quite down and getting quite bad mood swings but i thought it was just me being a teenager but then my nana passed away which had a really big effect on me and thats when my mental health and mood swings started to get worse and then about four months after my nana passed my grandmother passed away aswell to which left me severly depressed and i started to harm myself and my mood swings were really servere and it was like my mood would be fine one minute and the next inwas in this dark place with this thing behind me telling me i was worthless and useless, this got alot worse during quarentine to the point were i tried to take my own life(edit: i had just turned 13 about a week beforehand for those who were wondering)
but my mum walked through the front door downstairs which made me stop(edit: for those who were wondering i got to the point were i put my school tie around my neck)but anyway when i got back to school about a month in i went to go talk to someone and i told my best friends and im now getting all the help and support i need üòÅ

sorry for the long backstory now lets get onto the main story. So the following week i went and told someone one of my bestfriends(i have 5 btw) started to tell us he wanted to end it all at first i thought he was genuine but after about a day things started seeming weird like he would show us his cuts and like show them off and say that we were self harm buddies which made uncomfertble and he would harm himself with a sharped pen lid on his desk making it very obvious he was doing it. Another example is when i went to his house( well stayed in his garden when it was pouring thx covid) and he said that he tried to overdose on paracetomol and again i belived him and told him im always there to talk( i think this incident was about a week before i told someone) but then in that same week were he told us all this i asked him privetly if he had tried to kill himself which he denied that he had tried.So a teaching assitant caught him harming his self btw and now he goes and talks to the one of the schools counserlor(the same one i talk to) and i was just wondering if i should tell someone about this.

edit:btw im not saying i dont belive him and its quite clear he has issues aswell but im just suspicious because its weird that as soon as i get help and told him he starts doing the same thing and he said he has been doing for a while were as for the durarion i have know him for(a year and a half) he hast done anything to cover it up so yea thats it.",29Oct2020,1

722,"Hey all,

I was just wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what career I might be best at.

I've always enjoyed the arts and creative things (writing essays, music, art, etc) but I'm wary of pursuing music and art as a career because of the high risk and low payoff. I enjoy the social sciences and humanities, but I don't think I'll be very happy with any of the jobs I can get with those degrees. With that in mind, I'm trying to think of careers that might utilize my creative side while providing financial stability.

I'm not seriously considering engineering or architecture, but it seems so rewarding to have a portfolio of things you've created that you can look back on and be proud of. I wish I could do that with art or music, but those are both very risky career moves and I feel it's best to have a backup plan. I want to do something creative, I just don't know what it would be.

725,"I have an 11-inch iPad Pro that I just bought in August 2020 with a 2nd gen Apple pencil. It was great, but I started having weird problems with procreate. When using the apple pencil it would act like i was ""shading""/ using the pencil on its side even when I was using it on its very point. I put my problems into the procreate forum and the mods told me it was a faulty pencil.

Before returning the pencil I tried everything i could think of to fix it but it didn't work. I returned it but the new pencil did the same thing. My husband was able to fix the problem by turning off the settings for tilt. (which made me feel dumb, but tbf I didn't even know there was settings for that or how to mess with those). This led me to believe that there was nothing wrong with my first pencil, but I had already replaced it so there wasn't much I could do.

After 2.5 months with my current pencil, there have been pressure issues. I first noticed it in procreate, but it was also happening in Good Notes 5 and the Apple Notes app. Line thickness is inconsistent. There are moments when it's okay but that doesn't last long. I also tested it with pressure sensitive brushes; when I try to use a brush at its thickest the line will be barely noticeable. I've even tried to press down on the ipad as much as I could without damaging it, but the line was still thin.

I've tried most things I could to remedy the problem. From hard reseting, cleaning the ipad, cleaning the pencil, replacing the nib, tightening the nib, re-pairing the pencil, turning the ipad off then on, and reinstalling the apps. The only thing i haven't done is factory resetting which I don't want to do.

What are the chances that I got two faulty pencils? And how would I know if it's my ipad being faulty? I made an appointment to get them checked out but that's 10 days away. I would prefer if I could find some miracle fix but I'm out of ideas to try. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: I've also updated the ipad to the most current software.",29Oct2020,1
726,"Hey guys

Throwaway as this gets a little personal.

TL;DR - might get sacked because I punched boxes over being pushed too much at work when I'm doing 2 peoples jobs and also was told that someone I care about alot got raped because she deserved it. Yup.

So today I got very angry at work and punched a few boxes, which I know is unacceptable at work no matter the situation. However I was provoked by a colleague (let's say Stan) and somebody that isn't my boss, but is in charge of a few of the things I do daily (Morris). 

It's a bit of a long story but basically both of these people get paid more than me to do next to nothing and chat all day, and boss me around. ""Morris"" barely communicates to me which makes my job take a little bit longer. 
I have no complaints so far. 

I should also add that I'm doing at least 2 peoples jobs as I have had a person taken away to work in other departments, and ""Stan"" has been told to leave me to my job so he can concentrate on his 'job' as it is more important stock he deals with. 
No complaints so far. 

So recently I've been veeeeeeeeeeery busy and I've had Morris on my back complaining that I'm not doing enough in a day when I work from start to finish except for cigarette breaks and the occasional chat with Morris and Stan. I usually agree with Morris that I could do more. 
Still not a single complaint from me.

A few days ago, Stan started going into detail about his opinions on rape victims and women in general.
This is already quite long so I'll skip most of the sexist, racist, xenophobic and hate speech comments.

So yeah, Stan starts saying that rape victims probably deserved it because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and that they should be able to defend themselves. Like learning martial arts. His words. 

I surprisingly calmly remind him of what I told him nearly a year ago (not the first time hes said this) that my (ex) girlfriend (of about a month ago, very mutual, very recent; still care about her) had been raped when she was younger.

He smirked and said ""she probably deserved it"".

Again, getting angry at work is wrong.

Anyway I told him I'd break his nose if he said another word and he shut up. I didnt apologise and we started getting on again, acquaintance wise anyway, and it was over.

So today I'm obviously still very quietly angry at Stan. 
I dont want to start stuff so I havent said anything about that.
So I'm working my butt off and Morris comes and koand about rubbish that Stan could have easily picked up with his list of nothing to do, whilst I'm clearly very busy wrapping boxes and expensive items. 

Eventually after unnecessary nagging I imagine I looked visibly stressed. Morris continued, which is why I believe he provoked me. 

So yeah I got angry and punched a cardboard box containing a piece of stock, which was heavily packaged and wouldn't break, although again I understand how unacceptable it is to get remotely violent.

I told my boyfriend and asked him to tell his older brother (he lives with us). It completely slipped both of our minds. All yesterday I was completely occupied and came home, saw his brother but didn't say anything because I was so tired and completely forgot. Now its today and she comes 20 minutes late and our house is a wreck. I don't think we are allowed to have pets (im not sure) but she saw two of them and signs of having them (like a box the crate come in and dog food). She came in to see what needed to be repaired. She didn't say anything as a bad response to what she was seeing that could be against the lease and now I have no idea what to expect. I don't know if she just doesn't care, I don‚Äôt know if she's waiting until she isn't busy or until after our next rent to warn us to kick the animals out (if they aren't supposed to be here) or if she is going to try evicting us immediately, I have no idea what to expect. And I feel horrible and responsible for the fact that my roommates didn't know so they could prepare because she only told me, being me the only person who would contact her about our housing issues. I feel horrible. How could I have even forgotten?",29Oct2020,1
728,"I‚Äôm (19F) a crim. justice and psychology student and I absolutely despise what I‚Äôm doing.

I‚Äôm taking statistics at my university and obviously i‚Äôm hating it and failing it because I‚Äôm absolutely rubbish at maths. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in some horrid 9-5 cubicle job for the rest of my life conducting research instead of doing hands on things because that‚Äôs my absolute most horrid fear.

My true passion is acting, of course, and I‚Äôm currently working on making that dream of mine come true.

732,"Hi Everyone,

Sorry for this isn't the place to post this but I need some thoughts on a matter. Recently, my employer sent out a newsletter stating that since work is ramping up for the holiday season, employees are needed and attendance will be rewarded. I won't go into the super fine details but the basic idea is that if you never call off and show up, you get a bonus. Normally, this would be great and I would encourage it for the most part. However, with flu season here and covid still very present, is this negligent on my employer who now offers a bonus to keep coming in even if they are sick. I should also note that if the individual does call off for feeling ill, they forfeit the bonus for the month.

Am I overthinking this or do I have any paths to take, other than going in and hoping I, or someone else, isn't sick?",29Oct2020,1

734,"I'm sorry if I break any rules or this is somehow wrong, I don't post a lot.

So, 2020 has been an awful year, I assume for everyone, but I feel like it's been a real turning point in my life. I feel like this, mainly because I've found out a decent amount of people truly dislike me.

Now, I've always feared people hate me for a multitude of irrational reasons but brushed these feelings off as paranoia or anxiety. I don't have a massive desire to ""fit in"" or be cool but I never thought that would make me so unlikeable!

I am not intentionally cruel or demeaning and I like to think I'm considerate, but following several conversations with different groups of associates, it's apparent most people just tolerate me and there are even some that even actively avoid me and only one person can give me a reason why! 

The final straw, happened today when I passed my neighbours on the street. We smiled and waved and once we passed my mum said, ""wow they really hate you don't they!"" And I've got to admit, it hurt. I've had maybe 3 conversations with my neighbours since moving in and I suspected they disliked me but, again, assumed it was just paranoia. I'm as quiet as I can be with 2 children under 5, I remembered their children's birthdays and got them a gift each, I greet them every time we see eachother, I'm wracking my brain trying to figure out what's wrong with me!

So I guess my question is are there any practical ways to get people to like me? Are there people you don't like but have no reasoning behind? Is it overrated to be liked, because I feel like maybe I haven't been paranoid and everyone has disliked me all my life.",29Oct2020,1

738,"Hi! This is my first post here and I'm in great need of advice. I'll start off by saying my boyfriend is incredible. He basically worships the ground I walk on and is consistently there for me when I need him and goes above and beyond all expectations. However, he is not a very sexual person. He confided in me when we started dating that he was a virgin and that when he hit puberty growing up, he barely felt the need to jerk off or relieve himself. We've had sex, but it's not great. He is very awkward, and clumsy, sometimes he has even gotten soft in the middle of sex. In the beginning of the relationship I found this cute and thought he would find his footing eventually, but it continued.I can't help but feel very turned off and it's not that I don't find him attractive, it's just that I don't even view him as a sexual person because he never really attempts at having sex with me and when he does the chemistry is just way off and I'm not into it. 

I'm a very sexual person, but I'm also very submissive. I don't do well in positions where I have to take over, so I wish that there was a way for him to become dominant in the bedroom but it is just not in his nature. We've had many talks about this and he came up with the idea that I could get my needs met elsewhere (ie. Hookups and sex from other guys) because he didn't think he could ever be that way. Although I experienced a lot of relief from that, I also feel conflicted. I have never met a guy who treats me better than I deserve to be treated, in fact in every other case it's been the opposite. But not experiencing any sexual connectivity with him has been weighing on me. We love each other a lot, and it's a very comfortable love. He and I make good life partners I suppose, but not lovers. I just can't help thinking that may be there's a guy out there who can meet all my needs both emotionally and physically, but I'm not sure and I also don't want to lose him. 

Do you all have any advice for me in this situation?? Is there any fixing this?? Please feel free to share personal experiences etc. I'm feeling pretty lost with that right now.",29Oct2020,1
739,"I‚Äôve always had free reign/non controlling parents. We definitely are close but although I live at home while finishing school I have a lot of independent tendencies. (Separate households but my mom &amp; grandmother) live 10 minutes down the road. 

Couple examples: 

Whenever it comes to them making food and constantly offering it to me or making me a plate when I clearly laid out I buy my own groceries and food to make. And that I‚Äôll let them know if I want what they plan to make that night. *No I‚Äôm not on some crazy food lifestyle just simply portion control/healthier meals to lose weight* I‚Äôll happily eat my prepared meal at the dinner table. 

Yet they will buy the burrito, make the plate of pasta, constantly harass me to eat the watermelon. 

They will try and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me get women if I‚Äôm at the bar/restaurant with then. Trying to be my wingman. When as cool of parents they can be don‚Äôt understand socially it makes me and whoever they are trying to get me with uncomfortable. I can go to a bar and have a drink not need to talk to a woman. If it happens great but that‚Äôs not why I get out. They always try to invite themselves to my camping trips/hikes. (Again it‚Äôs complicated but when I‚Äôm joining a small group especially during covid where we all get tested prior, wear masks, not share food + they have to haul the entire family to the trip and can‚Äôt bring +4 guests to something i didn‚Äôt organize)

It‚Äôs not easy to get help because teachers aren‚Äôt able to pay attention to online students bc of  in class students. I totally understand it must be hard for them as well.

742,"I feel like my [M18] girlfriend [F18] isn‚Äôt attracted to me


My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year. It‚Äôs clear to me that she loves me, and wants to spend as much time with me as possible. However, in the 13 months that we have been dating, we‚Äôve only had sex four times. Initially, I didn‚Äôt let this bother me. I was never too brute when initiating sex. We still made out, and kissed (we still kiss, but making out is less common). 

Over the past four months, I‚Äôve just come to the realization that the infrequency of intimacy is just abnormal. To add to this, I‚Äôve become wildly insecure about her sexual past (retroactive jealousy), as a result of our sex life. She‚Äôs seen over 8 guys in the past (casually), and has been in one relationship in which they had sex regularly. Currently, she‚Äôs on SSRIs, and birth control. She claims that her medication has negatively affected her sex drive. Before stating this roughly a month ago, she‚Äôd said that she a). felt like she couldn‚Äôt satisfy me b). was insecure. I‚Äôve brought the lack of intimacy up over 3 times. During each confrontation, I was incredibly nonchalant about addressing it. I simply wanted her side of things, and each conversation simply ended with ‚ÄúI want to be intimate‚Äù; ‚ÄúWe have so much to explore‚Äù; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm attracted to you‚Äù. I‚Äôd like to believe all of these statements, but the lack of sex has caused me to obsess over her past/compare myself to her past partners, and doubt my appearance. On top of this, I‚Äôm now paranoid about her cheating on me. The angst and mild resentment that I‚Äôve been dealing with has caused me to grow distant from her. I feel like I can‚Äôt trust her because of my delusions, and I can almost never just embrace the connection that we have, because of the intrusive thoughts. 

She‚Äôs expressed being sexual person, and has given me some insight into her past. Most of it consisted of casually seeing other guys/maintaining some FWBs. I never have had a problem with this, and I‚Äôm glad that she was able to get out and experiment. She just doesn‚Äôt seem to be that person around me. She doesn‚Äôt initiate/has never sent a flirty photo. I‚Äôve just resorted to telling myself that i‚Äôm just not as attractive as the guys that she‚Äôs been with and am incapable of turning her on.

Sex typically unfolds like this;
1). I initiate foreplay/become more touchy (she almost never does this, but will hug me/kiss me out of the blue)
2). I try my best to satisfy her, often with oral, she often finishes
3). More touching, the sex ensues
4). She kind of sits there like a log.

Each interaction that we‚Äôve had just seems to be led by me. She‚Äôs almost always in another place, and struggles to ‚Äústay in the mood‚Äù. She tried to give me oral once, but was so hesitant to do so that she asked that I put a condom on because she didn‚Äôt want to taste any fluid that I might release. I‚Äôve never been pushy, and have always tried to approach sex and foreplay from different angles. I want to see the promiscuous, lively girl that enjoys sex. I just see no vigor from her. I‚Äôm sexually inexperienced, but have picked up a lot from being with her. I wanted to develop, but I‚Äôve gone from square one to square one.

For those of you who have stuck around for this long; this is what I really want you to read 

I want to stay with this girl, and I want things to work out. She‚Äôs already talked about marriage, and moving in together. I could see those things working out, but my MAIN problem at the moment is the retroactive jealousy and delusional thoughts. I want to be around her and love her, and I just can‚Äôt seem to be able to do that lately. Yesterday, I woke up from a nap and just seemed to let go for a bit. I was no longer worried about her past, or our future, and I just enjoyed my time with her. I felt an amazing connection. I know that I still love this girl, and I want to stay with her. I just need some type of a hypothesis. 

I just want things to work out, but I can‚Äôt just be normal around her/embrace the pros of the relationship as much as I want to. I‚Äôm insecure, admittedly. I have abandonment issues, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about whether or not this will work out.

My confidence is suffering, and I‚Äôve found myself in a deep rut. I don‚Äôt want to ask myself if she‚Äôs cheating, or if I‚Äôm just not attractive in her eyes; however, I want something that I can chew on. Any ideas?

tl;dr - My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, and I‚Äôve damaged my emotional connection with her due to my obsession with our sex life. I have no idea what to do.",29Oct2020,1
743,"I have a friend (John) that I've known since we were 15 (we're now almost 30). We didn't keep in contact after high school because our lives just went in different directions. We reconnected a few years ago, and it has been an extremely rocky relationship (him being a depressed alcoholic and me being a depressed codependent and people-pleaser). It became very toxic for a while, and the beginning of this year I finally snapped, had a mental breakdown and began going to al-anon/codependent meetings to learn how to set healthy boundaries between myself and John. A lot happened, and to make it short we're basically good now, but I feel super burnt out on him. 

The problem is, I don't like hanging out with him. I'm an extremely introverted person, and since I was a kid I have never been one to actively seek the company of my friends. I have a few really great friendships that are low maintenance, we all have busy lives and when we do get to see each other it's great. But John wants to hang out way more than I do. When we do hang out, it's fun ish for a while, but it either means he comes to my place and overstays his welcome (2 or 3 days which is INSANE for me) or I go to his- his parent's basement, where his room is extremely unhygienic and I'll leave it at that. And no matter what he is always drinking.

He is not a bad person and I do care about him, but if we had met today I wouldn't choose to be friends with him. I'm not trying to dunk on him, I just don't really enjoy his company all that much and find him kind of abbrassive and immature. 

His bday is in a few days. I'm making him a gift that I want to bring to him (he bought me lunch and a cake for my bday earlier in the year) but I'm feeling really anxious about it. My mind is going crazy trying to think of any reason to bail, but I feel bad because it's his birthday. I know with covid we shouldn't really be hanging out anyway, but even that feels like it will read as a weak excuse (I'm at home all the time and only leave to get groceries once a week and John knows that). How can I drop off the gift without having to hang out? We haven't seen each other for 2 months, and i feel really horrible about just dropping off a present and leaving immediately, but I really really don't want to stay. He's not having a party or anything, I assume he'll just be with his family that day. 

Am I being a people-pleaser by worrying about how he'll react if I leave right away? Or is it really mean to not spend time with him on his bday? I also feel conflicted because I personally don't care much about my own bday at this point in life (same with my fianc√© and most of my friends) but John has a history of feeling hurt when he doesn't get much attention. He often feels lonely, and i can't really relate to that so I'm trying to see from his perspective. He might be hurt by not having a friend around on his day. Should I spend time with him even though I don't want to? 

TLDR: I don't enjoy spending time with my friend but his bday is in a few days and I have a gift to give him. How do I give him the gift and bail without hurting his feelings for not hanging out? Or should I spend time with him to try to make him happy?",29Oct2020,1

746,"So here's the story that's been on my mind for about a week. I live in an apartment, with a neighbor below me. Our bedroom floor has carpet. My partner and I were having sex about a week ago, though I admit it was a late. We were quiet, but our bed squeaks. We didn't think it could be heard, but we heard a loud bang coming from our floor/our neighbors ceiling. We stopped what we were doing, and moved much slower and quieter. There weren't many squeaks at all, and when there were, they were soft. This only lasted not even a minute--Our neighbor still heard, and banged twice this time. So we stopped completely, embarrassed, and went to sleep. The next day we got a phone call from someone at the front desk, telling us a neighbor complained about the noise. We were a little taken back that the neighbor immediately got the office involved, as we don't normally have sex at that hour (usually around 7-10 pm) and even when we do, not in such a way that the bed squeaks. The person at the office seemed to feel a bit awkward for calling and laughed nervously, and explained that they told them that people live their lives and that they can't really make us stop except to maybe not do it at that hour or get a new bedframe/fix it some how. I'm not sure where to go from here, I'm honestly afraid that now our neighbor is upset they might complain again even if we have sex earlier.  


 I can try to fix the frame, and we'll be mindful of the time going forward, but I'm just surprised as I said that they immediately went to the office before either a.) letting it go since it was once or b.) leaving us a note/talking about it. So reddit, what should I do? I'm really nervous and embarrassed. I've lived in dorms/apartments before and have never had a noise complaint toward me before and i generally keep to myself. I don't have parties even before covid or play loud music or blast the tv. i don't have any dogs, i don't argue with my partner. we tend to stay quiet and mind our business. we've had noise from all directions as well, since that's just apart of apartment living, but never saw any reason to report it unless it sounded like someone was in danger or it was something non stop that disrupted our lives. But as I said, now I'm nervous (i'm a naturally anxious person) that we'll get more complaints from the same neighbor and now i'm cautious about every noise i make. Should I ignore the complaint and keep living normal (of course at a reasonable hour) or should i seriously look into the bed thing? I can't really afford a new frame at the moment, and I'm not sure if trying to fix it would be enough.",29Oct2020,1
747,"Personally, I don't care much for the holidays except for Halloween. I was devastated about not being able to celebrate properly this year but I was making the best of it by planning things to do with my little sister and baby brother (it's his first Halloween btw).

749,"I‚Äôve been on academic probation for 2 semesters now and this is the second and deciding semester. I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. It‚Äôs weird, but I like working and once I get into the zone, I go all out. In fact, I would go so far as to say that my life revolves around my work. I just like the respect and admiration that‚Äôs given when a job is well done. My role models are people who work hard and are well-educated too. But ironically, my grades don‚Äôt reflect that mentality at all. 

I‚Äôve already turned in many assignments late or just missed them completely. My midterms are horrible because I never finish all the questions in time and/or I don‚Äôt know the material well enough. It‚Äôs so hard to get myself to start working to the point where I‚Äôve developed chronic procrastination. I also don‚Äôt usually start assignments until I feel like I have a good grasp of the material (because isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôre supposed to do?). Hence why so much work is missing/late, combined with the fact I‚Äôm behind on lectures. Maybe it‚Äôs a form of perfectionism, but I‚Äôm pretty laid back otherwise, so it might just only be when I work. I don‚Äôt hate my major (computer science) either because I like to program and make things. But failing so much is making me numb. 

At this point, I actually think I‚Äôm going to fail and get kicked out. And when I do, I know I‚Äôll feel as if my world‚Äôs going to end. With the way things are going, I don‚Äôt see any other outcome besides this and possibly being disowned by my parents and such.

758,"Hi everyone.   


I have a dilemma and I'm not sure what to do. The reason is because I feel like I can't do anything. Let me explain. I met this girl in one class where we have to divide into groups and speak with each other over a video call once/twice a week about the class content. Through our weekly discussions I've been impressed, and more surprised that this one member\\girl has a lot of thoughts that are just like mine. Since we're halfway through the semester, this girl and I have kind of, unexpectadly, taken over the group where it seems like just her and I discuss with others taking notes that we have to submit. I've grown fond of her from when I first saw her and I can't tell you why. Her expressing herself has just confirmed something in me as to why I've felt an instant and sincere attraction. I'm well aware of our natural tendencies of projecting our ideal person onto the person we see fit for us, but I can't say it's due to that, as I have experience proejecting in my past.   


I found out that she's in another one of my classes and she's video called me a couple of times to help me on homework. Naturally, because I feel like we both sense a strong chemistry, we spoke about life. It meant a lot to me because she's a genuine girl that I sense has deep sincerity and authenticity.   


My issue here is in my conversations with her, she has mentioned that she has a boyfriend. She shared this information not because I made a move, but because she was sharing a story. Obviously knowing that, I'm not sure what to do because for 1) I can't be an asshole to get in the middle of that. I've been in an abusive relationship before and my histronic/narcisstic ex would hurt me in that way. I wouldn't do that to another person/guy because it also goes against my morality. I do really care for her and I'd never make the selfish move to interfere with what's in her life \[relationship\] for my gain. I don't want to hurt her. My 2nd issue is hearing from her has made me think more and more about her. It's not an obssession, but it has affected me in a way that makes me think about her and wanting to know where she is, what she's up to, etc. It's kind of starting to affect my focus on school, but it's nothing she has done, it's just me, how I feel on particular days etc. My 3rd issue: I'm not a picky person, but it's very diffcult for me to have an interest in someone, and when I do I potentially fall hard. I don't know if this is really relevant, but my personality type is INFJ, under myers-briggs personality types, which for me means I have strong introverted/intuitive knowing about things and people in my life.   


I'm okay with being a friend of hers, actually most likely a very good friend seeing how much there is in common between us in terms of thought processes, personality type, humor, and mannerisms. It's just weird, and it hurts that i can't advance and move forward in how I want to choose and speak to her because of the awareness that she's in a relationship. I don't really know what I'm asking for, but I don't have any friends and family to share these thoughts with and I was hoping any one of you can just comment on anything I've mentioned to help me with processing my feelings. What hurts me personally is throughout my life I've never had too much opportunity to be with women I've had genuine interest in/in love with and I've been in 2 abusive ones because I tend to attract broken people who end up hurting me.  


I apologize for the long post and potentially disorganized rant, but thank you for reading, it means a lot to me.",29Oct2020,1

762,"  I am extremely new to reddit, so please excuse any mistakes I may have made.

*A bit of background:* 

  My mom is the youngest of 5 siblings and the aunt in question, lets name her Mellisa for today, is the eldest (they have a 7 year age gap). I have a younger sibling that I adore, who is 3 years younger to me. My aunt and uncle have always been very close to us, and I idolised my aunt uptil a few years ago (more on this later). Mellisa and her husband have an adult son, that lives in a different country, so they decided to buy a dog (M) to not feel lonely. One year later they bought another one (F-Sandy). Both of them are retrievers. My aunt and uncle are very wealthy and love to spoil their doggos (the oldest turned 5 this year)to the point where the oldest mostly only eats food if he is handfed (this has become a habit now). There are only three people in my mom's entire family that can feed them this way- my aunt and uncle and me.

{*Why and how I stopped idolising her:* I had always assumed as a kid that my mom and her shared a special relationship, and that they were more than your ordinary sisters and were more like bffs(boy was I wrong!). So one day, while we had gone to their place for dinner(note this is happening a few years before the arrival of the doggos) I noticed that Mellisa got mad at my mom for some dumb thing like taking out the wrong kind of ladle, or the wrong set of bowls for dessert. Then I began noticing that she had a huge ego that made her act a bit entitled at times. If my mom ever tried to confront her or stand up for herself the issue would become bigger. My mom would eventually try to bury the hatchet, move on and make up with her. It was after one such stupid fight that I overheard my mom sobbing and telling my dad that she feels that while she has Mellisa's back at all times and is even expected to do so, her sister never supports her and that no one will standup for her against Mellisa or even to correct her. The final nail in the coffin for me was when, a year after the arrival of the second doggo, Mellisa started unknowingly (ig?) refer to my sister as Sandy, which is NOT SIMILAR TO HER NAME IN ANY WAY. Tho she apologised the first few times my sister corrected her, she has stopped apologising nowadays.}

   A few months ago Mellisa tested positive for covid. All of us were very worried for her and her family. My uncle was negative but still had to be quaranteened, so he would not be able to leave his house for a few days. We offered to help them out in any way we could, so they decided to entrust the doggos to us and we accepted. The doggos stayed with us for 20 days. Although it was fun to take on this responsibility, the experience took its toll on all the four of us. I was tired of handfeeding these guys and their constant barking, the poop experience, 4 walks a day, was a too much for for everyone, especially my parents(everyone has their own lives to live as well you know?). The worst part was that these guys left ticks all over our apartment and it took us more than a month to almost get rid of them. But given the situation we did not say much about our feelings and sucked it up. (I think this is where we went wrong).

  A few months later Mellisa asked my mom if it would be okay to keep the doggos at our house for the weekend so that she and my uncle could go out with their friends to rejuvinate and enjoy themselves. And we reluctantly agreed.

A week before my birthday, she again asked us for the same favour,for the same reason, but this time my mom refused and said that it wasn't possible as we were planning to go out to the mountains celebrate I\_really\_like\_appyfz 's birthday. So we made a plan to celebrate my birthday outside.XD (honestly it was an awesome birthday). And Mellisa's trip was cancelled as one of the friends had some urgent work to attend to.

**Now onto the incident:**

  So Mellisa called my mom TODAY, to ""ask"" if she could leave the doggos with us TOMORROW and that they'll pick them up on SUNDAY. Cuz they are taking another mini vacay, this time to the beach, with their friends.

  My mom has a holiday tomorrow so had booked an appointment at a salon. She had to cancel that because of this sudden change in plans(she had been looking forward to this appointment for a month). My sister and I have lectures till 5:30pm tomorrow and I have to attend a workshop on the weekend. AND WE CAN'T SAY NO?!?

  I was livid at the sheer audacity she has to even suggest such a thing. She has alternatives- she has a maid that works from 8am to 9pm, another maid to do household chores, a cook, a driver and a dog walker that is ready to come thrice a day if paid for it. Mind you they have a seperate room for the maids and the maid that works a 12hr shift has in the past and absolutely can stay overnight but she charges for it.

  \[We can't say no because if we do they will dump the doggos on my grandpa's head and go for their trip. They have done this afew times in the past and my mom had to sit Mellisa down and tell her that this is taking a toll on their dad and she can't keep doing this to him- which led to another argument\]

  I love those dogs to death and would do anthing for them, but this is becoming too much and I'm afraid it will take a toll on my health again- both mental and physical, because They Are Not Our Responsibility.

  (After their first stay, I realised that I had sprained my right hand wrist and I wasn't able to sleep properly or workout or play badminton for a week because of extreme back ache I had due to the constant push and pull on the leash)

What do I do? Should I even do anything? Is there a way I can suggest my mom to handle this situation? Please advise me on what I should do or ask my mom to do going forward.",29Oct2020,1

Sometimes when we hang out, I ask to look at his phone, not because I distrust him or anything, but because we like to talk about old memories with pictures we stored in our phones. 

The issue is, he gives me almost unrestricted access to his phone, but I can't bring myself to share everything in my phone with him and I only show him certain pictures or texts. I can't get over the embarrassment of showing him what I like to do on my phone in my free time (Play dress up games and anime games) or talk about my previous relationship, of which my ex left me for another woman.

I‚Äôve never really had a proper pet since childhood. I love all the animals but I‚Äôm seriously crazy for cats. They‚Äôre so unique and different in their own way. Also they‚Äôre so sweet. They know how to cheer you up. They‚Äôre so cuteee..

Once we had a orange cat come in our house and became friends with us when we gave him some food. He then started living with us. He was so perfect. He was the highlight of my day. I used to come from school and he would be there to greet me. And whenever I was studying, he would sit outside the window and meow at me til I let him inside. He loved being petted. He would also sleep besides me sometimes. I loved waking up to him besides me. I loved him with all my heart. It just feel so nice to take care of an animal and give him/her everything he/she needs and make them feel cozy.. also play with them and kiss them. He was also very good for my mental health. I was distracted and happy for a while.
One day he got sick. My mother did something to him I think. He never came back. 

We‚Äôve had many stray cats come in our house but all of them were thrown out by my mother the moment they caused slight inconvenience. I never got to adopt them. I don‚Äôt know why but she hates cats. I can‚Äôt even process what goes through the minds of such individuals who hates cats as much as she does. Like she treats them like trash :(( 

Every time I achieve something she promises me that she will get me a cat but when the time comes she starts yelling at me. She says that I can‚Äôt take care of animals. But that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve taken care of many baby cats as long as their mother kept them in our house. I know what it‚Äôs like.

I‚Äôm desperate at this point. I‚Äôve 6+ years left until I graduate the darn med school :,( I can‚Äôt move out yet.. I was thinking that when I‚Äôll go to uni I‚Äôll bring a cat home. But that‚Äôs risky because my mother might throw it out or kill it :( no matter how much I convince her she doesn‚Äôt listen. I‚Äôm tired of scrolling through Instagram and seeing all the cats videos. üò≠ when will I actually get to hold one??

But right now, every time I think about the future, I don't see a future. Some days I have a positive outlook on life, then other days I feel so trapped.

773,"Well this is certainly not a very impressive situation, but I'm having trouble moving past it. I (F18) met a guy at work (M24) about 3 months ago. We started texting after a few weeks and hung out once. I thought I saw some good signs like compliments, hugs, talking about making more plans. I would see him at work at least twice a week and each time I saw him, he'd go out of his way to talk to me a lot.

A bit over 2 weeks ago, the last time I saw him at work, we discussed making plans. Even chose a day. We also casually texted the next day but then after he didn't text me. The day before we were supposed to hang out, I checked up to see if he was still down but he didn't respond. He also hasn't been at work for these past few weeks. It has been completely silent on his end and I'm actually slightly concerned about him. 

The reason why I'm upset over this is because (even though I shouldn't have) I developed strong feelings for him and saw good signs. Then out of nowhere he disappears. I suppose that's the exact definition of ghosting but I can't wrap my head around it. Selfishly, I wish I had gotten an explanation instead of being left confused. I know I shouldn't be confused about the situation because it's clear he doesn't wish to continue talking. But I keep catching myself during the day getting upset over a guy I never even dated.

The issue is I am still living at home with my parents. Should I tell them I dropped out? How would I even do that? They keep telling me they are proud but it makes it even harder. Thanks for the help.

786,"Hey, this is my first ever reddit post and I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologise if anything is weird.

I don‚Äôt know where to start so here‚Äôs some background info. I (15F) are currently in year 9 of high school (Australia). I am not very great at keeping friends and have had a few fall outs with friends over the past 3 years. My current friend group consists of my boyfriend of 3 years (15M), 2 guys and 1 girl, all 15.

Anyways. So lately I just haven‚Äôt felt right, I used to be such a bubbly friendly happy person and now I‚Äôm extremely irritable, sad a lot more than I am happy, and sometimes I just feel nothing. Now in about October (I think) of last year I went to the doctors because I wasn‚Äôt feeling ok too. I was ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with depressive anxiety and went to see a psychologist for a while until COVID hit. That helped a bit but I just felt really awkward talking to the guy I had. I haven‚Äôt gone back there since COVID hit my area in about May or so. I‚Äôve asked my parents to book me an appointment again with a different person but they keep forgetting and idk if it‚Äôs worth the effort anymore, now don‚Äôt get me wrong my parents are great people but just bad at listening sometimes.

My mental health is starting to take a toll on my relationship, my boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him A) has been trying to help me so much and I think he feels like he isn‚Äôt good enough because it doesn‚Äôt help (it does help but then I just get worse again) and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve tried to tell him it‚Äôs ok and I‚Äôm so grateful for all the help he gives me but idk. I only really feel okay when I‚Äôm with him.

Now I think my biggest issue is school, I have exams coming up and I am the biggest worrier and overthinker in the world. I can‚Äôt focus on anything for too long, I‚Äôm always fidgeting or bouncing my leg and for about 6 years now I have been tearing and gnawing at the skin around my fingernails (google dermatophagia) 

I don‚Äôt really know what the point of me writing this was but I think I just wanted to get it off my chest and have a rant. My last point is that I want to be a psychologist when I‚Äôm older (ironic) but I‚Äôm worried I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôve had to see a psychologist (somebody told me that, idk if it‚Äôs bs)

Sorry for such a long post, any advice would help :)",29Oct2020,1
787,"Me (girl) and my boyfriend are together for more than 4 years. We've been through a lot, especially this pandemic. We were thinking of getting married soon actually. He's been busy with work lately, and I wanted to surprise him with a getaway weekend once he's free. At the same time, I want to pop the question to him during those moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is... I can't afford a ring. We don't restrict ourselves to tradition, but I still want to give something to him as a symbol. I was thinking of making a custom omamori and then put a lock of hair in it in the shape of a ring (but he won't wear it because that'll be weird). He's not a materialistic person, so I was thinking if that's alright, and if it's culturally-appropriate also.

790,"Hi there I thought this would be the best subreddit were I can ask to see how you view it from your own point of view.

I'm  a guy (male) in my early 20s, I'm an fresh IT grad. What I think sets  me apart from my friends and other grads, is that about 3 years ago I  took a leap of faith and started my own business. It was a struggle at  the very beginning. putting countless hours without getting a good  return. Nowadays I'm doing amazingly well, and I am not writing this to  boast but much rather to give context to what I'm about to say. This  year (1st Jan till today) I managed to profit just over 100k USD whilst  studying full time.

Now here is  where I want your input. Prior to all this, I had a minimum wage job  where I had met this wonderful charismatic loving girl (she's bi and 2  or so years older than me). We hit it off, eventually we started hanging  out with each other and her friends (there was never anything romantic  between us although that is what I wanted/still want).

After  about a year or so after getting to know each other really well, she  had a death in her family. It was suicide so you can imagine where it  put her. I was devastated and it pained me to see her like that, but  after that, I gave her the space and we fell apart as she did with most  of her other friends. My guess is she tried to push us away to not feel  her pain. Not seeing her pained me for a good few months, and this is  where I started my business. Practically it was a tool to get  distracted.

Anyway since then  we  met up once or twice but never like we used to. Fast forward to today,  out of nowhere she reached out after I had just posted an Instagram  story and within a few minutes after I posted it she texted me that she  her new job was in the area and we should meet for coffee (always whilst  respecting covid regulations). How could I decline such an invite? I  told her when I was free and we met up, there was her colleague (which  left soon after) and the way she introduced me was like no had ever done  for me previously, every little thing, all my achievements and success  and what not in a single sentence. She made me blush. Just after her  colleague left and we were chatting, one thing that struct me was ''How  happy I am for you'', literally another thing I never heard someone tell  me. She even asked me to meet up again sometime next week for lunch.

I  want your input and if you ever were in a ''similar'' situation and if I  should pursue it or just let bygones be bygones. There is this saying  that goes if you are on your deathbed, what would you regret most about  your life? Well mine is is that I never told her how I felt and the fear  that she would not reciprocate the same feelings.",29Oct2020,1
791," 

Hi! My dilemna is this. I had previously made plans to live with two friends from my freshman dorm. They made this plan with our other friends to live in this complex which is super far from campus. We needed a fourth roommate but couldn't find one. That is until one of them asked another friend who I don't like at all. He's rude and extremely condescending. They asked him without seeing if it was okay with me first. That is just one of many decisions that were made without checking in with me first, including the apartment complex itself.

So anyways, my current roommates (I am a sophomore) asked me if I wanted to live with them again next year at a much more desirable apartment and I would much rather live with them. So basically my choice is to live at a place which is much better with people I would rather live with or screw over my friends because it will be very hard to find another roommate.

Personally I feel that they haven't shown me the fairness which I would expect from a rommate. My parents also don't want me to live at the far apartment complex because I may not have my car and don't want to walk long distances to class. It's also worth noting that all the friends living at this complex, I am the only non-nursing major. Whereas my roommates this year, who I'd like to live with next year, are all different majors.

I would appreciate some advice on how to handle this situation or tell me what you would do. Thanks guys.",29Oct2020,1
792,"Hi, everyone :) I (f20) have been having a bit of a hard time recently. I‚Äôm in college out of state and living in an apartment with some friends. 

Life right now just feels really hard and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm handling it very well. I‚Äôm taking 20 credits and working 25 hours a week, and when I have free time all I want to do is sleep, but then I feel lazy and stupid because all my other friends are able to handle stress without shutting down.

Because of this, I don‚Äôt really hang out with people, and I just constantly feel like the people around me are judging me for not doing enough. I‚Äôm embarrassed by how overwhelmed I always am, and don‚Äôt want to share how I‚Äôm feeling with my friends because I know a lot of them are just as stressed as me. I get good grades and can hold a job, but I‚Äôm always losing patience with people and some days don‚Äôt really interact with my roommates or family. It just constantly feels like people are judging me for not being good enough, or for being a bad person, and when i try to bring these feelings up to my parents they just tell me I‚Äôm not a bad person and then seem to get really annoyed with me when I tell them I never feel like I‚Äôll be good enough. 

My mom specifically seems to get mad at me because I spend a lot of time speaking up about what I feel is right, and when I tell her I‚Äôm overwhelmed she tells me that if I‚Äôm so overwhelmed I should stop trying to fix the world... that doesn‚Äôt seem fair to me though. As a young adult living in a f-ed up time, I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm supposed to just sit back and not even try to do anything. 

I also get really mad at adults when they use the fact that I‚Äôm young to give me work they don‚Äôt want to do, or not take me seriously because of my age. Sometimes it pisses me off to the point that I speak my mind and tell them why I don‚Äôt think their attitude towards me is fair. My mom says that‚Äôs just how life works and I have to get used to it, which makes me mad, and then I think I‚Äôm entitled for getting upset by this. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm a bad person in every aspect of my life and nothing I do is ever going to be good enough and I don‚Äôt know how to stop feeling this way. It‚Äôs like even when I feel like I‚Äôm finally on top of things, something sets me back and makes me burnout and then I feel awful and like I‚Äôm disappointing everyone by not being perfect. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can be a better person? I would really like to not always feel like a failure anymore.",29Oct2020,1

It‚Äôs something like this ‚ÄúDing Ding Ding Ding Ding DingDingDingDingDindindinindin.... then it just fades away. It‚Äôs only when I wear earbuds and it happens with any phone but only that specific ringtone. At first when the pace is slow, I think ‚Äúwho is texting so much?‚Äù And then it picks up the pace so this constant nonstop ringing. But it almost feels far away, and smothered as it gets farther.

794,"I am 19/F. I live with my grandparents, was raised and adopted by them bc parents are addicts. 

My best friend growing up has seemingly ditched me as we've grown older because things are going better for her. She doesn't talk to me as much anymore, and it kinda sucks. We both have crazy families, would refer to each other as family members, and would always say like ""Atleast we got each other."" She works at a hospital, has a bf, and lives with him. She was also given a car for her 18th birthday while I am still saving up and looking for one. She never comes to see me even. Or wants to do anything. Ignores me for days even. I get people grow apart, I feel like I'm just being left behind by her though and forgotten. 

Meanwhile I still live at home, work at a phone store, have no car, and college is still far off. I have enough money to get a car, I've just been struggling to actually go out and FIND a car because I have little help and when im not at home I am at work. I managed to meet a guy who actually manages the paint department at a dealership and he's agreed to help me look for one whenever I'm ready. I keep putting it off though because I just get nervous asking for help. I'm not used to it, am used to doing most things by myself.

796,"My wife and I live in an apartment, and the neighbor has lived next door to us for the 5 years we've lived here.  A few months ago, his wife left him and moved out.  We sorta knew about it, but ever talked to the guy outside of a hey.  Even one day I tried to talk to him and he just took off.

Fast forward to covid.. he comes out to the balcony and is always talking to us.. at first it was all okay and harmless.. bit weird still.. wondered why talk now but hey, maybe he's lonely since the wife left and can't visit friends, etc due to covid.  That was a couple months ago.   

Now I find that some things that my wife and I talk about, he will make a story out of it, and tell us about it.. 

for example :  my friends and I are planning a trip to the lake, of course my wife and I talking about going, etc.. he comes up with a story about going to ""John Lake"" which is the exact lake we're talking about.. another one.. my wife and I got a gift from a friend.. an instant pot.. the next day.. he says he'd love an instant pot.  another one, he talks about how great he is in this and that.. and i say to my wife, but he's a plumber.. surely if he's so great and smart, he could do more with his life.. so of course here comes a story about a colleague he works with.. and says oh he's just a plumber...

I was invited to go to a big university to a party with a friend. Thing is that, I live with my grandparents and so quarantining would be difficult/still be a risk of passing it over.

802,"Little context: I‚Äôm a lesbian who turned 23 last month in September. I‚Äôve never ever had any desire for kids in my entire life and I knew that if that even changed I‚Äôd adopt. Due to being intersex, my periods are utterly painful at the point I sometime faint and I bleed a massive amount, I can go through an entire box of tampon in two days. 

I‚Äôve been talking about getting Hysterectomy for 2-3 years now, and of course, my mother is entirely against it. She‚Äôs the typical ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll change your mind someday!‚Äù but I have a massive phobia of being pregnant and carrying a child. I have nightmares about it. I‚Äôm scared of carrying a child and giving birth and like I said I‚Äôd much rather adopt and give a family to a child that has none. 

She keeps telling me they won‚Äôt do it because I‚Äôm too young but my FtM ex had it around 18 and my FtM friend is getting it soon and he‚Äôs younger than me too. She quickly dismisses it because it‚Äôs about gender dysphoria but I also have it registered in my medical file. (I needed it to legally change my name)

The main reason I want to do it is because of my period. I‚Äôm currently on a third type of birth control because my body gets used to medicine too quickly and starts to reject it; same reason I had to switch my sleeping pills more than one. Despite being on birth control that is supposed to stop my periods I started them again and it‚Äôs like 2-3 a month for a day or two, just enough to be an inconvenience. I don‚Äôt want to keep switching for my whole life especially if I‚Äôm never going to have kids, on top of having low fertility due to being intersex. 

I‚Äôm calling my doctor on monday about the birth control issue and I plan on asking her about Hysterectomy too but my mother‚Äôs protests are getting to my head and now I‚Äôm scared to do it. I know 100% I want it but she‚Äôs putting up a wall and I‚Äôm scared to go over it to get the surgery.

I made the argument that for literally anything that required a photo ID, my student ID worked, and in the one situation it didn't, I used my immunization records, which I also offered. The woman then sarcastically asked if I ""had a picture on it?"" No, I don't, unfortunately.

So I found out a few days after her birthday that they started dating. They are happy with each other and want to see where it goes.I was WTFing out since they knew each other for 7 years. 
WHAT THE FUCK.
They are adamant about dating and actually admitted they were waiting for her to turn of age to date. 
Before I said anything, I just told them to let me process this before I beat them both up.
I have known the brother in law for 15 years, nice guy all around and never really dated much. He just kept telling me no one interested him when I asked him why he doesn‚Äôt have a girlfriend or even a boyfriend. He is smart and works hard. He doesn‚Äôt have bad habits if any kind except for the occasion binge gaming.
My younger sister is mature, and smart. She is nerdy just like him but she is very self conscious. She also is very manipulative and likes to get out older brother in trouble with our parents.
Our parents are old school and don‚Äôt care about the age limit. So WTF.
But they knew each other when she was 11 and he was 23. 
They would hang out a lot since she didn‚Äôt really have friends and he lived with us now and then due to his job.
If they were the same age I would be fine, but the fact that they are 12 years apart and knew each other since she was 11 is making me want to beat his ass and beat her ass.
Has he been grooming her for this moment? He doesn‚Äôt seem like the manipulative guy. But my little sister is manipulative as shit and lies a lot. Did she mind trick him?
I honestly can‚Äôt process all of this. Because he is a nice guy and I can‚Äôt even imagine him hurting her. She seems smart enough to know which guys are bad.
My entire family is mixed up. Some want to kill him and others says just to wait it out.

Meeting people has been tough and outside of my flatmates I probably knkw about 3 or 4 people enough to message them and start a conversation without it being weird. I dont know if I was being nieve thinking I would meet a whole load of people here or if the situation has just prevented me from doing so. 

I have also tried to be active within my course and the team im part of here too. I invited a lot of people to join my course chat and that is quite lively but when I asked if anybody wanted to go out on Friday there were no takers.

811,"I need help. Like, really bad. I posted here a while ago about how guilty I felt for getting help. Well, I still got it and got sent to a place near me that's inpatient. I stayed for a week.

The first day was actually really relaxing until my first meal. Breakfast was hard and so was lunch because for two years I've skipped Breakfast and Lunch and only eaten dinner and a few varied snacks throughout the day. So I wasn't used to eating that much.

The staff gave me anxiety after yelling at me to eat or I'd be kept here for longer, and instigated me by telling me I was childish and embarrassing because I didn't like my food touching. (I have severe OCD. It just helps me when I can separate my foods.)

After forcing myself to eat all my breakfast, which was a small omelette, two pieces of toast, a banana, a small carton of milk, and a glass of orange juice. (Remember I never ate anything for breakfast and now I felt sick from overeating. It hurt like hell.)

We were sent to our rooms for 30 minutes after dinner and the doors were cracked. We weren't allowed to leave our rooms during these times and if we needed something we were supposed to stick our thumbs out. (Though we would regularly be ignored completely on purpose.)

My roommate who I'll kill Onyx for privacy reasons, (Not real name.) was in the bathroom throwing up while I was curled up on my bed. Eventually he left the bathroom and I asked if he wanted me to get a staff since he was sick. He told me no and say he was just doing his routine.

Might I add this boy was maybe 20 pounds soaking wet. He was skin and bones. The definition of anorexia.
I didn't want to go out of my room to tell a staff he was hurting himself but they'd ignored my gesturing out the door and calling for them for 10 minutes and my roommate was getting annoyed so I stopped.

I asked him why he was doing that and he said to lose weight and I immediately gained interest.
I've been obsession with losing weight for the longest time as my parents regularly bully me for having a bit of a stomach.

I started purging with him in our 30 minutes of room time after all our meals every day I was there that week and I lost so much weight it was unbelievable.

But when I got home today I found all these sweet foods I hadn't eaten in so long and started to binge. I got so upset after eating a lot of pastries that I immediately purged and began the cycle all over again.

I feel like I'm dying and if I lose anymore weight my parents will notice. My mom got mad at me saying I was just making up more and more things wrong with me for attention and it was my choice to stop.
But it's not and it's hurting when I try to stop.

I picked up something bad from a mental institution? Where do I go to treat this? Someone please tell me what to do. I'm so lost right now.",29Oct2020,1

There are people who are new to this whole lonely situation due to the pandemic but welcome aboard, this has been my life since middle school. I‚Äôve had friends, but I felt lonely and now it‚Äôs even worse as I age. 

I‚Äôm always locked in my room doing either school work, watching random videos, playing games, Netflix, anime, repeat. It‚Äôs a damn cycle. The thing is I don‚Äôt mind being stuck in my room. I‚Äôm just that kind of person who loves and hates the loneliness and the boredness. But it‚Äôs getting to the point where I now find myself lashing out randomly at my parents or my sibling. Mostly just my family members and not my few friends. I‚Äôve had thoughts about people dying and not giving a damn about it because I know I‚Äôve become so emotionless. I find myself not caring if certain people close to me die and that scares me because I know when I was young, when I thought about that, I‚Äôd get sad instantly, but here I am, thinking how I wouldn‚Äôt care at all and continue doing my repeated activities. 

It‚Äôs selfish and I think all of this is affecting my mental health and causing me to become more selfish and also using this anger I didn‚Äôt know existed, onto my family members. I just want to know what I could do for myself to at least come out of this funk. I don‚Äôt want to rely on friends or a therapist or anyone besides myself because that‚Äôs putting my stupid issues onto them. People say to exercise. I would, but I just know if I started exercising, my family members would make a comment about how I‚Äôm doing something different, and I know I would be immediately pissed off at that because I just want to live my life without people noticing shit, but I think I‚Äôm going down my own hole too deep and I want to try to get out but idk how",29Oct2020,1
813,"A few months ago, my friend was very sick and not in the right state of mind, and made a TikTok account that we're now trying to delete as it has videos on it that she doesn't want on the internet. She can't remember the password or what email it was linked to- we've tried recovering the account by sending a code to all the emails she has but none of them end up being connected to this account. There isn't a phone number linked. 

What is the best course of action to take? Is there another way to access the account without knowing the email it's connected to? Could she email TikTok support and have them delete it for her?",29Oct2020,1
814,"Just curious. Since Kroger is everywhere, I was thinking about giving them a gift card to get baby stuff or food. He is one of my best friends and I feel horrible. But I'm also wondering if a gift card to get groceries may seem disingenuous or offensive? He's a person who doesn't openly show stress but I can read the signs of him being incredibly stressed out.

Do you think maybe instead of a Kroger gift card, maybe Amazon would be better? I know they do 1 hour deliveries in his area and he's trying to avoid going out as much as he can.

819,"I feel like I've missed out on the college experience. I lived alone in freshman year and met my boyfriend the very first day of college. I didn't make an effort to make friends, just had a handful of people I sat with in lectures. In sophomore year I lived in dorms and loved it but it was cut short by college closing in early March for the pandemic. My college won't be open for in person lectures until fall 2021. 

My boyfriend of 2 years wants to live together fall 2021. I realise that I've missed out on a lot of college and I want to live in dorms one last time. Adding to the issues is the fact we have been long distance for the last 8 months and will be *until fall 2021*, so 1.5 years long distance all together. We've had rough patches before and I feel resentment for some of the crap his untreated mental illness and baggage has put on me. I've cried with hurt and frustration many times. I don't know for sure if we'll be together this time next year, so signing a lease in spring for fall 2021 sounds like a terrible idea. I'm kinda hoping that us being in the same college city again in fall might make me fall again. My feelings have been fading for the last 3 months and I feel terrible about it. I yearn for how I used to feel. I keep getting thoughts of ""how do I know I wouldn't find someone who wouldn't burden me with issues that really need psychiatric help?"". I don't miss him much and I rarely want sex. I just feel so resentful over all the crap that's happened and I'm hoping a combination of time and seeing him regularly again might bring back the spark? The thoughts of leaving someone I'm so close to and walking away from the beautiful times we've had feels like betrayal

My dream has always been to become an actress, and create something that people can enjoy while providing a platform where I can be the voice to those who can‚Äôt have theirs heard. Sort of like Emma Watson, she‚Äôs been a long time idol of mine and her humanitarian work as well as her films have always inspired me to be just like her. I‚Äôm currently working on making this a reality, I was able to snag an opportunity to be an extra in a popular Netflix show filming in my area (though I haven‚Äôt actually been able to be in it yet cause there haven‚Äôt been any opportunities that I fit my description for). After I finish with this show I plan on signing with a talent agency (bc i‚Äôll have gained the bit of extra experience I needed) where I live and hopefully start to get more opportunities!

The thing is though, I have parents who are unsupportive of this dream of mine, they actively shut down any acting talk &amp; want me to stick with a degree and a university that isn‚Äôt my passion. This is my life though, and I want to start living it for ME. Not them. We all die in the end anyways, might as well make my tiny life worthwhile.

So my question is: what are some good resources and places to find connections that can help me gain experience and opportunities to pursue a career in the film/entertainment industry? I also wouldn‚Äôt mind working as crew such as stage manager, stage director, assistant director, even as a writer (which I love to write!) so on and so forth. I just know that this is the scene for me. I know I have the potential to make it big &amp; I know I was born to be an actress, to work in films‚Äîto do what I love. I‚Äôm just stuck and I‚Äôm so overwhelmed that I have no idea where to start!

Any help would be appreciated, thank you so so so so much &lt;3",29Oct2020,1
827,"So, whenever I need to rant about something a lot of times I post about it on my close friends story on insta. One day I posted a pretty ambiguous and vague rant and he replied to it and started making claims that it was about something that happened a long time ago. Essentially he just started making assumptions about it. I got pissed about this, especially since he has a history of being untrustworthy and fucking things up when he tries to get involved or help, so the fact that he was making these assumptions and shit pissed me off. I just told him he was making a bunch of assumptions and then removed him from my close friends viewer list cause I was just tired of his bs. Tbh i dont know why hes even on my close friends story, hes broken my trust like twice and every time he tries to help he screws something up and makes my life more complicated. Hes a good friend but...really not the best to talk to about personal stuff. That happened a while ago, last night I posted on my close friends story again and he messaged me saying something related to what I said on the story even tho he hadnt seen it. His gf is on my close friends list so I'm guessing she told him or sent him a screenshot of what I posted. So now he knew he wasnt on the list. He didnt say anything about it, but I noticed today that his account is now private (I dont think it was before) and I've been removed from his followers",29Oct2020,1

831,"I hate feeling this way. I used to have so much love for myself, but now I‚Äôm in a constant state of mental fog and anxiety. This has been going on for the past year. For the 3 years I was in college, I had a financial aid scholarship that required me to take a ton of credits per semester and maintain a certain GPA. That, combined with working a full time (40 hr) job, commuting to my college‚Äôs night classes (1 hour drive, 5 nights a week) and coming home every night @ 10-11 &amp; staying up til 2 AM studying/homework, for 3 years, basically destroyed my social life. It didn‚Äôt help that my family put immense pressure on me, constantly telling me I wasn‚Äôt doing enough and I always needed to be running 100%. And my friends were always giving me shit because I couldn‚Äôt go out, but I literally did not have the time. 

They‚Äôd call me a loser and tell me I‚Äôm an ‚Äúanti-social weird ass‚Äù. Some of them even ended up telling other people I knew that I thought I was above everyone else and that I only cared about myself, just because I couldn‚Äôt muster the time or energy to go out. Because I knew I‚Äôd have a 16 day the next day (work &amp; school combined). Also, I missed out on multiple great opportunities with girls because of my schedule. I just wouldn‚Äôt have been able to make enough time to commit to a relationship, which really had a negative effect on my mental state. I went through all of this day after day for 3 years. 

About a year ago, I finally reached my breaking point. I broke down into a depressive state. I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone ,outside of work and school, for about 3 months. The good relationships I still had began to suffer. I even met a girl during this time at my job and we really liked each other. But she didn‚Äôt work there long and I hesitated due to my lack of confidence. She‚Äôs gone now, and I‚Äôll probably never see her again. This was the death nail in my coffin when it came to my confidence and self worth. I was so disappointed in myself when this happened. 

Its gotten better since then, but I still never fully bounced back from this. This whole experience murdered my confidence and caused me to develop social anxiety. I used to be able to walk in and feel like I could own a room, but since I‚Äôve been out of the social loop for so long, I feel like I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. And I keep letting these good opportunities with girls pass me by. It‚Äôs almost like self-sabotage at this point. I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt feel normal and sure of myself. I‚Äôm disgusted with the fact I let myself get to this point. 

Can anyone give me legit advice on how to be confident in myself again? Is there any way I can get over this and just feel normal again?",29Oct2020,1
832,"Alt account here, since I'm probably the asshole. So, for some backstory, My wife and I were each other's first relationship, and we've been together since highschool. We've spent our entire adult lives together, and since neither of us are particularly great at making and maintaining friends, we've done just about everything together. That is until fairly recently. I'm a stay at home dad at the moment, while she is working, and has made some work friends. She goes out with these work friends to hang out and party and such. I know it's perfectly healthy for her to have friends and such, but I can't help feeling really upset and sad when she hangs out with them outside of work. Jealousy may be a component of it, but I think it's more complex than that. Best I can figure, it makes me feel... obsolete, for lack of a better word. For the first time in our adult lives--a decade or so at this point, she's having memorable life experiences that I'm excluded from. What's more, she has basically told me that she wouldn't want me to be a part of those, even if it was an option. I do get it on some level, but it still makes me feel hurt and like I've gone down in her priorities. Adding to this, I do find drinking especially distasteful, and especially with her strong family history of alcoholism, knowing that she's drinking just makes things worse. We've talked about this, and to her credit she has made an effort to put more attention into our relationship, but I still can't help the feelings I get when she goes out with her friends. I don't suspect her of cheating or anything like that, I trust her implicitly in that regard, but knowing her personality I strongly believe that if she was offered drugs she would accept, and that, moreso than alcohol, is something I don't want in my life. As I said, I understand on an intellectual level that it's perfectly normal and healthy for people to have friends and do things separate from their SOs, but considering that our formative years and entire adult lives were spent with each other, sharing nearly all of our experiences, I can't really accept it on an emotional level. I feel like she's becoming a different person and leaving me behind, and that fact is tearing me up. I've never had any issues with depression or anything like that, though what I'm feeling lately in regards to this might well fit the definition. I'm not sure specifically what kind of advice I'm looking for, and I think I largely wanted to vent, though if anyone does have anything helpful to say it would be very welcome.",29Oct2020,1

My mom is at a very high position in large international company with many sub companies. (She is basically royalty there, and if she wants something, she gets it with minimal hassle) I have shown interest in a few of the fields that she has control over, and she has offered to get me an internship there. 

I do not deserve the internship. I have done nothing to work for it, and I think it should go to someone who has worked for it. I also don't want my entire professional career to be built on something I didn't earn. 

My parents want me to take it, because it would be amazing for my career, but I'm unsure because my mom would have essentially bought me my career, and someone who worked hard wouldn't get the opportunity because I was there.

considering i've never lived with someone who wasn't family or a bf, i'm scared. what the hell do i do? what's weird and what's not? do i leave my door open if i'm open to hang out or do i just go to the living room? if i cook, do i just make him stuff too? or can i ask him to just cook a little more to share? i love baking but would get fat if i ate it all alone - is it weird to just give him some or could that look like an attempt to hit on him? how do you split groceries etc?

We have talked about it, we love each other so much, but sometimes I just get reminded. 
The guy told me, that she tried to touch his dick, but he pushed her hand away. She has never mentioned this, which makes me feel even worse.

I‚Äôve recently been completing a full stack web developer coding bootcamp. Although I am 1/3 of the way through the class &amp; have a decent grade, I truly hate it.

861,"I (F17) am in a family with my mom, her boyfriend, my brother (10), and then there is my father and step-mother. 
My parents divorced when I was 7, and after that I went completely downhill. I struggled through school, I was groomed online for 2 years when I was 10 until I was 12, hung around with some shitty people, and then finally started to pull myself back together when I was 14. I met some good friends, opened up a bit, got out into the world and tried my best to make ends meet with what I had.

I‚Äôve felt like I have been raising myself. My dad cheated on my mom back in the day, and then after that everyone‚Äôs mental health started going downhill, and 10 year old me took to the Internet for comfort and socialization. Nobody was watching out for me. I could not trust anyone. My mom has severe anxiety/paranoia to this day and has extreme bursts of anger. My dad has been pretty absent, and has been recently trying to reconnect, but I‚Äôve distanced myself from them for a long time, emotionally. I couldn‚Äôt deal with their problems on top of my own. I‚Äôve lived with them, but I don‚Äôt trust them. They keep me alive. We talk sometimes. But I hate spending time with them. Any more than one hour and I‚Äôm done for a week. When I do I feel trapped and isolated. They have very prominent mental health issues but refuse to get help because they claim there is nothing wrong with them. I love them, but being around them all the time is too much for me to deal with. This makes me feel like a bad daughter. My mom thinks that financially supporting me equates to having a perfect life. I‚Äôm thankful, but they are incredibly toxic to live with.

I‚Äôve started going downhill again and started getting therapy a few months ago. I practically had to beg my family because they didn‚Äôt see a point. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and severe anxiety. I am going on meds soon.

My younger brother has been going through a rough time in school, and I know my family doesn‚Äôt do much good for him, either. He has ADHD and had a bit too much exposure to the internet as a child as well, and he just doesn‚Äôt get along with other things. He says all kinds of nasty stuff and causes a lot of trouble. I try to help him out, but even then I find myself extending so much of my energy. This is what makes me feel the worst. I find myself unable to gain enough strength to be there for my brother when he needs the support and attention. Even being around him sometimes is too much for me. I need to be better to him and more present in his life but it takes so much out of me.

As a post requisite‚Äî they aren‚Äôt terrible. They have good days and bad ones. My mom is caring and funny despite her paranoia, my dad has been very kind and understanding despite his irresponsibility and immaturity. The main issue is that I‚Äôve spend so much time on my own and my mental health is so low that I am struggling to care for them as much as I should. Step parents aren‚Äôt really in the picture. My mom‚Äôs boyfriend is a complete ass so he‚Äôs lived here for 8 years and we have hardly spoken. That part is rough.

868,"So I have driven cars before I started to learn driving cars the proper way and had no problems. I even got complimented by most of my friends and family when I drove them. They always felt safe when I drove and I started driving at 15.


Last year I started lessons for my driving license, because I was planning a roadtrip and finally had reason to get a license. The keep the story from becoming a rant ill give you a brief overview.

-He would tell me the incorrect ways of doing stuff and in a later lesson tell me I was wrong for doing the stuff I learned from him.
-talk non stop about his slighty racy views about blm and white people
-critizing me and telling me I probably have adhd
-gaslighting me.


I basically got scammed and had no way to prove it. After I finished the lessons I cut ties with the guy and found out that this was a tactic some driving schools did to get students to take more lessons and pay more. 


 A month later I was at a friends birthday party and we went swimming near a lake. I jumped of a cliff into the water, but slipped and fell on my wrist and got a wrist fracture and it took me over 6 months to properly heal.



I recently healed and I wanted to start driving again, but the problem is that whenever I am with people I got overwhelmed with anxiety that I might f up. I completely lost my mojo and the only way for me to practice is with people, but people are the ones making anxious.


How do I drive a car without someone judging me? I know it sounds stupid, but I have this gut feeling that if I just drive alone for a few hours that I will regain my mojo and be able to drive with people again and get my license from a different instructor.

871,"Hi reddit, first of english is not my native language so i'll try to explain my situation the best i can and sorry in advance for any tipos.

For some context i am a college student in Argentina, i'm in my second year. when i started college in 2019 i move out of my native city, Mar del Plata, to buenos aires where my parent rent a bedroom in the house of a lady that one of my cousins recommended. the first year was pretty good both with my grades and mental health, if there was a long weekend i would take a bus to visit my family and then comeback.

But as we all know everything change when the covid 19 atack. Since the quarantine started i've stuck in Buenos Aires without being able to see my family, the lockdown didn't affected my parents jobs so i've been able to continuing college with no worries.

Now my problem is that in the beginning of the quarantine i was doing good, i enjoyed my online classes and felt more easy to keep up with homework. But as the year went on i felt more and more unmotivated to do anything, i barely leave my room now only to go to the bathroom and i haven take a showers in weeks i think, i spend either lying in my bed or sitting in my computer all day and my sleeping and eating schedules have become very random. I haven't change my clothes or clean my room in a while. All of this has affected my grades wich drop the last semester and i fail a lot of classes but was still able to do the ones of this semester because many weren't correlatives. when my mom ask me how i did that semester i got scare and told her that i did good because i was scared of disappointing her so nor she or my dad know about that or how i am doing mentally because everytime they ask me i told them that i am doing fine because i don't want to worry them. But this semester i did even worse than the last one because i don't even listen to my classes anymore, i just enter the class, mute it and then lay down i bed all day, maybe i can save a few but i know there is no way i can save them all.

I have decided that the best thing to do would be to retake the next year the classes that i failed this year, i know that my parents would support me in this but i am still scared of telling them that i failed my classes because i am scared to disappoint them and i am scared of telling them about my mental health because i am scared of worrying them.

So reddit, how should i explain all this to my parents so we can take the best course of actions?

TL'DR: because of quarantining i am enable to visiting my family in my native city while i study in the capital, because of this my mental health an grades drop and i fale may classes the last semester and will fail the current one, i have to tell my parents about this but i am scared of disappointing them and worrying them, how do i explain all this to them?",29Oct2020,1

I live in a run down, violence/drug filled town where most people live off of social security checks. I moved here about a year ago to attend college in this town. I was not careful when looking for apartments and ended up procrastinating up until a week before I needed to move back to college. I ended up taking the cheapest option on a not-so dangerous street. I didn‚Äôt realize I was moving next to the most disgusting woman on earth. 

When I first moved in I quickly learned that this woman had 3 kids. I could hear her kids screaming on the top of their lungs and bawling throughout the night. Some longer days I‚Äôd find myself awake around 1-2AM, and still hear her 3 year olds screaming and bawling. This was followed by the woman screaming back at them telling them to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù. This is a daily occurrence at this point. 

I also quickly realized that she had a 6 month old pitbull puppy, which she kept outside, chained up at all times of the day. Absolutely neglecting the poor dog. Sometimes for as long as 12 hours. Without food or water. This went on for about a month before I called animal services on her. Animal services took the puppy away and I haven‚Äôt seen them since. 

She then decided after she got her dog taken away, she would get a cat! I thought this animal was way better suited for her. I was wrong. Yesterday she threw her 6 month old kitten out the door, let it cry outside of her door and then threw away her litter box and food containers in her garbage can. She completely neglected the animal. It was also raining that night, due to rain the next day and then snow the day after that. Her kitten came meowing at my door in the rain after she was thrown out. I let her in and fed her and gave her water. I am now planning on taking her to this amazing shelter about an hour away who provide amazing care and do not euthanize their animals. I have adopted from this shelter before and their animals come and go quick, they do background checks, income checks and sometimes visit your home to see if it is suitable. (Just letting you guys know the kitten is in good hands now) 

I also discovered today that she threw all of her baby‚Äôs dirty diapers outside on the ground, next to her garbage can. And also had the audacity to put her overloading trash into my trash can. 

I can NOT stand this lady. She is the absolute WORST. All I hear is her kids screaming and crying, her threatening to beat someone‚Äôs ass over the phone and I literally see her neglecting and abandoning her animals. I literally want her gone.

My parents are extremely toxic. I was very heavily verbally/mentally abused as a child by them and moved out as soon as I got the chance. That was 10 years ago and since then we have only spoken/seen each other a handful of times. They even moved at one point and refused to tell me their address. I have tried to forgive and mend the relationship several time but they always push me away. They show absolutely no interest in my life and I have not heard from them since March of this year (after a 3 year hiatus). Even then, the only reason they reached out to me was because they stalked my Pinterest and suspected I was pregnant and wanted to know if I was hiding it from them. I have come to accept that my life is far less drama without them but I do have that weak spot that wishes I had loving parents in my life. 

My husband and I are trying to get pregnant. I know they will want to know but I honestly do not want them back in our lives. I feel like they will try to wiggle into our lives just to have a relationship with the child and with them usually comes some sort of drama.

I used to think I was completely straight, then I had a bad sexual experience with an ex and felt for sure that I was Asexual for a couple of months and now I think I might be Bi or Gay but Idk how to tell? I've never really had crushes on anyone and I don't really think of people as sexy or hot so wtf am I?

With this transition to thinking I might be gay, I have started wanting to express myself more but in a more feminine way, I've spent hours looking at girls clothes, not in a creepy way in a they are so cute I want them way if that makes sense, and now I kinda want to try crossdressing but definitely don't have the money to get anything nice.

Also while this is happening I've been searching for a job as my savings are quickly dwindling and I'll likely to not have money for food soonish, I could ask my parents or friends for money but I've always felt terrible asking anyone for money and honestly I'm more likely to go without food for a week before asking anyone.

##the relationship 
i (22F) was with my ex ""joe"" (23m) for about two years. generally, i felt that he did not respect me, and i tried expressing to joe that i felt we were incompatible many times. he refuted my claims and repeatedly would tell me how relationships require work, and that people are too quick to break up. that we could discuss and work through everything. often, after fights, he would think things over, and then eventually admit his wrongdoing and apologize. this was something i really appreciated about him, and i figured that because he was capable of that, he was right and we COULD make things work.¬†


it still felt like he didn't listen to or respect me. i am still coming to terms with the issues in the relationship and how i was manipulated. i am not free from fault. i should have stood up for myself more, and this is a lesson that has really been driven home to me in light of recent events.¬†

##the breakup 
2 months ago, he found a post i had made on reddit that i was planning to move out and break things off. i had been making an exit plan/had not told him that i wanted to break up bc i was worried about how he would react. after seeing the post, he said ""we should break up."" i downloaded tinder since i had mentally checked out a while ago, and i talked to and met a few guys, including ""bob"" (23m).¬†


joe tried to float the idea of giving things another chance, and this time he'd do anything it took to keep me happy. i couldn't help feeling resentful that he didn't step up until he really needed to, and i didn't feel like i could trust him to change for the long term. he said it wasn't fair for me to resent him for past transgressions. i asked over and over for space, and he dodged and deflected, saying that he didn't want to lose me.¬†


i told bob that i was giving joe another chance, and we maintained contact, mostly sending each other pictures of our respective cats and chatting about our days. i found bob endearing and felt really guilty for my feelings. several times, i made plans to move out, only for joe to find out and convince me, somehow, to stay. during this time, joe's car broke down, and he hesitated on selling it, but i told him that he should and we could use my car until he got enough money for a new one.¬†


i sought advice from reddit on this and another alt account, which has now been deleted. i know reddit often suggests breaking up, and so i took things with a grain of salt. i wanted an outside perspective, and multiple outside perspectives were telling me to leave. finally, i did.¬†¬†

##i moved out 
i called bob and he helped me move out. when joe finished work and exited the study on friday, oct 16th, he saw my packed bags and got upset. that everything was for nothing, that i was leaving him anyway. i reiterated that i wanted space, that we could remain friends, that we could try a relationship in the future given that we both change and mature. in his anger, he threw a plate and my jewelry box, breaking both. i was crying and asserted that i would call the police if he kept scaring me. he stopped and said that he would never hurt me.


joe said i was abandoning him and leaving him stranded because i ""told him"" to sell his car. he asked me to buy a new car for him, and to pay for the rest of my lease upfront. i agreed to the lease, and offered to loan him money for a car.¬†


when joe calmed down, he helped me move a few of the heavy items. bob came to help me, and joe refused to allow him to enter, so i brought boxes downstairs and to the porch, and bob moved the boxes to the u-haul that i rented.


i did not tell joe the address. i kept in touch with joe and clarified that i wanted things to be platonic only. i continued confiding in reddit, and people told me that i should stop helping joe and doing him favors. that our relationship was toxic and unhealthy. on friday, 10/23, i told joe that i did not feel comfortable loaning him so much money for a car, and that we should cut contact. he seemed to take it well.¬†

##the crime
that night, 3am on Saturday, i woke up to joe beating and choking bob. i felt helpless, begged him to stop, tried to pull him off. bob kicked joe off and yelled call the police. i reached for my phone, but joe kicked it away and held me by the ankle, preventing me from reaching it.¬†


some struggle followed, and then eventually bob got joe to start talking. joe said he couldnt live without me, and that he came that night to kill bob, kill me, and then kill himself. bob said that joe still could get out of this, and told joe to leave in bob's car (since joe didn't have a car. i dont know how he got there but i'm guessing a rideshare app). bob said that if joe left, we wouldn't tell the cops. and so joe left, and bob and i lived. i called 911 so bob could get medical attention, and the cops showed up too.¬†


they took pictures of the crime scene. i was questioned by detectives and eventually told them the truth. they began searching for joe. the weekend was spent in the hospital visiting bob (who sustained major injuries, but thankfully is expected to make a full recovery) and trying to hide my location, like living on the run, afraid of joe finding me again. on monday, the police confirmed that joe had committed suicide.¬†

##aftermath
joe was an aspiring streamer and his following had been steadily growing. i have appeared on his stream before and so his community is familiar with me. people who i have never really spoken to are now adding me as a friend and sending me messages of condolences and offering to listen or help. other streamers, his old friends, are doing remembrance streams and art.¬†


i want justice but don't know if it's wise or cruel. so many are saying that joe was such a good guy, he was selfless and always positive and so helpful. and he may have been those things to them, but joe put me and bob through hell. it feels like joe got the easy way out bc now everyone is mourning him, remembering him fondly, and fundraising for his funeral. the charges against him have been dropped.¬†


it's a complex thing. i don't want to completely demonize joe, but i want them to know that he wasn't as great as they think. that he didn't die from a tragic accident because ""2020 is so awful"" and ""the good die young,""¬†but that he chose to end his own life to escape the consequences of his crimes. i've met joe's parents as well, and they are obviously mourning the loss of their son. they insisted on knowing the truth, and so i told them and a few of joe's really close friends.¬†


so, should I reveal the ugly truth about a man already deceased to his loving and mourning community?¬†",29Oct2020,1

I think it's just a reaction of visceral incredulity, like I can't believe that someone would find me attractive, and furthermore don't trust them when they compliment me. I feel like a loser, because the idea of a relationship always sounds nice, but the moment someone propositions it, I feel uneasy and borderline disgusted by the prospect.

So, first of all, my older sister met up with her neighbour a couple days ago and ate dinner with him. They shared a fork. 

The problem is, my neighbour found out the next day that his best friend is confirmed to have covid. And my sisters neighbour met his friend before the dinner with my sister. So there is a realistic risk of my sister getting covid. 

Right after my sisters neighbour found out, he and my sister got tested. But the results still aren't there. 

Today, my older sister says to my parents that the tests turned out negative and invited them over, not wearing masks. 

After my younger sister and I found out, we confronred her to show us the negative results and if she even has the results or not. She didn't answer directly and after asking a couple of times me and my younger sister became infuriated: how can my older sister risk our parents?

When our parents found out, they sided with our sister believing we are crazy! It brought my mother to tears that we had a fight and she said that it was her responsibility to watch out for herself and that the risk meeting my sister is the same as her going to the super market.

I have a lot of resentment towards my mother because she's a self centered bitch who's a compulsive liar and will deny everything that makes her look bad to the grave. My heart constantly aches because my father has aspergers and my mother absolutely obliterates his emotions will insults like she does to me. I don't have any resentment towards my father because it's not his fault that he's emotionally absent. I have no guidance and stability in my life. I feel deeply affected in my heart and it doesn't help that my personality type is INFJ according to myers briggs which means i crave deep connections with people and don't even have literally 1 friend. I'm in undergrad school still because my life has been on pause for the past 12 years trying to be better by stopping my sexual addictions and other problems. My mother displays what's called the dark side of the ""mother complex"" which means when the father is absent, the mother craves emotional attention from then her children. I feel emotionally drained being around her. As much as I take responsibility for my life, she's a psycho and has neglected me in every way in my upbringing. I wish to move out but i have no income, no spouse, no job and I'm still trying to make the most of my life by pursing what I consider meaningful. Currently she's giving my poor father and I the silent treatment for days because I expressed that I don't condone her manipulative tactics and straight fake persona. What hurts is she's selfish and I care to have a relationship with her. I've been dealing with this monster for my entire life and since my teens I've tried to teach, help, her appropriate behavior but it's absolutely useless. I hate her for everything. She's an absolute monster and I feel like a failure because she has locked me in her house for many years and now when I can leave, I really can't as I can't support myself. Believe it or not, I miraculously have a self esteem and self worth but I have deep pain that i positively use to keep me humble in life. When she's away I feel better. Her entire aura reeks of darkness.

I don't know why the universe or god would allow a poor autistic man to be born to this demon and I come out of it.

Especially with something so personal, but im stuck and don't know what to do. Before the real story starts i feel like i have to give some context about my mother. My mother was adopted right at birth by my grandparents, they were beautiful people and loved her like her own. They were very poor when they chose to take her in because her real mother was... for lack of better words a harlot. this women ended up giving a number of children away to different family members and friends. My grandparents against all odds gave my mother a wonderful life full of amazing memories. My mother has told me stories of her child hood, basically growing up poor but still having every kids want and needs because of sacrifices her parents did for her. She loved them so much and they loved her. So many of her stories have made me cry seeing my mothers eyes light up at how vividly she remembers birthday parties and events that my grandparent made for her. im honestly doing her a disservice by not going into detail on some of her stories, but i feel this story is going to be long enough as is. To sum it up;  my mother says she's glad she was adopted because god blessed her with two perfect parents. But you can tell that she still hurt she was abandoned at birth.

My mother grew up carrying my grandparents values, and was extremely hard working and very kind. together with my grandpa; they managed to gathered enough money to move to the united states, and build a small home. During this time My mother met my dad. He was a bit of a ladies man, and not very emotionally available. not to mention he was physically and mentally abusive to her, despite all this they got married, had a kid (my brother), divorced, and finally married again in the span of about 10 years. she spent allot of time working until finally  my Father and her eventually saved up enough money to buy a home of their own not too far from my grandparent's home. together they had 2 more children, my older

fast forward Years later. My mother a married women, mother of 3. My brother (15ish) at the time, my sister (7ish), and myself (4ish)My grandpa was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer....he was a smoker.  When my grandfather was dying  my mother was there for everything, every appointment every chemo therapy, and basically took care of him until he passed. fast forward to about 3 years later; When my grandmother was dying of a brain aneurysm. And she basically did the same thing all over again.  Not to mention she was a rather heavy set women, my mother bathed and cared for her, and basically had to deal with a half sane person 24/7, since after a number of operations my grandmother wasn't left with allot of her brain function. she did this for years until my grandmother passed. losing both her parents and not having the healthiest relationship with her husband. My mother was left devastated. She spun into a deep dark depression where she even tried to kill herself. For a number of years she would keep to herself and i could hear her sob softly every night with no comfort from her husband, and no support from her children since we were too young to know. My older sister and older brother resented my mother for not being there for them because she was so busy tending to my grandparents who were dying. i also didn't get to spend much time with my mother, but even as a kid i understood what she was going through, sure i was disappointed she wouldn't be around much at home or school events but i never resented her for it. Years after this when my mother seemed to have moved on, she tried to pick up where she left off with us, but at this point since my brother was old enough to move out. He was gone and started his own family, leaving that fence never to be mended. She tried her best to be a good mother, she attended some school events and took us to swim classes and basically tried to cram years of lost time with us in as little as time possible. My sister however has always been a bit of a hot head so she could tell my mom was trying to catch up in being a parent. My sister didnt see this as redemption or a fix to the year lost. She saw this a fake or patronizing, and since then hasnt had a great relationship with my mom. My sister has gone as far as to call my mother a great daughter but an awful parent. i on the other hand was happy to just spend time with my mother.

Fast forward to now, my mother is in her mid 60's with early dementia. She has become from a quite meek women to a pugnacious no shit taker. A mix of abuse from her husband, being mentally unstable, and just being old and not caring anymore has made her very argumentative . for the better or worst, She no longer takes shit from my father (who by the way is a much better man now...still kind of a dick tho) or my sister. sometimes it feels nice to see her stand up for herself, but sometimes she goes overboard and just dies on every hill. Every possible fight or argument she goes into large rants and fights for hours if not days on the same tangents. She will take something as little as my dad going to the store for a bit too long, and go into a 3 day rant . where she fights and screams at everyone about how she hates him and resents him and his family for being so abusive. My dad is far from perfect and used to beat my mom and us. He's a changed man in the sense where after the first divorce he never laid a hand on my mom again. But the psychological abuse didn't stop. hes always been rude and short with everyone in the family. He's always belittled my mom in social situations or has always chosen his family (my grandparents on his side or his siblings) before any of us. To an extent i resent my father for what he put us through, and sometimes feel like he deserves it.. and sometimes i think the mental illness is making my mother overreact. Sometimes her points are valid and we hear her out but sometimes what shes fighting about makes no sense and its very hard to be patient with her. I should mention everyone in my family excluding myself are all pretty feisty. so when argument starts no one like to back down they all want to be right so desperately. So i have to play mediator in every fight to the point where every time someone is fighting about something they look for me to try and break it up after they argued for a good 30 minutes. this typically ends in everyone just silently avoiding each other for a few minutes. There are the times however, where my mother just loses it and there is no reasoning with her at that point, shes said some awful things to everyone. Things that are hard to carry with you and just can't forget... deep deep cuts and shes basically broken any chance of ever mending the bond between herself and my sister. i try my best to explain to my father and sister that shes sick and we have to be patient with her and not take things she says too seriously. Even though what she says hurts me too sometimes. But they think shes lying or using the mental illness as a crutch. My sister has told me to stop dealing with her and just send her  away to a nursing home since i still live at home basically taking care of both my parents. My father seconds that notion. and recently my brother has called me to tell me the same thing. i feel like things are slipping from my grasp and my family all wants one thing because its easier to just send her away than to deal with her. My mother though very pugnacious is still a loving caring women who worries for her children and loves us all, there is no questions behind that. but i can see that that love isnt shared back by the people around her. i refuse to be another person in my mothers life who abandons her; When she went above and beyond for her adoptive parents when the going got tough. i dont care how much trouble my mom is or becomes I want to be there for her like she was to my grandparents! But all my family doesn't see it like that. they see her as a burden. On the other hand After she fights with my sister or father she gets very ill, she has periods where shes just bedridden in the dark and just sobs to herself. Im afraid that all this fighting is killing her. All emotions detached maybe sending her to a medical facility away from the fighting where she will be attended by medical professionals will be better for her. But i feel like that would emotionally destroy her, make her think we dont care or we abandoned her. how would i know they if they are doing a good job of watching over her.. what if they abuse her. i cant even begin to imagine that. Not to mention i cant just ask her what she think or wants, because i dont  want her finding out the people around her are considering sending her away.

I dont know what to do Reddit, i need your help to plan my next steps carefully, i want to be there for my mother but i want to make sure my emotions arent getting in the way from doing whats right by her. i want to be there for her like she was for her parents, but i also want to make sure she lives the rest of her days happy. i dont want to be the reason she passes thinking no one around her loved her, and the ones who did are dead. what do i do?

923,"This is dumb and probably nobody will see this but  what is the quickest way I can make enough money to buy a laptop asap. Long story short my(25F)  best friend(27M) has been going through a lot. Basically the beginning of thia year he had his whole life planned out. He was studying german, was working a ridiculous amount to save up to go to germany (has always been his dream) and to be with his girlfriend of almost 2 years there where he was supposed to study there and work on his laptop. He had the funds, ambition, everything, he was supposed to leave in august but. Because of covid he lost his job, had to use all of his savings to stay afloat, barely has money for food even, and hes volunteering at a hostal for a place to live until his work reopens. His girlfriend a week ago broke up with him bc she said it was too hard not knowing what was going to happen in the future bc he cant just go bc now that he no longer has the funds. He got desperate enough that he made a gofundme but considering there are so many people in need right now, his was overlooked of course.

Today, he was volunteering painting at the hostal and some guys stole his laptop. He noticed immediately but it was already too late. Police said they cant do anything even with his photos.. He literally doesnt have anything anymore. Over the past few months I can just feel his depression coming back and getting worse. I'm really scared he might do something to harm himself. He says he wont but he wouldnt tell me. I lost my dad to depression and I dont want to lose him too. He is a brother to me and I care about him as if he were family. Hes the most amazing and supportive friend I could ask for. 

What can I do to help?  I dont have money myself.i will literally do anything except prostitution. I'd sell my xbox one but that's not enough for a laptop. I'd give him my laptop but mine was stolen in january (my fault. I left it at a homegoods store and realized 5 hours later). What could I do to get that money? Is there a page for odd jobs in Colombia. Man..

926,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j3l8ga/wibta\_for\_telling\_my\_housemate\_that\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j3l8ga/wibta_for_telling_my_housemate_that_his/) this is an update to this post but I didn't feel like it fit amita because, I firmly believe now that I am not but I really need advice on handling this situation. TL;DR: My (20f) and my So's (Do, 21m) new housemate (Tall, 20m), invited over his girlfriend (Jane, 21f) from across the country to stay over a week with little notice. She ended up staying over two weeks. She smoked $50 worth of weed, that was not hers (never replaced it, went and bought only herself more), she overran the washer, left all the lights on, left a mess in the house, she was a NIGHTMARE guest, basically. I was declared not the asshole for these reasons. People told me not to let her come back over as it was entirely disrespectful to us and our property, and a HUGE source of stress. 

So, to bring back some characters. Jane's family was paying her $500 a month to be a student full time, on top of her loans. Her family does not like Tall and despite her doing homework here while visiting, they cut off her funding. So, naturally we figured she wouldn't have the funds to visit for a long while, we can move out by then, not a problem. 

Well, Tall comes to us today. He wants to know if she can visit, get this, from the beginning of December to his birthday a week into January- 35 days! This is not fucking possible. There is no way she is going to be able to stay here a MONTH without a lease, assuming we even wanted her to (we don't, full stop). He asks Do, Do says no and lists the reasons why, when Tall simply is not understanding, Do says to ask me. Well, apparently, despite me listing off the messes she left, the fact that he didn't clean, the fact that she not only smoked all our weed but did it in the apt which was a HUGE rule we had discussed, he cannot understand why she can't stay here. He's promising to clean up after her, they won't smoke weed in the house, etc. But, he promised that before. He has proven that he has NO influence on her and it's actually the other way around, she influences him to not do chores, to partake in being loud, to smoke weed in the house, etc. I don't trust them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and get this. She wants to bring her two cats with her. We live in a 2. bedroom. apt. WITH A CAT. Our lease says specifically that we can only have one cat. I don't trust her to clean up after herself, let alone contain her cats to not rubbing their smell everywhere or shitting on the floors, and stressing my cat out. Even, just for a week (which is what he's trying to wear me down on, giving him a week to prove that she is okay to stay over). I tried to insist that she stay in a hotel room but he's says she cannot afford one. He isn't accepting my or Do's discomfort as an acceptable answer. I don't want there to be tension or fighting in the house. I really do not. But, I also, REALLY do not want to spend an already stressful time, stressing myself to bare bone about whether he and his girlfriend are toking it up in my apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. Do and I are going away the week of Christmas to see his mother. I'm afraid he's going to just invite her over for the week without our knowledge and bring her cats along anyways. How do I combat this? What can I say? How do I ensure at the end that he doesn't sneak her over for a week?",29Oct2020,1

935,"Okay, I have a feeling this is going to be a long one so please bear with me as I feel some context is needed.

I'm 24 and my partner is 25. We met when I was 19 and I moved across the country to be with him and we moved in together in 2016 when I was 20. The main reason I moved away was because I desperately wanted to move out of my parents home (they were great parents, just overbearing and I was waiting for a reason to leave). The first year we lived together was great, I went home regularly and I was at university and so was he, we had a lot of spare time to do fun things together, etc. He finished uni in 2017, I dropped out of my course due to MH reasons and I took a year out but continued to live with my boyfriend and our relationship was, and always has been great. Some stuff was going on back at home, my Mum left my Dad and he went a bit off the rails and did some crazy s\*\*t which lead to him losing his job - my anxiety became really intense at this point because he doesn't have any family, now my Mum left and he was on his own. My MH deteriorated even more, I was out of uni, wasn't able to make rent with my boyfriend only working part time and my health not being the best so I couldn't work. I told my boyfriend I wanted to leave the city we were in and move closer to home but he was still doing his Masters in the city so we couldn't but I asked him if we were able to move closer to home (our home towns are about 40 miles away from each other) so I had a support network around me. He wasn't keen on this idea and made me very aware of that, I felt like I wasn't being listened to and I could tell he didn't want to do it. So, it comes to the end of our tenancy and ultimately decided to move FURTHER North (about 40 miles) as we both knew people in the city. I was excited at first as I felt we both wouldn't be as isolated as we were. 

So, we are still living in a large city in the North of England, I started uni here and completed my second year earlier this year. I must say, my first year here wasn't great, I met one friend that I saw around once a month and then I met another girl who went on to be a good friend in the November and then there is a girl who I talk to here and there too. In Feb this year, I spoke to my boyfriend about still wanting to move home, I applied for a third year transfer back to a University closer to home and we were going to be moving to my boyfriends home town, where my boyfriends friends and family are and I can easily get home. My boyfriend, again, wasn't too happy about this but agreed and we signed a tenancy for a lovely terraced house, fast forward a few month and the UK is in complete lockdown, my boyfriend is going on about how we should stay up North but I begged him to apply for everything that he could so we could move because I was feeling so isolated up here but he didn't, he didn't put the effort in to applying for the jobs so we could move home and he hid behind the pandemic as the reason why he 'couldn't find a job' (he was and still is working from home so he could have just done that in the new city) so we had to scramble and try and find yet another tenancy here in this city and we made the wrong decision.  The area we live in is boring and a little bit sketchy but it was cheap as I'm struggling to find work alongside uni, there isn't even a pub here. Nothing.

Fast forward three months, I am miserable. I feel so isolated and lonely here, my friends don't want to do anything or they're still too worried to leave the house in the midst of the second wave. We went down to my boyfriends family home last week and I felt full of love, wholesome and surrounded by people who mean the world to me and then I had to come back to the loneliness of this city and the only face I see is my boyfriends, I miss my family and being able to do things with friends and I want to see my dad more and my Nan who has been self isolating since the beginning of March. I've told my boyfriend a million times about how I'm feeling but he just passes it off as the town we live in, or the house, or the pandemic but it isn't, it's living so far away from my support network, it's only seeing him day in day out, it's not being able to see my family, it's feeling as if I have no friends because I only speak to mine over social media, it's seeing my boyfriend meet up with his friends while I'm sat at home waiting for him to come back. I feel so resentful of him for not putting me first for once, like I've put him first for the last five years, it's him not being able to sacrifice living here when I want to move for my own sanity and mental wellbeing. He is an amazing boyfriend, we get on so well and I don't want it to seem as though I hate him because I don't but I'm fed up of putting my own feelings on the backburner or even him sweeping my feelings under the rug and blaming the way I'm feeling on everything other than the fact I don't want to live here anymore because he wants to kid himself into thinking we could possibly stay here. I'm doing University from home and it doesn't look as though he will be going back to the office any time soon as I just cannot fathom why he can't just do this for me. 

I'm in such a bad place mentally and it's almost as though my feelings don't matter and his feelings are always above my own when it comes to this thing because he doesn't want to move back to his home town or my home town. I'm just fed up.",29Oct2020,1
936,"Hey everyone,

I'm seeking a little bit of advice for my current situation. I have an ingrown toenail that is now untreatable without a doctor. The pain is worsening after stubbing it and I've been dealing with it for a long time. It's to the point where I can't exercise or walk without pain and is affecting my mental health. 

The issue is I have no insurance and no extra money to shell out to pay out of pockets. Podiatrists have turned me away (too expensive for me to afford right now) and the free clinic in my area is not seeing patients in person due to COVID (offering remote services only). An ER or urgent care visit will surely put me in debt and I'm afraid of that option. I am the only one working as my wife is a stay at home mom and I was laid off due to COVID (working now thankfully, but can't get insurance) and finances are tight enough as is.

Has anyone ever been in this situation or can recommend any advice? Makes me want to rip the whole nail and toe right off. Lol. Thanks in advance.",29Oct2020,1

940,"i don't know if im allowed to post rants on here without asking for any advice, so if im not, i apologise. but i really need somewhere to voice my thoughts and feelings at the moment.

first of all, im so fucking bored all the time. my daily routine has been the exact same for the past year of my life - i wake up, do school (im in college for music production), and then i just sit in my room and do basically nothing for the rest of the day until i go to bed. it's so boring and lonely. i want to make my daily routine a little more fun and exciting, but it's kind of hard to do that since i have barely any friends and i can't drive, nor do i have any money or a job (i applied for a job, but i still haven't heard anything back.) my constant boredom has just been making my depression much much worse, as i feel lonely and bored all the time and it reminds me of the fact that im broke, lonely, jobless, and unable to bring myself wherever i want without having to ask my mom or my best friend to drive me there. ive tried going for walks so i can at least get out of the house, but it gets boring so quickly because i have nobody to walk with and there's really nowhere to go. ive tried all the different routes and such, but it's still just so boring and lonely without anybody to walk with and nowhere to go. 

i also don't even have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, because every girl or boy that i try to talk to just ends up getting tired of me or finding me annoying, so that definitely adds to my loneliness. ive had one serious girlfriend in my whole entire life, but she broke up with me after putting me through emotional hell, which just added to my depression, so basically all i can do while im sitting in my room all day is think about her and miss her and wonder if she even regrets any of the things she's done to me, even though she has another boyfriend. i want love, but everybody finds me annoying and unattractive and insecure. i am annoying and unattractive and insecure, but i never let it get to me. it's something i try to keep to myself as much as i can.

i just want change - i want to not be bored all the time, i want to be happy and have a bunch of awesome friends and a girlfriend, i want to have money, i want to be able to drive, i want to have a life - but i don't have a life. im bored, lonely, broke, jobless, and i have a desperate want for love. im not trying to ask for advice, but if somebody wouldn't mind giving some or wouldn't mind messaging me and starting a friendship, i would really love that :( xx üíú",29Oct2020,1
941,"Around 2-3 months ago my roommates impulse bought this dog without talking to me and my other roommate first. She‚Äôs a cute dog but the responsibility required has truly been a nightmare. She‚Äôs more than likely ruined our security deposit from potty training. She for some reason will howl precisely at the time I‚Äôm trying to nap. I‚Äôve had to walk her most days because my roommates rarely walk her.

The worst part is that my roommates are leaving to go back home for winter break. They‚Äôre all flying and I‚Äôm the only one staying. I‚Äôm staying because I have a job here. I‚Äôll be working far more than full time every week over this break because I need to save up money for a big move next summer.

942,It's making me really uncomfortable and he refuses to tell me why he's keeping it.,29Oct2020,1
943,"First, I‚Äôm going to give some back story. 

We‚Äôve been friends for a number of years. She‚Äôs been someone that I got close to. She‚Äôs very sensitive so you have to be careful how you word things.

I once was talking about how I had a specific friend that only called me when he was upset. He never wanted to talk or hang out when he was happy. He just seemed to want me around to make him feel better and vent to me. She responds, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm like that do you???‚Äù

I‚Äôve just accepted that it‚Äôs a quirk she has and so be it. I can be understanding of that. So things were fine for a couple years.

Then one day we went out to eat and our waiter was training someone new. She was a little slow but it was like her 2nd day. Even if it wasn‚Äôt, things happen. No biggie.

My friend was super agitated. She couldn‚Äôt believe how long it took. Then she forgot her dessert to go. My friend was quite rude to the waiter over it. He clearly pissed but stayed calm and explained she was new and trying her best. I wanted to crawl under the table. 

I left them a large tip and tried to smile and show kindness. After that day, my opinion of her started to change. She was just being super negative about everything.

She had an instance where she got angry at her daughter for attending a party with Hispanic people. She ranted about them all being illegal and how she was going to get raped. She said her daughter called her racist and she said, ‚ÄúWell maybe I am but I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

She had a health scare with her son, her daughter was having issues, and she and her husband were not doing well. I chalked it up to that and tried to be understanding.

However, I‚Äôve been through some trauma and personal loss/issues and I have not treated people this way. But so be it. I‚Äôm not her nor am I in her shoes facing what she‚Äôs facing. 

These last 6 months she has posted some really negative political posts about democrats on Facebook. Some of these videos are used to create division. I commented on it and told her I was surprised she shared it just because of how decisive it is. I don‚Äôt care who you vote for but I don‚Äôt like hatefulness. 

I probably should of just talked to her but honestly I didn‚Äôt want to see her in person or talk on the phone. I was already to the point that spending time with her became something I dreaded.

There were a few other posts I asked questions about or asked her opinion. I wasn‚Äôt being angry. I was just asking questions and giving my view. She got super defensive and angry.

Tonight she made a post making fun of how some people talk. She wrote her post misspelling words and saying people need to learn to spell and use grammar.

People commented making fun of it and she stated she paid attention in school. Blah blah blah

So, I commented. I was not attacking her as she‚Äôs accused me of in the past. I explained that culturally some people speak in ways indicative of the people they are raised around.

I used my husband as an example.  His family is kinda.. eh... white trash. I‚Äôm sorry. They are. He used to say, ‚ÄúI done did‚Äù. He was an honor roll student and He‚Äôs an engineer. He still spoke like a hillbilly. He no longer speaks like that btw lol

I explain to her that people can go to school and learn
how to speak a certain way but due to the culture they are raised in they may speak different. 

I also provided a link to the history behind Ebonics and explained some theory on how different ways of speaking the same language came about. I was trying to show her how some things come to be. 

She responds with, ‚ÄúI was talking about white kids and adults and their posts on facebook‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt respond because I felt like what I said was valid but respectable. I didn‚Äôt want to be accused of attacking her.

She ended up deleting my comments entirely. I sent her a message and explained why I felt it wasn‚Äôt healthy for me to keep her on Facebook. I wasn‚Äôt trying to offend but I just wanted to give her a heads up. I told her some of her posts are very negative and racist. 

She told me she was going to do the same but didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings and was tired of being attacked. She sent a heart and she wished me the best. I said ‚Äúsame thing and take care‚Äù

Then she blocked me. I guess I should feel bad? But I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm really disappointed in her. I thought she was better than that.",29Oct2020,1
945,"I'll try keep this very short...

&amp;#x200B;

At my college we have been allowed to create a major work for our final assessment. I am 1st ADing where my friend is writing/directing and our other friend is producing.

&amp;#x200B;

The director and I are fairly closer - much closer than the producer and I. However, the director is closer to the producer then I am with the producer.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue lies here. As the 1st AD I've been going through my dedicated tasks - scheduling, call sheets, mitigating communication between HODs.

&amp;#x200B;

The producer had begun slowly handing off small 'producer' tasks for me to help out with. Considering it's a student film and the director is a good friend of mine, I of course said yes. Over the course of 2-3 weeks this has begun to build up where im now in the process of locating and recruiting Make-Up Artists, 2nd ACs, Gaffers/Best Boys, Composers, Art Dep. Assistants and - the biggest task of all - communication with our city council to finalise permits for our ONLY exterior that the director is happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been running around the city and back and forth between the school to get all of this done. Driving around helping build DIY rain machines, location scouts and phone calls to traffic and pedestrian controllers etc.

&amp;#x200B;

IN SHORT: I've been doing more than what a 1st AD should be doing.

&amp;#x200B;

MY QUESTION: Is it rude/necessary to ask or speak to the director (a friend) about potentially asking for a co-producer credit (or something along those lines) as well as my 1st AD credit? Or should I just leave it for the sake of peace?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this is an issue for me is because I truly believe in the script. He's an incredible storyteller and understands the craft in such a way that it's inspiring. I feel like i don't want to let this go only because I believe in him and this story - more so than I suspect the producer does.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really love some help with this predicament.

946,"I‚Äôm turning 19 in January. I was supposed to start college this past September but I deferred for a year because I wouldn‚Äôt do well online. I‚Äôve been planning to do 2 years of college, transfer to a university to do 2 more years and get a bachelor‚Äôs, and hopefully do the last year abroad in Ireland. I‚Äôve had this all mapped out for the past year or so and I‚Äôve been working towards it by saving every cent I have.

I‚Äôm not too torn up about the last few months of high school getting messed up. Yeah I missed prom and didn‚Äôt get to wear my dress, but whatever. I kinda hated HS and was stressed the whole time. They‚Äôre having a grad ceremony in June 2021 so at least there‚Äôs that.

However I‚Äôve been looking forward to college and moving out for years. I‚Äôm a very independent person and I can‚Äôt wait to be out of my parent‚Äôs house. (They‚Äôre not helicopter, just overly paranoid and overbearing.) I really only have one best friend here and I don‚Äôt hang out with anyone else. I got laid off in March and haven‚Äôt been able to find work since. I just want to get out of the middle of farm country Ontario and go to the city.

People are saying a vaccine for COVID could take years, and that we might be restricted/wearing masks for literally over half a decade if not more. I don‚Äôt mind wearing masks; it doesn‚Äôt interfere with me very much. But I‚Äôve been waiting for so long to be able to go out wherever I want, and to travel. The idea that that might not really be possible until I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs is terrifying. My whole life I‚Äôve been stuck in the same spot; I‚Äôve never been out of the country, barely even out of my province. 

People always say that your 20‚Äôs are the years where you go out and find yourself.

I reposting this because my last post was too vague. 

I am a 25 year old female. I acquired brain injury in a car accident when I was 18 months old. I have a lazy eye and an MRI that was done in 2008 says that there was brain atrophy. Comparing that MRI to recent MRI‚Äôs, the atrophy seems stable so far but my neurologist still wants to do annual MRI‚Äôs to monitor it.

I also have an official diagnoses of Turner Syndrome. I am either 4‚Äô10 or 4‚Äô9 and I was always grades behind in my Math class. I currently take hormonal replacement therapy because my estrogen levels are so low that I am premenopausal. 

I am also insomniac, do not smoke, drink, or drugs. I practically lived off of junk food until a August of this year. I am now taking steps to cut back on junk food. I have anxiety and I also take vitamin B-12 supplements.

Dementia does not run in my family but with my conditions, I am still worried that with my conditions, I will develop early onset dementia. And that is scary because I hear that early onset dementia can start in your 30‚Äôs.

I don‚Äôt know, if this is because of my anxiety or if this is a legit concern but either way.....I still could use some emotional support and potentially some advice.",29Oct2020,1
951,"This is something I‚Äôve been confused about for the past few weeks. I feel like I can‚Äôt really rely on my intuition about this because I fear I may be blowing things out of proportion. I‚Äôm not going to get into details but I just need some general advice on how to recognize certain behaviors.

Let‚Äôs say your parents are overall caring and good intentioned people. They tell you you are beautiful and smart and the greatest gift they ever received. They reach out to you and want to be a part of your life. They help you with things and give you meaningful advice like learning to love yourself or finances. You do fun activities with them like going on shopping sprees and watching movies together. They are affectionate to you and love you unconditionally.

However, there were many occasions where they have been dismissive of your struggles. They tell you you‚Äôre exaggerating most things. They often say you are lazy and ungrateful when you come to them with an emotional problem. They say you are too sensitive when they say a hurtful joke about you or when you tell them a past experience where you were hurt. If you are experiencing a problem, it is all in your control and you are simply just playing the victim. They have made you feel guilty and accused you of being selfish in certain situations when you had no intention of hurting anybody. You feel like you will never be able to get through to them and you feel like maybe you really are at fault.

953,"Backstory: I work in the healthcare industry and am on a team that reports directly to a boss; we‚Äôll call her A. 

I started at this job a few weeks ago and shortly after, another guy on my team was let go from the company - mainly because of the feedback that A gave him. 

I generally get a cold vibe from A and have had this impression since my initial interview. When my teammate (and quite frankly only friend at the place) was fired, a lot of people we‚Äôre upset including me... This did not help my ongoing impression of A.

Today: I get called in to talk to my bosses supervisor, we‚Äôll call her B. 

The issue was me implementing a certain protocol she did not agree with.

The thing was, A told me to do this EXACT thing that B was talking to me about ‚Äî not even a few days ago.

A was sitting in the room as B talked to me and I repeatedly said multiple times, ‚ÄúI was under the impression things are done THIS way....‚Äù without directly throwing A under the bus, hoping maybe she might tell B she was the one who told me to do this certain thing. I should note she didn‚Äôt just explicitly tell me, but demonstrated it herself as well. Words can be misconstrued but this was very clear.

I asked for clarification at least 3 times during the meeting, looking at A hoping she would admit to B that what she told me was wrong. 

She would hop in the conversation every now and again and reiterate what B was telling me, but never owned up to what she told me. I don‚Äôt know if she completely forgot what she told and showed me 3 days ago, but I kind of doubt it.

I didn‚Äôt stand up for myself because: I report directly to A, not B. And I saw how she made my friend‚Äôs life hell to the point where he was fired.
I really don‚Äôt want to lose this job or have a bad relationship with my boss, but I just feel frustrated about the situation.

What would you do if you were me?
