0,"Hello,

I think I have a problem. Unless I’m working I get extremely bored so I work a lot (60 hours a week) but when I can’t get overtime I get very bored. All I do is watch YouTube videos/twitch/Reddit and sometimes get food with my neighbor. But he’s kinda my only friend. I don’t work super close to my house, and many of the people I work with are older than me so while I’m friendly with them idk how good they would be as a friend. I’m in university now in the US but decided to go online this semester due to covid. Once that starts I’ll probably go down to 40 hours. What would you recommend to occupy myself? I love to travel and I do that as much as I can, but obviously it’s not an everyday thing. 

Thank you",08Aug2020,1
1,"Hi redditors,

Title is kind of self explainitory. I have to have a COVID test tomorrow. I need one in order to go back to school as planned, so I understand why I need to do it. However, I can't help being a bit nervous. I've seen footage of others getting the thing jammed up their nose and heard various accounts where some claiming it was quick and easy and others saying it hurt. I have to have it regardless, but I can't help but be nervous that it could hurt. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time 💜",08Aug2020,1
2,"hello. I’m 15 years old and at this point in my life I don’t know what to do. I’m going to have to start applying for university not too far from now and I don’t know what to do. My parents are conservative Asians and want me to be a doctor

My passions and aspirations currently are to inspire people. I want to become an actor or cartoonist. I wanna create or be apart of things that people will love and get inspired by. I live in the UK (a place where university is pretty cheap) I’m not sure if that’s good for my dreams but idk.

I need some advice",08Aug2020,1
3,"My ex (20M) and I (20F) hooked up after 6 months. I know this is a problem in and of itself but both of us have stayed celibate since the breakup, not intentionally. Well for me it was intentional since I do want him back but I don't think he was doing it intentionally lol I think he just hasnt been presented the opportunity. 

Anyways thats not my point. My point is that during sex I started bleeding slightly. I lost my virginity to him a year ago and there was no bleeding. He said its fine and its just because its been a while but something tells me thats not the case.

Should I be worried? I know I could go to the doctor but my family doctor doesn't respect boundaries and tells my mom everything, and if I tell my mom I have to go to a different doctor she'd ask me why and I would have to explain. Also I'm not a good liar and coming from a Christian background, premarital sex is not tolerated in my house.",08Aug2020,1
4,"Hello, I just finished highschool and I'm going to university in october, so now I've got to make some decisions. In the major I intend to go, there are two major universities, one closer to home (I would still need to catch a train tho) and another in a different part of the country, and I got good enough grades for both of them. Neither of them is bad, but the furhest one is better. My parents have been very supportive about this and told me to go for what I think it's best. Money isn't really a problem. So, I now have to decide if I'd rather go to an entirely new city and live by myself for the first time or stay home.
There are some days that I'm really looking forward to all the possibilities and feel like it's the right decision, but others I wonder if I'm not just complicating things. What do you think?",08Aug2020,1
5,"I myself struggle with self harm and mental health issues and I would never wish that on her. I know it's normal for kids to feel under the weather, but she has told me of how worthless she feels and how much she hates herself. I recently told my step mom about my own self harm issues it was one the hardest thing I have ever done, i don't think i have the heart tell her about her daughter. Luckily she's not self harming. There's a lot of reasons for her to feel this and i can't do anything since im a young teen. Any advice?",08Aug2020,1
6,"I (17m) have been smoking for a year and a half. Like everyone, started like a small party thing and became an addiction, only because it gives me that concentration I need when I study. I smoke around 7-8 cigs a day on average which is a lot I know and I am ashamed of. This year, I changed highschools and I stayed alone in another city, without my parents and smoking was the thing that gave me the motivation. Then came the quarantine and I actually quit for 2 months. 0 cigs. But then I started again (I didn't plan to stop, it was that I was more obligated to stop than that I wanted to and I am not ok with the idea of doing things only because you are obligated to do them, without my own will). Now, school should start soon and there is a high change it will be online. Which means I stay home. If that's the case, I will not smoke at all during the week days and I am sure I will lack productivity, which is important for my olympiads study.
Now, about my parents. My mom told me when I was like 14 that if I ever smoke I should tell her to smoke with her (she also smokes), with the idea that I would smoke less than alone. Hovewer, even when dad brings a beer she is upset. My dad would probably make fun of me for a while but then be okish with the idea.
What do you think? Also if the answer is yes, how should I tell them? I've never told anything this big to my parents and I don't know. Thank you!",08Aug2020,1
7,"Hello, I’ve been diagnosed with chlamydia about a month ago and I kinda wasted my medication to get rid of it. In between me taking my medication, I have had sex numerous times. I know I most likely still have it.

10,"I 25 yr old Male was offered a job at a place locally that provides health, vision and dental. Some of the problems we're encountering are the potential to lose coverage for medication, and state based SSI insurance that I've needed since I was 12 because of a perception Disorder. 

If I lose my access to my prescription medication I won't be able to sleep at night at all. Which i mean very literally. I also am able to have dental work done under certain circumstances. Once every three years I am also able to have my prescription glasses renewed with a new pair or different prescription. 

The state based coverage only allows me to make 1468 dollars a month in gross wages without losing coverage entirely.

State based insurance provided is Mainecare if that helps.",08Aug2020,1

15,"I’m 18 years old, I’m going to college in September, and my life is being completely ruined by anxiety. I don’t know how to cope.

I think it started when I was around 17. I always had anxiety before then but, that was when it started to get really bad. I had pretty bad acne which I went on this medicine called accutane for. It made my lips and face soooo dry. I couldn’t go into school because of how undeniably bad it was. My lips were red and chafed and were constantly bleeding. It was so embarrassing. I was depressed for a long time during that. Then I started noticing, my hair was thinning. That was the last straw, I stopped taking accutane. Since then, my hair has slowly gotten much much worse. My friends have told me that I look like an old man. It’s honestly so degrading. I’ve been off accutane for almost a year now, and I’m not seeing any regrowth at all. I’ve been taking this thing called Rogaine but, I’m also not sure if it’s even helping.

But that isn’t the point if this post. Because I’ve realised that if it isn’t my hairline, it would be something else. I go through every fucking day stressing about my hairline. Every day. Every time I watch anything, I always compare my hairline to the men on screen. When I was younger, hair wasn’t even a concern to me. I didn’t even notice it. Now it’s all I fucking think about. It plagues my mind. I want it to stop. I need it to stop. I don’t even care about my hair. I’m sick of it. I just want to be happy. I just want to be secure in myself. I want to be confident.

I don’t want to go to the doctors about this. Because all they’ll do is prescribe me with some pills and send me on my way. I don’t want to go to therapy and have some rich snob just nod their head. No. I need real, genuine advice from people who understand.",08Aug2020,1

19,"So here's the timeline:

- Early April 2020: Start interviewing for internships. Secure one.

- Late April 2020: Internships are cancelled. I postpone the applied project to fall.

- May 1 2020: Ask program director to set up a call to discuss alternative project ideas for fall. 

- June 1 2020: Start interviewing for intwrnsh again.

- June 26 2020: Land an internship.

- June 30 2020: Finish onboarding.

- July 1 2020: Reach out to program director with a secured internship and formal project interest statement.

- July 16th 2020: Try to follow up on July 1 email.

- July 30th 2020: Reach out to academic advisor.

August 3rd 2020: Reach out to program director again.

I have yet to get any feedback on my project.  I can't enroll until it's approved. I can't graduate without this class. I'm working 80 hours a week between my internship and my full time job. My dad lost his job last month. I don't had the fucking energy to chase a ghost in my emails.

Got a call from the University recruiting department today asking me why I haven't registered for classes. They said they have a way to escalate the issue if needed but I don't want to piss off the program director (who will be grading my applied project).

What do I do?",08Aug2020,1
20,"When I was 18, I went to uni for 1.5 years, I was in Arts and  I thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I was immature, didn't take anything seriously, was getting horrible grades and subsequently put on academic probation.. I dropped out shortly after that. 

I then decided to pursue a career in EMS, I graduated from a 9 month course and started working as a medic. Did that for about 2 years, but ended up really injuring my back and ultimately did not return. 

My mom then recommended for me to take dental assisting, I wasn't really sold on it, but after looking into it I decided to enrol myself into the program. It was only 1 year so I thought, why not. I graduated and have been working as a dental assistant ever since. 

Well, I hated it. I worked for 3 different clinics, and was treated like garbage by every single dentist. After speaking to other older dental assistants, they told me that this is just the way it is and that it is hard to find a dentist who is actually good to their assistants. My friends also had similar experiences and now have quit and decided to pursue different careers.

I am 24 years old, I quit my job 2 months ago and re-enrolled myself into university to complete and undergrad in Sciences. I love animals and I've always wanted to be a Veterinarian. I regret not going into it at the start, because part of me thought I was not smart enough but also I am glad I didn't because I was definitely not mature enough to make that kind of decision. Now I am older and I am sure that I want to get my Sciences degree. I graduated from my EMS and Dental Assisting program with honours, and it proved to me that I am actually smarter than I thought. 

My family all said the same thing when I told them I was going back to school to pursue Sciences and then Veterinary medicine ""how long is that going to take?"" I told them, I'll probably be 30 when I graduate from Veterinary school. Their response to that was super negative, implying that I'm going to be old.

So now, I am having second thoughts. Like, what am I doing? Is this the right choice? Should I just go into Dental hygiene, since I have a dental background and get it over with in 3 years instead of 6?

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. Am I too old? I don't know, I thought was sure of this decision but now I'm scared.",08Aug2020,1
21,"Okay, so, for some background, My mother had abandoned me and my sisters for around 4 months and went to live with the now ex-boyfriend in a completely different state that's way over 500 miles away from where we lived, and she didn't really have any intention of coming back. Even before that, she hadn't really been there for me and my sisters, and our father had passed about 7 or 8 years prior to this. She left us in a filthy, downright disgusting home without power, water, and barely any food. 3 of the months were in summer, so we couldn't get food from our schools or anything, and considering how young we were, we didn't know where else to go for food. Around the beginning of the school year, my friend, someone I often confided in, had told her mother about our situation and called the Department of Human Services, resulting in our mother losing custody of the three of us and her jobs.   


It's been a few years since then, and since we've been taken from her, she's been contacting us frequently, and all three of us still talked to her for a while, but a few months ago, she had become a bit manipulative. She was now practically homeless, (the house was sold about a week after DHS removed us, which was also around the time when she was notified about us being taken) she didn't have any way of making money, no one would hire her, and she didn't have anyone who could help her. Of course, we started to kind of feel bad, and I had started to blame myself for what had happened to her life, since I had been the one who told my friend about us, which had ultimately lead to all of this. My oldest sister allowed our mother to stay at her apartment until she found a job and got enough money to support herself again. A few months went by, she hadn't even been looking for a job, and she had just been asking us for money, saying it'd be for bus fare so she could get to interviews, and of course, we gave her as much as she asked for. We later found out that she had been using the money for literally everything but bus fare, and my siblings were pissed. All of my sisters have recently cut off all contact with her, the sister she was staying with has kicked her out, but I still keep in contact with her.  


I still love my mother despite all that she's done, but my sisters have been attempting to pressure me to stop speaking and associating with my mother, and say that I'm a dick for still contacting her despite the fact that she ""used"" us. That stuff doesn't really bother me, but I'm kind of conflicted. I do kind of want to stop speaking with her, because she's done some pretty fucked up shit to us that I'm leaving out of this post for personal reasons, but I'm afraid she might do something severe, as she's been diagnosed with depression and has attempted to commit.. *you know*, quite a few times. She's told me that I'm one of the only reasons she's still going, and that she's going to try to get help and get a job. She often calls and texts me during her emotional breakdowns, asking if I'm okay, if I still think of her as my mother, and if we can meet up. She's been really scared for me because I'm a poc in a state where police brutality has been happening, so she always wants to meet up to check in with me and my sisters to see if we're okay, but only I ever go to see her. She's been trying to better herself for the past few weeks so my sisters will talk to her again, but she's done this so many times before and she always gives up almost instantly... 

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really don't know what to do... Should I still talk to her, or should I stop? I hate that I have to go to reddit of all places for this, but whenever I bring this up to any of my ""friends"" they either say something like ""oof that sucks... idrk what 2 tell u man"" or just straight up leave me on read, not text me for the next few days, and then change the topic with a ""hey! sorry, i've been busy, wanna play \_?"".

22,"I've been married for almost 10 yrs to my wife, but we've been separated for most of it. We live in different states so I only come down for emergencies or to visit. Her kids were always an issue and that's why we separated. She's from the school of let's give them every and they'll behave (which doesn't work) and I'm more or less traditional. We're she just gives and gives I believe in working and earn what you get (with some exceptions).

 My step kids are loud and disrespectful. So much so she would often tell me how they would drive her to tears with their behavior. 2 of them are almost teenagers and her older 2 are teens and about to be grown. We've talked at length about what needs to change for me to come back and I feel lied too about everything. They aren't able to be disrespectful to me because I'm stern and don't allow it. I've always believed there is a way to talk to anyone other than yelling and throwing tantrums. I have gone off on them at times because of how the spoke and acted and the lies they often tell outside to other to get things.

Should I stop telling my friends not to hang out with a person who would violently bully me?

A few months ago I dropped a person who I thought I was friends with because he would say the most hurtful things to me. I am bipolar, just to get it out of the way, I have mood changes that are difficult to cope with and social anxiety. I should also admit that I am still a teenager and a female because apparently that matters.

let me explain the whole story first.

Bullies- Let's call them A and D

Random gamer the bully is friends with- AnimeGamer

Second ""Bully""- X

Friends- let's just call them friends

My closest friend- Z

(he is the one who was always there for me and I love him with all my heart. He is like a brother to me)

So this all started when all of my friends had gotten Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Seige. Now Some of my friends and D already owned the game. They urged me to buy it. Luckily it was on sale at the time. To be honest, I don't enjoy fps as much as I like playing RPG's or Visual Novels. Now I'm a big fan of fallout and COD WWII so I didn't think it would be that tough of a game. Now, this starts off as X and one of my friends teaching me the basics of the game. it was going smooth until I learned about multiplayer. I started having a panic attack because I hate the feeling of people spectating me in a video game unless its someone that I know. Now what I really hate is that none of my friends told me how toxic some of the people are in the game. The first time being in-game chat made me lose my mind, apparently being a girl playing video games is the worst possible thing in the world. I don't think i need to explain it. Now I also being a teenager and a stupid crybaby I couldn't control myself. My friends completely understood and they told me that they would never start a public match unless I gave them permission. Now A and D didn't do this and made me leave the game once they started a multiplayer round. A had also told me to stop playing fps and go back to playing RPG's. After this happened several times, D started telling me the stupid things girls always have to hear, ""Go back to the kitchen"" ""get on your knees"" ""make me a sandwich"" blah blah blah. I would sometime laugh at them because they never really hurt me until he started saying these things to one of my friends (Who is also a girl, but she also has severe anxiety) I told him to shut up until he started being extremely sexist and racist. I should also mention that there was this other gamer that A had invited. his username was along the lines of AnimeGamer with some numbers. What made me absolutely break it was when he told me he would find me and r\*\*e me. I was done with D and AnimeGamer. So I immediately blocked them. A, X, and one of my friends had a problem with this and didn't seem to care. I told them to f\*\*\* themselves and I am never unblocking them. Another day happened and X invited me and my (Girl) friend to a party. He then proceeded to tell me and my friend to ki\*\* ourselves and d\*e in a hole. Boop I blocked him. Now A had HATED me. He would bug me day after day after day after day to unblock all of them. I kept on telling him no because it was my choice. One of my friends told me to unblock them and just mute them when I'm in a party with them, problem is that I could never talk to my friends because they would talk to them instead of me. (another thing to bring up is that one of my friends continued to play with AnimeGamer even though I told him multiple times the things he had said to me) Now after all that had happened, I invited all of my friends to a party where we could just talk to each other and play Minecraft peacefully. A soon joins in. I'll just cut to the chase. I told him how annoying he is and ill block him if he doesn't stop bothering me. he then proceeded to text me an entire message about how I'm a sensitive little bitch and he doesn't care that there's something wrong with me. I started to have a panic attack and some of my friends who were in the party with me started saying things like ""Alex was talking behind your back to us too"" (he said things like ""op is ruining our friendship"" ""she is just sensitive"" ""she's faking this whole depressing thing"" etc.) That had completely broken me. I am grateful that they did tell me what he said about me though because that gave me another reason to block him. I sent him this really long message about how it is my choice and I don't want to be friends with him anymore. I wished him the best of luck. Now I am trying to teach myself to never hold a grudge and not to hate people, but it was so damn hard.

Now to present day, I feel much happier after blocking them. I can finally talk to my friends without feeling sad. Also, another note is that X had apologized to me and my friends about what he had said. he was going through some tough times back then and I accepted it.

it wasn't until yesterday that my friends had all gotten DBD. I also have it but it is only on my stepmom's ps4. I didn't really care that they had played it without me. Until A and D had texted them. I was in a party with my (girl) friend and she had told me very mean things that A and D have been saying to her. I told her to block them because of it, but she proceeded to tell me ""oh you'll just get used to it"" That was outrageous to hear. I told her fine and that it wasn't my problem if she was friends with them (In a good way?) She told me that she was going to play with them instead of me. Now just today I saw all of my friends in a party, including Z, playing with A and D. Now this had completely broken me, I just don't know what to do. I keep on asking them why their friends with them even though they had hurt me so much. They would never answer. I feel like such an asshole and so stupid for asking my friends these questions.

Should I be friends with these people that make me happy but continue to talk and play with a person who has told me multiple times to ki\*\* myself?",08Aug2020,1

29,"I am sorry this is too long, I feel I need to give context. 

I (32,F) met my boyfriend (33,M) through Twitch and video games 3 years ago. We are in a formal relationship for little more than two years. We are in a LDR, have good communication, talk everyday, watch movies together a lot, play video games together as well, etc.  We see each other between 6 or 9 times a year, but now with the pandemic we are trying to be responsible. Anyway..

The thing is, every time he sees me online playing without him, or when I go about my day with him and tell him I played ""x"" game, he is ALWAYS asking ""Who did you play with?"" or ""who are you going to play this game with?"".  Or when he sees  whoever on my social media, a friend or follower (I am a video game streamer and I have a solid fan base / community and friends) asking to play with me or referencing that they had a good time playing with me he always ask questions or throw ""jokes"" at me, like for example, we have our  ""dates"" on Sundays, his day off and my cheat day, and I mention ""I'm so excited for Sunday to watch movies with my guy (him) and eat something yummy"" he is like ""oh yeah, which of all your guys? A or B? (mentioning friends I play with casually). It sounds innocent and I used to laugh it off, but its been like this for quite some time and it started to kind of bother me a month ago, when...

I downloaded the COD app to track my stats and things. and one day I got a notification pop up that he was online playing. And I got that same notification of other people. Later that day when we talked I said ""oh how was COD? did you kill it!?"" being totally friendly and trying to start a conversation. It was just an innocent question, but he got all defensive and said ""How did you know I was playing?"" and me trying to be playful went ""Ohh If i tell you Id have to kill you haha"" and he got all paranoid and weird and I felt, idk, ""something"" a hunch.. That same night he was leaving for work and he told me to enter his account so I could download a game he bought (he shares his games with me) so I was like ok sure, I went into his account, and noticed he deleted a conversation with a female, which I saw weeks earlier and was nothing wrong. It was nothing just a ""hey do you have space in your team?"" and stuff like that. I saw nothing wrong. How I knew about that conversation? Two times I have gone into his messages because he has starred some cheesy messages between us and I like to see that, It makes me feel good. (the first time he asked me to go to his messages to retrieve a key). 

So obviously, I felt something wrong. Why would he delete something when he knew I was logging into the account? I felt so so bad, sad, disappointed. I am the most transparent with him as I can be. I consider myself a very open, honest and transparent person, and mature, I don't joke around or fool around. He as well can go into my account and I have thousands and thousands of messages and friend requests, some normal, innocent, others harassing, flirting or sexual (that I never ever respond to, this happens to everyone when you put yourself out there on the internet). I just ignore it. But is all there, in case he doubts of someone I play with he can feel reassured and see I do not hide stuff from him. It is not necessary and he didn't ask for it but I like to be an open book I have nothing to hide. I am lazy too about erasing every single thing. 

I didn't tell him anything as I didn't want to ruin his day at work (we both suffer from bad anxiety so I didn't want to give him a bad time, I how how bad it is. I suffer it myself I do not wish that on anyone even if I feel mad at them). But I did have an anxiety episode so I couldn't talk to him for two days. When we talked I asked him straight, ""Hey why did you delete this conversation?"" And he put this nervous laugh and said ""ah you saw that, yeah I didn't know if you were going to see it or not but I thought you were going to be upset and ask me about that if you saw it, I don't know I just felt I should have it removed""  I got so ANGRY listening at this. Because WHY THE FUCK do you have the right to ASK ME A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE EVERY FUCKING SINGLE DAY and you deleted that shit because you didn't want to be questioned? I do not have the same right? ! I don't fucking care if he plays with women or talks to them as long as of course he respects our relationship. I have NEVER made drama about something or anyone, asking a bunch of questions before, so I feel he has no right to be afraid to be questioned If i have NEVER done it before.. right? 

I trust him, he is a little more innocent than the guys his age, he is not flirty at all or has that personality, he is a good man, the conversation had nothing wrong, just a guy looking for a team to join. I told him, that I have seen that conversation a long time ago and I didn't ask about it because 1. I do not go watching his messages or snooping around, it was a one time thing. 2. I saw nothing wrong with it. How ever I felt pissed off that he is entitled to act like the fucking FBI when I play something but his selfish ass wouldn't want me to the same he does.  

I didn't talk to him for three days. When I feel disappointed or angry or sad. I just disappear. I wanted to cool off. When we talked again I told him, ""well I told you how this made me feel, and you told me that you messed up and apologized a hundred times. Its fine. But now I do not want to have your account, I am going to delete it, I do not want you to feel you have no privacy to the point you need to delete stuff, that sucks. So we are just gonna stop sharing our accounts please"" He insisted for days, that he didn't want that, that he buys all the games because he wants me to play them on my stream and support me that way etc, etc,  so he convinced me. We stayed that way. 

HOWEVER... 

He keeps asking me the same questions whenever I play, and do the same ""jokes"" and I didn't care before but now I can't help but think about this incident every time. Am I wrong? How can I let that thought go? Am I wrong that it pops in my head every time he asks something and It bothers me?

32,"Just some back ground information: I am a senior in college on the east coast and am currently looking for law schools in the west. My mom is a single parent (widow), only child, and never apologizes or admits when she’s wrong.  In the past couple years I have been fortunate enough to go visit other states in the west coast and each state I visited, I fell in love with. Since COVID started, being at home with not much to do helped me think more about my ultimate goals and dreams for my career and life overall. I realized that my dream is to be in the west with my boyfriend (21 M) in either Colorado, Utah, Oregon, or Washington.  My boyfriend will be going to a different school than me, but we’ll hopefully be in the same city. I believe that it would make more sense to go to law school in the state in which I will live in. So, fast forward to late June, I tried to nonchalantly bring up law school while also trying to include moving out further west. She immediately was shocked (understandable), but then looked almost disgusted? She then says she can’t picture me living there and other confusing excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. I just sat there and listened because I know it won’t take one day to get her to listen to me. I then start to look at what schools I’m interested in and what cities I want to live in. Thankfully, my boyfriend and I are in agreement with the same states so we’re excited. So, last week I tell my mom that now I’m really interested in moving to Colorado and going to law school there. Again, she just keeps saying negative things about Colorado and why I shouldn’t go. She then tells me that I am not “driven” enough, and at that point that just completely broke me inside. But again, I listen and ignore, but I am fuming yet crushed on the inside. A couple days pass and I start to give her an attitude (which I won’t deny, because I did) and she comes into my room and asks me why I’ve been rude. I told her how much her words hurt me and how she could say something like that to her own daughter.  At this point i’m scream crying at her and telling her how hard I have been studying for the LSATs and looking up information about the school, the cities near it, etc. I ask her why it is so hard for her to just accept that I am an adult and at some point I have to do what’s best for me. She then tells me that it’s hard for her to accept me leaving, but she knows at some point she has to. I understand it’s hard for her, but being in my house for too long with her makes me depressed. Thankfully, her mother aka my grandmother, lives with us and we both complain about my mom.  So, two days ago I visited her at her job and we went to lunch together.  She brings up law school and asks me who else is coming with me. I never had the opportunity to tell her that my boyfriend is coming because she would immediately shut the idea down so why is it worth it to bring up anyways. I decided to take a shot and ask if we could live together since I won’t know anybody else there and feel most comfortable with him especially when it comes to my first year of law school. Understandably and not surprisingly, she said no and I never brought it up again.  Yesterday, we went out to lunch again (we lost power since Tuesday) and she then starts asking me so many questions about my boyfriend and why he wants to move there too and all this other bs. I told her that it’s not her problem because she is not his mother. She didn’t like that response and she then got so angry out of nowhere and called me a liar because I never told her about my boyfriend wanting to move with me. She said that I wasn’t “woman enough” to tell her, but she never gave me the chance to. And to top it all off I have to stay home for the semester because my school went online. I just really need advice on how to talk to my mom and tell her that this is my life without her getting mad and having tension for the rest of the year.",08Aug2020,1
33,"Hi! I’ve been looking for someone to talk to. Someone who doesn’t know me personally. I’ve just been going through a lot lately at work. I work at a boys and girls club in my town. I’m the Administrative Assistant there. One of my best friends is Pam. This guy at my work, Emilio, likes her a lot but she doesn’t like him. There’s a guy there and his name is Landon. He’s really sweet but he’s also really lazy. He’s made me a few art projects and I hang them up in my office. He trust falls on me a lot( to which I always catch him). He pokes me and hangs out in my office. Overall, he seems to get close to me a lot. For most of the summer, I’ve been the one in charge because one of my bosses got COVID and was out for a few weeks. My other boss doesn’t really deal with the staff. Since my other boss has come back, he’s gotten a little more distant. I still talk to him but he acts weird. I was in the art room today and he asked me if Pam was talking to anyone. I knew instantly that Emilio wanted to know. So I told him that I didn’t know. After a while, I told him “Emilio wants to know, doesn’t he?” And he’s like “Yeah. Idk dude it feels like I’m in a movie. He wants me to find out all this stuff and I’m honestly starting to like her”. It broke my heart. And the thing is, I know there was no future there. He’s lazy and unmotivated and a pothead. But why does it still hurt me? He made me feel like I was liked. I have low self esteem and it really hurts. I had told my friend who doesn’t work there and she thinks he might be trying to make me jealous. There’s a small party Emilio is hosting tomorrow and he makes these comments like “Are you going to hang out with me tomorrow?” What am I supposed to make out of that?

It’s not a place I’m particularly excited to work at but hey I’ve worked at pizza places before so it’s nothing too new. They wanted to hire me right away but I asked them for a few days to think about it and they agreed. 
There are other jobs I would rather work but I don’t know if they will reply anytime soon. This pizza place is barely opening so I think it would be fairly easy to promote because there is no one ahead of me. 
One of the issues is that I have a hard timing understanding what they are saying because of different accents and they have said things that make me believe they won’t follow mu schedule. I’m going to college in August so every place I interview at I tell them I might have to change my schedule early on and they have been fine with it. This place seemed fine but when I mention I want to work part time they sorta kept on pushing that away and saying I could work 40+ hours a week...... I have to let them know soon what to do.... that’s where I need y’all’s advice.

Pros to pizza job 
- already know the position 
- Payed higher than the minimum wage 
- Don’t have to worry about not getting a job

- might expect more hours than I can give 
- Could be a short lived job.

40," My best friend is also my roommate. He is about to start his final year of education (I’m working full time) I am worried that once he finishes, he is going to be burnt out or have some sort of mental break.

He is a workaholic, always has been. His degree takes 6 years to complete and he has taken the place of top of his class in the best university for his subject, I am incredibly proud of him. All he ever does is work for his degree though. After classes he comes home at about 6pm and will easily study till about 10pm, sometimes later and full time every weekend as well. He has no hobbies or interests outside of studying.

He does a few good friends that he hangs around with, but they are all planning on moving to the opposite side of the country when they finish. From what I can tell its just going to be me and him next year. He has a good job lined up here after graduation, so we are going to continue living with each other.

I don’t think he realises how different studying is to working full time. I hope I’m wrong and he manages fine but I am worried that he will have nothing to fall back on, even if it is a crappy tv show that he enjoys.

Is there anything I can do to help him beforehand or is it even my place to do something about it?",08Aug2020,1

43,"For the first time in my nearly 20 years of existence I'm going to cut someone out of my life. For my whole life I've either kept friendships or they just gradually drifted away. I've never actively cut someone off. I met this kid my junior year of high school and we started talking basketball and to this day that's a large percentage of what we talk about. But holy shit when I debate this kid it's like debating a plastic straw. He refuses to acknowledge that he's ever wrong. And he usually makes very hypocritical points. Recently these debates have started to be less about sports and more about real shit (animal rights, politics, etc) and he's the exact same in these debates. Refuses to admit he's wrong/look at another perspective.

Whenever I debate him, I get very irritated and usually resort to very vulgar name calling because while I try to listen to his perspective, he never tries to listen to mine and I get very annoyed. It's toxic and I'm done putting up with it because I don't like the person I am after those debates because I usually say at least one thing that makes me go ""yeah my mom would probably yell at me for being this much of an ass"".

So how should I go about this? I was considering texting him (I'm not doing it in person bc he lives like 30 minutes away) saying ""hey, I feel our debates are making me toxic.

I had such good vibes and she even trusted me enough to book her hotel for us (IE give me the money before hand). During our convo she told me she enjoyed strawberries so I went out on got a box of chocolate covered strawberries as a gift. We had both discussed that we didn't want this to be a one night stand, more of a FWB I had mentioned that I thought she was a cool person and I felt like we both actually liked each other so I was curious if she was totally against any potential relationships and she said she wasn't sure and I was like no worries was just curious. Anyways show up at the hotel get the room for us, wait for her to arrive. She gets there everything seems great having good convo hugging, I give her the strawberries. I'm feeling really positive and then out of nowhere she says she's not sure she want's to have sex anymore. I said okay any reason why, she says she's unsure. So I ask if I should leave, keep in mind we were at this point cuddling on the couch in the room. She says no don't leave, and she explains she has feelings for this person who burned her pretty badly six months ago and that she's out of nowhere is feeling like a hoe. Honestly in my head at this point I'm wondering what went wrong or if that's even the truth, I explain to her that I don't put sex on a pedestal and I don't think of her that way and that we both agreed this was supposed to be just a casual thing. We begin talking about I ask he why it's making her feel this way etc. I ask again if she wants me to leave she once again says no, she then says that she also partly feels like I'm giving off a vibe that this isn't just casual and I explain to her that just because I like her and I'm interested in her as a person doesn't mean I had higher expectations than this being casual if happened great if not no worries. The conversation continues and she asks if we can just not do anything tonight, at this point I'm so confused and feeling kind of hurt and I explain like we kind of had a game plan about how things were going to go tonight and then you kind of dropped this big awkward bomb on me, like you absolutely have the right to say no but that was something I was expecting and excited for (white knights please don't crucify me). The conversation starts to get a bit heated because at this point I'm upset at the situation and I just kind of want to leave and I feel like everything I'm saying is making the situation worse and nothing is going to save it or change her mind. She then says she knows it's her fault and I'm justified in the way I feel but she says she would be interested in being friends and would like to hang out when she gets back in 10 days from her trip. I bluntly tell her you travel a lot and I'm not sure that I'm not sure we have enough in common to forge a strong friendship with you not being here on top of which I would still be sexually interested in you and it would be difficult for me to suppress those feelings. She seemed confused by this and didn't understand what I meant and why it was a bad thing to make a new friend, and that sometimes a friend can become sexually interested. I told her I have a hand full of really close friends and if we don't things often those friendships typically end up fizzling for me, and honestly most of my friendships with girls don't bloom into those types of feelings later on it's probably something with me but it just doesn't happen. I said I guess we could try but I don't want to play around with your emotions like the guy who did six months ago I'd rather be blunt than hurt you because I do like you. We're both pretty upset at this point and I decide that I've had enough at this point and I want to leave. She's sitting on the bed and before I leave I crouch down hold her hands and I explain I know I'm being kind of big jerk and I wish this went a lot better, I know I should've just left instead of trying to fix or talk about it but I was just upset, you're a beautiful girl sincerely one of the prettiest girls I would've ever had the good fortune to be with and I enjoy talking to you and I'm willing to try if you want to, I have trust issues so it's hard for me to believe that you'll want to come back and hang out with me after we had such a bad interaction but I'm willing to try. She says thank you that the apology was nice and that the guy who played with her heart never even called her beautiful. We both stand up hug each other and we kiss each other and I say goodbye.

She's now going to be gone for 10 days in a different state, and I'm not honestly sure how to feel I know I wasn't the best but I feel like my trust with her is waning and I don't know if she's going to lament over things or get more in her head about it. I'm not really sure what to do I didn't handle the situation perfectly but for me I feel like for me it was the best that I could do at the time. If she comes back and does want to see me again should I give her a chance or should I just chalk this up as an unfortunate failure? I'm just really confused on my feelings with this. Ideally she'd comeback we hang out and then start seeing each other but I don't know if that's too optimistic. I wouldn't care if I didn't like her but gosh it's just really playing with my mind. I don't know if she was telling me the truth, or if it was really something to do with me, she said she hadn't seen anyone for six months, but who know she could hook up with some people while she's back home. Honestly the whole thing is giving really bad anxiety at this point.

For context I've been more depressed than I was ever before for the past year while at a new job where I make a bunch of money as a software engineer.

I'm absolutely exhausted. The pressure at work is constant and I have all this other stuff going on in life (just normal stuff like moving, trying to find friends, etc.) that there's no time for anything. I've been depressed this past year while working at a high pressure company as a software engineer. It sucks but I make so much money and I think at this point if I quit then I will also just be really depressed at another dev job.

I recently bought a van as a sort of ""well if I get fired or quit from depression then at least I could live in this, and travel to some national parks"" and then three days later the van was stolen. It was a brand new van, so now I have an expensive loan and no vehicle. The cops says there's a decent chance they recover it, and that will change everything for the better for me if they do.

I just can't imagine myself happy in my line of work. I've realized this past year that I can eek out a non-depressed lifestyle if I socialize and go for a 2 hour walk once a day. So socializing and exercise make me happier, and my job is exactly the opposite of that, sitting alone on a computer all day. I've learned that I'm really good at pushing through the pain and sticking with it... it's been tough but I've stuck it out. If I had that damn van I'd probably just quit at this point and go f*ck off and wait for quarantine to end so I have more options I dunno. I'm in a high risk group so I'm concerned if I just go get a regular job like bagging groceries then I'll get sick and die.

I guess most developers don't feel like this. They go to work, bang out 8 hours, go home, bang their wife or husband, put their kids to bed, and do the whole thing over again. To me, and maybe it's because I'm depressed, but that whole thing sounds boring as hell. Even if I weren't depressed it just doesn't sound *exciting* or at all fulfilling. I guess there's remote work and /r/digitalnomad but it seems like moving all the time requires constant effort which just increases the amount of stress because of having more stuff to do (like pack, and find a dry cleaner, and find out where to live, etc.) But yeah remote work might be less boring I guess.

I also feel like I may get fired and it's hard for me to give a shit any more. It really is just hard. I hope they just find that damn van so if I do get fired I have a place to sleep.",08Aug2020,1
51,"Long story short, I’m a 32 year old female and have never really had a great relationship with my mom. She was always obsessive and borderline creepy when I was younger. When I have opened up to her about things like my relationship issues, she went behind my back and contacted my ex’s mother to tell her how terrible my ex was treating me. This may sound like it happened in middle school, but it was just 2 years ago when I was 30 years old. She is also pretty toxic. If she perceives someone is being critical of her, she says she should just kill herself. She is negative, racist, homophobic, extremely judgmental of anyone not like her, and treats my dad like crap.

So, I just really don’t want a close relationship with her. I have nothing to say to her so I don’t text or call much but still do reach out on occasion. But then she sends me texts like “why don’t you ever call me?” or “you only call me when you need something” (which is NOT true). And if I don’t answer right away she sends “helllooooooooooooo”. This behavior pushes me away even further and I don’t want to respond to her at all.

I feel bad because she supported me my whole life and in a sense feel like I owe her something. Am I being a terrible daughter? How do I handle this?",08Aug2020,1

So I am studying Performing Arts and I have since I was a kid. But a constant theme I’ve had is that I always cringe in the moment: whether this is performing or watching myself back (I physically can’t bring myself to watch my previous performances) 

But when I think about doing the performances I don’t think about cringe or anything I’m very positive about everything until I’m doing it. 

This must also feed into my confidence issues and anxiety( im on medication for that but it doesn’t seem to help?)

I love what I do and musical theatre is my passion and I really don’t want to let my cringing get in the way of this. Does anyone have any advice for how I can feel comfortable with doing the things I do?

57,"To start off, I have lost quite a few friends to different situations whether it be drugs, physical illnesses and unfortunately homicide/ murder. To conceal identity, I will call her Jane. Jane recently within the last month suffered a mental breakdown/ very seemingly psychosis/ episode. She was known for suffering from bipolar episodes as a teenager and has a rooted history in being religious as well as the rest of her family (non denominational). Jane suffered her episode and they quickly checked her into a mental institution for evaluation and treatment. apparently treatment was not going as planned and Jane either wasn't receiving the care and treatment she needed or she wasn't responding well to it. Jane was then checked out by her husband and taken to several states over to go live with her parents. This morning I was notified that Jane had found her fathers gun, cut the lock to the case and ended her life this way. She believed she was being possessed by a demon, she was afraid she was going to kill her children because of this demon supposedly possessing her (she leaves behind a few daughters) as this all has happened so abruptly, and with my lack of knowledge in the religious department- I grew up not going to church or believing in MOST organized religions, as i've never seen their communities growing up in the bible belt to be altruistic or pleasurable/kind. I just feel like religion is bullshit essentially but I digress because I'm trying to keep an open mind. However, despite that... I want to offer support and say the right things and be informed. I'm at a loss of words and feel angry FOR her that she suffered so much and that her mental illness had taken over and she ultimately felt there was no way out. I am someone who has personally experienced mental breakdowns for my own different reasons (panic disorders/ depression/ and paranoia ), I understand how it feels being in a mental institution, feeling hopelessness, having suicidal tendencies and feeling like every system is against you and that there is no way out of it. but as for the portion of the demon possessed part, i just don't get it. I'm currently attempting to do my research and read some articles in order to further understand. thank you for reading, it has been an emotional day for my parents and their neighbor/ family. They were close to my parents so I'm trying to make an effort to show my support. Has anyone known or experienced anything like this?",08Aug2020,1
58,"So I’ve known this guy ever since 5th grade, which was a total of 7 1/2 years. Everything was fine and dandy, we’d stay up talking and playing games for years to come and we know every weird quirk about each other. It wasn’t until around 11th grade, he asked me out, sure I’ve flirted with him here and there a bit but our mutual friend kinda pushed us to be a thing. One and a half years later into the relationship, I was sick of the relationship and filled with dread, he didn’t treat me right, he never listened to me, he’d never give me affection at all unless he was leaving, and he’d go hang out with other people after we’d make plans to hang out, essentially just dropping me. I felt like this ever since our one year anniversary, it just felt like everything was going down hill, so I finally ripped of the bandage and broke up with him. Let’s just say he didn’t take it smoothly, meanwhile I was happy as ever. 

Now you may be asking, “So what’s the advice you’re looking for?” Well, I certainly don’t wanna go back to that hellhole of a relationship, I found someone who treats me with all the love and compassion I could ever want. I don’t miss him one bit... on a relationship level, I just kinda miss the good ol’ days of us being absolute idiots together, so I guess the advice I’m looking for is, how do I go back to that, or is there even a way to go back or fill that weird-wacked up crackhead vibe I miss?",08Aug2020,1
59,"So I am in a pretty serious relation that has been going on for about 3 years. I think for the most part we really hit it off. We enjoy each others company, have a lovely dog together, and have tried to motivate each other to be our best while we've been together.

I have never been in even a good relationship, so I am still trying to find out what is healthy and what my boundaries are. And thats where I need advice. 

I am not physically affectionate, at least in a sexual way. Having been in circumstances that have left me uncomfortable with sex and not having a real interest or passion for sex, has left us both feeling very awkward a lot of the time. He is a very sexual person. He loves it. And most of the time I feel like I am filling an obligation rather than investing in my partner physically. He is so handsome and beautiful and I tell him this often, but I just do not want sex. There are times he has expressed his vulnerability to this, saying that he feels as though I don't like him physically. This is not about him, but I have tried working on it to ensure that his needs are being met. But it is never enough. There have been times on occasion he throws a bit of a tantrum when he has not been fulfilled sexually. I feel so exhausted in the end.

There have also been times where he has demanded me to do things that I see no point to? Such as once when we had fought after having sex, he did not let me change back into my clothes and took the covers, leaving me to lay on the bed without anything. I don't think I have ever felt that horrible. Or sometimes asking for me to just spend more time together that I do not have to give him. Such as us going out (when we could lol Covid 😔) or even demanding which lane I am in when I'm driving. It is awkward and I have brought it a little to his attention but no changes or apologies gave been done or said.

He always brings up past mistakes of mine, even when I have apologized and tried to work on them. Although I try, he never acknowledged that, only that there are no substantial changes. Even times where I have just felt sick from either being actually ill or drunk and will get mad for months about it. I haven't wanted to get drunk around friends with him since because of the last time that he still hasn't gotten over. He has also said some questionable things about my disability that I bring up and sometimes he really understands but when he is upset he says things that I feel are pretty ableist,  but its only because he gets really upset. 

Not to mention I feel as though I do the majority in the relationship. I drive us around, I clean the dishes, I tend to the dog and pay for all his needs, I do laundry, and whenever there is an expense that is not just going out to eat I cover it (like gas, groceries, rent). 

I cannot even remember an anniversary that we haven't spent crying from being angry.  That breaks my heart. But other days are so nice.

But he is sweet, funny, and has made me the happiest I have ever been. I am known to be a doormat and a push over, and that is why I never have been in a good relationship before this. I think that these are just issues that couples deal with and can talk out. When I suggest therapy, nothing gets done and he never really agrees. He is a sweet guy when he happy, and he is compassionate. He will tuck me in when I am tired. But I am so sucked up with the bad parts, but the good parts are so wonderful.

I need some advice. Typing all this out makes me feel so horrible in my stomach, but I just need some guidance from someone who maybe has been in my shoes.",08Aug2020,1

62,"I’ve been self employed for the past 3-4ish years. I recently lost all of my clients and am doing some freelance gigs on the side for additional income. On top of that, my fiancé and I have about 2 months of savings and that’s kinda pushing it.

So I’ve been job hunting and so far and only have one company interested in me (it seems like most employers are kind of put off once I say I was self employed). With that said, the one company who is interested would require me to move out of state and the salary may be lower than what I’m expecting. 

My concern is, if I get an offer,  not taking this job because they’re going to want me to relocate this year, and then not being able to get another offer later on and having no income. (Granted its a job I would 100% enjoy; also I’m pretty confident there wouldn’t be an relocation assistance or maybe something small)

I’m really not sure what the best decision is. I’m leaning more towards taking the offer if I get one so I know I have income, but we just closed on our house about a year ago and I’m not sure if we’d be able to sell it.

I find out from my friend that he is on hinge at put his location at the festival 2 hrs away from me. He also wasn’t answering his phone the two days he was gone. He told me it was because he misplaced his phone and found it on the last day. 

When I asked why he was on the site behind my back, he said it was because he wanted to find girls to come over for his buddies but it never even happens cause he lost his phone. 

What’s more bizarre is, him and I had never slept together but we did do other things together. He said he never did because he knew I was a good girl and wanted to wait for the right time because he respected me.

66," I'm a recovering alcoholic in grad school. I had a very explosive turn to my addiction and bipolar disorder which affected a lot of people negatively, including the person I'm going to bring up. I went and got help, and now I have over a year clean and I've been living in sober living while working on my Ph.D.

We had a conference call yesterday and I answered a question. It was early for me, and I had just woken up, so I sounded pretty groggy. The fucked up part: One of my co-workers who is intimately aware of my alcoholism messaged the **whole group during the presentation** that I was probably drinking again and was drunk on the call. I told him to shut up in the chat, and sent him a text telling him how messed up that was and that I'm living in sober living doing the best I can to make amends

He messaged me next day calling bullshit, saying that I had to be on something, and that it was probably my bipolar anti-psychotic meds fucking with me too (he knows about my diagnosis). He then asked about my sober living situation, which I told him about, and then he responded with ""lol fuck you, go fuck yourself you pathetic, manipulative piece of shit"". I was absolutely floored, and I responded with something along the lines of that I didn't deserve what he said.

He is a co-worker, a fellow graduate student, so I am going to have to be around this person. I did show another graduate student the abusive texts that he sent me, but I was so fucked up from them that I deleted them quickly afterwards. I contacted my service provider if I would be able to retrieve those texts, and they said only in the case where there is a legal issue.

I'm just wondering what kind of recourse I can take. He falsely accused me of being drunk in front of all of my colleagues, who all know about my problem with alcohol (it was very apparent). The only reason I'm allowed back at school is because of my sobriety and my ability to manage my bipolar disorder (anti-psychotics, etc.). I feel insanely uncomfortable right now. My therapist said that I could file for electronic harassment if the messages don't stop, which is what I will do if he continues to pull shit like this. I just feel like I've been put in a bad situation where I need to go around and ensure that everyone knows I'm not drinking...

I’ve been fantasizing for as long as I can remember. I’m a 17 year old boy from Toronto and I have some severe self esteem issues, I don’t know where they root from. I’ve got a great family, I’ve got hobbies and interests (I love music and play guitar) but somehow I never know how to appreciate the good in my life.  

For a while I’ve been fantasizing about being more social and going out more often and being more interesting (I’m an introvert and I wish i was more social) I’m working on my social anxiety and I think it’s getting better but in my fantasies I’m always very social. Also I’m obsessing over getting approval and I fantasize about getting approval from my idols (people who don’t even know me). I fantasize about being in an elevator with my friend and having a conversation with him/her that catches the attention of my idol.... the elevator is like my happy place. Whenever I feel uncomfortable with reality or self conscious, I play music and pretend I’m in the elevator. 

It sounds weird but it’s so normal to me at this point. Now I want this to stop, it makes me feel temporarily happy and self fulfilled but it’s ruining my life and I know it’s bad and toxic but I just can’t stop. I can’t learn to love myself and be grateful for my own reality. Also I fantasize about my male idol being my father. Even though I have a really good caring dad, I feel guilty about that but I think that’s because if he was my father I know I’d be getting direct approval from him or something. 

How can I learn to just live in reality and be grateful. I just want to love myself and stop fucking fantasizing. 
I keep thinking my idol would probably look down at me, and why? What’s wrong with me? Apart from my deep self esteem issues. I don’t know. I’m always trying to escape my flaws when I wish I could just face reality. Sorry to get so repetitive. I’m a bit drunk right now.",08Aug2020,1

  So my (16f) family on my mothers side is very close. She has three sisters and one brother. Two sisters, the brother, and all of our other relatives including cousins and grandparents live in Pennsylvania, but we live near the canadian border in NY. We dont get to see each other much since most of my cousins are scattered throughout the country and my aunts, uncles, and grandparents are getting very old so its hard to make the 6 hour trip. Recently my moms only brother was diagnosed with liver cancer and it’s been a really hard blow for the whole family. We recently did a last hoorah celebration on July 4th for him, expecting it to be the last time he or my grandparents would ever be able to come. (We usually do very large celebrations with the whole family and it goes all week. This is also usually the only time they come up to visit) this time I was the only one of my siblings or cousins who came, even though my sister is local as well as a cousin of mine. It really wasn’t a great time. Its awkward as the only kid, and as the youngest of the whole family they think everything i do is trivial. But im a senior in high school, i got accepted into a med school program thats half of my school day, and i run multiple debate, educational, and fundraising programs within my school and city. So in my opinion i really dont feel trivial. At this point I’ve just decided to act happy and go with it. The weekend went fine and it was over soon enough. Then, my uncle and aunt made a surprise visit after an appointment he had in a city nearby for his liver cancer. They stayed with my aunt who lives here and we went tonight to go visit. They only cooked meat (im vegetarian and have been for 6 years, they know i dont eat burgers, sausages, or hotdogs) so there wasn’t much for me to have for dinner and everyone got on me about that like always. After dinner my dad decided to tell them I’ve been considering applying to Tulane University in New Orleans for college. This is like a smack in the face for my family and they all started to say how it doesn’t matter and i cant go because the culture isn’t right, it wouldn’t help my career in medicine, and that im trying to get away. None of those things are true. But it dug into me anyways. After this my family got in talking about annoying things i dont agree with and wont get into for sake of not  making this a political post, but anyways, after a few hours of this i was ready to go home. I texted my dad asking to leave because I was cold (we sat outside and distanced because of covid) and i was hungry since I hadnt eaten. An hour later my dad gets up and starts saying we have to leave because i wont stop texting him because I want to go home so badly. I tried to just play it off that i was cold but of course my family just came at me like I was just being a selfish kid and i was trying to just make it okay and say we can stay its fine but my parent’s were ready to go. When i was driving home i couldnt help it and just yelled at my parents about how they made me feel like my uncle with cancer probably thinks I dont want to spend any time with him and that I just want to be on my phone or at home and I felt horrible. But in the scheme of things I am the one of my cousins who showed up tonight. I am the one who came to the fourth of July when Im fully aware that my sister at least could have too. My family always sees me as this kid who never wants to be around them when on multiple occasions even besides the ones listed (we’ve done zoom calls, surprise visits etc, and i was the only one) ive been the only one there!!! On top of that I feel absolutely horrible about the fact that I yelled at my parents. They are so so good to me and I really try my best to be good too but it hurt me so much they would start this when we have specifically talked about how they aren’t supposed to say things like that. They didnt even yell back.

It has limited capacity by like 1/4th and has mandatory masks, temperature requirements, sanitizing stations everywhere and mandatory ones before and after every ride, which has social distancing on them. 
I feel like, of course there is a risk, but it feels safe, no more dangerous then going to the superstore (i live in a highly populated area so superstores are packed.) Or going to a mall to pick something up. 

Yet I feel super guilty about this. I know there is a risk, and I am prepared to do my best to make that risk as low as possible. 

What do you think? Am I to paranoid or am I being an idiot and shouldn't go.",08Aug2020,1

79,"I have an 11 year old son, and he has been getting bullied by his friends.  It’s gone on for the last few years (they’ve been in a friend group since 1st grade.). It used to be silly things, but it would boil down to one friend being ostracized until the next kid was.  I always tried to be supportive and told him he gets to decide who his friends are, but he hasn’t had the easiest time making new friends.  He can have a hard time knowing how to socialize because he has adhd.  Anyway, with the pandemic going on we have been socially distancing and maybe the others aren’t, and so my son was the one getting bullied again.  This time, they went too far.  They took screen shots of a video my son made at school on YouTube in the 3rd grade, which is still up btw... and they put it through an editing program so it looks like he made a video that says “I hate blacks and Jews”.  They then proceeded to black mail him with it and told him they would send it to any school he ever tried to get into.  He was afraid to tell me about it because it looked so realistic he thought I wouldn’t believe him.  We found the original video, which is actually titled something along the lines of “my introduction”.  When I found out I contacted the parents and sent the picture as well.  The father apologized, and the other parents essentially ignored me.  Now however, the entire friend group is ignoring my son.  It’s been really hard on him especially during quarantine as they played PlayStation together.  What can I do to help him during this time? How should I handle the picture?",08Aug2020,1

83,"I just graduated high school (yay!) and during my 12 years I’ve never actually dated anyone.

Over the summer I’ve been working up my courage and I actually managed to ask a guy I really liked to grab lunch with me. (Don’t worry there are like 0 Covid cases where I live) 

I also went to the Prom after party (never been to a high school party before) and it was really fun, despite being one of the only sober people there. 

I’ve realized that throughout these last few years, all the crushes I’ve developed  were because the guy paid me a compliment or just smiled at me during class, or at the after party asked for a pic with me. That was enough for me to develop a serious crush. The one exception is the guy I asked on a lunch “date”. I’ve always been pretty antisocial, because of strict parenting, and being shy, but I find that I really enjoy hanging out with people (even though I’m exhausted afterwards). 

**Is it weird that I’m attracted to guys that are just being nice?** (I’ve heard that it’s a sign of insecurity and boy oh boy am I insecure, if so it’d be true) Also, **how do I become closer with my friends?** (eg convince them to include me in more parties and stuff, because I haven’t been super enthusiastic in the past)",08Aug2020,1

85,"I (21F) have finally figured out my plans for the future but my mom is holding me back. 
Just some back ground information: I am a senior in college on the east coast and am currently looking for law schools in the west. My mom is a single parent (widow), only child, and never apologizes or admits when she’s wrong.  In the past couple years I have been fortunate enough to go visit other states in the west coast and each state I visited, I fell in love with. Since COVID started, being at home with not much to do helped me think more about my ultimate goals and dreams for my career and life overall. I realized that my dream is to be in the west with my boyfriend (21 M) in either Colorado, Utah, Oregon, or Washington. 

 My boyfriend will be going to a different school than me, but we’ll hopefully be in the same city. I believe that it would make more sense to go to law school in the state in which I will live in. So, fast forward to late June, I tried to nonchalantly bring up law school while also trying to include moving out further west. She immediately was shocked (understandable), but then looked almost disgusted? She then says she can’t picture me living there and other confusing excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. I just sat there and listened because I know it won’t take one day to get her to listen to me. I then start to look at what schools I’m interested in and what cities I want to live in. Thankfully, my boyfriend and I are in agreement with the same states so we’re excited. 

So, last week I tell my mom that now I’m really interested in moving to Colorado and going to law school there. Again, she just keeps saying negative things about Colorado and why I shouldn’t go. She then tells me that I am not “driven” enough, and at that point that just completely broke me inside. But again, I listen and ignore, but I am fuming yet crushed on the inside. A couple days pass and I start to give her an attitude (which I won’t deny, because I did) and she comes into my room and asks me why I’ve been rude. I told her how much her words hurt me and how she could say something like that to her own daughter.  At this point i’m scream crying at her and telling her how hard I have been studying for the LSATs and looking up information about the school, the cities near it, etc. I ask her why it is so hard for her to just accept that I am an adult and at some point I have to do what’s best for me. She then tells me that it’s hard for her to accept me leaving, but she knows at some point she has to. I understand it’s hard for her, but being in my house for too long with her makes me depressed. 

Thankfully,  my grandmother lives with us and we both have issues with my mom and have tried discussing them with her to no avail. So, two days ago I visited her at her job and we went to lunch together.  She brings up law school and asks me who else is coming with me. I never had the opportunity to tell her that my boyfriend is coming because she would immediately shut the idea down so why is it worth it to bring up anyways. I decided to take a shot and ask if we could live together since I won’t know anybody else there and feel most comfortable with him especially when it comes to my first year of law school. Understandably and not surprisingly, she said no and I never brought it up again.  Yesterday, we went out to lunch again (we lost power since Tuesday) and she then starts asking me so many questions about my boyfriend and why he wants to move there too and all this other bs. I told her that it’s not her problem because she is not his mother.

She of course didn’t like that response and then got so angry out of nowhere and called me a liar because I never told her about my boyfriend wanting to move with me. She said that I wasn’t “woman enough” to tell her, but she never gave me the chance to. And to top it all off I have to stay home for the semester because my school went online. I just really need advice on how to talk to my mom and tell her that this is my life without her getting mad and having tension for the rest of the year.",08Aug2020,1
86,"So I am afraid that i might have testicular cancer. I have a story, this happened around half a year ago when I got ph premium for a week. I was masturbating all day but one time I felt a bit weird when I started ""it"". I was near the end of the session but then when I came I felt something wrong. I felt that nothing came out but blood. Imagine you put a big cabbage into a bit bigger bowl then seeing blood rising from below the cabbage and then burying it in the blood, that was how my penis looked like. I know it sounds weird but then for a month or two I was constantly washing my penis and not masturbating at all. After the second month I started masturbating again but gently by just touching my penis inside my pants while watching porn. It hurt a bit for a week but then I started getting back into the whole thing. Now whenever I fap either when I start or when I finish I rarely feel a bit of pain in my left ball, also I feel that my left ball is a bit more harder than my right one. I fear I might have some kind of cancer or some other reason for this, but I can't go to the doctor. I am 13 to clarify and I don't know what to do.

90,"few mental illnesses so I stopped for the best of my brain and the sake of my mental health. Now recently I learned about a Roblox developer who unfortunately took their own life. I decided to see the news about this tradagey (I doubt that’s how you spell it but you get the point) the majority of the people payed their respects but a select handful made fun of his death which Of course was for attention. I decided to go on one specific channel which got the most hate. While browsing his channel I decided to look at his first made video. His first video title was somewhere along the lines “do not click this video “ but of course because of my couristy (auto correct ain’t helping me this time) decided to click it. The video was only a few sect long and it was a image of a cross with a few blood droplets. I soon became determined to find a useless image. It took me almost half an hour to find the origin of the image but finally found it after remembering there’s something on the internet called “reverse image search” at the end of the day  it was just a book cover. I finally felt relieved but I recalled looking through cursed videos a little while earlier so I decided to search some up. I passed by one which was a 3 minute video of a guy staring at a camera and throughout it the video weird things would occur like the eyes spinning and eerie music playing. The background was also a bloody red. I was able to hop on Quora in time to ask if this video was truely (is truely even a word?) cursed before my mind did her regular routine of yanking off the WiFi cord. While in bed I kept thinking of the video. That night I ended up staying in my brothers room..which yeah if you’re wondering a 17 year old with his brother but hey I was pretty paranoid. My brother told me he’ll watch the video but never did. The next day some Quora users mentioned that if you watch the video you’ll pull your eyes out. Of course I watched it over and over again and got more paranoid. Now looking back at that I feel pretty ashamed of myself. Either ways, some others told me they watched it hundreds of times months ago and they’re eyes are still there plus supposedly the person in the video has a Facebook account and the person in it does not know how he ended up in the video. Of course you probably guessed it didn’t end there. I got into more videos like a video of where if one watched the video you could get headaches but I can probably assume it was due to the placebo effect and anxiety. I also passed through websites mentioned cursed paintings where reporetdly (spelling error)looking at the painting multiple times can kill you, of course I’m still here it’s simply a urban legend. Soon after that I made myself into researching about the origins of supernatural rituals on R/theeekings where a bunch of nutjobs make creepypasta rituals and more other people make “experiences” for other gullible idiots like me to believe them. The first one I learned was where you can make your stuffed Animal to try killing you and taking your body. Of corse people made experiences where the stuffed animal would be in front of their door the next day. At the end this ritual was baloney found on 2Chann the Japanese verison (Y’know what I’m going to stop notifying the reader of spelling mistakes) and soon I got myself into rituals where you can play hide and seek with a demon which once again more baloney found on 4chann but back then (which was just a few months ago) I was gullible enough to believe it plus I’m fucking 17. I spent a month and a few weeks looking up more and more like the ritual called “The white kimono” from a book supposedly called Akuma no gishi. Now this ritual was where you could summon a spirit to come and kill you when you sleep. Pretty scary right? It’s pretty easy to. Look at 4 corners of your room in a direct order then chant a few things then imagine a girl like samra from the ring and go to bed, if you can’t lucid dream then it was nice knowing you. When I read this I got paranoid as  hell I decided to hop on a occupy discord serve because why not? One discord use by the name of Asmund the angry called it a folklore story that probably spread. As you can probably tell he was pretty annoyed by me. I was in the occult discord server asking questions and all and all of a sudden was kicked out. My mom actually pulled off the WiFi cord so I desperately found it again and stayed up till 2:00AM to find the discord server. I was soon able to find it and learned the reason I was kicked out was, hear this... “Baiting answers”... now supposedly this people in the server say they have common sense, they Gave not even ONE single warning to me to stop asking...Questions. I also learned some people who called me “cool” in the server called me ignorant and stupid when I was away. I told this to my fellow so called friends which I call them my classmate-friend and one told me to immediately leave the server for multiple reasons. I left the server and decided to never go back but as you can probably guess I did. I wondered if anyone said anything about me when I left. I still remember clearly. Going shopping at Kohl’s (you can’t turn down a $10 off a $50 dollar purchase coupon especially in my family) I told my parents I would go back to the server to check and they told me not too. Of course I did either ways and they said nothing about my departure but Asmund did have his birthday the next day. I waited a few days and soon started to worry that I was going to be cursed or hexed so I decided to bump across a few more discord servers and they all said “nah” or “yah but very low chance” I also found a YouTube channel called Lisa sourbrine and witch who claimed can hear what people say about her. Turns out she was likely a person looking for attention (I asked 4 discord servers/~20 people and they said the same thing) At one point I found one of the largest witchcraft discord server.Out of the blue one person mentioned her family was chased by a demon called Haures that supposedly their aunt summoned on them. The family saw bees coming out of the ground and all the weird shit you can think off. That’s when I decided to re-hop on Quora and ask if this demon was real. I don’t remember the first answer but it came from a skeptic so you can decide what s/he probably said. I soon started to ask a lot of questions and I mean a lot. Around ~30 questions a day and that quite a lot for Quora. Of course skeptics and demon summoners came to answer my questions. Some people got really agitated by my requests and I’ll get to one later. Soon enough I wasn’t able to make my mind on weather not not demons existed because there would always be a contradicting side. I also hopped on R/demons where people tell others what they will summon and also experience of them being attacked by a demon which once again has zero evidence in all experiences I saw. I also saw some people make claims like “the supernatural exist but there’s no evidence for it” but as for now we can leave it as supernatural till we get proof and the proof we get from this witches is just all talk. That about my whole story. Currently I’m still debating but I’m currently more on the skeptical side of all this topics unless someone provides even just a few evidence of demons existence (beside testimonial claims) it’s also been hundreds of years since demons were first introduced, fun fact the Greek definition of demon was something positive and was spelled Diamon instead of demon but when the medevil times came it was then changed to something negative and typically associated with evil. Also if you’re wondering, one person a famous author on Quora got triggered. She even wrote “I Want to fling a shoe at you.” Damn I never knew I was that annoying...On august 2 2020 I decided to join a mental illness support group on discord. There were multiple channels but the main ones I remember was #main,#help 1-5 and #help dm. I decided to go to the help dm because I wanted to talk privately about my situation.  About a minute after I requested for assistance someone by the name of BlueRoseABC#9696 came to my rescue. I soon saw that I may finally get out of this wormhole after all. I started of by pasting my whole story but during the middle of it she told me to slow down. Later when I finished she cursed at me and told me she was in a dark room? I already got pretty confused. She later started telling me about all this supernatural things like fairy circles and all the weird shit. Soon enough I was quite paranoid because I knew I wasn’t talking to a listener I was instead talking to someone who made my condition worse. At the end I said my farewells. In one part of the conversation she said she could show me proof demons exist but I declined the offer. The next day, I asked on Quora is I should go back and ask her for the evidence of the supernatural and all said yes so I went back. To my astonishment I was banned from the server. I spent 10 minutes using VPNS And I finally got back in. What’s funny is that I skeptic using a VPN wouldn’t work but it did. Oh well. I soon dmed her and she was sure she could show me evidence. I chatted to her for around 5 hours but to summarize it up, she sent me a scar on her arm which symbolized she actually did self harm. Later I was able to see the ritual she was going to do. The paper looked like it was made in less then 10 minutes and she wrote more directions then what could fit on the paper. I later asked to see her books and when she took a picture of a diary looking thing and said I can’t show you important things I was very and I mean very infuriated. The so called “ritual book” looked more like a diary and was written for that purpose. The “ritual book” also never showed the ingredients needed for rituals plus if you say “I can’t show you important things” that makes it even more worse. Now I soon started to scold her for about an hour. She apologized for what she did and told me she would throw away the “so called ritual books.” Soon my clan mates from clash of clans...came to comfort her. She told me she wouldn’t fall back into gullibility and I trusted her. I’m still asking questions to her since well, I’m scared shitless about what she said even though she told me to forget this.Now my mind tells me to do some of the most stupidest things I have ever thought. My mind wants me to rejoin back discord servers specifically witchcraft discord servers that have already banned me. The reason why my mind wants me to do this is because it wants me to see just one stupid message I sent. I emailed discord support to delete my account so I will never ever be able to see the one message but as for now my mind is being a damn $&amp;@“ is this OCD thoughts or intrusive thoughts? Also recently I saw my old message of someone saying that a demon by the name of Haures was mentioned in the Bible and Judaism and now I really want to go through the whole VPN process of me getting unblocked from the server to ask the question once again..also the link to the image is down below.Also please give advice for me thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

Forgive me for my shitty story telling it's my first reddit post

Background information: I live with my family of 4 as a child and I believe that we are generally quite happy and stable due to both my hardworking mother and father.

my age: 16

sister's age: 14

I didn't notice for a while now but ever since my sister moved into secondary school (high-school) I've seen multiple changes in her attitude towards me specifically in the begging of secondary school (y7 11-12 of age  ) I remember still being a lovely sister that I could still talk to on the wag to school and someone I could hug when I came back from school. She would always also open up the door to our house properly not slightly opening and in general give me quite a happy attitude when dealing with each. Obviously siblings fight and I thought that was quite normal at the time as it was over quite petty things such as food or what not and looking back I still think this is okay to have and is healthy to have between siblings.

Time passes by and she is now 13-14 and shows she is disgusted towards me. initially I thought this might have been my problem with hygiene because I thought it was rediculous that I couldn't even make physical contact with my sister at all but this disgust still existed after I took showers or washes with hands. I knew however that it was not a hygenie issue as my parents and others around me did not have a problem with my hygiene. So I continued to ask her why she actively ""hated"" me and she continued to say I was disgusting as her only real explanation but this would cause her to cry when touching me or anything I touched in repulsion of me and I thought this was some type of weird joke but I soon realised it wasn't as she kept up with ""act"" for over 2 years now.

This often led to unneeded physical outrage from her side. For example if I were to spray water on her after cleaning my hands she would actively try to hit me or slap me my parents now don't even see it as a joke or some sort of weird prank anymore because on one occasion I touched her bedsheets by sitting on her bed and she literally cried over things I touched and my dad came in to comfort her.

This has led up to recently today she cut me sharp metal for teasing her saying she acts like a baby.

Ps: I'm reading the story and I'm missing a lot of detail about the story but I don't know how to explain her very unstable despise and hatred towards me it's just weird.",08Aug2020,1

As you get older you start to realise your parents have problems and flaws and idk if they are really as good of parents as I thought. 

Don’t get me wrong I love them and they would do anything for me, I am very lucky to have a loving family. I get along with them very well. 

But ive gotten older and so I’m being invited to parties and things and they never let me go to ANYTHING. even if there is no drinking or drugs. They have told me stories of them being younger than me and going to clubs with fake ID’s and going to parties just overall having a good time as teenagers, but they refuse to give me even a taste of that fun. They say they trust me but never let me out ???? I have little to no social life because of this. 

I’m Australian and on my L’s rn so I can’t drive anywhere without a parent and I live in an area that is far away from bus stops or train stations. There is literally no way for me to even go out with my girlfriends without help from my parents. And if it doesn’t suit their plans I can’t go. Mind you their ‘plans’ is sitting at home in front of the TV. 

I’m extremely bored. It’s ruined my friendships, they hardly invite me to anything anymore because I can never go anyways. (They not the best but that’s another story). 

I feel like they’re being selfish but maybe I’m the one being selfish. 

But whenever they do go out it’s on a date because they say they never get ‘them time’ and they leave me home to clean up or study. I don’t need to study y’all I need to get some sun lmfao.

I tried to end it all but didn’t succeed and ended up in the hospital. 
My parents told my school (a boarding school) what had happened and they were fine with letting me back as a boarder with some restrictions after i was released from hospital. 
Two weeks later my parents and I have an argument where I tell them I don’t want to talk to them for a bit so I go off the grid to them. The school still knows where I am and I am with my friends. 
Because my parents can’t get a hold of me they tell the school that they’re worried and maybe I should be on suicide watch. 
This leads to me nearly getting kicked out of school, humiliated infront of my peers, forced to become a day pupil and never allowed to be without the presence of a teacher while I’m on school grounds.

101,"So I was interviewed at Panda Express and they said they just need to clear the background check and I'm good.

Im 17 and I've had them done before and nothing has come up so I'm like 99% sure I'm good.

I'm having the first job nerves y'know, worried how I'll do, worry about not being fast enough, worried about people not liking me.

102,"I (19m) have been feeling really stressed lately with everything that's going on with my life, from relationship to money.

I feel like I have a lot on my plate, but I don't want to give up on any of them. I have 2 jobs because 1 is for the money and the second one is to help me get to my future career goal but it doesn't pay well at all, as well college will help me to that career goal so I continue it. I love my girlfriend but we're long distance so she takes a lot of my free time just calling, I don't mind but some days I just want to be alone for a while and decompress a little. 

I don't have much money and I'm worried I'm going to fail in life because of that, I just turned 19 recently and I haven't done much with life and I am struggling to make money because of everything that's happening (covid, working my second job, girlfriend, school, food, and bills). I feel really stressed and I don't know if everything will be ok or if I'm going to be ok in the future.

To be honest just talking/writing about it helped me decompress a little and get things off my chest. But I still feel stressed and worried about my financial situation, my future, and my relationship. But thank you for reading, I don't know if there is much I can do about things other than just power through it.

long story short I feel that I have a lot to do and worry about and it makes me stressed. I'm working two jobs, going back to college September and have a relationship that takes up most/all of my free time.",08Aug2020,1

(They are covid negative btw). However they have a kid a couple years younger than me. I'm expected to entertain them and I can't take a break. Like we were out the other day and I needed a break and I started on a book. I was then told I was being rude and anti-social. We share a room so there is nowhere to go. I just found out that they are now coming on our staycation as well and I will have to entertane them there. (Sorry for rambling) . My parent then ask me how I feel and get mad when I say my true feeling. They say in the past we have stayed with them and we should return the favor (They have stayed with us befor). The kid follows me everywhere and I can't even go to the bathroom without them knocking. Also because we have visitors who came from a covid area I can't go neer my friends and even if one is bold enough to hang out with me I'm expected to include the kid, which ruins the fun. I feel isolated from my peers and have no escape from them. I'm no longer enjoying my summer holiday as I can't do the things I want to do. They r a nice person I just feel trapped. My parents say I'm lucky that we get to do touristy things, but tbh I was doing them anyway.  Im not rude to her but I just can't take it So reddit. What do i do about this situation?

I really don’t want to sound like a lazy, entitled millennial here. But good god. It just the worst. It’s not just that I don’t “like” it or that I’d rather be playing video games or something. It’s not just a matter of preference. It’s borderline a phobia. I despise it. Time seems to draw out SO slowly, and it feels like I’m walking through molasses. 

I’ve tried just not thinking about it, I’ve tried shifting to positive thinking. I’ve tried not looking at the clock. Making extra little jobs for myself. Thinking about other things. It doesn’t matter what I do. I just hate the WORLD when I’m there.  Every single day when I go in I’m like “how the HELL am I gonna get through this today? Why me?”

What can I do to try to despise this position less, or make time go a little faster?

112,"Hello! 
Throwaway and sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. I (25f) am a really happy person and grateful for what I have in my life. But about every few weeks I seem to become down because I'm jealous of others steps in life. I graduated college and I will get to those steps eventually (engagement, marriage, starting a family, buying a house) but I fell like I want things to speed up. I love my boyfriend more than anything and I'm impatient and wanting him to propose. We've been together over 3 years and have talked about everything (marriage, kids, what we want and we want the same things). He says he's going to propose in a few months but those months passed and nothing has happened.  I'm keeping all of my thoughts to myself so I don't think I'm hurting anyone but it's eating away at me. I also feel guilty about the jealousy I occasionally feel over others. 

I am jealous over one person in my life. I love her to death. She's on baby number two and is married and successful and looking to buy a house. I am also jealous that her mother watches her kid (and will for the next kid) 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. I won't be able to have my mother watch over my kids that much in a week. I feel like she is very lucky and I wish I had the opportunities like her. Shes not very maternal and just wants to pop them out asap so her mom could take care of them so she can work. Her and her husband are disappointed that they have and are having another girl. I feel like they should be grateful that they have healthy children and family that can watch over them while she is able to pursue her career. She also drinks occasionally during pregnancy and that bothers me. When everyone gets together, her mom holds her child the whole time and she hates when her baby cries, she wants to avoid taking care of her child as much as possible.

I am following my career path and in a very serious relationship and everything is going great for me, yet I feel guilty that I feel jealous over her successes. Maybe I'm just annoyed that she isn't grateful and making some bad decisions and everything seems to be going perfect for her?  Reminder, I keep my thoughts to myself. How could I stop feeling jealous of some people in my life and become more patient with my life? Many thanks!",08Aug2020,1

117,"Okay so basically I got into riding horses when I was 12. I’ve just always loved animals it’s my passion even when I was very young so I went to a barn and offered to work for lessons. I worked extremely hard to be able to ride some weeks without even being able to ride at all But I loved being around them so much it didn’t matter and it’s probably the only thing I love to do. I know that it’s an expensive hobby but I just couldn’t stay away. My parents have always been very poor and could not afford to pay the grocery bill let alone a hobby like horseback riding. 
So for most of my life I’ve been working to ride. My half brother who’s twice my age met a girl who rode horses and basically got him into it now they are married. They just bought a ranch and a house where they own many many horses. I rode with him for awhile until we had a family blow out due to his girlfriend not liking me. 
Basically I had to give up riding and it’s been over a year, I see them riding doing what I love on social media and our mom is so proud and glad that he’s happy but I just can’t help but be jealous. I work full time while going through nursing school. I just don’t have the time to ride even tho I so badly want to. I live in a rented out trailer because my parents moved to a new state due to financial issues. I work really hard but my brother has just completely abandoned me. 
My question for anyone is how can I go ride? When ever I call to make an appointment there are always so many contingency’s and over priced lessons to walk in a circle. I just simply cannot afford to pay 90$ for a lesson. Yet my brother owns many many horses and a ranch I guess I’m just jealous.. not sure how to cope..",08Aug2020,1

119,"so this is my first post, and i barely know what im doing, so bare with me please.

im 15 years old and my hair is really long. its down to my butt. im nonbinary and id definitely feel more comfortable with short hair (my mom doesnt know im nonbinary because shes homophobic so im not out.) for the past few weeks ive been begging my mom to let me cut it and she keeps saying no. i only get my hair cut around 3 times a year and i get 4-6 inches cut off every time. this is the longest my hairs been ever because of quarantine. and my mom wont allow me to get more than 2 inches trimmed off, even though i always get more than that. not to mention she let my twin sister get 10 inches chopped off at the beginning of the year. not and ive dyed my hair several times and my hair is pretty damaged and dead anyway. my grandma, my therapist, and my moms friends are on my side. my moms reasoning is that i used to get very upset when she cut my haur short when i was younger (me and my sister had cut each other's hair when were around 5 and it was hideous. the only way to fix it was to get it all chopoed off, which i threw a tantrum about). my mom is also telling everyone that im just lazy and dont wanna take care of my hair, even though i gave her several reasonable reasons as to why i wanted to cut it all of. for one, its dead. its also way too long and shes always complaining about how much i shed (easy fix), and im in rotc and have to wear my hair up in uniform, which takes a while to style when its as long and thick as mine and would be easier with short hair (ig thats where she got the lazy part.) my mom found out i liked girls not too long ago and as i mentioned, she's extremely homophobic. she told my sister that she doesnt want to cut my hair because i would look like a ""dyke."" a reminder that she diesnt know im nonbinary.  its my hair, so i feel like it should be my choice if i wanted to cut it, anyway. im a good kid and dont usually disobey my mom, but i feel like this could be an exception. my mom threatened to blister my ass, take away all my electronics and ground me until i turn 18 if i cut my hair short. im not really scared of the punishment, because as i said, everyones on my side and they wouldnt let that happen. i still dont like to disobey my mom tho. so im stuck. so, reddit, should i cut my hair and deal with the consequences or just let it be until i turn 18?

tl;dr
im nonbinary and want to cut my hair for a number of reasons. my mom let my sister cut her hair (not as short as i wanna cut mine tho. but she wont let me get more than 2 inches) but she doesnt want me to cut mine because she doesn't want me to look like a ""dyke."" i dont usually disobey my mom but it's my hair, so i think its my choice and shes being unreasonable (in my opinion)",08Aug2020,1
121,"My \[19F\] friends \[19F, 19F\] and I have been Skyping a lot more since quarantine began. We often find ourselves on there for hours playing games or watching things together. I take care not to video call when we're each going about our day to day lives because too much sound or movement going on can grate on me to the point of hysteria. One of my friends, though (let's call her C) has a tendency to have a lot going on in the background while we chat, even if we ask her to mute her mic or go somewhere quieter. She'll make dinner, have full conversations with her family, or play a TV show loudly while on call with us. These noises, on top of conversation and whatever show or game we have playing, can make things really difficult for me. I find myself annoyed and frayed more often than not, and I don't know what to do.

C has been one of my best friends for years, but serious conversations aren't commonplace for us.

123,"Hi, I left one of my mechanical pencils on the floor and sort of kicked it with the side of my foot by accident. The lead broke off in my skin, the barrel basically 'injected' it into my foot.

I tried to get it out a bunch of ways, squeezing it out, tweezers, even cutting it out a little with a (sterilized) x acto knife, even got desperate and tried one of those pore vacuums.

124,"**TL;DR: Brother makes living w/ parents kinda suck. I want to move out and rent an apartment. What do I do?**

I would consider myself somewhat financial savvy; I have spreadsheets tracking my finances and projections for the year and onward. I know that the smart thing to do is to save up as much money as possible and purchase a house, but I wanted some thoughts and opinions on my current situation.

I'm [25/M] about to pay off my students loans this coming September after graduating from university in May 2019. Living with my parents has been the main reason why I have been able to pay it off in such short time frame, as the loans only started to collect interest in December 2019.

However, I've been considering moving out and renting an apartment. The reason why is because of my brother [40/M]; I don't have any issues with my parents, they are very kind and loving. Unfortunately, my brother makes the household a very toxic environment to live in and it is very emotionally and mentally taxing to deal with his behavior on a daily basis. 

There are several gripes I have with him: 

* He always gaslights me (whether on purpose or not, I'm not sure) over random things and attempts to make me question my memory. 
* He is very quick to anger, and if things are not done in way that he finds satisfactory, he will blow up or yell at you until it is fixed.
* He can't take no for an answer. If he asks you for your opinion on something and you reply negatively or ""no"", he will persist and attempt to persuade you into saying yes for something that works in his favor.
* Whenever I leave my room, say to eat dinner or relax in the living room, he will rant and vent to me about his issues until I leave the common area. He will also come into my room during times I am working (currently WFH due to COVID) and start ranting and venting to me about his problems. 
* He does not respect the fact that things that I have bought belong to me. He will use things that I have purchased, use them until they are old or ruined, and not fix or replace them.

I have brought attention multiple times to the things he does to me and the rest of family, but he eventually forgets. 

Of course there are times in which he is great person, but I have been feeling that, to potentially preserve my mental health, I should move out on my own. However, I would really love to keep saving money and I love my parents very much. I feel that I've dealt with his behavior for so long that it isn't too big a deal to keep putting up with him.

If it helps, I live in Northern Virginia and currently make 75k a year. 

If anyone has similar experiences and can provide some help, it would be great. Thanks.",08Aug2020,1
125,"So I’m not entirely sure why he feels that way or why it is a problem. I started to notice him getting annoyed by how drunk I get when we go to clubs. I thought it was just the drinking so I decided to go sober so I wouldn’t annoy him. He seems to like going to clubs with me. I’m pretty sure it’s because I’m always down to go (I don’t want him to go alone we lived in London and he didn’t understand walking in the streets at night alone can be dangerous. He comes from a small town).

Well when I went sober to the club, he still seemed annoyed. A guy started dancing with me I wasn’t into the guy so I looked at my friends for help but I saw him with an annoyed look on his face talking to my other friend pointing at me.

129,"Sorry this is my first time posting on reddit. Sorry in advance for anything I'm getting wrong and not doing. 

I need advice on how to make my situation better and I am... basically a shut in with no one to talk to. 

Some back story: 

I was abused as a kid- sexually by a family member I've had 2 step fathers and my 2nd one was very narcissistic and emotionally abusive. My father is very detached and doesnt really pay me any notice and I dont talk to hardly any family for varying reasons but mainly because of the abuse I suffered. 

When my mother left step father no.2 she wasnt doing well. We were really struggling financially and it was very hard. My father has always contributed bare minimum despite being stable. My mom has struggled as a single mother. Step no 2 was very emotionally abusive and knocked her confidence. 

Now the issue. 

One day when I was about 19 I get a notification from my bank saying my account had been frozen and was undergoing investigation. I couldn't access any money. I had a job and all my money from that job was in that account. I called and was panicking trying to see what the hell I had done wrong and they just kept saying "" you have to come to a branch to prove where your funds came from"" and ""we can't give you any information regarding your account"". I got of the phone and my mother, who had listened to my terrible call and yelling and panicking, came in and said ""I need to tell you somthing"". She then explained that she had been stealing money from her work and using my bank account to do it. 

Now- I dont know how it works in normal households- but since my mom has struggled so much financially shes always had access to my bank account to give me money and then also monitor what I was spending. Since I was abused I think she thought I may go off the deep end in some way. 

I honestly had no clue that this had been happening and its was really shocking not only that she had done it but that she had used me when shes the only person I could trust.  

My mom was arrested, put of trial, convicted and now has served probation and her sentence is spent. I still live with her. I do care so much about her, and I dont know if it is just being locked down but we argue alot. I cant help finding myself being irrationally angry at her and random crap because I feel like I cant do anything with my life or to be Independent. When she did her crime- they attached the bank fraud to my name blacklisting me from having any accounts for 7 years. No one wanted to touch me. If a job ran a credit check it came up as a flag. How I was treated by people who found out she did it, or that my account had been the one used changed. My boyfriend at the time ended things. I feel like I was punished for something I had no clue about. I get people dont belive I had no idea- but I really didnt know.  

I feel so miserable about things now I just dont know what to do. I'm 24. I never went to college because of what happened. I wake up everyday wishing I could just stay asleep. I dont want to die, I'm not suicidal, but I am not thrilled about living. I feel like everyone in my life has betrayed me and I dont know how to even start to make it better. 

Am I the asshole? What do I do? Can I do anything? Really just looking for a friend.",08Aug2020,1

131,"Ok so after my parents divorced, my dad met this woman, let's call her ""B"". She is a teacher in this elementary school that i used to go to, and my dad knows some people there so that's how he met her. I guess when they met they clicked and started going out more. The thing is that i never liked her, in fact i fucking hated her. Whenever he would bring her over i would basically throw tantrums, would lock the door of the house so that they can't get in, heck i even threw magazines at her. I was pretty open about my feelings towards her but my dad seemed to only care about his own ass and disregard my feelings as he always does. Like dude, even my brother and grandma (dad's mom) dislike her.

So, then she moved into the place above us (our house has two floors and my dad used to rent the place above us) and that's when my life became a terrible mess. Also i should mention that she has a daughter and a son who are both spoiled af. I think that during that time she was tryna be all nice to me like even tried to talk to me and give me advice on smth, bought me a birthday present but all that was fake, i know that she doesn't like me as well. But no now that Mrs has got her own little luxurious apartment (which was probably reconstructed with SOMEONE ELSES money) she thinks she's the shit and even dares to shade me at times like no honey you're living in someone else's house for free and you think you can shade me. Pathetic. Like i'm telling you if it weren't for my dad that bitch wouldn't have seen the damn letter A from America (i'm from Europe so going to America is kind of a big deal here).

Now onto my dad, he doesn't take me nor my feelings seriously. We have communication issues. One time i told him that i don't like the way he jokes (it has always bothered me) and his response to that was that i should get used to it. Like i finally built up the courage to tell him something and that was his response. Hilarious.

Generally, i'm extremely unhappy with my current life situation and big portion of it is because of my family, man, i even self-harmed.

I have to talk to my dad but the problem is that he won't listen and i don't know what to do. And i know damn well that if talk to him , he's gonna walk out of that conversation like it never happened, continuing his happy little life filled with lies while i'm gonna have a dozen more mental breakdowns and mental problems in room.

So, after we knew each other for about a year, we decided to open up about our ages/where we lived. Turns out, we live in the same state, and she’s about half a year older than me. 

Anyways, I also met this guy named Robert (obviously not his real name, for the sake of their privacy), about a year ago, and we were never super close, but were kinda close at a point. 

When I first introduced them to each other, they didn’t really care about each other - They probably said a few words, then moved on.

One day, one of my online friends texts Ava and I, telling us that him and Robert were online dating, and that he that he had to break up with him, since his parents found out about it.

He continued to tell us why his parents wanted him to break off the relationship - apparently Robert had sent this guy questionable pictures, was a weirdo in general, when he tried to break off the relationship, he threatened to kill himself. Obviously, Ava and I tried to talk to him, but, when we did, he kept going on about how he had no reason to live, since his online boyfriend no longer wanted to date him.

Now, a few months after that happened, I almost forgot about the whole thing. Then, out of nowhere, Ava and Robert started doing, like, basic e-couple stuff, like getting matching profile pictures/usernames, leaving group calls to join a call in DMs, y’know the drill.

The thing is - When I asked Ava (I wasn’t very comfortable asking Robert at the time), she’d always tell me that it was all a joke, like she was trying to hide their relationship. At first, it didn’t make sense, because, although I personally wouldn’t online date someone, I thought that Robert was fifteen, max (Ava is fourteen, and will be fifteen at the end of the month), so it would be perfectly okay for them to date.

So, about a month or so ago, I was talking to Robert, and we somehow got onto the subject of dating. I asked him if he was dating Ava, and he told me that he was. At first, I was happy for them, since I thought that Robert was a lot younger than he actually is, and they’re both my friends, and I want them to be happy. 

I was okay with it, until he told me his age. He’s eighteen, and Ava is fourteen. As someone who’s also fourteen, I’d feel very comfortable dating an adult, and wonder how either of them are comfortable with it. 

So, if you think about it - Something has to be going on, right? Someone who’s barely a teenager and someone who’s a legal adult shouldn’t feel comfortable with dating, online or not. And, knowing Ava, I don’t think she’d be comfortable with that, unless she was being groomed. 

Normally, I’d just confront her about it, but I also care about Robert, so I don’t want him to be sad, or anything. He’s aware that the age gap isn’t, uh, normal, and has asked me to keep the information about them dating to myself.

So, do you guys have any advice for me? I partly feel like this is my job to fix, since I was the one who introduced them to each other. If you have any questions, just let me know in the comments.

Thank you!",08Aug2020,1

136,"I'm 17 years old who has only got close to a girl once and I messed it up pretty much right after there was interest. I was too blind to see that she actually had interest and I did nothing to continue it, shortly after that we stopped talking. That was years ago and I haven't really gotten close to a girl since. It's not that I'm socially awkward but it's been a thing I couldn't grasp my hands on and seeing majority of my friends getting significant others around me is taking a toll on me mentally, I'm gonna go to college next year (Quebec so I go a year earlier). That's just the relationship aspect of my mental problems too.

I have played contact sports throughout my adolescence such as Football and Rugby which resulted in me having multiple concussions and I feel that I'm catching on to things in school as quickly as I used to before receiving them. Aswell since those concussions I've been diagnosed with a severe anxiety problem and now I'm going into a highly stressful stem program in my college because it opens the most doors for me for Universities. But since then during my recovery I feel like people are constantly pitying me like I'm a charity case for being in the harder programs at my high school but mostly in sports which I took pride in playing which now I can't play any of the sports I truly love anymore.

Those are just two of the problems I face, but I feel like my world around me is compressing all against  me and there's nowhere to go which now majority of the nights I go into a depressed mood just thinking about all these things. I'm running out of options on how to get rid of these problems.",08Aug2020,1
137,So for a church challenge we were asked to make a parody of a popular musical and me and some friends and some people that are somewhat friends with me made one. I worked on majority of the lyrics however decided to have someone do the editing of me and two other people singing. When she finished editing I found that she put all of their names as the writers and my name last which I feel seems like when people look at the credits that I wrote the least when I probably wrote 80% of the parody. I’m very hurt by this and one of the girls stole half of my characters lines because she wanted to do a hairstyle close to them. What should I do? I’m honestly hurt by it and wished they gave me the credit I deserved because the girl who stole my part did not write any lyrics or edit but got a lot of credit. The song I feel also lost its value as one of my favorites since this is a baby memory that keeps being brung up whenever I listen to it.. Any advice on how to make me feel better?,08Aug2020,1

140,"Hello! I am a 24 year old female and weigh about 127 pounds. I try to workout 4-5 times a week. Although I workout, I find that it is hard for me to eat healthy sometimes. Sometimes I’ll lack energy and once in a blue moon I’ll notice my face will become pale. I feel like I am definitely lacking a vitamin. I could go to a doctor for a physical, but some doctors near me are not seeing patients physically. 

For breakfast I’ll eat some white or wheat toast with avocado and egg. For lunch It usually changes, I try to meal prep. One week I made chicken cutlet with white rice, this week I did not meal prep and had some leftovers and occasionally peanut butter and jellies (lol). For dinner, it varies but I try to incorporate steamed vegetables every night.

One thing I struggle with is my sweet tooth. I crave sweets at night. Tonight I had some strawberries with whipped cream. And once I was finished, I went back into the kitchen and put whipped cream in a cup and ate it (puppachino).

141,"Hello!

My roommate and I (living in Massachusetts) are looking for legal help regarding a situation with our landlord. Basically, we want to break our lease (states in contract either party can break at any time and we have written consent from him as well but he’s going back on his terms) and he’s threatening to sue us for the remaining balance of our lease. 

A few months ago on 3/3/20 we signed a one year lease contract with our landlord who is the owner of his own property management company. We signed the contract with the option offered to us to use either electric or oil heat. We made sure to check with him several times oil would be available as we made it aware to him that we would not be able to afford the cost for electric on top of the rent. 
3 weeks later (3/19/2020) after all was said and done and finalized, he was showing us around the basement and went to turn on the oil heater, which we discovered was broken. We received verbal and written evidence of him saying it would be fixed in a timely manner of a few weeks and that he’d also cover “above and beyond what the cost of oil would have been.” We were in regular contact with each other until it came time to deal with the payment of the bill. We took the cost of the bill out of the next months rent along with a note explaining why, and added the invoice from our electric company. The first bill was a bit higher than normal for this area. We assumed since it was the first bill maybe there were other fees associated with it and it would go down the next month. 
Come time the second electric bill came around we were sure there was something wrong. It was $200 over what it should have been for a normal household, and this was for 2 people who work every day and are never home and use one lamp and the dishwasher maybe 2 times a week. 
Our house took over a month to heat up after the electricity was turned on. All the thermostats were on and turned up to 80° sometimes in attempts to warm the house up. We have documented proof of the thermostat being at very high temperatures and the house still being 60°. We tried to reach out to him for months to get it fixed and have written and verbal proof that he ignored us. He’s being very passive aggressive about everything saying things like “sorry I’ve ignored you for the past 2 1/2 months, but never did I neglect you in an emergency situation.” We also have written proof that he went on to our side of the building without our permission and accused us of subletting because there was a bed in the basement (that my roommate and I were sleeping on because of the upstairs overheating). 
At this point we had tried to reach out to him for months about a bunch of other things wrong with the property. After the second time of taking some of our bill out of the rent check he finally reached out to us which was almost 3 months later. He sent us a letter saying we owed him the difference back up to a certain point and he’d only cover less than half of what he originally wrote to us he’d pay. We tried to set up a meeting with him to negotiate the prices he was coming up with (and also the other issues with the apartment), as we set up a spreadsheet with accurate numbers in regards to normal heating costs in our area for the lifestyle we had and other factors. He was so shady towards us that it would have been very uncomfortable to meet with him and we also didn’t want to say anything that he could try to hold against us later so we wrote him a check and called it off. Later that day he showed up to our retail job in town and I had to take care of him at the counter. He corned me in a very awkward conversation asking me about what other things were wrong with the apartment. I told him one of the issues was that our front door physically would not close, and after he left the store he proceeded to go into our unit and look at it and told us after the fact (in a text) that he couldn’t fix it and would send someone over in the morning. In the lease it states the landlord must give a 24 hours notice before going into our premises which he did not do. The person who he had come over didn’t even fix the issue and now our front door is stuck shut so now we technically only have one exit which violates fire codes of the building. My point is that we have quite a few things documented that prove we pretty much signed the contract under false pretenses and everything else he’s done wrong.
Finally the stress of all this along with the stress of covid life, my roommates medical condition has worsened and therefore bills have gone up, not to mention most of the stress is from our landlord harassing us. My roommate has decided they want to leave and had written a letter to our landlord stating we were giving our 30 day notice and that we had already paid our last month rent in the initial contract signing and we’d be leaving 30 days from the day after we contacted him. Our lease states “the tenancy may be terminated by a written notice given by either party to the other before the first day of the last 30-day rental period and shall be effective on the last day of that rental period, or thirty (30) days after such notice has been given. Landlord is entitled to pursue all remedies provided or recognized by applicable law.” We did exactly that and quoted it in our letter to him. It’s also worth it to mention that during the previous situation about the heating costs, we have a text from him saying we are more than welcome to break our lease if we weren’t happy there, no questions asked.
A day later we received a note back from him saying we didn’t state any reasons for leaving (no where does it specify that that would be necessary to terminate the lease) and that he’d be taking us to small claims court and eventually regular court if we didn’t pay him the remainder of the agreed upon total cost of rent in the contract. 

I’m just wondering if, with covid going on, this would even go anywhere in court and if it’s legally safe for us to leave anyway. We have compiled evidence of his wrongdoing and don’t really know where to go from here. We just want to leave peacefully which he gave us permission to do, and I’m afraid this will affect my future in renting another place. I can provide any other forms as well to make this all tie together better. 

Sorry for long rant, I thought it’d be helpful to include all details. Thank you in advance for any help!",08Aug2020,1

143,"Hello! 1st time posting.

So. I’ll start from the beginning, since I was 13 my one passion that I have carried with me for years is art. I would draw all the time, and was fired up for it. It was my solace in hard times. 

Anyway, I have a tough relationship with my parents, and they ended up picking my college for me. And with no financial help, I had to go. I went to a art school that didn’t have the specialty (illustration) I wanted. I also became terribly depressed, and would cry a lot during the semester because I wasn’t passionate at all about it, I was isolated etc.

I’m pretty much graduated now, and lately it’s hard for me to do my hobby...if I draw I get intense anxiety and often I can’t finish a piece, I get very unmotivated to draw because of this and feel my love is being wasted.

So the advice I want to ask for is, how do I rekindle my love for art? Or any ideas for things that might help?

144,"My anxiety, while not debilitating, is just eating me alive. There's always something on my mind that I'm anxious about. Even if I know, logically, that the anxiety is unnecessary, there's a physical reaction and it's horrible. When it's bad, my heart races and I shake, if it gets really bad I start to cry. In the past I've had to leave work because of it.

I work in customer service, and when I get into an altercation with a customer (which is bound to happen), I struggle to stand my ground because of my anxiety. I shake, my heart races, my voice waivers, etc. I despise it because I know how to deal with that but this fear of confrontation (and literally everything else) is getting in my way.

I've gone through years of psychological evaluations and working with psychiatrists, but it was mostly medication for the depression. I was once told that meds can't cure anxiety, really only you yourself can cure your anxiety. I just don't know how, though. Has anyone gone through this? Or something similar where they can help me figure out what to do and how to handle this?

145,"I live in a large city where open burning of all kinds are prohibited.  My neighbor (tenants) disregard these laws and light large fires in the open.  They often burn wet kindling and plastic, which causes a ton of smoke and noxious fumes.  This is really tough since our home doesn’t have central A/C and I would enjoy the ability to open a window for fresh air.  

This sometimes happens as early as 6AM or as late as midnight.  This has happened for the past 3 years.

Each time I call the FD or non-emergency line, they dispatch a fire truck.  They warn them sternly.  And then they let them continue to do this, every week.

This is so bad now that I called the line tonight, they sent the fire truck, and then as I was listening in, the fireman and offenders were having a jovial chat about their beer choice, and “yeah, we just have to respond to these.. but it’s no big deal”

As an asthmatic, I think it’s a pretty big deal.  Where our tax dollars are paying these fire people to slap them on the wrist and the pervasive conduct continues, I am now at a point where I can’t stand it.

Would it be permissible to douse their fire with water next time?  I want to take matters into my own hands, but it’d just escalate the situation or be called “arson”.

Long story short, I fell in love with one of them, the other one got diagnosed with cancer, it’s been a rough year on all sides and I’m now struggling with some new issues that I didn’t have before. Now when my two friends hangout without me, I suddenly get very jealous and upset. I try to make sure they don’t find out about my envious feelings, as I know it isn’t fair to either of them, but how can I make these feelings go away? Or lessen them?

I’m not even sure entirely what it is I’m scared of. I did have a toxic relationship with one of them for awhile that we have been working on, and things are a lot better now so I know that I don’t have to feel insecure or threatened about our relationship. I used to be scared that they did not like me as much as our other friend and I was jealous of their relationship with them because I wanted to have something like that. We’ve sorted it out, but sometimes I still feel my past feelings. I know I don’t have to worry anymore, but I do.

151,"I am a straight male and I've been with my girlfriend for about half a year now. We've been like best friends through most of it, always done stuff together, usually not afraid to express our feelings, it's been very easy to talk to each other from when we met up until a few weeks ago (I'll expand on this), etc.

I knew she identified as bisexual when we started dating and had no problem with it whatsoever. She was the one who asked me out first, she was the one who initiated our first time handholding, etc.

In the past few weeks, however, I noticed her talking to me a bit less and I knew something was wrong. We chatted and she expressed to me that she has been questioning her sexuality and said she has been really confused lately (her own words, not sure if this would be disrespectful wording). She thinks she might be lesbian, but my understanding is she's still figuring it out. That was devastating for me to hear and I just started balling my eyes out. We've still planned to go out on a date together in two days but I feel like this admission has brought a lot of stress on both of us.

I have never had to question my sexuality which is part of why I'm posting here asking for help. I'm so confused about what to do and I'm so confused on how this is possible. We had sex multiple times (last time she was the one who asked me, that was about two months ago though), she had previously had a very high sex drive and frequently messaged or called me saying sexual things to me (which I was totally on board for), we used to make out essentially every time we were alone together, and again SHE was the one who asked me out first and had us hold hands first. She's also had crushes for male celebrities before and told me about how she used to really like this guy in middle school. Some of this might sound stupid to mention idk, but given this, I just don't understand how this could happen.

I don't know how to cope with this and I don't know how to support her through this as well. I'd especially appreciate help from anyone who's been on either end of a situation like this before. I love her so much and don't want to lose her, but I also just don't know what I should do.",08Aug2020,1
152,"New to reddit so sorry in advance If I'm getting it wrong. 

Some back story: 

I was sexually abused as a kid by my grandfather starting on the day of my grandmothers funeral. My mom got cancer and almost died. Married and divorced my 1st step father who cheated. Then married my 2and step father who was an poopoo head narcissist who was emotionally abusive to both of us. We have also struggled financially for years. 

Mid story: 

One day I get a notification from my bank saying they have blocked my account and it is under investigation. Um WTF?! oh yeah I freaked. I was 19 and every penny I had earned was in the account so of course I call them and they just repeat that I would have to come into the branch to ""prove where my funds come from"" and ""we cant tell you anything about your account during the invesigation"". Needless to say I was a panicked wreck and was losing my mind. My mother who had heard all of this came in and sat me down saying she needed to tell me something. Now I'm not sure if any of you have had devastating news before, but my feet weren't touching the ground. She proceeds to tell that she has been stealing money from her work and that she used my account to ""launder"" the funds.  

Before I go further I should stress I love my mother more than anything and I dont for one second belive that she would have done this, had my abusive ex step father not completely destroyed her spirit. To say my mother wasnt herself is an understatement. 

My mother was tried and convicted- and has now served her time. She does genuinely seem remorseful about it. But the main issue is while she was convicted and I was never given a sentence- my life has been rattled. 
Because my bank account had been used, understandably no bank would touch me. My bank had flagged me that I had committed fraud so I was given a black mark. I cant have a bank account for 7 years. No credit nothing. My boyfriend at the time broke up with me. I feel like I lost everything and have been punished for something I had no knowladge about. I know some wont belive me, but I honestly didnt know. Losing my job, bank account, boyfriend, and everything was incredibly painful. I didnt go to college in the end and things have been miserable to say the least. I'm now 23 and desperately want to get my life back on track. I am watching my friends get married, make car and house payments talking about babies and I am stuck.

I dont know what to do. I honestly wake up every day hoping to just stay asleep because dreaming is better than waking. I dont want to die but I dont want to live. Am I the asshole? Where did it all go wrong? What can I do now?",08Aug2020,1

158,"My boyfriend and I got engaged 3 months ago, we've been together for 5 years. When we got engaged, we mutually decided we would wait until we were married to have sex again, even though we had a regular sex life beforehand. We would still mess away and get each other off, send nudes and stuff. 

He has no siblings and lives alone, he doesn't drink. 

Lately he's been seeing his friends a lot, and I've never had a reason to doubt him before, I never thought twice about it. I've never had a problem with him being friends with other women, hanging out with them, but our MUTUAL agreement is that we have boundaries against the opposite gender coming into our homes alone/going to their homes alone. That's our only rule. 

He told me his friend was over playing video games, and I called my fiance to ask him a question, but he didn't answer. I sent him a message, and sent his friend a message and asked if he would ask him to give me a call when he got a chance. The friend messaged back saying he was at work, but he'd call him when he could if I needed him to. I asked if he saw my fiance at all that day, he said he hadn't seen him in a while. I went to his house, he wasn't there, but I had a spare key so I let myself in. I walked through the house and at this point, I still wasn't sure what to think, but I trusted him, so I decided I'd just wait for him. I went to his room, and there was a used condom on the floor. I tore the room apart, which maybe I shouldn't have done, but I did, looking for anything else. I didn't find any bra or underwear, nothing, not even the wrapped to the condom. 

So I sat in the living room, pissed and crying my eyes out until he got home maybe thirty minutes later. His reaction was ""Shit baby, I was dropping \[friend's name\] off at home, what's wrong??"" like he cared. I got up and left, with him trying to talk to me the entire way out to my car. I got all the way home, he followed me, and then I started yelling at him in my driveway. I told him that I talked to his friend, that I found a condom, and that we're over. He was crying, and saying it's not what I think, it's nothing like that. 

He said he didn't use the condom on anyone, he liked to wear a condom while he was jerking off because it prevents it getting on everywhere. He said he lied about the friend coming over because he's been sexually frustrated and has been watching so much porn, and wanted to do it in peace. He swears that's what happened, he hasn't had a woman in his home, and he was gone to pick food up when I was there, he showed me that he did get food. I said I needed to be alone to think, and I'm not sure what to do, or if I should believe him at all.

164,"I feel like that my body is just going to quit on me. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. 

I (18F) am 5’4 and weigh about 180lbs. I have a work out streak of over 60days according to my Apple Watch- and have been working out much longer than that since quarantine. I also visit the Gym five times a week.

With food- I attempt to keep my meals healthy- I have tea every day and a light breakfast, skip lunch, and have dinner- and usually either snacking before that- or dessert after- always one or the other. but I don’t think that’s anything unusual for the average American diet. 

Anyway, everyday my heart will start randomly hurting- or my foot or legs or some other random body part. Right now it’s my spine. Great.

Maybe the answer is I’m doing something wrong- hurting my body more than helping it- or I’ve gone paranoid af. Either way I need to fix my dread now.",08Aug2020,1
165,"My ex (30F) and I (31M) had an unplanned pregnancy and I just found out my 2 week old daughter is in fact not mine. We've known all along there was a very slight chance it was someone else's, but all of the important details pointed to me (or so we thought). Since we were split up for the majority of the pregnancy, we planned on raising our daughter as co-parents. I have a nursery setup with a crib, clothes, diapers, etc. that I plan on either giving to my ex or returning.

&amp;#x200B;

She is handling it surprisingly well. I will support her and her child as a friend, but since we're not together I won't be assuming the role of her father. I know she is not on good terms with the actual father, but I don't know anything else about him. Luckily, she has a very supportive family and plenty of help.

&amp;#x200B;

This was tough news for me to hear, and even though I prepared myself for the possibility, I wasn't expecting it at all. Telling my friends and family will be uncomfortable for me, but most of them knew I wasn't the only potential father and are aware of our on-again off-again relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on paternity leave from work and set to return in late September. After I meet with my ex and drop off the last of my baby stuff I plan on taking some time away from home for a week or so to clear my head. My employer still thinks my ex and I are together (didn't feel like it was necessary to notify them at the time) and they are completely unaware of the potential fact that the baby was not mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

When and how should I break this news to my employer? Also, any general pointers on handling conversations with colleagues about this going forward? I know many questions will pop up about how ""my daughter"" is doing - how can I address this professionally? I suffer from a bit of social anxiety, so picturing these types of scenarios is terrifying to me.

167,"I am 26 years old and have never hugged, kissed or done anything further than that with someone of the opposite sex. I've never been in a relationship and it's starting to take a toll on me.

The problem is, I'm a ""nice guy"" and that's all I have as a personality trait. Women don't like **just** nice guys, they like guys who are smart, funny, witty, sweet, confident, interesting and ambitious. I am none of those things and I have never been any of those things my entire life.

Because of this I never asked a girl out growing up. I knew they would turn me down and in most instances I have more than enough reason and evidence to believe that. Women don't see me as boyfriend material because I'm not confident, I don't have a personality. Sure, I'm nice and thoughtful, but that's the bare minimum a person should be, I have no personality and confidence. Just being nice means you are not ready for a relationship and you aren't worth any woman's time.

I know because of this, I probably won't be able to get to be in any type of romantic relationship until I'm 30 or older. I'll have to take years to develop a personality other than just ""nice"".

I'm worried that I've wasted my life. I can't get into a relationship for a long time because who would want me? I'm just ""nice"" and nothing more. That's the bare minimum, **all it means to women is that I'm fucking boring**.  It's going to take so long to develop a personality and be cool and confident :(

I'm literally just a piece of human tissue with no personality. No woman would find that attractive and I wouldn't want to waste their time. I'm so upset that It's gonna take me 5 or more years until I can be confident and actually have a personality. I hate being just a boring ""nice"" guy. Any thoughts on what I should do?

171,"I'm going to start off with a little backstory, and hopefully it all makes sense by the end. I'm sorry if this is all over, I'm trying to remember everything I can here and some of it I was extremely young for and I'm now having a hard time remembering everything. 

When I was young, probably 10-11 my house caught on fire, and my parents never saved money back nor did they have any type of insurance, so we lost literally everything. 

After that, we bounced around from place to place for about 4 years until my dad met someone through a mutual friend who offered him a house and in return my dad would work for him. This lasted about 2 years until my mom and dad got divorced.

My mom and I moved back to the area we were originally from and got an apartment. At 18, I got my first job. At 18 I also wanted to moved out and away from my mom. My mom claimed she couldn't afford the apartment alone despite the fact she'd been doing it for 2 years before I even got a job. I moved out regardless which resulted in her letting the apartment go and she moved in with my sister. I went halfs renting a house with a really close friend of mine. This plan didn't work out the way my friend and I planned, we got sick of either other, ruined our friendship because of always been around and to close to each other, and I moved out. 

Fast forward to current day, I have a house with my girlfriend. I also have a 2 year old, and one on the way. My sister kicked my mom out and she had nowhere to go and again no money to fall back on to get a place of her own so now she's also living with us. Even if she could afford to live on her own she wouldn't, because she's ""afraid to live alone incase something was to happen"".

 I can tell her living with us isn't going to work or last long, and she has no intentions of helping herself or trying to move into her own place, however I also couldn't let her be homeless either. My girlfriend and mom fight sometimes because my mom can be a handful, shes rude at times, doesn't care what anybody thinks of her or her actions, etc.

What should I do here? How do I tell my mom I don't want to live with her forever but in a way that doesn't come off badly? Where I'm at now, it's almost as if I have to pick between keeping my girlfriend or kicking my mom out and her be homeless. I'm lost and have no idea how to approach the situation.",08Aug2020,1
172,"Over the last year or so my brother in law and his fiancé both really got into Pokémon go. My husband (his brother) and I aren't the biggest fans but it can be fun when we have the time and it's time with his brother. They have invited us out twice now. My husband has had to work both times. The first time was at the same time as my dad's birthday dinner, so I politely decline, which their response was ""yea, yea sure."" The second time I was looking forward to going, but I wasn't able to get off work as early as I needed to in order to make it. I texted them when I got off, but they weren't out anymore. 

Now they won't invite us to any; Pokémon, family game night at their house, dinner at their house. Anything. We have found out my husband's parents have been assuming that their children still talk to each other and that they have been inviting us to family game night at the parent's house, but they haven't for a while now. His brother and his fiancé also kind of barge their way into mom's and dad's place, so the parents haven't planned a game night in a while.

After the first invite, his fiancé made a comment last holiday season at a damily gathering that she only invites someone once and if they don't show up, she never invites them again. That seemed odd back then, but now it's been all I can think about since they basically refuse to invite us now. So am I the jerk here and what can I do to fix this?

Recently we’ve been playing Minecraft together and having a lot of fun. We had joined a Pixelmon server and liked it a lot, so we decided to apply as staff to the server. I got Builder first, and convinced her to join and get builder with me. The other staff members were all so incredibly nice and they’re all amazing. One of the staff members, (we’ll call him Citrus) Is a really sweet and cute guy a year older than me. I really wanted to become friends with him, and honestly I though I might’ve liked him for a little bit but he lives far far from me and I can’t do long distance relationships, so I’m passing. But my good friend, Honey, is getting very ‘possessive’ of me and also very jealous because he likes me, and I’m pretty sure he has a crush. I feel horrible because every time he says something nice to me, like he calls me cute, she leaves or she gets upset. I tell her countless times that I don’t like him in that way and I never will, but she doesn’t listen. He’ll constantly give me little gifts on Minecraft and when he does she’ll just avoid me. I feel so lonely because she’s currently my only good friend that I have right now, she knows me better than anyone. I can’t go to anyone else about this because she would’ve been the person I would have gone too.

176,"To be clear, she is 3 years old and healthy. As a Chipin, odds are she will live atleast another 10 or 12 years. 

Just some backstory:

I took her in when she was a year and a half old from an older lady that had cancer and was unable to take care of her anymore. It was a sad thing... She was underweight because she had issues eating the big, dry food she was being fed from the dollar store, she was coated in fleas and had patches of hair missing and I doubt she had ever regularly had her nails trimmed... They were horrifically long and beginning to curl and she is still terrified of having them done. When I think about this, I start to get pissed off but I have to remind myself that she is fine and healthy now and that this woman was sick and she eventually did the right thing. 

I'm not too sure what that has to do with this outside of the fact that I am insanely grateful that she gave her to me. She is my first dog ever and even though I have always loved animals, I had never known that I could honestly get this attached to a dog. She is my best friend and the one little soul on this planet that I can count on. She sleeps next to me with her head on the pillow and her arm around my shoulders every night, she is there to comfort me on even the crappiest day, she goes everywhere possible with me and even when she can't, my returning home and the reaction of pure joy I get from her lets me know that there is someone, somewhere that couldn't imagine life without me. I just flat out love this dog.

But, sometimes, and honestly it is too often, while she is laying with me while I'm watching TV or we are playing with her toys, I will have the involuntary thought of ""Oh god, what will I do when you're gone?"" And it eats me up inside. I will literally burst into tears or go into a full on anxiety attack thinking about it and I can't drop it for days. I will sit here and think about having her cremated and where I would put that tiny box and go so far as to even look for people near me who do pet cremations so that I am prepared. 

I try to remind myself that that is just life and I will have to accept it and enjoy the time I have with her, but it's hard knowing that my best friend will die way before I will and it sucks. How can I stop having these intrusive thoughts?

179,"I (22 f) and my boyfriend (25 m) have been together for a year. It is the only relationship I’ve ever been in and it’s going great. 

One thing that’s stressing me out is our differences in sex drives. His is very high to the point where he’s in the mood all the time and mine is fairly low. He’s absolutely amazing at sex and I’m extremely attracted to him. However, there are many periods where I aggressively do not want to do anything sexual at all. And these can last weeks at a time to the point where I’ve pretended to be in the mood. If we only had sex when I was in the mood, we’d barely have sex. I’m perfectly content to spend time watching tv with him, going on walks, playing games, and literally any form of quality time. 

I also want to add that he’s not pushy at all. In fact, once he starts to sense that I’m not in the mood, he’ll insist on stopping. However, I still do feel guilty when he’s clearly in the mood for sex and is consistently getting turned down. I’m worried that at some point it will affect our relationship and his self esteem in a bad way. 

Other than the occasional fling, I’ve never been in a relationship so I never noticed my seemingly low libido til I started dating. I have had few partners and didn’t grow up in a sex positive place at all so I’m completely in the dark. I know there’s no ‘standard’ and people are different, but I’d like to know you guys’ personal thoughts. I keep hearing these horror stories about relationships that fell apart due to the more sexual partner’s needs not being met.

Now it’s like she will talk to me once in a blue moon. I don’t know what to make of all of this, but I do know that I’m still hurt, but also kinda want to wish her happy birthday. Even though she never wishes me one anymore. 

In fact, she went as far as to comment on a post that involved me the day before my birthday, (and we very briefly chatted when I asked a question). So I was kinda hoping she would wish me a happy birthday the next day so that we could at least be on speaking terms, but she didn’t. And I doubt she would just forget after the many years where we would both call each other on our birthdays to talk. 

I’m just so hurt and confused on how to feel. I’ve tried for years to let go but I’m just so sad and angry. 

She probably didn’t know, but I suffered the most I have ever suffered several years ago. And I tried to reach out, but she didn’t really understand. So I just stopped trying. And then my world fell apart. It was like I was dying every single day. 

I’m better(ish) now. But I’m still haunted by the memories we shared because I don’t know what to do with them. They still mean a lot to me even though she isn’t in my life anymore.

183,"To give some background on my situation, currently I (14f)live in Country X, I don’t fluently speak the language neither does my brother, it is a difficult language to learn without a proper education of it. 

My mother(48f) fluently speaks X Language, english is her second language and she is pretty good at English as well. My dad(47m) can speak both languages, but english is his first and he can read in language X. My brother(12m) can only speak english, and I can speak english and language X but I struggle to articulate my thoughts and can’t read. I can get barely get through a conversation. I am better with dialects and slang than he is, but my dad is better with proper grammar and stuff. 

Recently, my brother, mother, and I moved to country X. In a new house with only three suitcases and two bags. Our father had to stay in a different country for work so he can’t rlly help us. 

My mom has been making us go with her everywhere to buy furniture and stuff for the house, and we have only been living here for about ten days. We were in an hotel for four months before. 

My brother and I can’t really meet people or make friends because of the language barrier, and we can’t really talk to anyone but ourselves so it’s been hard for us. My mom has been meeting with our aunts, grandparents, and our cousins. But it’s really uncomfortable and hard for us to talk with them, and my mom and her family have some beef going on. 

My mom doesn’t let me call my friends in America anymore because it uses too much data. 

So I proposed that since we’ve been living here long enough, we should be setting up wifi instead of relying on data because it’s pricy, and we’ll run out. 

She said “I’ve been busy.” 

I know that she isn’t THAT busy. She had time to watch TV and take naps all day yesterday, and call her siblings and talk all day on the phone about nothing in particular. 

“So, when will you be free?” I asked. I didn’t want to upset her by calling her out.

“Well. You have free time, you set it up.”

“I’m fourteen, I can’t read language X, I literally can’t,” I explain.

“You know how to, figure it out you’re old enough.” She ends the conversation and flies on another phone call. 

So I am still annoyed that she isn’t setting it up, but I decide that if she isn’t going to and my brother can’t, I should try. So I go online and I start searching for how to, and I discover that it will take 3-4 weeks to set it up. Which overlaps with the start of school for me. My school may be online and if I don’t have wifi I can’t start.

Thing is, even when I do get to that point it seems like I will still be stuck. It's gonna be hard to make friends or socialize since venues and any events(cons, festivals, movies, etc) are gonna be closed or really limited at least, even martial arts which is actually something I enjoyed. And then what's been getting me down and a bit angry is the fact I've never dated, and have even been envious seeing or hearing about people who have girlfriends. It's made me have some funks where I feel very down and hopeless, especially considering I have Asperger's Syndrome, had to deal with a dysfunctional family for years(still am) and didn't have the media depiction of teenage years. The fact my mom has accused me of being gay due to the lack of a relationships doesn't help matters. Plus you hear all these things of people who dating in their late 20s or 30s or got friends but I've already felt lonely for the vast majority of my life, I don't want to wait almost another decade if not more for things to get better.

191,"I’ve always done well in school and sports but struggled socially. I’ve always been awkward and had trouble making friends. I have a lot of anxiety. Even though I feel like I “know” a lot of people
And many people tell me Im really funny, They’re not really friends. I don’t get invited. 

Im currently in sophomore and I feel like I don’t fit in anywhere. I go to a top 20 school. It feels super cliquish and political. I feel like there is no social life unless you’re in Greek life. I got rejected from a frat where my really good friend was the rush chair and promised me a bid. I didn’t make it past round one. 

My school is online so I’m staying with my dad for the summer and I guess the fall. I love him and he cares a lot about me but he’s suffocating and I feel like I don’t have real freedom. My dad moved to a new city, so the only people I know are my dad and my coworkers, who are a bunch of racists and I don’t really want to be friends with them. 

I just feel like I hate every aspect of my life. I want to move to nyc or la and pursue film.  have a lot of money so I could live somewhere else but with COVID moving out doesn’t seem like the wisest or productive, it’s not like I can really do much. I feel like all my friends at college don’t really care about me and I feel suffocated at home.",08Aug2020,1

How do I know I won't die alone on the streets. A friend once told me that there's gonna be a time where the choices you make will define you the rest of your life. That one year will decide whether you die alone on the streets or live a proud and happy life.

199,"So I was outed as Bisexual to my mom a few years ago and way before I wanted it to happen. Now just a month ago I came out to my mom as a Lesbian. I was crying and a sobbing mess, my mom insisted that I was stressing myself out about my identity and shouldn't worry about that stuff yet. (I'm turning 18 in a month) She thinks the main contender behind my depression and Anxiety is the fact that i ""think i'm gay"" but that's not it, I KNOW i'm gay.

Anyways, my aunt (we'll call her S) and my mom (M) have always been super close and S has always been what I thought to be the supportive, cool, wine aunt. S's daughter texted me awhile ago and it was a texting conversation between S and M.

M: the more i think about it the more i doubt that B (me) Is gay.

S: Exactly, some kids are just looking for some way to feel welcome

M: I know! she's always been weird with her writing stories and i know she has liked some guys.

This hurts a lot, because my mom had always told me my stories are good and she thinks i could make a career out of it. But now my own mom calling me weird? And the fact that she doubts my identity makes it worse, I'm starting to notice more and more how she pushes some guys on me.

I'm 19f. My little brother is 11. He likes to watch those youtube videos where someone feeds reddit posts into a voice generator and reads them out loud.

I'm sure the videos he watches are mostly harmless, but my protective older sister instinct makes me worry he'll stumble across something violent or sexually explicit or just...bad.

I talked to my dad about this and he wasn't completely convinced. I'm looking for tips on how to convince him -- I think he wants more solid evidence than what I talked to him about (which is basically what's above).

but now im here again, i read a philosophy book and kinda just feel like im wasting my time.
i dont want to pursue a career in animating or anything art related, no doubt freelancing would be nice but other than strictly for commission work i dont see any point in doing art anymore. the thing is, art is like all i do, without it id do nothing. its become my main source of entertainment and i struggle to find anything else to do. i feel like what i make currently has no real purpose and isnt worthwhile, if i was to continue id wanna make something meaningful and make the ""audience"" feel something. but i dont have an interest in realism or landscapes or anything like that and the process of making comics bores me. im just kinda stumped on what to do with myself. where do i go from here? 

i dont have any friends to hangout with and im not a fan of socializing in general, i prefer being alone and doing things alone, but i also have extremely bad social anxiety so leaving the house on my own is a challenge in itself. i have little to keep me busy and have yet to graduate highschool and dont have a clue what i wanna do with my life which is a whole other problem.

I believe that there’s a deeper issue going on with her, however, based on the way she’s been engaging in conversation with me, I fear that if I were to address it, she might take it the wrong way making things worse. She’s very prone to panic attacks and I don’t want to provoke one. However, I don’t want her taking her frustrations out on me. How can I go on about this? 




I am in a friend group of four girls. For the sake of this post, I’ll call them Jane, Stacy and Emily. 

Just for some context: Jane and I have been friends since our freshman year of high school. We’re both 18 and just graduated. Stacy is 17 and entering her senior year. We started to become close friends with Stacy our junior year. Emily was a foreign exchange student our senior year and is now 18 years old. She returned to her home country about three months ago. Ever since we met Emily last year, we’ve become a really close friend group despite the long distance. 

With the exception of Emily (due to different time zones and circumstances), we talk pretty much every single day through our groupchat and have frequent zoom calls. Emily will sometimes engage whenever she has the chance. We have never gotten in big fights and I would say we’re pretty unproblematic for the most part. 

That was the case until these past few days...

It all started when I was on a zoom call with Jane and Stacy earlier this week. Jane was singing a song and I jokingly said, “Damn it now you got it stuck in my head.” We were going back and forth and Jane jokingly mutes me. It ultimately turns into a roast session. We know each other well enough so it really wasn’t a big deal. Jane then makes a remark about my sex life. I’m not particularly a sensitive person so I really didn’t care. I was going to clap back by also making a remark about her sex life, however I stopped myself because I thought that maybe I was crossing a line so I said, “Actually never mind. I think that’s enough for tonight haha”. Stacy then says, “Oh I think I know what you were going to say”. Jane didn’t like that and kept asking us what we were talking about. 

Again, I didn’t want to cross a line so I said that we should drop it for the night. She gets really upset and leaves the call. We then ask her in the groupchat if she was okay and she told us that she was having a panic attack. She explained to us that we made her overthink all the things she’s ever done. I felt really shitty about it and I apologized to her. I never intended to make her upset, but that didn’t change the fact that she was obviously upset. Eventually, we sort things out. 

A couple nights later, we were talking in the groupchat as usual. I was watching Euphoria and making fun of certain aspects of the show. This was nothing out of the ordinary for me. I make fun of shows, movies, songs etc all the time even if I like them. Even my friends engage in the same banter. However, Jane sent a long paragraph that read along the lines of, “Well I didn’t really like the show either but I hate it when people have negative things to say about things other people like. They’re entitled to their opinions, too.” 

It really threw me off but I decided to brush it off. Then, I made a comment about how the website I was watching the show on was probably going to give my computer a virus. Jane then responds with, “Well you don’t even like the show so idk why you’re still on it.” I was taken aback again but I brushed it off. Finally, I made a comment about how Euphoria had some similarities to another show I really enjoyed and this kind of set her off. She said, “Well isn’t that how all shows work??? Either way, that show probably wasn’t the first one to do it so...” 

I was finally fed up with the attitude over something as trivial as a TV show so I finally said, “Girl are you okay? I can feel the attitude through the screen”. And that’s where I fucked up. I admit that perhaps I was harsh because next thing you know, she sends a snap of herself clearly in tears. I apologize once again because I admit that perhaps I was reading too much into everything. However, I couldn’t help but notice that something was terribly off in the way she usually engages in conversation. I asked her if everything was okay and all she told me was that she was tired and to just “forget about it.” I didn’t want to make things worse so I respect her wishes and drop the conversation. It all eventually blew over. 

Fast forward to last night...

She told the groupchat that she wanted to try shrooms. Knowing her opinions on drugs, I jokingly said, “Okay Miss. ‘I don’t want to do drugs’ lol”. We’ve all made similar jokes in the past so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. Then she responds with, “I said I didn’t want to do HARD chemical drugs”. I then explained to her that drugs are drugs and that “hard” drugs aren’t necessarily exclusive to “chemical” drugs and that she should be careful with any drug she wants to try. This set her off....once again. She said, “Well I never said anything about hard drugs. What’s wrong with me not wanting to do chemical drugs? All I said is that I wanted to try shrooms jeez...Idk why we’re talking about hard drugs.” 

I was starting to get really angry and frustrated. Despite this, I decided not to say anything because I didn’t want to make things worse. I’m starting to think that this isn’t about a show or drugs and that there’s a deeper issue going on. Worst of all, she seems to only go after me. Not Stacy. What’s even more frustrating is that I feel alone in all of this. Stacy doesn’t say anything even though she sees it happening. As for Emily, she’s not in the groupchat often so she’s not really aware of what’s going on. 

I decided to stay up really late last night to talk to Emily about the whole situation and get a second opinion. The reason why I didn’t want to talk to Stacy about it was because (as much as I love her) she’s not exactly a reliable person. I’ve told her secrets in the past only to find out that she told her boyfriend and her boyfriend told his friends about it. This is a sensitive topic and I don’t want Jane knowing about it until I can find a way to properly go on about the situation. Not to mention, she tends to be a fence sitter when it comes to things like this because she doesn’t want to offend anyone. 

Anyways, I talk to Emily about it and she agrees that Jane has been really off lately which explains her change in attitude (Btw, even though Emily doesn’t engage in the groupchat nowadays, she still reads everything we send when she has the chance so she’s not entirely out of the loop). 

The real challenge is finding a way to address the issue. Jane is extra sensitive. There’s nothing wrong with being sensitive, however, it can be challenging to talk to her without her taking anything personal and potentially putting her in another anxiety attack. Even though I’m not necessarily as sensitive, I don’t appreciate being used as an outlet for her frustrations. If I try to talk to her about it, I fear that she might take offense to it. Like I said, I think there’s a deeper issue going on with Jane. The Jane I know would have never gone off me over something a petty as a TV show or drugs. 

Perhaps I’m reading too much into everything, but like I said, this is very out of the ordinary for her. I still care deeply about Jane and want to sort this out. 

I appreciate any feedback. Thanks!",08Aug2020,1
209,"Hi everyone. As someone who is going through IVF, I’m part of a bunch of infertility internet groups. I saw something on one of my infertility groups that was deeply concerning to me, and I wanted to get everyone’s take on what, if anything, to do. I can’t tell if I’m being a judgmental jerk, and I need perspective. 

One of the women in one of my groups is currently going through IVF. She posted some things that were alarming for various reasons, things that displayed some pretty glaring inconsistencies, so I looked into her. I found out the following. 

She already has 5 children between the ages of ~2 and ~7. She does not have custody of these children, nor does she pay child support for any of them. It appears she doesn’t even have visitation—nor is she apparently making any attempts to get them back. She was recently sued for child support and didn’t even respond. Yet somehow, she is paying for IVF out of pocket.

She apparently got her tubes tied when she was married to the father of her children, thus the IVF.

The person with whom she is attempting to have a baby is currently on parole for having killed his own infant son, basically by shaking him in anger. He was just released from prison after pleading guilty about a decade ago and is currently on a registry for people who have committed crimes against children. I don’t even know whether he is allowed to be around children. 

As far as I’m aware, the reason the father of her existing children won’t let her have visitation is because he does not feel safe letting his own children spend time with someone who killed his own son. Understandable. But she has apparently elected to stay with this person anyway, in effect choosing him over her own children.

She has been with this person for about a year. They aren’t married. That alone isn’t an issue. But as far as I can tell, she is the kind of person who is constantly in a relationship, and always thinks that person is “the one.” There are just a lot of red flags there. 

Their first IVF ended in early miscarriage. Since then, the man who killed his child has apparently left her. Today she announced that despite this, she is going forward with another embryo transfer, this time transferring two. She goes on and on about how she wants twins. I don’t even know if she has consent from the “father” to do this. She keeps saying she’s “going at it alone” because “being a mother is [her] calling.” But she already is a mother, and by all accounts she has failed miserably at that. 

There are other reasons I feel her doing IVF is a terrible idea, but these are the big ones. I feel like this child is absolutely doomed, and that doing IVF in this circumstance is unethical. I understand that the clinic likely doesn’t know about any of this, and I’m not suggesting that IVF clinics should necessarily do deep dives into people’s backgrounds before determining whether to take them on as a patient. 

As someone who is desperate for children, I am furious and disgusted. Am I overreacting? How would you all feel, if you learned this information? Would you do anything about it? Should I do anything about it? Is there anything to do? 

Thanks for reading.",08Aug2020,1

212,"Hello, F here.

I really need help.
On Reddit, I‘ve posted something on a friendship-related sub because I was trying to find some friends that I can regularly talk with. There were a few people that I talked to but I wasn‘t really thrilled about them? They stopped talking to me and I thought ""Hey, just search again!"". 

Then I‘ve met someone and we became friends really quick! I will call him Eric. 
We exchanged numbers and started talking EVERYDAY on iMessage and I swear to god, whenever we both woke up, we instantly texted eachother and I loved it very much. Due to my 'clingyness' I always lost my friends because they felt uncomfortable and overwhelmed and even though that changed, I was still worried that he might feel the same way. But he didn‘t. He said that he feels values and hearing that, made me so happy.

We talked and talked for hours without a single problem. Then I once showed him my drawings ( I‘m a digital artist and I always draw myself in that chibi cutesy-wutsy style ) and since I don‘t sugarcoat anything, and draw myself EXACTLY how I look like in real life, ( curvy, short ) he, out of nowhere asked me if: ""show me a picture of you, I want to see if you really look like that irl 😂 "".

I didn‘t feel uncomfortable. At first I laughed it off but then I began to worry. I‘ve sent him multiple selfies of my face, I told him that I took them recently and that a full bod pic, would be useless because he already knows how I look like. There‘s no other excuse to be wanting a fullbody picture. Anyway, until that little ""fight"" we had, he didn‘t talk to me anymore. He said he was quite busy and I believed him.

Since I was always the one doing the first move, this time I expected HIM to apologize because I did feel bummed out. But I wasn’t mad or anything. He sent me two body pictures ( old ones ) as well, so I thought he wanted to have one too. I hated myself for throwing that tantrum. I apologized and hoped that everything would be normal again. Now thats morning again for me ( I live somewhere else ) now it has to be nighttime for him.

I really don‘t want to sound like a stalker.. but when I was on instagram, I saw our messages and it said that he was online an hour ago. That must’ve been ca.. 11 PM for him? I dunno. Also on Reddit after 7 days, he replied to a comment and that was 5 hours ago. When I was asleep, I told them to text me whenever he was free from his work. Whatever it is, if he was on his phone but didn‘t reply to my messages, then it means I really messed up.. we always said goodnight to eachother and now we don‘t even do that anymore.. I just don‘t know what to do.
He‘s so distant and I swear, I won‘t find any other friend that is so understanding, without any sexual undertone, being so fun to talk to everyday. Now I‘ve ruined it all and its my fault..

A few hours before that 'incident', we talked about never losing touch and now because I refused to send him a body pic, I‘ve ruined it all. I even told him that he wasn‘t the first one that asked me. 
When I was younger, I had some ""friends"" that wanted to see how my body looks like and when I refused, they were defensive and upset for .. no reason.
I was young, stupid and naive, I thought the only way to keep my friends, is to always make them satisfied without thinking about my own feelings. Now I can say ""No"" easier but now I know that was a terrible mistake..
Now, of course some of you will probably say ""if he can‘t handle it, then you should cut the ties, he doesn‘t seem to be a good friend"" 
I understand but I don‘t want to believe that yet. He made me so happy these past weeks, I forgot about my dark thoughts that I had. Because I felt so distracted talking to him and even he admitted that he feels the same way, since he had a breakdown a few weeks ago and I thought ""hey, this will be a wonderful friendship!"" 

But now I made everything worse and I hate myself. I‘m always the one ruining friendships, its always my fault. I don‘t even deserve being happy. What should I do? Please help me..",08Aug2020,1

219,"I (22F) became friends with this girl (24F) who’s was my upperclassman about a year ago. She seemed really nice and was always telling me how cool she thought I was. 

I’m really glad we became friends because we have a lot in common (ADHD, same interests, same taste in music, same doubts), and she gives really great advice and is very supportive. I care about her and appreciate her presence in my life. However, I fear I cant ever match the affection and love she has for me and has been making so clear to me recently. 

In the past we’d just been talking every now and the and giving advice when needed, which felt very nice and natural. She mail ordered me a plate when I was studying abroad and didn’t have one. :) We would also get to hang out from time to time whenever she was in town.

Recently however, she has become a lot more intense. We seem to talk every single day about deep subjects like the meaning of love and the universe, and almost daily tells sends me walls of text explaining how happy she is to know me and how much she appreciates me and how lucky she is to be my friend. I don’t mind this on occasion, it’s nice to know I’m appreciated but recently it has just become too much for me. I have run out of responses to her heartfelt confessions of passion for me and I feel almost awkward receiving such affection. Today she told me that she has always felt drawn to me and how she felt like she was destined to be my friend. She also commented that she can’t believe she hasn’t “messed things up with me yet.” 

I didn’t have many friends growing up, and most of the friends I do have now are close but no where near this affectionate, so I don’t know if it’s me who is just too socially awkward to handle this level of affection and platonic intimacy, but it’s beginning to make me extremely anxious and nervous. 

I am anxious because I don’t think I am even capable of feeling just HALF the love and affection she feels for me and am certainly incapable of retiring the same amount of love back, and I know if she knew this or would DEVASTATE her. Is there something wrong with me? Why don’t I feel the same passionate excitement she describes for me when I talk to her? Of course I care about her and want to be her friend but I don’t think I can handle this. I feel extremely awkward about everything and I am starting to fear she is becoming over attached to me or even dependent on me. I want to continue being her friend but not like this, and I mean it in the kindest way possible. It’s just starting to take its toll on my mental health. 

I am terrified and I have no idea what to do. Am I really that unfeeling and cold? Is this normal behavior for friends? How do I make myself love her this much too? 

TL;DR: I have a very kind and generous friend who has helped me through a lot, but recently she has become extremely affectionate and attached to the point of my own discomfort because I don’t think I can return this level of love she gives to me. Is this normal for friends to worship each other like this? Am I just that unfeeling?",08Aug2020,1

221,"So i have a friend(10th grade) and in the past month has been talking to many girls. He finds a girl online like through YUBO and talks to them for less then a day then says they are dating. A few days or less later the girl calls it off with my friend and then my friend tells our friend group what happened and becomes very saddened. He starts talking to more girls after that, has a two day relationship, breaks up then he becomes even sadder. I comfort him everytime but i have never gotten the courage to tell him that maybe he should take a break for a little bit. Some kids at our school are finding out about this and are thinking him as a creep and weird. I want what’s best for him but i don’t know how to tell him. Does anyone know what i should say?

I just don’t really buy things for myself. I always convince myself not to.  Anyways I’ve been wanting to get this thing that costs around $200 but I just can’t bring myself to ask my parents to let me buy it (since it’s online and all that). I know it’s something I want since I’ve been looking at it for months and I’ve been saving up to still have a certain amount of money still left incase of any emergencies. However I just got $200 from a few side jobs and my parents are always telling me to save up and save up. But I feel like if I ask them to get it they will think I’m not responsible or something.

223," Never told me why she stop talking to me, not even when I asked her, everytime I tried to talk her back or something she just said, she was busy, she didn't have time to speak, she was studying, She didn't wish to speak with me cause she was tired or something else, and all that for a whole 2-3 weeks, so I just stop bothering her and waited for her to text back, she did, 4 months later, I asked her why she ghosted or didn't speak did it she asked if I was mad at her (I wasn't), never gave me a reason, got mad at me for asking her again just a small reason, and left again for approximately a whole year, everytime in the university just avoided talking with me or being near me with her new friends, hell not even looking in my direction (Which for me was kinda funny and insulting at the same time) didn't care and didn't think about it the next months. She just greeted me an hour ago and send me a friend invitation.

229,"I moved in with my boyfriend and a roommate (which is one of our good friends) back in January. We have a dog and our roommate has a dog. I used to really love his dog before living with him, but now that I’ve seen how possessive he is and just how annoying he can be, I’ve started to develop a hatred which is really not like me. I’ve loved all animals for as long as I can remember. I’m even going to school to be a vet tech and I study constantly about dog training as well. My roommate never buys his dog toys or treats which has been frustrating for me. I spoil my dog, I buy her expensive, healthy treats and really good quality toys. His dog steals all of her toys and destroys them. He also was very aggressive to her when he first moved in with us which made me think differently. My dog was still a puppy and she was learning to socialize when he was very possessive &amp; would growl at her for no reason... She couldn’t even look at him without him growling at her. Even now, 8 months later, he still growls at her and attacks her even though she’s triple his size. Anyway, I’m having trouble living in the same house as him, it’s as if I get triggered every time I see him growl at her or steal something of hers. Our roommate knows about him stealing toys, so I always keep them off the ground and I’ve given him all of her old ones. Also, he constantly comes running every time I’m giving my dog treats, so I always give some to him as well but now it’s gotten to the point where I have a strong hatred towards him and don’t even like petting him or walking him anymore. He’s disobedient, doesn’t listen and has aggression problems. I want to like him, but every since he started being rude to my dog, it’s made me angry. I’ve never disliked an animal before, I want to like him but I truly don’t even think he’s cute because of the way he acts. What do I do? How do I stop hating him?! He’s just a dog, I want to spoil him and love him as well, but I can’t seem to get over the way he acts &amp; treats my dog.

I want to talk to people who have better experience  in life. Yes, I am aware that the plot is fiction but it's plausible and that has depressed me. Plot is below but do women like this exist? Do scenarios like this happen? I'm in a mentally conservative society so maybe it doesn't happen here but I'm not sure.

One day MC and bald dude have sex with their individual girls in the same room (not sure if it  a foursome, partners don't get exchanged). This happens for a time. Then one day before their session starts bald dude starts having sex with both girls and MC watches (a bit shocked). He tries to join later. Bald dude stops him but then does shit to get MC's crush 'ready' for sex. MC has sex with crush. It keeps getting worse for MC, bald dude keeps having threesomes with the girls and sends pics to the MC showing his achievements. Bald dude is unaware MC has a crush on the girl.

Hey all! I hope everyone is doing well. I just dealt with something I’m not proud of. I’m 22 and a recent college graduate living at home due to COVID-19 and Quarantine. I wasn’t the best teen to my parents (mostly lying and arguing with them) but I got my act together but tonight something happened that mirrored events from my high school days.

244,"( I want to preface this. I never pursued anyone else while being in a relationship.)

This one is a bit of a long one. I wasn't sure how to even *ask* this as its a bit of a complicated situation. I've tried to cut it down as much as I can, but I usually only come to reddit when I feel completely at a loss. So heres the full thing.

I met a guy named Ben a few years ago my sophomore year of college. The nature of our relationship was purely academic and I tried as hard as I could to get him out of my head the following years. He was a teaching assistant for a biology class I was taking. He's almost 8 years older than me. He never made any moves, and neither did I. Fast forward to the start of my senior year. Still thought about him. Had an overwhelming feeling that I'd never experienced that I *needed* to talk to him. Added him on instagram and we talked for months straight. Never saw each other in person while talking online. Then, he moved away for an internship and figured he wouldn't be coming back for a few years. At this point I still convinced myself our relationship was platonic until he asked me out to dinner when he came to visit some friends over spring break. So now my crush had turned into full fledged feelings. Id never had feelings for someone this strong, but he had no idea when hed be moving back. I was supposed to be moving in with my sister even farther from him after I graduated. He expressed maybe wanted to move across the country. He never ended up doing that. I ended up realizing id be graduating late, and he told me he may be coming back to my school to work with the biology program he was a TA for. Didn't end up doing that either. We sort of lost touch for a while.

Neither of us ever confirmed what our ""relationship"" was to each other or if we were seeing other people at all, or if we were just talking. But there were obvious feelings on both sides. I went on a few dates with someone while still talking to Ben. Never told Ben. Ben never mentioned any girls. He still expressed how much he liked me and all the things he'd do with me (this sounds sexual when in reality he's never been that forward with me?) and I expressed how much I wanted him here. We started facetiming a few months ago. Things got more flirty. This made us even closer. Still no talk of the relationship. Just sort of danced around it while still telling each other how much we meant to each other. Talked about the future without talking about our future.

Now heres where the boyfriend comes in. Ben got a pretty good job a few months ago and stopped talking to me as much. (I figured it was because of the job, but.. who knows.) I met my (now ex) boyfriend, Matthew. Matthew was someone who flat out told me he'd been with a lot of other girls. I told Matthew I've only had one boyfriend before, and was very direct that Ben is someone I think of often, and was worried about starting a relationship with anyone even though Ben lives far away. Matthew was never weird about Ben. He said he trusted me completely and never saw Ben as a threat.

Heres where it sucks. Matthew is here for school and is moving to another country in a year. So i was already worried about getting closer to him, and then having him be even farther than Ben ever was. Matthew expressed that although his feelings for me are stronger than anyone he's ever been with before, that he's nervous he'd do what he normally does in relationships, and end them fairly quick. He said its hard for him to keep feelings. We went strong for about a month and a half. (We were friends for months before we confirmed anything.. so it feels like longer.) I opened up my heart to him in a way that i never had for anyone. We were incredibly intimate which was also very new for me, and something ive always been anxious about since I know Ben has also had more relationships (and obviously more sex) than me. Matthew started acting different, wasnt able to focus on school or work as much. Stopped talking to me less. I figured something was going on.

He broke up with me today. Says he still has intense feelings, but cant be in a relationship right now . I have no reason to believe hes lying. Hes the most honest person Ive ever had anything with. We sobbed together. It really, really hurts. Even though I know hed be moving in a year anyways. And even though I know in the back of my head i wasn't fully able to be there mentally in our short relationship considering how often I still think about Ben, and how I know i would always wonder about Ben if i continued dating Matthew.

I haven't told Ben about Matthew. I have no idea if I need to. He's talked about us visiting each other, but the last time he asked if i could come visit i said no. Im wondering if I should make the trip. Id feel comfortable enough to tell him about Matthew if I make the trip, but i feel dishonest not telling him about it now. I mean, we haven't even had a serious talk about our relationship.

Everything with Matthew hurts so incredibly bad but Im wondering if this is a sign to fully commit to trying to figure out what could happen with Ben? If that its good that it happened now, instead of getting closer to Matthew and then having him move away anyways? I knew he never would've wanted to do long distance, even though he never said.

I just wonder if Ive officially fucked everything up with Ben. Im thinking of calling him next week but I have no idea what I should say. We know we like eachother. But we dont know what eachother does during the week. Who eachother sees. What we want someday, or if wed want anything with eachother. I think it may be a lot more serious, and ( a bit obsessive) on my end.

Any advice is appreciated. I know I probably sound like a very immature person, considering how Ive handled everything, and what I have and have not communicated. I think it in part has to do with severe anxiety (not that this is an excuse to be immature) but also just inexperience with relationships as a whole.",08Aug2020,1

I feel like I’ve failed her. I don’t know if I have the energy to get myself back to where I was. I was so depressed and anxious for so long. 

I didn’t drink alcohol, didn’t do drugs, didn’t go on vacation, didn’t buy games, didn’t buy clothes, cut out TV, put all of my hobbies on pause, I was working two jobs for a year. 60+ hours a week. It all just died on me. 

I don’t know how to be what will make her happy again. I feel so worthless.

251,"Hi, my crush on my teacher first started in the 9th grade. It ended around my junior year. (Rising senior f17) I came here because even though I no longer have feelings for him I still feel hurt and disturbed by all of it. I feel disturbed because he never shut down my feelings. I'm not sure if teachers can tell when a student has feelings for them but I'm positive he did. He didn't necessarily reciprocate them but he never tried to stop them and I feel that he encouraged it. It hurts that no one will believe me, I have no proof. But I know because of the way he would act around me. He stared at me constantly, encouraged me to come eat with him during lunch. One time I had to do a presentation and he told me to come during his free period, we were the only ones in the room and he locked the door.  He seemed to get jealous when I was around guys. I've been questioning this for the past two years and I know this isn't all in my head. I hate that I have to live with this and he gets to keep on working with minors while acting like nothing happened. I met him when I was 14. It's so disturbing. I know no one will believe me and honestly some days I doubt myself too. What do you guys think?",08Aug2020,1

257,"I was in, what felt like to me, a long-term relationship with a girl who I absolutely adored. We had been friends for years before we dated and we were a part of the same friend group as well, with my friends and her friends overlapping in the best possible way. However, within the last couple days, I got a breakup text that completely blindsided me and accused me of toxic traits I had that hurt her. She claims, and I agree, that I manipulated her, despite the fact that I wasn’t even aware I was doing it (we had an argument about something similar the month prior but my efforts to fix it were too focused on specific aspects and failed to fix the greater whole of my manipulation.) and caused her to lose herself. While I don’t want to underscore her, because I trust that what she is saying is true, I didn’t get a chance to ever speak with her about it and let her know I was taking steps to fix my behavior and I knew what to do to salvage our relationship (that up to that point had no warning signs of ending. I‘ve been on the other end of a toxic relationship and the circumstances didn’t even remotely seem the same). I still don’t know the specifics of everything and she has emphasized that she never wants to speak to me again and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to. Outside of the one previous argument we had, she hadn’t let me know of any of these issues in our relationship and never tried to work through anything. I felt completely lost, so I turned to my friends. Most of them have been ghosting me (one going as far as to block me on twitter/social media and to remove me from extremely random parts in our lives like a Minecraft realm) and providing me no explanation as well. Not a single one of them has wanted to talk to me and only one of them has actually responded to me. I understand that I was in the wrong with my relationship but my friends won’t even support me or listen to me accepting my mistakes and wanting to fix things. I’m basically completely alone right now and I have no clue what to do. They have all sided with her, without even acknowledging my viewpoint. Even the ones who haven’t known her as long and I have supported through everything have alienated me as well, and I’ve effectively lost years of friendships that I’m not sure I’ll ever get back.

Now she randomly just texted me that she was taking her own life and then, 40 minutes later when I didn’t answer, called me to tell me she was taking her own life. I don’t know any of her friends (we were seeing each other for less than a month and met on tinder), so I had been searching through any known avenue trying to find a way to save her for over an hour! But then I saw her snapscore go up. Not by a lot, only 1 point but I know it did because I was keeping an eye on it.

I've often times spoken to her but I've never been good at helping people through them or fixing their issues. Lately she's been talking about meeting some guy who she's in an online relationship with over discord. Obviously when she told me his age it immediately didn't sit right with or should it with anyone really. She says its fine because the guy helps her calm down or talk through her issues, but I'm worried that this person is doing so just to groom her into doing something stupid. She's clearly very attached and what she says about him doesn't make the guy seem particularly terrible. As it stands though I know it's wrong for someone in a seven year age difference or maybe even higher if he's lying talking with someone like an adult.

260,"For a bit of backstory, my best friend and I were born two months apart and lived on the same street growing up. We were inseparable and literally like those best friends from the movies doing everything together. We were practically siblings. 

When I was 9 my family moved countries for work and family reasons and I now live a 9 hour flight away. Neither of us had phones then but we kept in touch writings letters back and forth for years, never missing a birthday or christmas for years. We both eventually got phones but his family is less well off and he doesn’t have regular wifi or data so for a while we could only have short phone calls and no texts. Now we call a lot more regularly and it’s really nice that each phone call doesn’t feel like catching up after months of no contact. 

Since I moved I’ve only been back to visit twice and have probably seen him for a total of four days in the past 8 years. And yet it still feels like we’re best friends. If we were to hang out now we would pick up right where we left off. Literally everyone close to us knows how close we still are, including my boyfriend and his girlfriend. As much as my friends used to tease me, I have no sort of romantic feelings whatsoever towards him and never have, he is like a brother to me and practically part of my family. 

Recently, I’ve been going through some tough emotions, especially with coronavirus and some harsh realisations about who my real friends are. I’ve also been feeling a bit homesick for my old home and country and a lot of that includes missing my best friend. He’s been a huge point of stability for me through the past years, a friend separate from my life here and I feel like I can always go to him either to rant or just escape. 

We’ve been talking about having him come to visit for a while now but because of corona that won’t happen for a while and I really want to see him.

I just feel the need to let him know how much he means to me and how much I miss him at the moment but I don’t want to come across all emotional or weird or have it miss the mark. I also don’t want anyone to think this is some odd confession of feelings or something, I just miss my best friend. I don’t want anything to become weird between us if I start being all over emotional and sappy. How can I tell him this in a way that shows how important he really is but isn’t too intense? 

Tldr: I moved away from my best friend since birth but I’ve recently been missing him a lot and want to let him know how much I miss him without seeming too emotional or weird or seeming romantic in any way.

262,"So every time I’m invited to go hand out it usually involves eating out at some fast food establishment sometime throughout the night/hanging out. 

Every single time I’m thinking “I really don’t want to be here(fast food establishment)” “maybe I’ll like it?” And I’m like “uhh I’ll just get the same thing you got” 

Every single time it takes me 20- 30 minutes to eat something that would normally take 15 min.. you might ask “why?” Well, it all comes back to the backstory. 

I’m technically Mexican. I grew up in a Mexican household but as I grew up I heavily withdrew myself from that culture to the point now people just think I’m white. Anyways, I’m Mexican culture it’s very socially acceptable to eat. And very not socially acceptable to not eat. I grew up obese due to this but around 8th grade I went the polar opposite direction which then caused that attitude with not just my parents but the culture as well. “Oh you think you’re better than us?” Which lead to the other stuff. 

Anyways. Some examples are, I didn’t have McDonald’s for the first time at 21. Never had Wendy’s till today. Dominos till 19, uhh I think that’s all? Like every single time I try to eat that it just sounds and look so unappealing but like the warmth of the food makes me so nauseous. The soil is just so “ugh” French fries are so dry and salty. The soda I gave this ongoing joke of being “diabetes water” 

Like I genuinely cannot eat that without forcing it down and literally holding myself from the “need/reflex” of throwing it back up. 

To date the worst has been McDonald. I literally threw up.. 

Like how do I say “I don’t want to..”? In the past I’ve tried to disguise this by being like “oh you like the French fires? Have mine!” “No I don’t mind” or once I get to my room, especially now being with corona we usually get take out and I’ll get here and I’m like “hey you want some (name of restaurant)” and just give it to my roommate. Other times I’m just like “hey u forgot ur drink In my car” but there’s only so many times you can use that one before they know somethings up. Same with “oh you like this? Have mine!” “Oh? Wait, you didn’t eat anything...”

?? If I’m just like “no” then we have the other issue. You’re hungry me keeping you from eating isn’t ideal either.  So..? I’ve also tired the “oh I actually just ate” thing",08Aug2020,1

The only thing I am is an observer of negative thoughts. All day every day is a huge struggle. What happened was that I had some close friends that started taking drugs. We did them together to have more fun together. One thing led to the other and I ended screwing around with psychedelics. This has completely disconnected me from my family, I no longer feel comfortable around them. I can’t speak to anyone because I’ve been hiding my feelings for about a year now. I have no desire, no soul. Every second of my life I am reminded of LSD and how it has completely destroyed my perception of the world. The perception that I took 19 years to formulate and I was lucky to have. I cared about others and had plenty of friends. Now I can’t connect with anyone. I feel completely disconnected from my past life. I’m sad but not even crying all day. I feel like I have no emotions apart from anger. 

The reason I think I ruined my life is because I’m the only one in my family who has ever done any thing like this. I have no idea why it was going through my head to do these things.

284,"So today is the first time in awhile that I’m attempting to stay sober at night instead of smoking weed or something. I think I just like to smoke at night bc it keeps my mind from running loose and being negative, and something happens at night where I start just nitpicking myself and judging myself badly. 

I’m not where I want to be in life and there’s all these problems both small and big, and I can’t tell if they’re real or if they’re not fabricated by my brain being irrational. And with weed I can just get lost in whatever and I’ll also be pretty positive, and can relax and breathe. I’ll stretch, listen to music, rehab my shoulder, or mediate, and I can pretty much just focus deeply into something. I’m starting to think that it might be ADHD related but who the fuck knows.

There’s like an anxiety and angst that’s just in my chest throughout the day sometimes and it spikes and drops through the day as well, but at night it just eats away at me and I might not be able to sleep. When I was going to school I would just smoke weed and workout, but now I’ll smoke through the afternoon, throughout the evening, and top it off at night.

I just think like this probably isn’t the best for me, but whenever I stop I just feel like not smoking weed just makes my life boring and sucky. And to be fair the circumstances are pretty boring and sucky, and corona has put a dampening on a couple things but overall it just feels hard to exist.

It’s more of an anxiety bc I feel it in my chest and it’s like a tension that I can’t describe. I wish I could just feel contempt and happy, but all these anxieties about my past, about not being good enough, about not having value, etc, just rise up and I just can’t.

During quarantine I picked up making music and for awhile I was making music sober and that was my way to spend my time doing something different.

We have been dating for 2 years, currently living together and we have a 3 month old baby. My boyfriend was dating someone before me for over 5 years. He never felt the motivation to live with her and work for a better future for both of them. She would want to marry him and he would tell her no. I’ve heard she treated him like a king but yet he never felt nothing more serious to marry or live with her. His ex ‘s mom died and then she got cancer so maybe he also felt he couldn’t leave her, even if he really wanted to. Although they had around 3 years when that happened. Many people have told me I am more attractive than her. In my opinion she isn’t too bad but I don’t want to judge her like that. I ain’t no hater. I have anger issues and there are days I tell my bf a lot of shit I don’t mean but I know I need to work on my anger. I have lied to him, I’ve told him at the begging he sucks at sex (which he now doesn’t) but he told me he knows he really loves me because he feels he is crazy over me and in the past he would never tolerate the stuff I have done to him. 
So I want to know, what really makes you go crazy over a girl? Sex, body attraction?

295,"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been dating for over a year, mostly great, we get along great and everything. Our relationship was quite fast paced but we’re convinced we’re soulmates or w/e (cringe sorry). 
Anyways, lately I’ve been having some negative thoughts about our relationship, his job is a professional athlete so he’s away a lot. This is unfortunately led to him missing important things in my/our life like a miscarriage, me going through several medical issues which is currently something I’m going through (not able to walk), getting a pet which needed to be taken to the vet multiple times and looked after etc.
All these things I would obviously prefer him to be with me for. 
Now I know what you’re thinking, I shouldn’t be mad at him for working but he takes time to go back to his home during these times that I need him as well so he’s not necessarily working every time he’s not here. 
I’m just not sure, do I just accept that this is our lifestyle because of his job or do I let him go because I’m getting sick of doing things alone. Not to mention, if we have kids do I want to do it alone.",08Aug2020,1

Quick break down: My brother seems to be alienating himself from all his former friends and family members who do not live up to his religious moral standards.

I want to start this off by saying I love my brother. He frustrates me sometimes but he's a great guy when you really see his whole package.. He’s good looking, Extremely talented and gifted in sports, and extremely intelligent. He got his bachelors and was at the top of his class. He could write some killer fucking essays. All around he’s someone that anyone could easily look up to and admire. But i’m worried because he’s changed over the last two years. From an early age he’s struggled slightly with OCD. (my whole family has had issues with OCD to some degree but never something that was debilitating). But I bring this up because over the last 4 years he’s become heavily religious and it seems like his OCD has played into the way he practices religion. He had been associated with the Christian faith ever since he was young (my family was semi religious growing up but my sister and brother were the only two that really took interest in it), but now he’s been taking everything out of the bible extremely literally. A few examples:

He refuses to walk through a door if it has a “Do not enter sign on it” even if the owner of said door tells him it’s okay to do so. Since he’s told not to by the sign then he has to obey it, which was his explanation.

He’s gotten very strict on following laws to a perfect interpretation. Examples include:

If we are walking in a city and there is no cars around he refuses to J-walk even if it’s safe to do so because it’s against the law. He once added 30 minutes of walk time to his trip because he refused to J-walk even though it was late at night and perfectly safe to J-walk on multiple occasions.

He will go out of his way to record, report, and pay taxes on purchases that he makes out of state over the internet even if it’s bought through amazon because technically that what the law states.

He reads every legal document that he’s given from front to back. And I mean like terms of service, warranties, insurance offers etc etc.. He has told me it’s because he’s afraid that he might miss something and therefore might end up breaking the law. So he has cancelled plans so that he has time to read over these documents.

And honestly all of that is fine, but he’s been starting to try and push these ideas or beliefs onto his friends and family and began cutting people out of his life who disagree with his moral standards.

An example of this is a month ago my brother and I had a light hearted discussion about morality. We were talking about lying and I had suggested that “sometimes it’s okay to lie as long as it’s not done to harm the individual in any way. He disagreed and said since it says in the ten commandments not to lie that it’s never okay to lie. And when I brought up the scenario of “1940’s Germany and you need to lie to save someone”, he really struggled with the response and initially said it’s okay to lie there. But his most recent text that he sent me, he had changed his mind. He stated that he refuses to associate with me until I denounce what I said and essentially fall in line with what he believes.

He also had a friend group of about 8 really close friends from high school and college who he slowly cut out of his life. Running into some of his friends later in life confirmed that he had cut them out of his life because they don’t “align with his beliefs” and he no longer wishes to associate with them.

So at this point in his life, he’s 32 with no close friends, never had a relationship, cut his mom, dad, and myself out of his life all because we didn't have the same world views. The only person that he isn’t at odds with currently is my sister. But my sister is frustrated with him and wants him to seek help. She’s worried about how his beliefs are slowly destroying his life. My sister suggested that I and her reach out to him together to maybe suggest getting help. But how do we address this to him without him cutting us all out or doing something dangerous? We don’t want to make him feel like we are attacking him. What do we do if he chooses not to accept help? Do we cut him out of our life until he gets help? We also thought about including our uncle into the call with my sister and I. He seems to have a very good relationship with my uncle but my uncle holds the same beliefs that we do about the situation. He’s just currently stayed out of everything because he was hoping it would all resolve on its own.

I’m just really depressed and lost at this point. Any help or advice on who to reach out and talk with would be amazing. I’m also happy to elaborate on anything that you may need me to.",08Aug2020,1

I (16M) for the last 2 months have not been feeling the best? Its hard to explain. It started when i broke up with my ex of a year, and it didnt bother me at all, when it probably should have. Ever since then i havent really felt anything emotionally besides insecurity and anger. This might not seem like the biggest deal, and try not to judge but i slept with three different girls (We did not do anything ""adult"") and didnt have any feelings whatsoever for them. Its slowly gotten worse as i have had a really bad urge to do things like get drunk, sneak out and just do stupid things. Its gotten increasingly harder to resist and i realized i still have no intent whatsoever to do any sort of drugs or nicotine. I used to be a good kid and didnt even think i would ever be in this position, i have no regard for my personal health but more for the close ones around me.

302,"Hello, I am a 22 year old male and am starting to feel insecure about my appearance. I haven't let this kind of stuff get to my head but lately it's getting frustrating. I got in a relationship with this girl back home, I am from Alaska but am in Virginia for military training. Anyway, when she showed her family a picture of me, their first remark was about my ""baby face"". It normally doesn't bother me when people talk about how young I look because normally that's a good thing. However, her family sounded rude and it came off as insulting. She doesn't mind obviously but I just wish her parents didn't think negatively of me for something out of my control and for something so minor. Maybe I'll receive some harsh backlash for this goofy post but it does bother me lol. What can I do to look older, I know it's vague but that's because I'm open to all suggestions.

Some of the stuff include, getting a motorcycle, learning guitar, learning French, etc. 

I’m 21 currently in the military and I’m aware of how stupid and ridiculous this sounds but it really does feel like life is effectively “over” at this point. Like growing up severely depressed I never had that “self preservation instinct” but now that that’s over and down with I still don’t and I’m confused asf. Doesn’t not being depressed mean I’d want to live?

Same with learning guitar. Always wanted to learn an instrument.

306,"Situation is pretty much as title infers; I’ve made mistakes in the past, same as everyone else. However, unlike everyone else, I don’t forget my many moral lapses; no, I cling on to them, ponder them constantly, and let them torture me day in and day out. I try my best to excuse myself for the mistakes I’ve made as a kid (16 and before), but I’ve done things as an adult that I’d find hard to forgive in other people. Coincidently, assessing myself so critically has made me a much more understanding/forgiving person, so I guess that’s good. I’m at a point now in my life where I’ve become the person I’m probably gonna be for the rest of my life, so these same mistakes won’t ever be repeated, but I guess what I want to know is this: what truly makes a bad person bad? It’s situational, isn’t it? I struggle with my absent-mindedness and my tendency to get caught in the moment past, is there any way to move past this? Or is it better that I cling on to these moments as lessons for the future?

308,"So I have this friend. We'll call him Andre. For context, both of us are devout Christians and we both believe in abstinence. Long story short, he was a bit of an unofficial leader in a ministry I used to be a part of. Super cool dude, all of us college students loved him.  
  
I got on the phone with him tonight and we talked, he's out of the state for a while so we don't talk as often as we used to. I thought little of our conversation being so late at night because he's like this with all of us and cared about keeping in touch but works very odd hours currently.  
  
Anyways, he admits he's been drinking, I think little of it. Then he mentions how if I was just 5 years older he'd have already started hitting on me. I laugh it off and think he's just been a goof. Then he says it a few more times over the course of about 40 minutes. During this time he also confesses he struggles with sex (needing it too often when, as a Christian, he's not even supposed to have sex before marriage).  
  
Now, I'm nobody to judge. Everyone struggles. Most non-Christian's don't even believe in abstinence. I appreciate his willingness to be vulnerable with me. Then he brings up again how if I was just 5 years older we could get married and solve my ""boy issues"" (I'm single and have been for a while). He then goes on to admit he's ""holding back"" and would normally say much more but is trying to behave himself.  
  
The whole conversation left me really weird feeling. I thought ""If my pastor did this I'd feel horrible about it"" but he's also 5 years older than Andre and has a wife and kids. I feel like maybe I'm just holding Andre to a higher standard but then I thought, if I was a 33 year old women and I hit on a 21 year old boy I'd feel gross about myself... So maybe it was weird that he said all this to me.

My dad has a temper and can be emotionally abusive, and my mom is very dependent on my dad financially. They've been growing distant of late and my dad has been leaving the house without telling my mom where he was going (during a pandemic nonetheless). This among other things made my mom suspect my dad of cheating on her. She called me to ask for advice and also wanted to let me know in the potential chance she needed help leaving. I actually told my mom to talk to a friend of hers instead of that I wouldn't get too involved. That being said I was really angry when I heard about what my dad was allegedly doing. My mom ended up confronting him but he wouldn't answer her or talk about it.

My dad recently reached out to me to explain his side of the story (and by his account, he's not actually cheating). I do feel that he's being honest about this, but he's withholding information from my mom to hurt her. He wanted me to provide him validation and say that he was not doing anything wrong. He also feels like I already emotionally took a side, even though I told him I'm really not trying to get involved. He then told me that he's glad he now knows where he stands with me, and wants to move on with his life without me in it.

319,"Apologizing in advance for bad formatting since I’m on mobile!

Hello all, I am seeking some third person advice on my situation. I’m F(20), my parter is M(21). We have been together since March 2020. We are from different states, he lives in the state I attend college in. I’ve gone back and forth between my home state and my college state for 2 years now, as I’m a junior this upcoming year! I come home for breaks and what not. 

I met my current boyfriend on tinder after an eXtReMeLy toxic relationship, and he has been nothing but a light in my life. I have been in some pretty unfortunate relationships before, and nobody holds a candle to my boyfriend. We both see a bright future for us and we have gotten to know each other so deeply. I love everything about him. 

In May, my parents were furloughed from their jobs because of COVID and were struggling to support my younger siblings, so I left my college state to come home and help to keep everyone afloat, no big deal. We decided to make long distance work and it has been smooth sailing. We have a mutual understanding of the circumstances, we trust each other, we are in it for the long haul. 

At the end of July, he flew out to come stay with my family for a few days and everything went perfectly. I flew out after that back to my college to help him and his roommates move and spend some more time together after months apart. As we were getting him moved in, he brought up the idea of me moving in with him. 

I’m hesitant to this because I’m just nervous that things may not work out and I’d be without a place to live states away from my family. I don’t want to rush things, but at the same time I have never met a man so perfect for me and I’ve never felt like I was so perfect for anyone else either. I feel like I would miss out on an opportunity if I didn’t move in with him. I am also hesitant to even bring the idea up to my parents, as I think they’d shoot it down pretty quick. I wouldn’t want to go against them, but I think this is something that I want to do. My boyfriend and I both pay our own rent, pay for our own cars and other bills, so my parents wouldn’t feel a financial strain. I need to approach them with this idea before going through with it but am scared to. Part of me is anxious, another part of me says fuck it, if it doesn’t work out then so be it, if it works out then it’ll be a great choice. I feel like it’s ok to be a little impulsive and a little selfish while you’re young if you have all your ducks in a row :)

320,"So the shift I'm talking about is a 9 hour shift, I got those for Full Time months back at my old job, and that was stressing enough. I started out on these sorts of shifts, and explained rather clearly to my boss that working those shifts was a no go, I worked close, so I wouldn't actually be done for around a half an hour to an hour. They agreed with that and for my next shift my boss altered it and I was more comfortable. Looking at my schedule, it's the same damn shift we agreed I wouldn't be working. I don't want to be an asshole, but I'm done being a doormat and being exploited, the pay isn't even what it was advertised as, I was in the dark for my entire shift, and I'm treated like an actual grunt and a nuisance if I'm not killing myself over the shitty work I'm saddled with. All. By. My. Self. I thought that I could win just this one issue. It's shitty work, it makes me feel terrible, the people are toxic, but at least when I get home I don't want to cry myself to sleep, I just don't feel like I'm being heard, but I made it clear, and there was no doubt about that. I wasn't even asked about this, I was just scheduled it.

Although it's annoying that I have to once again make myself clear, I don't expect I'll get much pushback, but of course, I don't want to be caught off guard if it turns out they want to fight me on this. So let's say I make it clear I can't work this shift, and they respond that I have to, how do I establish that I can't and WON'T show up for it? My friend told me to be kind, but firm, and told me that if my boss tells me I must work that shift, that I should make it clear I won't show up, and if they still refuse, then I just don't show up.

Even if you think differently, me and the scheduling manager made it clear I wouldn't be working that shift, we had come to an understanding, and I think it's fair that I hold them to that. I just want to know how to go about that, and not let myself get taken advantage of.

Basically the title, I guess.

325,"My relationship with my dad over the past few years has been rocky. Ever since I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety (around 4-5 years ago) our relationship has been different. 

Over the years he has said so many hurtful things, and when I was younger he would do the same but I noticed it more as I grew older. When I started doing bad in school because I was depressed he would say things like “you don’t have a reason to be depressed” “just stop being depressed” “you are so annoying” “I’m embarrassed that you had to go to a hospital twice and for what? Emotions?” “You’re never going to be anything” “you’re never going to do anything in your life” “I don’t see you doing anything in life.” And obviously this made things even worse. 

Last year was the worst, my boyfriend broke up with me and I couldn’t handle the stress between a rigid academic course and a job and my grades declined. Then people started bullying me, I would wake up in the morning with calls from people telling me to kill myself. I was really really depressed. And I broke and I had a breakdown and went to a hospital. After I got out my dad said the same shit I mentioned above. He even went as far as to try to pull me out of school because “what’s the point of you being in school if you’re a failure” he’s a great dad I know. 

After that I just ignored him and I got better and we got along better and I thought he would apologize someday and realize that he did wrong. Well he only apologized when I asked him to and to be honest his apologies were half assed and empty. 

Well this morning my parents found out about my self prescribed “medication” (my weed pen) which wasn’t really a big deal. But it reignited some fuel in my dad and we had a big argument which to sum it up went like this: I tried to tell him how toxic he was and how he always denied that anything he could say would ever hurt my feelings. He ended up recording me, crying, 6 in the morning, begging for him to just please realize what he is. I brought up some things he said when I was younger, and all the things he had done to me and my mom. And he said that he doesn’t understand what he did wrong. And after I realized it wasn’t going anywhere I just asked me to stop but he’s the type of guy who just doesn’t stop talking at all no matter what, he just doesn’t know when to shut up.

(Some backstory: when I was around 5 I vividly remember him telling me he hated me and then spitting in my breakfast and my face. Apparently his justification was that I was being annoying towards my brother) 

I’m livid and so sad. I obviously haven’t talked to him. He is a narcissist and like any typical narcissist, he denies that he is one. There’s so much he has said and done to me but I couldn’t fit it all on here. Earlier this year when I got mad at my mom for I forgot what, he slapped me so hard he dislocated my jaw and threw me out the house. 

How do I deal with him. How on earth do I get him to realize how he is? I feel like if my mom and my brother would speak up because I know they have the same thoughts about him as me, then he would realize. But no one speaks up for me or helps me when I try to explain to him why I don’t want to talk to him. I haven’t feel so alone and sad I’m such a long time. All this time that I’ve spent smoking my weed, slowly regaining my self esteem and confidence and now I feel so broken again. Please someone tell me what to do.

328,"Tl:dr our mother who has a brain of a bird mentally abuses my brother by micromanaging  his life and keeps making him do everything when he's already an adult. We plan to leave but Im not old enough. Im sick and tired of her. What do I do?

Long story:
I'm 16M and my brother is 20. His mental abuser is our 
mother. We plan to leave her when I am legally an adult because of the law. But, I'm getting sick and tired of her. She has our id, passport, etc. 

She abuses my brother by destroying his free time and micromanaging everything he does when he's already an adult. For example, when he sleeps at 2 A.M. because he wants to rest, play video games, or do other things to relieve stress. She tells him to cook earlier and go to sleep. We move a lot so we don't have many friends do socialize and we use our free time to watch things like Anime or play video games. 

This isnt very important but she used to cook for us back then until she broke up with her boyfriend. Now we do it most of the time because ""shes too tired"" or ""too sleepy"" even though she sleeps all day at the afternoon. My brother works 2 jobs and more hours than her. She keeps forcing him to do everything including driving(which he could have earlier if she didn't screw him up by taking his phone and forgetting to give it back so he can receive a call from DMV). Everything is his fault apparently? Also she keeps threatening him to leave the apartment but he wants to help me before he leaves(this part makes me wanna cry) I keep telling him leave me and ill eventually follow up but he persists. 

She keeps telling him we don't make much money even though we do and we can live comfortably if she doesn't keep spending on useless things like she spend about 1k for herself the other day to make our apartment look better as if anyone uses the living room and the tv. She takes half of what my brother makes and makes him use the other half for groceries. My brother doesn't really spend too much and spend it only if it benefit the both of us... 

We barely speak to her. We try speaking up to her but it always ends up in to an argument. She sees us as tools she can use at the future to earn money and other things as if we would because of how she treats us. I heard she ruined another family by sleeping with her friend's husband. She is messed up. 

Also, I have a sister who moved out at the age 21 with her boyfriend which my mother cried because my sister tricked her in to giving her id's, passport, etc to live her on life instead of helping her. We conforted her because we aren't devils. But, she threatened to call the cops to search for her and our sister returned because of it. She cut off communication with our mother but not with us. We had to tell her to go back because it might be bad for her situation. Anyways, 2 days prior her leave they reunited. She keeps shit talking about her to us about how she's going to need her help even though my sister is hella smart in her own ways. Anyways she relies on my sister more than we rely on her our whole life because she doesn't know much English to begin with.

I don't know what to do and I feel like my brother is getting more and more stressed. Any advice helps.",08Aug2020,1

They said “Wait” and “Stop” a couple times. After awhile I pressed play and my headphones beeped and the noises stopped, but while I’m writing this I can here my headphones making unusual noises now.

331,"Because of the current state of the world, I had to make a lot of changes - one of which was to find a new apartment and get cheaper rent. So, I went onto my city’s Facebook page and found a girl who liked nice that was looking for a roommate.

We talked a good bit on FaceTime, got along great and decided to live together. But due to quarantining outside of the city at my parents house, I was unable to meet her in person and unable to see the apartment before moving in. I trusted the broker and her when they told me the the bedrooms were “similar in size.”

My roommate told me she wanted to take one bedroom further away from the door, and i could have the other. I said, yes that’s fine, works for me if they’re about the same size, makes no difference to me.

Well, I moved in a few days ago, and saw her bedroom for the first time. It is incredibly way bigger than mine. I actually have to find and pay for an outside storage unit because nothing fits but a small dresser and a bed and I have a lot of winter gear; she’s able to get a literal stationary bike to fit into her room (which she’s already ordered). 

There is a significant difference - which is okay - but the issue is that she lied, and now we’re paying the same rent for our apartment when I should be paying less.

How do I nicely bring up that I would like to pro-rate the rooms by size, and perhaps knock $100 off or so of my rent to make it more fair? 

I don’t want to make our friendship or roommate-ship awkward because we just met and I just moved in and we have a whole 12 months to live together, but I really don’t think it’s fair to be paying the same rent when there is a big size difference in bedrooms. I’m getting to be bitter every time I have to reach under my bed and find the storage bin with my hair stuff, or my clothes, etc etc. and need to just say something.

I have high anxiety and depression

I also have ADHD and Asperger's

I am a fifteen year old boy

So I've been on this sub for a while now asking for life advice, and yet I'm here again. Currently I am enrolled in summer school, and I was dumb enough to not do school for a month. I have 180 lessons to complete within the next two weeks, and Everytime I attempt to do it, I only get one lesson done and then cry for two hours. I then go straight to videogames, and then after that I go to bed. I just want to get my school done, but I know by myself I can't. My mom will flip out if I ask her for help, so my dad and sister have helped me in the past, and my dad has agreed to help me.Its not like I don't like school, or I don't have the tools, I just can't focus and get it done like I used to.

I have been trying to make streaming video games a thing to make myself successful. J don't feel confident about other things, because I really am only good at video games, art, I want to learn game development, and I also am great at modding.  I don't find interest in these things sometimes, and it feels like I won't get anywhere with these.

334,"A bit of back story: since lockdown I(20F) have had to head home from uni. I wasn’t here much before I went due to a breakdown in family communication so my neighbours aren’t used to seeing me in my room?? I guess?? We’re in a semi detached they’re the side we’re connected to. since I’ve been back my bed frame has changed so I’m a lot higher off the floor than I used to be&amp; my bed is right next to my window; this is where I sit to do my makeup. 

So this is where the issue is, after I handed in my uni submission I started to do my makeup a lot more as I had far more time on my hands. I like doing it in-front of the window as I get natural light and I can see what I ac look like. After doing this for a few months I was sat outside and over heard my neighbours talking about how I “peep” on them and that they  “sneakily” take pictures of me smoking the green.  Now I’m confused because: 

1. I have not a CLUE what these ppl look like. 
2. Because of Bush/tree placement i ac can’t see into their garden even if I wanted to. 
3:I’ve lived here for 10 years and never been worried / accused of this before? 
3. If you have a problem with me smoking just knock on the door and talk to me?
 
From here the issue has grown worse, I’ve tried keeping my blinds down and only opening them when I do my makeup so they know I have no interest in them. I’ve tried keeping my music loud to show that I don’t care for conversation. I’ve tried doing my makeup in other places in my room (I’m not a fan as I can’t see much as I don’t have any other source of natural light apart from my one window). Ive even tired doing my makeup in the garden but that didn’t work when it was loudly exclaimed that “I have come up with more creative methods” 

I’ve tried EVERYTHING so that this Karen doesn’t have to be paranoid and I don’t get unnecessarily accused of being a weirdo/ creeper. But I can’t do ANYTHING in my own home without it being twisted. Taking my elderly dog out in the garden for a wee? I’m obviously trying to have a peep? Chilling in bed scrolling through reddit? I’m obviously a weird freak who must be stopped. Honestly now they don’t hesitate to loudly talk about what they think of me when they are sat about 3 meters away from my open window &amp; tbh it makes me feel shitty cause it’s unwarranted. 

I live in a small town and these accusations are going to travel fast and it makes me super uncomfortable. So does anyone have any advise on what to do to fix this??

I have been seriously struggling for quite some time now to decide on what career I should have for myself.

I have worked as a bartender for the last four years. I really enjoy working in hospitality, however as it's the only job I've had, I'm not sure if I should spend the rest of my life doing it. The pay isn't fantastic and unless I become a manager I will be working as a casual for the forseeable future, which isn't very stable. 

On the other hand, I've been thinking about going to university to become a paramedic. It sounds like a really rewarding and noble career. I do feel a bit stressed about it as the degree takes three years to complete, which means I won't enter that job until I'm at least 26. Also, I'm not 100% sure if I would enjoy it. I have had quite a history of become very interested in something (law, being an example) studying it then quitting half way through because my interests would change. I'm worried that it'll happen again and I'll be back to square one.

I'm stressing out, I feel like my time is running out! I want to make a decision soon. I'm sick of being stuck in career limbo :-(

My partner also gets annoyed at me when I keep changing career paths.

TL;DR I'm struggling to choose between bartending and paramedics as a career. Bartending has been a constant in my life for the past four years, so it is something that I feel comfortable doing. Paramedicine, on the other hand, worries me because I won't be able become one until I'm at least 26,  and I'm worried I may change my mind half way through the course like I have with other courses. It just sounds like such a cool job though!

338,"I have been here a few times myself but this time I am asking for information on what I should do next? Below is the unfolding of my last 8 months of life and also what has occurred tonight. Thank you for any help or suggestions that you may provide.

Currently I am sitting in my wife's emergency room as she has finally attempted suicide for the first time by overdose. Let me take you back 9 months to where this all started. 

8 months ago on December 3rd 2019 I lost my dad. He lived a long life of suicide and depression and that was mainly how my childhood was growing up. He passed away due to head injury and drug related problems of his liver after trying to get high from muscle relaxers. 

February 2020. My wife started exhibiting signs of suicidal depression. This was never a common place for her and she had never been diagnosed with depression before. The next 4 months were filled with covid related pandemic, shut down and lock down of businesses and her being in and out of psych wards. 

On her trip out of the psych ward we got in a minor car accident that was declared my fault even after the car in front of my slamming on their breaks in the middle of an intersection in rainy weather and me hydroplaning into the back of them. 

Fast forward to July 2020. My wife decided after her 3rd hospital stay that she no longer wanted to be with me. *We have been together for 13 years and I met her when I was 14. Married for 4 years, built a decent life together, house, cars, nearly debt free at the age of 27 and her being 29.* I helped her move out as I am not going to control her life and force her to be in a place that she doesn't want to be. I split out finances in half. Helped her find an apartment, spoke to her bosses at her job to make sure she had job security, and gave her a paid off car to help her be on her own. This was 3 weeks ago. 

Today she dropped the dog off at my house and said that she wanted me to watch him. This was strange as he was the dog we got back in March/April to help with her depression. I spoke to her about how she felt and she told me she was not in a good head place but she had a lot of work to do in the next couple of days at her job and that he would be on his own for hours on end *he is only a pup still*. She went back home after dropping him off and we talked over the phone for a bit about what the future would hold for the both of us.

I recieved a text 2 and a half hours ago at 1:05am EST about how her apartment door was open and that she had taken a bunch of pills. I called 911 and drove to her apartment complex. We waited 10 minutes for them to unlock the doors as there do not have security panels or any type of emergency area to enter for police or EMS. When we got up to her room she was throwing up and had taken a significant amount of depression medication that was prescribed to her and washed it down with 5 beers. 

I am sitting in the emergency room now waiting for what is going to happen next. Honestly I don't even know myself? My whole life has been changed in the course of 8 months and 5 days. I don't know what to do anymore and I am mentally numb to everything. *I haven't even shed a tear all night*  can someone give me some answers? Are there any steps I should take next? Any recommendations will be appreciated. Thank you for reading.",08Aug2020,1

348,"Okay, so first and foremost, this is my first post and I’m on mobile. Sorry for bad formatting and spelling mistakes.

Alright so let’s get into it.

A bit of background, I have an absentee bio mom and have abandonment issues because she cut contact when I was about twelve. She was also extremely manipulative and a drug addict. I was raised by my dad alone with visitation after I was two until I was twelve when she cut contact. He also had an ex girlfriend (who is not the topic of this post) was actually mentally and emotionally abusive so I don’t react to well to certain behaviors like yelling and sudden loud noises. Because of her I am a pretty damn good liar and I am decent at hiding my emotions.

I also have a slew of other unfortunate life events but those don’t effect the story other then they attribute to my depression and anxiety.

My dad met my mom when I was 10, and I was introduced to her when I was like 11. They engaged a year later and married with the next year.

Examples of why I think she’s not okay:

1. She out right denied that my dads ex abused me, and told me to stop bringing her up and using her as an excuse for not trusting her.

2. I went from being a straight D student, to being forced to have all A’s and B’s or else I’d get my phone and all electronic privileges taken away and not allowed to go anywhere except for school. Not even with outside family. She later denied that she wouldn’t let me go out and tried to gaslight me. I would be ground for months at a time for a 79% C in a advanced class I was trying hard in. While I had A’s and B’s in all of my other classes. This would also last over the summer. I have decently under developed social skills and I used to be so desperately lonely and anxiety over my inability to properly socially interact that I’d break down sobbing two or three times a week.

3. When ever we fight or she does something that isn’t okay (when my dad isn’t home or isn’t a part of the situation). She always makes it out to be my fault, I’m the one who has to apologize or I’m being over dramatic.
-Example of a situation she said I made up: she SLAMMED my door open early once morning, startling me and started YELLING at me to wake up and I need to empty the dishwasher before I go to school. After I calmed myself down enough to not have an immediate panic attack, I went up and told her that wasn’t okay. She needs to knock, she can’t startle me like that and that wasn’t okay. She told my dad that she’d opened my door and asked me to get up. If it weren’t for the fact that I was shaking and trying not to start bawling on the floor, my dad would have believed her. He told her not to do it again and she said okay. (Spoiler alert it happened again at least twice.)

4. After some other, not so great (really bad traumatic shit) happened my behavior completely changed. I went from being a sweet, people pleasing, shy, neat kid; to rude, unruly, mean kid who’s room constantly looked like a tornado went through it. My parents didn’t notice at all and it took me having a break down 3/4 years later for them to know.

5. After I started going to therapy, both my therapist and I suggested changing some behavior in the house to make me feel safer and help me out. She said and I qoute cause it still pisses me off that is fighting once or twice every week or two was okay; “Yeah that’s not happening. I’m a great mom. And your not shirking you’re responsibilities on your me.”

6. She uses nice things she does for me to excuse her day to day behavior. She uses that she lets me do something or that she’s planning a thing that I want as an excuse. She says that it’s proof that she’s nice to me. She talks down to me daily. Snaps at me over simple things that can easily be explained. She orders me around and only thanks me for things when other people are around or mention it. I have expressed to her multiple times that this isn’t okay (In front of my dad every time cause she only is nice in front of others and I don’t want her to make me out to be the bad guy to him.)

7. Whenever I used to talk about my issues to my dad and try to explain my feelings (cause I was encouraged to do so.) she’d tell me I’m ungrateful and that I only focus on the negative.

8. She compares me to others. Including herself from when she was my age.

9. She says she wants a good relationship with me and that it’s my fault we don’t have one.

10. She tried to blame her therapy on me (that was one of the few times my dad has defended me this year and this is a day to day thing)

11. She claims I dont do enough around the house and for myself despite me picking up the house all the time and being the only one that regularly does chores as well as apply to jobs while also holding a steady relationship.

12. She clearly favors her own kid before me. Granted, he’s a literal baby (and I live him dearly and don’t resent him at all, his mom is not his fault) but she talks about how great of a future he’s gonna have because, and she’s literally said this; he has her smart genes and she’s gonna raise him right.

Alright, this is already a super long post I’m sorry, I really need some feed back. These are only a sliver of her everyday behaviors. I could go on and on and on. Please just help me get some clarification.",08Aug2020,1
349,"Hey everyone (first time poster here!)-

Asking for advice mostly from those of you in science careers, but any is welcome. I'm heading to university this fall and seriously questioning my path in life. I'm fairly passionate about science and love learning stuff from all fields. Right now I'm signed up for a neuroscience major but debating if I want to do that or even science. I've recently had an extreme amount of trouble focusing on anything challenging for my brain (as in, awful procrastination and restlessness every time I try to do something). I know science is an intense and challenging field, especially at the university I'm going to, and that it'll take a lot more work then high school. 

I've also not been very into neuroscience lately. As I watch videos or read articles online, I feel more drawn to other areas. I chose neuro because I was interested in my AP psych class but wanted it to be more scientific because that's what I've always loved. Recently I've been most excited by theoretical quantum physics and astronomy, but I don't know much about it and don't for a second think I have the crazy intense math type skills to enter that field. I'm passionate about nature and spend most my time doing outdoor activities, but the actual ""science"" part of earth/environmental science has always seemed kind of boring to me compared to other fields. I love chemistry and have always done well in it, but almost feel like there's no exciting new discoveries being made in that area. I hated biology freshman year, but also hated school in general at that point and didn't have a good teacher, so that could've been it.

Overall, I'm feeling like maybe science isn't right for me. I know it takes a lot of grinding in school, which i may or may not be cut out for (I know I'm smart but I'm nowhere near anything special or top tier). And a tough life career wise as well. If I'm not passionate about any specific area, and not smart enough to make it anything remotely easy, am I just signing myself up for a lifetime of intensely hard work? Or worse, unhappiness? On the other hand, idk what else I would do and I've always loved science, Please let me know if you have any thoughts about major choice, career, or anything!",08Aug2020,1

Examples for me are things like breaking into the skatepark to have 1 AM Jack-in-the-Box picnics or scaling the town's highest water tower, skinny dipping in the bayou and partying on the old train tracks where the moon makes everything glow. I don't know if I'm making any sense but ideas or advice (especially if you're from the NOLA area) is greatly appreciated",08Aug2020,1
351,"On Monday I realized I needed to move. My roommate is toxic. She moved in at the beginning of quarantine and at the time my apartment office just said not to worry about putting her on the lease due to all of the hassel during lockdown. I talked to the office today about what my time frame was to move out. I then notified my roommate that I was planning on leaving by the end of the month. I told her that if she wanted to stay she would have to go talk to the office by the 10th. She doesn't work so I know she has time. She then proceeded to basically call me a bitch for not being fair. This after 5 days of her saying stuff about how I treat her like trash, which I can tell you is not true. I have refrained from engaging or reacting to any of her accusations or insults. Then she just texted me ""so when can I move my shit into my new room?"" because if she were to stay she would move into the master bedroom which I currently occupy. I have been trying to be the better person but I am just so beaten down and I am so tempted to just kick her out because I have tried to be nothing but fair and all she has done is insult me and be rude.",08Aug2020,1
352,"Last week on Friday I stepped into a bee. It stung me on my big toe, this was the first bee sting in my life. I immediately removed the stinger and cooled it and put onion on it. After half an hour or so there was no swelling or pain, all that was left of it was the slightest amount of itching. Until last night.

Last night, a week after I was stung, I was lying in bed and my toe started to hurt. This morning I had a look and the sting was visible again, slightly red and slightly swollen. Walking hurts. This is really puzzling to me after a week of no symptoms. Does anybody know what's going on? Is it infected?

355,"I need a third person's view on this 

I've been at my current job for 2 years now. I have worked my way up to bartender and shift manager and now they are offering for me to be promoted to a salaried position as hospitality manager with benefits etc. But the catch is that store is awful anymore. The GM...he is a chauvinistic, apathetic jerk sometimes and others hes a moron. Our AGM is trying but he can only do so much. The 4 other female managers before me got ran off shortly after, hell that's why they want me to move up, another one is leaving. It's just a sour work environment
But for a 24 year old female to be given a salaried position with benefits and a possible chance to change that place ....maybe its worth it. There's a new district manager as well so maybe that will help....but so far it hasn't. I leave that place in tears many nights....
But I care about it and its a home and family to me now and I do want it fixed. 
BUT- I've been offered a job at another restaurant by a manager who used to be my co worker at my current job. He's offering to bring me on as a server but with promises I will be moved up the ladder quickly. He tells me it's an awesome environment and a restaurant that's actually ran right. He says it's so much better there....so he says lol 
So that's my debate. I know its easy to say ""if you're not happy then leave "" but we all know it's not that simple sometimes. I wish it was. 
So do I stay, take the nicer position with the better income with potential to make changes while also staying in a toxic environment that may never change and instead drain me dry until I'm broken like the rest- but with hopes it gets better 
Or do I bail on that sinking ship and start fresh, yes at the bottom again, But in a healthier environment where I can grow all over again with a good team surrounding me...I do run the risk of it being crappy money that won't cover my bills or maybe I discover its just as bad of a work environment too and nothing is really that different except now I'm back turning tables for money instead of salaried.

Do I take that risk? Better yet. Which risk do I take? 

TL;DR- do I take a promotion at my current job as manager where I'll be salaried but working in a toxic environment or do I take this new job as a server, working my way up again from the bottom but in a healthier environment.",08Aug2020,1
356,"I live in a mental home with staff and roommates, we have routines to make us all more healthy and be able to learn how to take care of ourself as our own parents couldn’t 

Personal reason why I’m here is cause my parents physically abused me and neglected me and now suffer from ptsd, suffering a lot with life and everything, especially paranoia constantly. 

One of the daily routines is watching the news every morning, just about 10 minutes and thats it yet it stacks up how much I hear about bombings or people randomly shot on the streets or even in my area, how the chances has doubled now that you’ll be attacked by a stranger or rape or anything horrible. As my therapist is trying his best to give me therapy and meds this is all making it so much worse, it makes me so much more hesitant to leave the house or even paranoid at all possible ways I could be killed any second and how I wouldn’t be able to defend myself. To be able to behave and such I kind of have to go and watch the news but it’s ruining my mental state massively, I cant think the world as any nice place at all anymore, I literally don’t feel safe any moment of my life. And of course I know stuff like being attacked on the streets is so rare, even in a very criminalized area where I live. I know all that is rare to happen to me but my paranoia only focuses on the possibility existing and it seems so much bigger when every day I’m forced to hear of innocent people being killed cause someone thought it’d be fun to shoot up a supermarket.

358,"Hey!

I have a friend who I’ve known since Elementary school. Let’s call him John. John is a cool dude, and me and him have a lot in common. He moved away several years ago, but he still visits me often, and we talk on social media often with our online friends. 

A few years ago, he discovered that he was a furry, and it’s been hard for me to accept it, but I can’t figure out why. I definitely understand that I should accept him, but it makes me scared when I scroll through his Twitter likes and I see a bunch of animals and Beastars stuff and Legoshi and whatever else. I’m not sure if it’s a sexual thing, but that doesn’t matter. 

I started comparing this to how most homophobic people feel about homosexuals (I’m gay and John is Pan but we aren’t dating) and I realized it! I’m not comfortable because I am afraid that I might be a furry. I’m 99% sure that I’m not, but being unsure about it and considering the fact that I might be one makes me very scared. 

As you may know, furries have a negative representation in the media and in pop culture, but John is a really cool and awesome guy. Again, I’m not even sure if it’s a sexual thing for me or John, or if it’s even a thing for me at all. I don’t want to make John uncomfortable, either. I know that I’m probably not a furry.

370,"I reported an issue at work where a colleague was misusing company software, that colleague showed the ""issue"" to myself due to excitement however I reported it that day. 

When this was shown to me by the criminal, he wanted to test something but had live details on the screen and I felt very uncomfortable as I love my customers a lot and would do anything to protect them, so I said to him if he wants to try something he can do it on my account which he agreed to, so he done the glitch/hack on my account instead as I work for the company but I am also a customer.  


I reported this issue through another colleague which means i didn't directly blow the whistle, the only reason I had done this was due to my friends technical knowledge and I thought it would make the investigation easier for HR from our companies side to tackle the issue and take appropriate action against the criminal as my friend seemed to know exactly how the criminal was doing this after I had explained to him what I witnessed.

Few days later in work, I was taken to a room and given a chance to give my testimony, they had asked me when I found out about the issue and I said on the day I witnessed &amp; reported it, which is untrue. I had known about this issue for about 3 weeks at this point but didn't report it because previously the criminal had not shown me everything he can do or more so I didn't really understand what he was doing (sent me pictures of random code), the criminal had told me at the time that he can see customers X, X, X.... which is information we have access to anyway so I thought it was odd but did not think much of it and just moved on even though he talked about it a lot..

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in that room I felt if i said that i had known about this previously, I would get myself into trouble so I said I became aware of this the day I reported it which is when I had really found out  what he was doing and knew this needed to be highlighted.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days later my when I go into work my access gets blocked and I cant login, I sit doing nothing for 3 hours until a manager takes me in for a 2nd meeting. I was advised I am being suspended due to them having to investigate my account because I let the person do this thing on my account and me being the customer and they wanted to investigate me to ensure I was not involved I am guessing ?

I was then taken into a 3rd meeting 2 weeks later and they had queried if I discussed this previously with the person, I said no and technically lied for the 2nd time but only to protect myself but at the same time I genuinely didn't know the criminals motives and what he was doing which is why I didn't report it and I realize I should have just said that at the time.

  
They had then presented me a chat transcript of me discussing it with the person a few days prior to him showing me where he said something like "" This is still an issue and has not been fixed"" which i replied with ""aw for fucks sake xD"" and carried on with my work as I was busy and did not have time for chit chat. Due to my employer finding this I feel like I will be coming across as dishonest and I have received a phone call to inform me I am being taken to Disciplinary for gross misconduct, I am still waiting for the letter but unsure if this will be for allowing the criminal to actively test his intentions on my account or me being dishonest, I did not want to be involved in this situation, this person had just contacted me and started talking to me about it I guess because he liked me or because he thought I was maybe cool or liked him more than I did as a colleague and he got friendly with me ? I'm sorry I don't know.

I will have a final meeting with a head manager who will take all the points into consideration and listen to my side of the story to determine the best outcome.

I am not a human with negative intentions and I love my job and my customers and I feel like life is putting me in the worst position for something that is technically not my fault, I was just trying to protect myself and my job whilst doing the right thing for the business.

The criminal has since then sent me several Snapchats finding it amusing that he has lost his job and has no idea I had reported him. This criminal had worked for an external company that works for my company so it was not directly involved in my work and/or located in my office however we share the same systems and follow the same processes and guidelines.  


I guess due to him working for the external company (where its very easy to get a job) he does not care as much about the fact that he has lost his job however the company I work for is a bigger deal and if I lose this job my entire career will be over and my job is literally the only thing I have in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been at home for the past 3 weeks now stressing and draining myself mentally, unable to sleep, wondering what I am actually being accused of... I have never felt like this and its a terrible feeling. At one point I lied in my bed and stared at the wall for 5 straight hours until I noticed a spider crawling across it and had to move to get rid of it because I hate them..

I have £8,000+ Debt at 23 which I am trying to slowly chip away but if I lose this job I will go bankrupt and most likely live on the streets... I would never be prepared to go that low so I'm having constant thoughts of suicide and just wanting all of this to end... 

I guess I wrote this post to try get some re-assurance because I cant get this out of my head and cant focus on anything else until I know what the outcome will be but I don't even know what I want anymore..

From here on out I will call my friend J and most of this stuff happens on playstation.

J is an interesting person to put it lightly. Everytime J does something wrong or falsely accuses someone he will brush it off as ""ohh, yeah, I guess I did do that"". No apology, no explanation, no nothing. On the flip side if I make a misteak J will go balistic, calling me an A-hole, dumb***, an idiot, really hurtful stuff. No matter how many times I say to stop, say sorry, try to explain myself, he wont listen. He seems incredibly incapable of feeling remorse and apologising.

For example, on fortnite, J was upset because I was spamming my AR and phasing through his builds. I was beating him 35-5 on box pvp. He went through his entire speil on how horrinle I was. This time there was a catch. Another friend of mine was witnissing this and decided I had acted poorly. I had never said a single insult back and only tried defending my actions and explaining my side of the story because he kept interupting me. I know ar spam is annoying but it was working wonders for me and it was a part of the game. I dont feel I deserved all the hate.

Anyways J defriended me and the other friend there had left to go console J. A few days later I joined a party that a friend was in and J greeted me by saying ""hey A-hole"". Another person who only heard J's side of the story said hello meanie. Everyone then went on to mute me. J had ruined my reputation in our fairly large friend group becajse of how I used an ar to my advantage.

Well, recently, J fought me again. I desperately want to de-friend him but I know that I will still meet him because we have lots of mutual friends and I dont want to get outlawed again. What can I do?",08Aug2020,1

This is a really complex relationship so let me explain: I 12M have a crush on a girl who is also my age. This is my first crush. My mom and her mom work for the same company (they’re good friends )and we see each other during work vacations once a year. I’ve known her for 5 years. She is really nice and we always blend together nicely. However on text she’s a totally different person. We used to FaceTime. (My mom said stop calling her if she’s not calling back). We eventually stopped texting each other frequently. One vacation she was asking to hang out with me so much I asked her if she liked me and she said no. ONLY THEN is when I started crushing on her.Since that one we haven’t texted much but she gives really mixed signals.  (Her friend prank texted me that she likes me but sometimes she leaves me on read. . . . . forever). We haven’t ever been awkward though.

July 18 and July 25 - Had unprotected sex. Condom kept breaking so we decided not to use it. He didn’t cum inside me. We used pull out.

They are refusing to leaving the country although it is part of their agreement on the visa that you can not stay if you break up. They have got a lawer who is knowingly helping them stay in the country and has now got an extension to stay until next year under false circumstances. 

Ok that part is bad but not that bad however, they have now found a new guy and they have been together for a couple of month. she has made him feel so bad about the situation that he has offered to marry her so she can stay. He's a good guy but don't think he understands what he is doing and won't listen to anyone. He think he has done this out of kindness but after speaking to others who know the situation apparently this was her plan anyway, she has made it clear to everyone that she is here now illegally and that she doesn't want to go but needs to find a way to stay. My friend is being taken for a ride and could potentially get into serious problems if they  fall out or get caught doing freud. 

she is also being very manipulating in their relationship and it is not healthy. I can see this all going very wrong as he's a nice guy and won't listen to anyone about what she is doing. 

I feel like she should be reported as she is not only here illegally now but alway about to do something terribly illegal with someone we really care about and can not see what is going on and want to protect him. Also I am concerned that if they do try and get marred but it said on the spouse visa that she is with the original partner that would be them getting caught anyway and potentially he will get into trouble for that and she will be deported anyway.

I heard my sisters child crying in his room, he had been for the last hour, I ignored it for awhile until it became unusual, she would always wake up and get him, but she didn't. So I trudged out of bed and knocked on her door, there was no response, I entered into the room and saw her lying in bed like one might as they are fucking around on their phone and fell asleep, he legs crossed, her arms inclined and hovering over her phone, nothing strange. Until I saw it, her eyes were open, half a glare, a foam in her mouth, I disregarded this and looked away, surely my mind was playing tricks, I'd seen her like that before I convinced myself as I concocted similar situations, and I rushed to her bed, grabbed her leg and told her to wake up. Her leg was ice cold, part of me knew then but the mind is an incredible showman, redirecting attention to the most appealing aspect.

So I grabbed her arm, it was perfectly rigid(I still think about it, and whinge this deep guttural contraction in my stomach thinking about it at odd intervals, no matter the location), like rebar threaded through her arm, I couldn't budge it, I still didn't believe, every facility I had for self delusion immediately activated. I dragged her off the bed and begged her to wake up, I slapped her, I felt her pulse, all cold all nothing. My last hope was to run to my parent's room, I told my mom Molly wasn't breathing, I said she might be...but I was cut off before I finished my sentence as she moved past me towards her daughters room, she knew immediately, she is an old pro in these matters, I could hear her scream and I could do nothing to stop it.

She left the room, told me she was dead and to call the police, I maintained hope for the next 30 minutes, I thought this was some obscure nervous system suppression, some doctor house shit that they would be able to pull her out from, but it wasn't that at all. They showed up, they were kind, told me there was nothing they could do, though then they meandered well longer than they should have, they threw her room apart, they asked us questions, they took her phone, they were kind I suppose but they were there for hours, insouciant in the sense that what they saw was commonplace and what I saw was thanatos riding away with my dear, sweet, essentially twin sister.

I'd given her CPR before, I'd found her like this before, not like this per se, rather, with a suppressed nervous system so I gave her CPR until the paramedics arrived, they said I saved her. That was pyric in retrospect. I couldn't save her this time, she had been dead at least twelve hours, that's what the paramedics said, considering the state of her self.

I just can't stop blaming myself, I knew she was in trouble, I knew she was sad and an addict. The day it happened I knew she sold a little pot to make extra cash and I saw her earlier that day with a baggy of kush in her hand, saying she was just throwing it to a friend for a few bucks, but that had to be when she got it. I didn't say anything and now her son will grow up without a mom, I have little means to ameliorate the situation, my family is disintegrating, my father into platitudes and a vehement adherence to the process of these things, a wake, remembrance, gazing at pictures and casting these self serving dialogues he mumbles that just break me, ""oh poor molly"", ""you had such a challenged life"", my mother with just pure anger, the former of which I understand , its a process that I find dubious value in, but value nonetheless, but my mom is collapsing into hatred. I just don't know what to do, I don't know what to do and I hope I painted an comprehensive picture. I just don't know what to do, not just in grieving, but in living with this, this failure to protect her.

I'm sorry if this isn't very comprehensive, and I've asked this question before on askreddit but it was just about whether she was in pain or not, they assured me she just fell asleep, the gentle touch of hypnos yielding to the grip of thanatos. How can I manage this, how can I help my family, my mother is losing her mind, she can't even spend time with my nephew without telling me how much she hates my sister for what she did. My father is catatonic, and self immolating in his own shame. Her death was her fault, but it's not her fault she's gone I think, it was an accident, but with the impression she left, the lack of her is unbearable. She was my friend, I couldn't save her, I've given her CPR at least 4 other times, been through this more, but she was always a good person despite her weakness, she never stole, never did anything but care, but I didn't find her in time this time. I should have found her.

Has anyone else been through this, can you please help me?",08Aug2020,1
385,"tl;dr of current financial situation:

* Was working for successful family business
* Business had to close due to pandemic
* Got caught at worst possible time for my savings (right before an expedition where I dipped into them with plans to replenish after)
*  Currently on welfare payment in a moderately generous country
* This welfare payment will be reduced substantially in 2-3 months
* I will still be able to live on that payment, but not comfortably

The current plan is to start my own business, one I've been meaning to for a while.

A ton of the basic business infrastructure is in place — website, product/service, marketing plan, sales strategy, etc. I am confident this is all done to a high standard, certainly one capable of producing a good income.

The main barrier to actually succeeding is simply going ahead and *executing* - putting in 40-60  hour weeks for the startup to get it going.

I am facing a particular motivational problem where the ""deadline"" to financial independence (i.e. that 2-3 month gap where I'd really need to supplement the welfare payment) is now so short that I feel like I'm in denial; much like a student gets from an assignment that's too big to do in 1 week, and now it's due 3 days away. The task is too big for the time allotted, causing the person to make the cognitive error of therefore assuming that ""well it doesn't matter if I start 2 days out or 1 day out, it's too short either way"" — intellectually we know it's not true, but it screws the impulse to start a bit.

This is worsened by the rationale that I *could* technically live on the reduced payment, just not well. It's a weird hybrid of enough fear about the deadline that it 'shocks' me into the denial phase described above, but not enough fear to shock me out of it again.

Anybody have advice specifically on this motivational shortfall?",08Aug2020,1

389,"For some context, this might get a little long. 

I'm going to college next year and we have to give at least 2-3 program choices when we take the university admission tests. 

I'm an aspiring doctor. Ever since I was young, being a pediatrician was what I wanted. 

My parents are supportive, though they're kind of suggesting that I get a business course instead of a biology major or the usual ""pre-med"" programs. They told me that I can take the pre requisites for med school while getting a business major so that just in case I suddenly change my mind about pursuing medicine, I can still get jobs since business degrees are flexible. I get this because who knows, what if I suddenly change my mind? I know they're just looking into the situation realistically because aiming for a MD degree is not a joke. I understand their point because in my country, pre-med courses (bio, medtech, etc) are sadly underpaid. Basically they're not against me dreaming of becoming a doctor, but just giving me more options since it's only pre-requisites subjects that are needed for medicine proper. 

So this got me thinking about business: I feel like I could adapt to it since I feel like I'm a student who gives a lot of effort, but I don't know if I'm enough for it. There are people out there who are smarter when it comes to business, so I feel insecure getting into a course where I only have little knowledge in. (My brother insists that I shouldn't be scared because that's where school comes in--so that I can learn.)

This is my dillema because I feel like everyone I know are already set on what major they would take, and I still feel lost. What relieves me though is that my parents told me that while they were suggesting options, they would still support me in whatever course I wanted, and told me to just do my best. I really love them and don't want to let them down, so I'm scared of possibly making a wrong decision. 

Any advice is appreciated.",08Aug2020,1
390,"met this guy (25m) on discord and i(21f) don't know what to do and feel about him and his actions.

i(21f) met this guy (25m) on discord channel a month ago. i know it sounds like a joke. i never had internet friends before covid19 had hit all of us. 

anyway the first time i saw his face and heard his voice, i instantly fell in love. a week ago, i told him i like him a lot. he said that he knew because of how i was acting and also that he DOES feel attracted to me and definitely has similar feelings in his heart but just doesn't know how to interpret them.

he has been distant from discord (yes, me) for the weekdays and saturdays since he doesn't wanna get sucked into it and he is trying to get his life in order. (i don't know what exactly is going on.)

we had an 8 hr video call last sunday and he showed me lots of good signals like telling me he feels comfortable with being himself around me, but when i texted him this tuesday, ""tell me if my texts are bothering you while you're away for your digital detox"" he told me my texts are bothering him because i'm just talking at him. i haven't texted him back since then, he hasn't texted me either. 

i don't know what's happening his mind and why he isn't okay with just 30 minutes of daily texting with me. i'm not even sure we're gonna have a time to talk that long like last sunday ever again. 

what should i do? am i just a clingy bitch? is this guy really attracted to me or is he just bored on the weekend?

tldr; met a guy on discord. he is attracted to me. i am attracted to him, but he doesn't want me to text him during weekdays and saturday. he said my texts are bothering him since he's having a hard time with himself. is this guy really attracted to me or is he just bored on the weekend?",08Aug2020,1
392,"I hate living in my house a lot and I’m really looking for a job but its hard because of the pandemic, my own inexperience and laziness, and the controlling nature of my parents.

My older brother on the other hand has had one for sometime but he wasn’t really focused on saving his money and so still lives in the house. Recently he has been seeing his boyfriend at night and so has been staying out longer than my parents’ patience allows as he returns at 1 in the morning.

My parents don’t KNOW he has a boyfriend let alone want to believe he’s queer because they are homophobic but I know they know something is up. It has been a reoccurring thing where my parents yell at him because they are annoyed at his behavior and to that he still sounds like he did 8 years ago what with the yelling back in the tone of a teenager.

But it really does make me afraid when after or even during these altercations that he says that he will kill everyone in my house. It would be an empty threat but he owns a gun and ever since I was a child I know how reckless he is when he is emotional. I have had chairs and butcher knives alike threatened at me because I was just being a little kid.

I know all this frustration comes from the way my parents treat him. They had children with a strict idea of how their lives should play out, they never planned for my brother to not be fit for college or for one let alone two of us to commit the evil sin of having feelings for men. I got the better end of the deal because I was better at school. 

But when I came out to them I really felt how things shifted as I defied their expectations of what I should be and it feels like every independent decision I have tried to make after that was scrutinized or scoffed at.

I do not feel safe or happy in my house, which is why I’ve historically set out to busy myself outside, but because I wasn’t smart as a teenager it never really ended in pay. I really don’t know how to get myself out of this situation that makes me feel so unhappy and scared.",08Aug2020,1

394,"My parents (49 and 52) are somewhat approaching retirement age, and we all live in Norway.

Now hear me out, I know, I know. MOVE FROM NORWAY? Etc, etc.

It’s not that it’s bad in Norway, but I don’t think my parents understand the possibilities they have.

My father grew up in a super conservative place and with super conservative grandparents.

He was not allowed to drink alcohol, nor even play football or cards. He had to resolve to driving cars and motorcycles for fun.

My mother grew up with just my grandma, and were economically challenged throughout all her life and still is plagued by loans unpaid.

The economic difficulties have plagued my parents since I was 10, leading to lies and taking money behind each others’ backs, even cheating.

They are all good now, but they deserve better than to slave away corporate jobs 24/7 to make ends meet approaching 50-60 years old.

They hate snow, hate the cold, my father has an old school American car that he loves to drive with no roof on top. 

They love the beach and the sun and just nature in general.

I try to convince them every time the topic comes up how cheap it is to live in places such as Spain and Italy relative to Norway, and if our house were to be sold, how much a better, easier life they could live in a warmer climate.

But i really don't care if i lose anyone of them. 
I don't care if they die or leave or just stop existing.
Also Is it wrong of me to lie to them? Like when i tell my gf that i don't wanna lose her. It's true that i like being with her but i would not really care if i lost her.
Because I know I would be fine, I have a life goal and i don't need people to reach it. The only people close to me i feel i would care about losing is if i got children in the future and there mother. I care more if fictional characters or people that have inspierd me die then people i know. It feels wrong lying to people and tell them i care if i lose them when i don't.

They spend the day at the building with me and we do group sessions, they eat a meal, and do other games and activities that go along with our group sessions. This is my first job out of college and i replaced a woman who was there for many many years. The first 4 weeks went so great! I had absolutely no complaints, but then a new client was added which brought the total number up to 13. This new person immediately was so demanding to the others. She expects them to do everything for her without even saying please. I have not heard her say please once. She doesnt even give them a chance to reply before demanding more things out of them. If they dont do the task like she wants them to, she yells at them for it. She acts like she is running the place and is in control of them. For example, while another client was eating she yelled at him to stop eating and go get her a cup of water when she was right by the fountain herself. Another example is that she blew up and embarrassed another client because she didn't bring her the right type of water.

401,"Summery: A person was stabbed, possibly murdered. It might be a hate crime and my girlfriend and I could be the only ones with information on who did it. What should we do?



My girlfriend recently started helping out part time at a friend’s mechanic shop. 

Our long time friend and his crew at the shop are very generous and always willing to go out of their way to help people out. They’re the type who would give you the shirt right off their backs. While there has been good food and good times,  we hold significantly opposing world views when it comes to some pretty fundamental subjects. The friendship is warm, but superficial. In that Thanksgiving kind of way. They’re self proclaimed rednecks, and it’s a ”good ol’ boys” type environment. Inflammatory things are said and racist/sexist/homophobic jokes are common. It makes us uncomfortable, and we don’t hide how we feel, we call them out. We challenge them. What we don’t do though, is take a firm stand and make tolerance a condition of our friendship. Which I for one am feeling extra guilty about, especially in hindsight. 

There is another kid, we’ll call him Jason, who works there that we don’t know very well. The kid is also a longtime friend of the mechanic

Fox News was on the TV in the lunchroom today and Jason muttered something about the BLM group being terrorists. My girlfriend politely commented back that we, the protestors, are not terrorists, and have simply been asking for the same things for decades now with no change and that’s why we have to protest. 

The kid abruptly tosses the rest of his lunch and leaves the room. It was awkward, but my girlfriend didn’t think too much of it. 

After the kid had left for the day and my girlfriend and the mechanic were  cleaning up, he tells her the following story:

“Jason said he stabbed someone at the bus stop yesterday. He said a black man came up to him asking for a cigarette. He thought the dude was about to jump him, so he took out his knife and stabbed him a bunch of times until he saw blood. Then he ran away.”

My girlfriend was shocked upon hearing this story and didn’t know how to respond. 

Our friend then says something to the effect of “Guess that black guy shouldn’t have tried to mug him eh?” LAUGHS, and changes the subject. 


This story has been weighing heavily on our hearts all day. The overt and callous racism of our “friend” notwithstanding, we can’t help feeling like, with this information, we have some role to play in justice for this man. We don’t know if he’s alive, or whether or not he actually did advance towards Jason. We don’t believe it makes any difference whether he did or didn’t. If someone attacks you and you stab them, you call an ambulance and report the incident as self defense. You don’t run away and leave the person to bleed. He didn’t have a weapon. It wouldn’t matter if he did! We believe that this man, if he is dead, was murdered. And if he is in the hospital, he deserves some sort of legal recourse, at the very least to help his family with the medical bills. 

I feel like, if the man had actually attacked him and there was a scuffle, this kid Jason( I keep calling him a kid but he is 27, a grown ass man who should know better) should have had no qualms about reporting the incident. What makes more sense to me, is that this grown ass man had his hand on the handle of his knife the moment he saw a black man walking towards him. Some minor action caused him to feel threatened and attack the man out of fear. 
We searched the news reports, and there it was. African American man reported stabbed at a bus stop Thursday while the assailant fled. 

We think the right thing to do is to report Jason, but we only know his first name. The only other identifying information we can give the police is the location of his work, but that would be bringing our friends business into it. We would be snitches. They could find out our friend has been paying people under the table. 

That being said, we are so appalled and disgusted by our friend’s sadistic reaction to something so tragic. It’s so amplified by the climate of injustice in the world right now, and the call for all of us to say “fucking enough!” and stand up for what’s right. We’re questioning whether our friend and his crew deserve our loyalty. In fact, we know they don’t. 

But still the conflicting emotions persist...They were just so generous and they helped us out so many times when we were super in need without asking anything in return. Besides, my partner and I are leftist lesbians. We’re on the fringe, and they accept us. We wanted to believe their bigotry was just a joke...a joke In awful taste mind you, but unfortunately, there’s a culture up here. I guess I cared for them and wanted to make excuses for them...play the long game and strategically erode their outdated beliefs through civilized conversation... 

But it feels too late for that now. Shit got real. 

They have so much respect for government and their precious perfect justice system, but it’s okay to bypass that and play judge, jury and executioner to defend your property? That sounds more like anarchy to me. 


We can’t sleep and are in knots about this whole situation. My heart aches for the man left to suffer and bleed and call out for help. And the monster is someone my friend calls a friend. What a nightmare it is to live with so many people who think that this is normal and okay. Who think this man deserved what he got because he MAY have been trying to mug somebody. Who cares if he was? No one deserves to be left for dead. And no coward has the right to take his twisted sense of justice into his own hands.

I(18M) want to be financially independent for itty bitty things i need i have college schedule and studies but want to earn money and get the highest amount possible, use 1/2 of it on tech and things i could use for my room(Tv, Nintendo switch etc.), a sweet setup has always been my dream before i get too old for it, plus a brand new computer.(since I don't need to pay taxes) and deposit the other half for  monthly interest in my bank account and use the monthly interest to pay for low cost stuff without bothering my oarents for it.  currently ive thought of  winning the Lottery that'll come to about 5400 USD Maximum and like 0.108 USD minimum but lets face it chances are lower than 1% even if i spend on 10 of the same type of ticket.

best work to pay ratio(max if possible).
no degree specified.
Flexible working hours (due to college)
secure and reliable (if online/ unless not obvious)

i can work with Photoshop basics(no degree in it/no class taken, I'm self taught) and can do digital art but i don't mind Working with my hands either. I have basic carpentery etc. and can work with Word too(i hear it's a thing now to know to work with PCs)",08Aug2020,1

410,"I'm 17, and last week I got accepted to my first job in a pet store. Since the beginning the boss gave me weird feeling but I know that place and I felt lucky finding a job in this whole Covid mess.

However here my encounters with him (I've been working there for only a week) -

• He's not following rules he gave to the place. (Like wearing a mask or smoking in dedicated areas - he smokes inside the store).

• Told me ""he doesn't like being asked"" on my first day, made small mistakes and since then has been nagging me to asked him everything.

• Scares me that telling people the wrong price would cost me in my paycheck, when I asked him about price of a thing customer wanted he told me ""wow you're bad"" and ""you should stop embarrassing yourself in front of customers"".

• I noticed he never tell something good to his workers, not even the good ones.

• when my co workers and I are opening packages and would work to organize them together, he'll always come to me and tell me that I need to be more organized even though we're all a part of it and the mess is a part of the process.

• Told me ""next time say 'no problem'"" after I answered a very friendly ""of course"" to his ""thanks"", and he cusses and speak badly on customers with his workers and never EVER replied to my thanks (yeah, fuck him).

Moreover, a new guy started to work here a few days ago, he's in his early twenties and the boss treats him so differently.

I had so much more encounters with him and I don't know what to do. I'm always coming early, I'm working very hard and on my first day (out of naiveness ugh) I stayed an hour extra with no pay.

He expects me to study all the prices or items and what does what (it's a big store), I love animals but it doesn't mean I know what vitamins you sick cat need and what's their price after a week.
I work for less than minimum wage (since I'm not 18 yet) and I'm not willing to take more than an hour of my free time to study more about the products.

Am I right? What's your experience with a bad boss?

I signed a paper where I committed to work there for 6 months, am I stuck? I honestly started to do a bad job and wait for them to fire me, is this a good way to deal with it?

I (f23) love my boyfriend (m31) of a year. I’ve never cheated before. He’s cheated on me with multiple females.( I can’t get it out of my head.) Sometimes it affects our sex life. It gets hard to let him touch me. I just started being able to have consistent sex with him again since finding out he cheated the first four months of our relationship with at least three different females. (And two trans people) our sex life just isn’t the same. I’ve asked to swing, switch it up, threesomes, bondage, try dom and subbing but he makes it all about him and his comfort. He hasn’t tried to please my body in ways I’d like in so long. I wear lingerie for him, i suck and fuck on demand. I have to initiate by sucking him off, then I ride him for a half hour and if I’m lucky and he hasn’t cum more than once he might flip me over and hit it from the back until he gets off a second and third time. It’s the same thing over and over. I love him and I don’t want to ruin our relationship but our sex life is so stale, we’ve talked about it over and over and nothing has changed. It’s all about him. I’ve asked, Ive explained, I’ve pleaded for change. I don’t want him to be mad that I cheated but I’m considering it heavily. Why did he get to cheat and still have a woman like me while only giving mediocre sex? I’ve thought about cheating since finding out he cheated in February (pretty sure it’s mostly out of spite). Now with our boring sex I’ve thought about cheating almost everyday. My eyes are closed playing different scenarios each time we have sex.

413,"Trying to make it short - 28M - I don’t think a lot of myself am not cocky, I don’t intentionally want to be like this, quite the opposite. 

I have a lot of friends in all corners of the world. But not a lot of close ones due to constantly moving.

I have an infectious personality that attracts people both friend wise and romantically. 

This personality then attracts people who want to be friends or more to the point that within months they are willing to do do anything for me and any idea that I put forward goes. I try to let people suggest things and try not to be the centre of attention. 

The problem is a lot of the time I don’t notice it is happening, I then let them inside my life and 
When I think that I finally found a close friend who I think may not see that side of me, I become obsessed with them to the point I want to hold on to them. I get jealous like a teenage girl and almost stalk them wanting to know where they are at 24/7. 

They eventually notice both sides of me, the manipulative and obsessive and rightly want nothing to do with me.

He becomes so difficult, mean, controlling, and pushes all the blame to me. He’s yelled and cursed at me countless times to the point I’m used to it now. All my friends tell me I should break up with him but I haven’t because I feel like the good things outweigh the bad things.

420,"Hello everyone.

Yesterday me and my  long distance friend had i really nasty discussion trough the phone, i was really mean to her and i offended her a lot without even realizing and im feelling really bad right now.

The reason why i was angry at her is because she hurt me in the past because i developed fellings for her when she didnt want anything with me, she said she didnt want relationships with anyone and  said some hurtful things to me, but i forgave her and everything was ok. She said she was going trough a hard time and wanted to be alone, i asked if she wanted to talk about it but she said she didnt want to share what goes on in her life right now, so i left her alone.

Even though she said she wanted to be alone, she was still posting stuff online haging out with other people, and yesterday 3 weeks after saying she wanted to be alone she reachout to me to check up on me, but the first thing told was that she was seeing someone , she knew that i had fellings for her i felt like she just said that to hurt me even more, and i just lost my temper and i lashed out onto her. We talked every single day  for almost 6 months i was always kind and understanding with her, she opened up to me about so many things and we had a really amazing connection with one another, but i felt like she lied to me and used me as an emotional tampon and when she found someone else she abandon me, i know she says she was having a hard time but her actions show otherwise saying she didnt want realationships with anyone and 3 weeks later messaging me saying she found someone, i felt lied to and deceived so i lost it, and i feel bad about it.

She said she was really offended and said we shouldnt talk anymore, but said maybe we could talk about it later.

I appoligized to her and said i wanted to fix this and still wanted to be her friend and she could message when we both cooled off, but despite this she blocked my number and blocked me on social media, so i have no means to contact her.

So much anxiety while writing this so will make it brief, 

 Recently met a wonderful girl at the same age. Felt like we both were at the same point in life and we had identical personalities, like we were the same person but in opposite sexes. We had been seeing each other for almost two months! Last weekend she just dropped from out of nowhere that she had a fucking kid already since 3 years and that the father left for another woman 2 years ago. I was fucking devastated even though I tried to play it cool like “oh that’s fine” it felt like a fucking shot in the face. I had let myself fall in love with this girl and now I’m just at a point I don’t know how to move on. Why the fck did she wait 2 months to tell me about this?

Now I’m asking, how do I let her know I want to move on without hurting her feelings? I don’t need to state the reason why, but just telling her this so suddenly after all the good times we had the last two months would be pretty obvious. I just want to be true to myself and what I feel is right and I can’t really see myself going forward with her after this.

Thanks in advance.",08Aug2020,1
429,"My (18m) girlfriend (17f) and I have been together since the start of the pandemic and we have been very happy! Overall, we hav even friends for close to 3 years and really close for maybe 1.5-2 years total. At the beginning of this year we started hanging out a lot more and finally started a relationship.

We are happy, our relationship is very tight and I feel like what we have is unbreakable. But, with everything going on, I have been experience more feelings that I cannot control.

We hangout a lot, close to six days a week with maybe one or two days off a week. We like to see each other obviously and we really enjoy our time together. However, the problem lays when she would like a day to herself, go out with other friends, or hell, just play a game without me. My surface level thought it, “Of course!” As the caring boyfriend I only hope to be this is exactly how I should feel. But after a few moments, thoughts like, “Is she getting annoyed with me? Do we hangout too much and is she getting upset with that? Why doesn’t she want to see me?” Start coming up. It’s like I go against what I actually know and want to feel! It frustrating to me because then this will lead to me to have what I assume to be are panic attacks over the fact that I thought these things. I’m always so nervous that she will get fed up with me for acting this way and we will lose the really good thing we have together.

She knows I feel this way, and has countlessly reassured me that nothing will make us break up, so why do I keep feeling this way? I want to be able to allow her to be her own person without having dumb thoughts that lead me down a path of anxiety and stress. Any price of advise on what to do would help :)

432,"I really need some advice on a situation I’m not part of but can’t get out of my head. I don’t live in my home country anymore but when I visited my sister told me a story about her childhood best friend S.

S was always a bit odd and very insecure about it. She desperately wanted to be part of „the cool kids“ in Highschool but never got into the clique. My sister (like her) is as nerdy as you can get but she was always very happy in her space and with her friends. While S kept thinking about how if she would only have designer cloths she could be more popular (which wasn’t the case she was just a bit odd and in Highschool that doesn’t help).

Anyway she met her now husband when she was in her mid twenties after a bad break up (first ever long term boyfriend cheated on her for years) and he was 10 years older but as nerdy as her and they always seemed happy together. He definitely plays the part per cliche - overweight, long greasy hair in a pony tail. Their wedding vows were in elbish, they game together, collect comic status, go to comic con etc.

They also play live action role play together for many years. And my sister now told me that in the last year his character in the role play got a girlfriend. While they texted in private about the role play they apparently fell in love with each other. He told S about it upfront and said he wanted a relationship with both. S had a friend from the roleplay group that went through something very similar only that her friend took it quite bad / jealous and they had a bad break up so S wanted to avoid that. Apparently they talked about it and she accepted it and the girlfriend move in with them. They now have a relationship the 3 of them - sleeping together in the same bed, having sex together etc. He is 42, S is 32 and the girlfriend is 24. according to my sister the girlfriend is very insecure and just came out of a bad relationship. 

I don’t mind if people have an open relationship, everyone can do what they want but especially since I heard her age I can’t shake off the feeling that there is something inherently wrong with the situation. The fact he is so much older and met both at a young and vulnerable stage in their life just doesn’t seem right. 

Am I being too concerned about other people’s life’s or should I do something? I wouldn’t even really know where to start I haven’t seen my sisters friend in maybe 10 years?

440,"Hello, I will try to not make this too long. I'm 17, and I've wasted my teenage years and my childhood being afraid to try anything new because I hated being behind everyone. It's just my nature and also a result of trauma that I won't go into.

I've become a hermit to avoid judgement from other people. I've stopped drawing, playing guitar, singing, writing, and I've avoided trying new things because it is painful to do anything. I find myself crying when I am working because I think about how much of a failure I am. My disorders also make me fall into depressive episodes which results in me not doing anything. 

My skills have actually decayed as a result. Or at least I think they have, I'm not sure because I view everything I make as bad. Also, with guitar, I learned that my teacher had been teaching me in a very awful way. I basically have to start all the way over. I've been playing for years, and I basically haven't learned anything. I can't blame my teacher completely though. My depressive episodes result in me completely avoiding my guitar because the cords sound awful to me since I'm constantly comparing myself to other guitar players. 

I didn't take AP classes or DC classes because I was too scared of being compared to other students and talking to other kids about grades and the future. I'm taking AP art this year, and I'm terrified. Our school year is online which is a god send. I can't see other people's art, but even then, I can't motivate myself to make anything. I can't try anything new. I'm not stuck with a boring concentration because I was too scared that I'd make something bad. 

I've tried to stop using social media to avoid seeing other people's creations and success, I've avoided talking to people for the last two years, I stopped sharing things I've made with others. It hurts. I want to try new things. I want finally learn how to skateboard, program, and improve my old skills. I want to actually show people things and be proud. But it feels like I can't. 

I'm turning 18, and I'm not good at anything. This is my senior year, and it feels like I'm running out of time. 

And to add on, I'm not mad at anyone for being successful. I think they're amazing, and I wish I was at their level. I am not a bitter person. I only hate myself.

All advice is much appreciated. Thank you",08Aug2020,1

Story: we’ve been together for a year then this pandemic hit. Everything was well and perfect before this. We didnt see each other due to the lockdown and by the end of the 2 month of lockdown, she decided to break up with me because she needed to be alone and didnt have feelings for me anymore. We didnt fight or have anything before this. Just a few days before that happened we were talking about our future plans. Im sure that theres no 3rd party involved as we are very honest we each other about this.

Nighttime hits me a lot since we would talk for hours before so i feel very down about 90% of the nighttime. Been losing sleep and waking up early automatically. Seems like my body doesnt want me to sleep. Ive been distracting myself with work and exercise but nothing is helping.

For the past, two years? I think? My mom's been sniffing this liquid glue (Fevicol). At first, I told her to stop doing that, but she kept saying it was 'her way of coping with depression'. Then she started shouting at me, so I stopped bringing up that topic.

I haven't and can't speak to my dad or any other adult about this. That will lead to them and my mom fighting, and she'll blame me for days,

Recently, she has been diagnosed with some kind of heart disease. Not sure about the complications, but I used it to my advantage and told her to stop sniffing the glue. She reacted fairly well and said she'll stop, but she still does it. I know old habits die hard, but she argues with me when I point it out.

ANYWHERE I hide it, she finds. I can't discard them because I use it for DIYs and such, and even if I do discard them she buys more. I don't even know all the places she keeps them...only a few. Under the bed, in the couch cushions...

She knows about the consequences and simply doesn't care. She also sniffs nail polish sometimes. If I blatantly refuse to give it to her, she threatens to hit me.

She was my best friend someone who found me when I’d be crying in my room because of a shitty home life and let me home her. She’s been my silent friend for years and now she’s gone. 

My brother was arrested the same day for assault on a man who racially provoke him. He’s been released for now but I don’t know if they want to charge him or not. 

The next day on the way to see my sisters and pass him on the bus. I get to my sister to see him running out a car into the house. Someone came for him with a small machete. He has a small gash on his chest and they almost severed a finger. 

This weren’t even the worse part. He managed to grab the knife from the boy but doesn’t remember if her stabbed him or not. The blood on his shorts wasn’t all his. He has to go to a hospital ten miles away in case the boy went to one near by. 

I had to clean the knife wrap it in tissue and cling film and his it in a bin on the estate. 

I had to call my dad and let him know someone tried to kill my brother.   This comes a month after they robbed him for his car and scared half his face. 

I’m scared my brother is going to be dead or in prison by the end of the year. 

I relapsed with self harm because I didn’t know how else to process my grief and anxiety. I live alone and when I have a breakdown there’s no one to comfort me. I can’t call over a friend because of COVID. I can’t talk to my dad about this because I’m scared he’ll just be too over protective.

He knows I used to self harm so I know how he’ll react. 

I deal with shit in my own but now I’m alone when I need help the most and I can’t open up to even my best friend for help.

This is my first time here and it's because I'm at a loss as to what to do.
I(17, F) am friends? More like just close classmates with a dude(17,M) who's kind of hard to talk to on a regular basis. 

I'll start of by saying that i don't agree with the way he goes about doing things. He's always posting those sad bart simpson edits, actively says he's going to commit suicide and is generally hard to talk to because he always mentions it and never wants to listen to anything positive. I'll admit i usually chuckle it off as him being him, because when i respond seriously he tells me i don't know how he feels/ what he's talking about/ to not get involved.

I don't know how to deal with it because i firmly believe that if you want help dealing with these things you should talk to a professional and not post it on social media. To me it looks like attention seeking. But maybe it's just me and I'm being shallow.
Anyway he just posted something along the lines of ""i can't take it, I'm commiting suicide"". And i responded with 'dude' privately. I don't know what to tell him or how to comfort him. Maybe it's not my place, we're not that close after all. 

It's happened multiple times before and I've tried being supportive, recommending therapy, reminding him that he has friends, telling him about things he loves and will miss out on. He blew it all off.
 
I want to be able to do something for him but i don't know if he's gonna blow it off again or if it's just a way for him to get attention or if he's actually going to kill himself and is asking for help in the only way he knows how.
I won't be able to forgive myself if he dies knowing i could have tried something.
Please tell me what to do. I'm honestly at a complete loss.
I'm sorry if i come off sounding shallow and too lazy to bother doing anything. But I've tried multiple times to appeal to him to no avail and it's honestly stressful dealing with him because i don't know if i might tip him over the edge by saying something wrong.",08Aug2020,1

459,"I (F17) know this is probably a fairly common thing. This wasn’t ever really a problem for me before until I became best friends with two very nice people.

Long story short, I fell in love with one of them, the other one was diagnosed with cancer (they’re okay now!), it’s been a rough year on all sides and I’m now struggling with some new issues that I didn’t have before. Now when my two friends hangout without me, I suddenly get very jealous and upset. I try to make sure they don’t find out about my envious feelings, as I know it isn’t fair to either of them, but how can I make these feelings go away? Or lessen them?

I’m not even sure entirely what it is I’m scared of. I did have a toxic relationship with one of them for awhile that we have been working on, and things are a lot better now so I know that I don’t have to feel insecure or threatened about our relationship. I used to be scared that they did not like me as much as our other friend and I was jealous of their relationship with them because I wanted to have something like that. We’ve sorted it out, but sometimes I still feel my past feelings. I know I don’t have to worry anymore, but I do.

I’m trying to learn to enjoy spending time with myself. I’ve been doing pretty good with it. But sometimes it’s too hard to do that for too long. I’m kind of tired of spending time with myself.

461,"One of my friends heard me listening to a song and thought that it was weird to listen to music in another language. I never really realized that it was different to other music to other people. To me it was just music that I can listen to just like any other song. She and her younger brother would joke about it being weird with their parents. 

One time I was staying at their house with my brother and while we were eating dinner, their mom said “What’s that music that OP listens to? Alexa play Kpop.” It was so embarrassing because it was obvious that nobody else there liked that type of music and they all thought that it was weird but I just had to sit there while they talked about how bad it was. 

I thought that if I was more like some of the Kpop fans I knew at my school, I would make friends that liked it too and they wouldn’t make fun of me. Everyone in my class that I knew liked it always wore Kpop hoodies to school. I bought one but I never really wore it anywhere but school. When I did wear it, people would constantly stop me in the halls to ask “Is your shirt that Chinese band?” Then there was this one kid who liked another Kpop group so he always said “Yeah that group’s music is okay but Monsta X is WAY better.” Apparently I picked the wrong hoodie because now whenever I wore it he would make sure I knew that his favorite group was better. I never even asked for his opinion or told him that I did or did not like the music he listened to. 

I thought that if I introduced Kpop to my brother, I wouldn’t be alone and we would both be able to like it. When I showed it to him, he kind of liked it but, if someone else makes fun of me for liking it, he would pretend that he hated it and join them. 

Then there’s my dad. He found out that I liked it and looked up Kpop. He then decided to play it on his phone out loud. A BTS song came on and he just sat there telling me how it’s weird music and “How can you even understand what they are saying?” I don’t even like Kpop that much but as soon as anyone found out that I did, they made it seem like I was obsessed with it. 

Since my dad only knew about BTS, he asked me what it stands for. I don’t know so he renamed it to “boys that stink” and now him and my brother call them that every time they decide to talk about weird Japanese music that I’m obviously obsessed with. 

I did have a few friends that liked Kpop before I even knew what it was. One of them was talking about going to a concert. I didn’t really want to go because I can just listen to music at home without and overwhelming amount of people screaming in my eardrums. I’m pretty sure that I was talking to my mom and told her that my friend wanted to go to a Kpop concert thing. Anyways my brother must have heard me and assumed that I was asking to go with her. My family was in the car talking about how my mom had been to a concert for one of the songs playing on the radio or something like that. I said that I didn’t know how people can go to concerts because it seems so loud and so crowded. The my brother started saying “But you wanted to go to that Kpoop concert!” 

I don’t understand why everyone I know thinks that I’m weird for listening to Korean music. It’s just like any other music that I listen to. Now I don’t tell anyone what music I like because I can’t imagine what they would say if they found out that I also like folk music or something like that. If I say that I like Japanese music, they will think I’m a weeaboo. If I say that I like Taiwanese music, they will say that it’s bad. If I say that I like Russian music, my dad will sit there and start talking about how Russia is corrupt and a dumb Soviet communist country. If I say that I like music in English, they will say that it’s a weird genre. If I say that I like anything else, it’s weird because I can’t understand the language and we all know that that is the most important thing when listening to music. 

Anyways now I have a Kpop hoodie that I haven’t worn in years and I never even liked in the first place, everyone thinks that I’m obsessed Korean music, and I don’t even know why everyone thinks this. Yeah I listen to Kpop but I listen to other music as well. Just because I listen to Kpop doesn’t mean that I’m obsessed with everything they do. Just because I have a hoodie from one group doesn’t mean that I hate your favorite song. I’ll listen to songs from pretty much and language or genre so why if Korean music the problem?

**What should I do?** Even if I stop listening to Korean music, they will still make fun of me whenever someone brings it up. Also I don’t want to stop listening to a certain type of music for that because I don’t see why the fact that it’s in Korean or Japanese or Chinese matters.",08Aug2020,1

470,"Used to play rough and do bad stuff when he was little and I wasn't very involved as a parent due to my own flaws, but after my situation changed 3 years ago I was able to put an end to a lot of it. He lives here full time unless he wants to visit with Grandma. 2 years ago my older son came back to live with us during semesters and younger son is 3 weeks a month. Last year he started getting worse again and now it's full blown.  
He has been screened multiple times, different doctors and goes to counseling and as far as I know does not have any behavioral or mental conditions. He does stuff for the hell of it, to get back at his brother, for shits and giggles, to get a reaction from his friends or me, etc of what he's told me/what the counselor or I have concluded.   
At least once a week, he's breaking things, has broken dishes and a shelf and my bedroom door and a $1k TV, swiping glass off shelves at the store, golfing or batting things out the window, ripping up my legal documents and paperwork, hitting his brothers or humiliating them, throwing food and screaming and spitting on me and other childlikes, making extensively inappropriate jokes, breaking into friends houses or the neighbor's house, going out after curfew or in the middle of the night or places he's not supposed to be, lying about things his brothers are doing or what he's doing, has even stolen games and movies from the neighbor even though they deny it. Sometimes threatens and tells me about bad things he's going to do or pretends like he's going to pour water on my computer or hard drive. And when he's not misbehaving, it's being severely hurt. Over the last 2 months he's broken his toe, opposite foot, sprained his wrist, contracted mono, gotten a kidney infection, and always has food poisoning or something like that so of course I'm always anxious.  
At my wit's near end. Have tried everything I can imagine, from just talking to him about his actions, giving him stuff to do away from his brothers and helping them all get along, having him go to work with me or grandma coming over, adjusting house rules to make some more explicit and eliminate others to allow expression, getting him to a counselor, letting him change to another counselor, physically restraining him by picking him up or hugging him when he's breaking or running around, having his father and older brother talk to him, letting him spend more time with his father, reducing time with his father, grounding him in the house and from his things, limiting who he hangs out with and what he watches or plays, locking the basement and attic and his older brothers room, not buying something he wants and taking away things permanently, giving him work to replace things, and considering Dr. Phil, CBD oil, and calling Father Karras. I've recently tried bribing him with privileges to not do things or to do more helpful things instead, and even his older brother and I have tried ignoring him and not giving a reaction.   
He's gotten suspended from school countless times, he's also gotten punishments at school for dress code and skipping classes. I will work from home to homeschool him so it's not really worth being suspended. He had behavioral therapy but got a referral to another city and he refuses to go to the other BT because he hates sitting in the car. A few times that I grounded him he convinced his younger brother to go get what he was grounded from, just to do it. Sometimes when I ignore, he'll start doing it worse or completely stop, but I'm not going to play the ignore my child game.  
He doesn't respond to any of it, whatsoever. He does understand and he'll listen in situations where it's really important. He'll do things I tell him to without ever complaining unless it's telling him not to do something or do something instead, he'll behave at grandma's with the same rules but he can't live there. Otherwise it's just a cycle of doing stuff he's not supposed to be. Now, he's perfectly fine waiting to be not grounded anymore, sitting home or doing work, he glides right through it like a champ.

I did tell my friend call me when he isn't around and I'll hang out, but I ignored him when he called me to come with that guy (friend  really enjoyed the group board games). He stopped calling/messaging. 

That wasn't the only reason I stopped, I realized that I did so much for the guy and I felt like if ever I asked him anything he didn't or wouldn't do it and that my opinion or what I want didn't matter. Small things. Like in 10 years time he's never been to my place or come and pick me up if I asked him but I should go to his place always and anytime, or pick him up, I've even picked up his dad several times. There are other things too. 

I did go to their place a few months later without telling them I was coming  Talked to them, chilled for hours. Told him to call me for the NBA playoffs. But he didn't and didn't contact me at all after that till now...

Should I say screw it and leave him in the past? Or give him a call....",08Aug2020,1
472,"the title is wack and i’m not quite sure what to do about this situation. ever since my dads gf has lived with us, she’s been overfeeding my cat to the point where he’ll throw up. i do take into account that maybe quarantine is to blame since everybody is home, but i’m not 100% bc based on my dads gf attitude.. i know what she’s doing. my cat has gained so much weight since march and he’s older (8 yrs old), and his joints have started making cracking noises when he walks. he still jumps and moves around fine but i hate knowing it’s gonna get worse. 
i’ve noticed my cat also trouble breathing, he breathes loudly just walking around the house and when he sleeps i see him breathe heavy then stop breathing for a few moments, then breathe again. (sleep apnea?)
she’s really fed him so much since march so i’m seeing all these concerns. i hate it and i love my cat so much. he was fine before she came here. 

my dad and i have told her to not feed him, only my dad gives the right amount, but he’s caught her overfeeding him multiple times. 
i’ve had a bad gut feeling about her since day 1, and none of my dads side of the family likes her. 
i used to believe she was such a positive influence bc she had given me good advice w/ family shit but then she got verbally abusive and is very hateful and i avoid talking to her when i can. 

anyways, i’m sorry to how dumb this whole situation is and i wish i didn’t have to worry about some manipulative &amp; selfish person slowly killing my cat, but i am. 
my dad is bothered by her overfeeding him too but she still does it!!!
this morning she did it again and my cat threw up once again :) 
then a couple days ago i heard her feeding him outside of the times my dad feeds him. 
my cat sure does love the extra food but his health is already declining. 

i know she’s a dog person and has been planning on getting a dog, my dad wants one too but my cat prob wouldn’t like the dog so there’s been no rush to get one. 
her son (14) lives with us too, and he harasses the cat. hissing = lets bother the cat more. my dad, my siblings, and i have also told the kid to leave him alone when he growls or hisses but the kid hates authority.  

this whole situation is fucked and there’s so much more i can complain abt my dads gf and her son but my main worry is about my cat bc i don’t want him getting worse health issues bc she keeps overfeeding him. 

i don’t trust this woman or her crazy son and i love my cat so much i hate hearing his joints crack, and seeing him get fatter. 
i cant speak up about anything bc she doesn’t listen and will treat me like shit and my dad can’t “go against her”. 
what the hell do i do about this situation? 
i wanna move his food to my room but i feel like my dad will get annoyed by that so i’m low on options.",08Aug2020,1

474,"I have this ‘friend’ that has always compared my work to hers; my grades and things like that. If I grade better than her, she will have a weird jealous look to her, and if she does better she’s so ecstatic, not at the fact that she did well but at the fact that she ‘beat’ me. I know this because she will explicitly say it beat you!’ It’s as a joke but when she speaks there’s always more truth to it. 

Recently she’s finally decided she wants to become a primary school teacher after graduation. she’s known I’ve wanted to be a primary school teacher for as long as I can remember. She’s always saying snarky remarks now like ‘we both know ima be a better teacher than you’ and it kind of infuriates me. 

She’s also recently decided she wants to go to the same university I’m wanting to go to because ‘it’s better’ but I am praying I don’t have to see her anywhere near me after graduation.

I feel like I have to compete with her and it’s the absolute worst feelings. Its a jealous feeling. I don’t want to feel this way, because I know the only persons success I should care about is my own. And I don’t need this added stress when I should be studying for exams.

483,"My sister, A, has always seemed a bit mature for her age. When she was about 11/12, we found out she was having cybersex with a stranger (middle-age, M) she met from FB. This repeated again last year. A was only 13 when we discovered that she was manipulated and groomed by her gym instructor (M30+) into giving him a blowjob.

In both instances, my other sister (F17), J, was the one who found out about it through snooping through her messages (without A's consent) and I was the one who 'snitched' to mom about it. I don't regret snitching in these cases because A had no idea what kind of grave danger she was in. My mom was a progressive woman who understood A's actions and helped with her recovery. Unfortunately, she was also in complete denial of the fact that our family dynamics played a huge role in A's reckless behavior. So while she doesn't really demonize A for her actions, she still believes that A is to be held solely accountable for her flawed decisions (which IMO is just wrong).

I've always felt that A had a lot of issues with our family. My parents always compared my sisters to me, telling them 'why couldn't you be more like your sister' etc. Of the two, A, who was smart academically like I was, took these comparisons to heart. A's accomplishments were always dismissed in contrast to mine (my dad once joked that while I was artistic, A was autistic). I only noticed signs of A's pain when I became mentally ill and saw eerily familiar behavior. These signs were further confirmed when J found a diary containing entries detailing A's wish to die for she will never be enough anyway. Again, my mom's position on the family factor doesn't help at all. The constant dismissal of our parents, unreasonable pressure to be 'more talented', and numerous violations of her privacy, I feel, eventually led to A's reckless search for the acknowledgment and affection she could not find in our family. 

Jump back to now. J tells me that A personally confided to her that A was no longer a virgin. A didn't tell J who she lost her virginity to, but it seemed like it was a recent development (something that happened during quarantine). J had her suspicions that it was her and A's mutual friend (M18; groped J when she was sleeping; currently still flirting with A). J also told me that A verbatim said: ""It wasn't something that I wanted to happen."" 

Given that A trusted J to keep this secret, we agreed to keep this to ourselves and to wait for A to tell me. However, I can't help but have second thoughts. Although I know that it's great that A finally feels secure enough to share a secret with us, keeping mum about this only delays A from getting the support she needs (esp if she was raped + past trauma unearthed). As sisters, it goes without saying that we keep and cover for each other's secrets from our parents (for reasons mentioned above) but there are always few and rare exceptions. 

Should this be one of those exceptions?

TLDR: My youngest sister, who has mental health issues, trust issues, family issues, and a history of past sexual abuse, has confided to our other sister that she has lost her virginity, saying ""it wasn't something she wanted to happen."" Should I tell our mother that she may have been possibly manipulated and raped so that she can receive help immediately, even though we risk losing her trust in us in the process?",08Aug2020,1

 I'm 14 and have a job, with my first paycheck I bought a bunch of computer parts and built my first pc. I'm just waiting on a new power supply to complete it. My computer doesn't have integrated wifi so I have to use it wired. I have a wired connection that goes to my laptop but my stepdad likes to unplug it just because he can. I have a wireless adapter coming in the mail in about a week so I have to use my wired connection.

 When I got this cable I went to go plug it into the wifi router as you do, my stepdad asked what the hell I was doing and I said plugging in my cable, that I paid for my self. He told me I was not allowed to because ""I got that router myself so fuck off"". My mom pays for the internet service. We got into an argument about it and he said he'd cut it if I tried to plug it in again. I talked to my mom and she said I'd have to do a shit ton of cleaning to get it. 

When he found out I got a computer and I need him to not touch my cable for a few days at least (my mom told him) he got so pissed. He started to call me lazy and said all I do is sit on my ass all day. I do nothing 2 days out of the week after cleaning nasty ass hotel rooms for the other 5, I think I should be able to not do anything on my days off.

I am 24 Years old and just finished University.

I have been in a shitty place most of my life. Never had friends in high school, college and just finished university without making any friends. I have always had trouble making friends because my parents have always pushed broken ideals on me. I am just now realising how broken they are. 

I just graduated a degree in a subject field that I hate. I only went forward for it into college and university because my parents forced me into it. I have been trying to get a job right now but corona isn’t helping.

It has been two years since I have spoken to someone other than my family. Primarily my mother. Being alone is really fucking with me. I just live in silence 24/7 and it really gets to me. I wake up, exist and then go to bed. Throughout the day i literally do nothing. I used to game heavily but stopped a year or so ago. 

I think I would be happy away from my family but my Mother is alone and a broken wreck since my father died. I am thinking that I would just exist until my mum died then kill myself.

I really don’t know what else to do. Thing is I hate this, but know I could do it and endure it.

Recently I (F19) matched with a guy (M19) on a dating app. We started talking and hit it off immediately. We texted/snapped for about a week before we actually met up due to some COVID stuff and busy schedules. He came over on Wednesday night at 7pm for our first ""date"" (we were just planning on eating takeout and smoking) and we ended up hanging out until 8pm on Thursday. We watched movies, played card games, smoked, slept, other activities (iykyk), and while I had to do some remote work on Thursday he laid in bed with me and insisted that he wasn't even bored, just happy to be spending time with me. He's incredibly intelligent, handsome, tall, and funny. We have a similar sense of humor and world/political views. He texted his family Thursday evening to figure out what time he had to get home for a family event and told them that he wanted ""to get in as much time as possible"" with me. He's absolutely melting my heart. 

I absolutely loved every second of the 25 hours we spent together and when we started talking about seeing each other again, I told him that I was going to cancel another date (which he loved to hear lol) so that we could. We made plans to hang out again tonight (Saturday). Before he left on Thursday he was looking at me and said ""I think you're what I've been looking for"" and kept repeating how much he was enjoying our time together. 

Here's the issue. I go to college in our hometown (where we both are now) and he goes to college out of state (about a 5-hour drive from here). His college is resuming in-person classes soon and he's leaving this coming Friday and probably won't be back until Thanksgiving. I knew this was the case, but didn't think much of it because I didn't expect things to go this well. 

I'm a total commitment-phobe but I was looking at him the other day and I couldn't help but think about how I didn't even want to entertain anyone else. I haven't felt like this in a long time and I don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated that he's leaving because I really think this could be good. Anyways, he's coming over tonight and I can't stop thinking about what will happen after Friday. Any advice on what I should do/ask him? How can I make this work? Would it be worth it?

494,"I hope this is the right subreddit for my question, so 2019 I was still in college and now I'm a working citizen, so me and my 4 male roommates decided to have drink at the rooftop of the dormitory that we are staying, we we're allowed to drink inside the premises and the land lady is very nice and we were also nice. 

So this was a school night but we still decided to have a drink, we really don't go to bars or rave parties because it would be much expensive to go to bars than buying the liquor and just drink it on our own dorm, we prefer like talking and having fun on our own, so before we set up the chairs and the table on the rooftop we decided to try the new liquor that has been f**ckng up other college students it was called ""The Bar Pink"" it's a Gin, so at that time I was pretty confident because it's just a Gin with a new brand and I'm a pretty good with alcohol and I never once throw up and I'm pretty aware of my own doings when I'm drinking, but it was a big mistake, so when we bought the liquor at the nearest 7/11 store and arrive at the dorm that we were staying at, one of our female dorm mate just arrive from her classes and she brought a friend with her(let's just say her name is Kira), also female, she said that her friend will be staying for the night for some school related reasons, anyways we invited her because she's also fun to be with when drinking and we're really tight friends and we also told her that invite her friend with us at the rooftop so that we get to know her also, just a disclaimer we're not those kind of douche guys who are trashy when it comes to women, we really are friendly, so anyways on with story of the alcohol situation, so we got the introductions done and we drank the new Gin that we bought, at my first shot I was surprised because it wasn't that strong when you straight up drink it, 

So fast forward we were drinking and enjoying our youth and me after at 3 or 4 shot happened BAMN! I WOKE IN MY BED NO MEMORIES OF WHAT SUDDENLY HAPPENED, AND TOGETHER IN MY BED WITH MY FEMALE DORM MATE'S FRIEND STILL ASLEEP, I was really shock at what happened like WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK happened, and my roommates were laughing and said ""what the hell happened to you?"" And I said ""what the fuck happened?!"" I really don't remembered what happened I was drinking at the 3 or 4 shots and just like that no memories of what had happened, at first my friends don't believe me because it's impossible that I forgot what I did last night, I really don't remember like it just happened instantly, so my roommates slowly started to believe that I really don't remember what I did, they told that I was really annoying and they were trying to escort me to our room and put me to sleep and every time they put me to sleep I went up again to the rooftop and started drinking and started to tell stories. So during this time when my roommates are telling of what happened last night Kira started waking up and smiled to me a said good morning to me and my roommates, I smile, and she ask if she could use the our bathroom we said go ahead, and I ask my roommates, HOW ABOUT HER WHAT?!  HAPPENED TO ME AND HER? DID SOMETHING WRONG HAPPENED, and roommates replied they didn't know what happened they didn't bother looking at us because they were also tired and drunk(not so much as me thought) and I ask roommates ""was I consentual?"" And my roommates said yeah I was really nice to her I wasn't really like forcing her onto anything and shes pretty down on you too, I was really relieve at this point because I don't wanna be that guy who was really drunk at a gathering and forcing someone to do something sexual, so after Kira just step outside from the bathroom and she said she has to go to her friends room now and she needs to go to school, and our female dorm mate arrive in our room when Kira left and she started laughing at me together with my roommates and she said ""what has gotten into you last night you were totally different when you're really drunk?"" So I explained that I really don't remembered of what had happened and she eventually believe me started telling what I did and she also recorded some of things I did, most of clips were short but it was enough to justify of I did, I can tell I was a different person from the videos, like I was drinking while my eyes are close and I'm talking at the same time my roommates were laughing at me, Sht! I didn't watch rest because it was really embarrassing. 

After they explained everything I was really trying so hard to remember of the event but there wasn't, there are no memories of the night, all I could remember was the 3 or 4 shots I did, I know this might be impossible but it's the truth I really don't remember anything.

So I just got some questions here, who ever is reading this, is this really possible? I thought this can only happen in movies? Can someone explain to me what's the science of the memory lost, and if someone else experience the same thing I did, can tell a little bit of your experience?

Edit: so most of the things I did was just annoying like talking drinking while my eyes are close, getting up and down the stairs even thought my roommates were trying to put me to sleep, and Kira and I after that day started following me on Twitter and I ask her if I we had sex, she said we didn't, I was really relieve because I don't wanna do something irresponsible specially when I'm still in college, and ow I still went to my classes but I was really fck up like I couldn't focus on the professors and I really wanted to throw up but my just wouldn't",08Aug2020,1

I want to address something quick. I’m not insecure about my relationship. I asked for permission to post and all of this wouldn’t have been an issue if she said no. It was the combination of approval and then a very concerted effort into preventing my association with her. I’m very matter of fact. If you say one thing and do the opposite I get annoyed. I also have had two previous relationships where I was a side guy and it was unfortunate. 

Anyway

I had a very lengthy convo with her. We both shared some personal issues and I told her that I feel like she is either embarrassed to be seen with me or doesn’t want her friend and family to know I exist. She said that isn’t it and that maybe her ex has control over her Instagram and she can’t reset her password on her phone because it won’t load the app on her phone. (I have seen this be an issue. She uses the computer for Instagram)

I said “I know its a public account with 2K+ followers you don’t know so maybe you should make a separate account for just friends and family that you can post personal stuff and your ex wouldn’t have control over that because it would be a new account. 

She got excited and said that is a great idea. She proceeds to make a new account. Posts to her “close friends” on her main account to follow it. I think. Great this solves all the problems. 

She follows my account and my three friends she has met. They follow back. That’s it. She hasn’t followed anyone else. None of her family or friends have followed and I casually bring it up this morning over coffee before she leaves for the airport to get her grandma and she says “oh I thought you wanted an account for just you and your friends, I didn’t invite any of mine”

I play it cool and she leaves for the airport. Our weekend we planned together had to be changed last minute because her grandma was coming in for the weekend unexpectedly. 

Here is the thing. I completely forgot I ordered flowers to be delivered to her house this morning like last week. I get a phone call about 10 mins ago from her extremely mad at me because I ordered flowers to her house. 

I hear a guy in the background asking who the flowers are from. She said it was “her dad” who surprise came with her grandma. 

I apologized saying I didn’t think it would be bad to send you flowers. Then she said she “has to deal with this and will call me later”

506,"Okay so, there’s this girl who I’ve been talking to for a couple of weeks now. We met at a party and we ended up at the same party again tonight. Soon as we started speaking we were making out, we went upstairs and as we were going at it I realise she is almost limp (we had both been drinking but she said she had only had a couple drinks and didn’t seem drunk). I stop and she is hyperventilating, she says she is having a panic attack and that her ex had raped her, I tried to comfort her and calm her down. She talked about how she wanted to kill herself and had harmed herself, I tried to de escalate this. Eventually She seemed better and we just layed there for a while, she started to kiss me again, then she passed out, her eyes then rolled back and shut and was unresponsive. I got her to answer me and picked her up, then sat her down, wasn’t sure what to do. Without saying a word she gets up and walks out. I went down stairs and gave her some space for a bit, then asked if she was alright, she said she was okay. We hugged and i gave her space for the rest of the night. I left and said my goodbyes to her, reassuring her that anything that happened tonight didn’t change anything about how I felt. We were meant to go on a date tommorow, but I’m not sure if that’s gonna happen now. My question is, should I give her space and not see her tomorrow/should I and is it worth pursuing a relationship In which I feel I will have to deal with a partner that has severe mental health issues,
Which may affect my own mental health?

Yesterday I decided to meet up with a female friend of mine and later that night we had sex, but there was a problem. When my gf left me I've lost a lot of confidence and as i see now, it reflected on my ability of maintaining an errection.

So even though the sex was great and the atmosphere was sexy and whatnot, I could not bring myself to get a full on errection, just a semi...

516,"For several years now, whenever i want to study or do pretty much anything, it takes me forever.

I remember back in the seventh grade when i was able to study 7 science chapters in 7 hours, but if i tried to do the same today i could study foe hours for weeks on end and i still wouldn't be done studying.

Concentrating in class, trying to do homework, studying for tests or even just practicing things i want to learn, its all so slow, and it feels pointless now.

I've been practicing how to draw for almost 6 years now, and im still not nearly at a level i wish to be. I try a lot of different methods, and sometimes go periods of time without practicing because it feels like im not doing the right thing, or am just doing things wrong. Since that happens so many times where i just waste days, weeks or months doing something only to find out it was stupid. Even when i do think I'm doing something right for once, it doesn't give any good results. (E.g I focused only on drawing loomis heads every day for about 3 hours for 2 weeks ,only missing about a day. I watched tons of videos, looked at how other people did it and just tried to draw drawings of real people heads in different directions, redrawing ones i did before etc, yet still i barely improved.

I've also been trying to learn a language for about a year and a half now, and once again im moving at a snails pace. Once again i keep doing things wrong and taking months to realise im doing them wrong. People keep saying to ""just start and not worry about finding the perfect method"" but i just keep doing things wrong/ or in a dumb way, which regresses progress tremendously.
Even when i try to be consistent, listening to the language everyday, trying to look up new words as i encounter them, really actively listening, i still end up barely understanding what they're saying, even after months of daily practice.

I know i don't practice as much as i should, but that's once again because i could pour weeks or months of effort into something only to find out it was wrong, and even if i read articles and posts and watch videos on ""how should i do this correctly?"" And try to implement them i still end up doing it wrong, or the methods don't really work for me, or (very often) i end up stressing about all of the above and if i don't see any progress within a day or to i bail on the method because i don't want to waste time again.

And there are days when i just can't being myself to practice/study/do the things i want to, no matter how much i want to, no matter how much i try to convince myself, i just end up wasting time on my phone watching videos (again, most often in the language im learning, still nothing)

I've been patient, and i keep telling myself that it won't happen quickly and it's gonna take years, but i know that even after years Im still not going to be even near where i want to be.

526,"So, I lost a lot of hair and I think it’s mainly due to me refusing to cut my hair. Some context to that- I moved out of my city not long ago already needing a haircut. My hair was too long and it was really hard to brush due to dry split ends, every time I brushed my hair there would be a worrying amount of hair in the brush. So much so that I needed to take the hair out every time I brushed my hair and it created a ball of hair as big as a baby mouse. 

My hair is somewhat thin too, so I think that made everything a lot worse- but I refused to go to a salon because I was in a new area I didn’t know and I am too shy to go to a new salon.

I finally was able to cut my hair at a salon that is near my apartment, and told the hairdresser to make my hair short because I wanted to get rid of as much damage as possible. It felt like heaven. Now my hair is just below my shoulders where it used to be almost to my belly button.

Whenever i brush my hair now it feels so nice and easy and I barely get any hair on my brush. This is the reason why I think having long hair with split ends caused me to lose a lot of hair.

And I lost A LOT, I can see bald spots in some places and my braids are so skinny whenever I braid my hair.

I wanna grow a little more hair and I think cutting it was the first step, but I’m not sure if there is anything else I should be following. Do any of you have any advice onto how to grow healthier hair?",08Aug2020,1
527,"It started a few years ago. At first; I  would just bite my hands or fingers when I was angry or stressed out about something but it just escalated from that. Now I scratch my wrists and arms until they bleed and sometimes, I'll take a razer blade or exacto knife and just slice at my wrists and thighs. Not to sound edgy but when I'm pissed, I'm like a rapid animal. I just want to destroy (even if the thing that gets destroyed is myself.)

I did this until I heard something ""pop"" and a wave of pain flew into my fingers. That's when I sat on my bed and just sobbed until I passed out.

So far- I've lied and told them that's it from the cat or from accidents (I'm a terrible liar) but they seem suspicious. I REALLY don't want them to find out about this.

528,"Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing here, sometimes I don't even know why I exist. Living in a family fractured with pain and suffering is difficult, yet somehow I manage to escape. A dysfunctional younger brother who always escalates the situation, a megalomaniac mother who expects both brother and I to bow unflinchingly to her rules, and me, a hypocrite and a broken man who hides away in his room away from his family, only truly happy when alone in the house and when he's with his true love. It's pure insanity for me, feeling helpless and trapped is part of my daily routine, and yet I manage somehow.

My mother recently realized she could hold her power over me by turning off the internet (with the help of her boyfriend), and so I'm stuck with knowing how fragile my joy is, and how it can be erased with the push of a button. So I've started to download videos from youtube and upload them to my files in order to pass the time. But she's bypassed that too.

Since I'm really insecure on how I look and act to others, I've removed every picture of myself and my family members in the room to avoid scrutiny and criticism from other people. I've also hanged up one of my paintings, and I've put a note on my wall that I have to follow. Though I'm never satisfied for some reason.

I keep worrying back and forth, I think that something terrible will happen at any minute, I feel irritable and angry every day, and my self-esteem has ran away from me.

529,"I’m probably going to end up deleting this because there are too many identifying details. But I want to get my full story out there. Hope someone reads it.

I’m currently a 24 yo woman. I started a sales job at a tech company a couple years ago. At first, I absolutely loved it. I was one of the only women but I thought everyone was really nice. I was also really good at my job.

On the weekends, I would usually hang out with this group of guys from work, one of whom ended up becoming my boyfriend later. Another one of them, however, started giving me a weird feeling. He was considered a “top performer” in our entry level job and was a tall ex-jock type. In groups, he would say things at times to imply I wasn’t included. Or when I came out he would ask why I didn’t bring any friends.

He started making me uncomfortable to the point I didn’t want to spend time with him anymore. Problem was, he was one of the most social and “popular” people at my workplace so it was hard to avoid him if I wanted to hang out with people. I just couldn’t bear it though so I stopped hanging out.

Fast forward a little bit, I’m crushing it at my job. So much so that it’s starting to piss other people in my role off, as they believed surely something was unfair for me to be doing so well. My manager reassured me I wasn’t doing anything wrong but I started to feel like people were acting differently toward me. My interactions went from friendly and casual to overly formal and almost hesitant. This was making me feel extremely anxious.

Eventually, the guy I started dating from work let me know that the guy I had stopped hanging out with was telling everyone I was only doing so well because I was stealing from the company. One other woman on my team wasn’t doing well so he was starting to say I was taking something from her. Again, I asked my manager if I should do anything, and he said to just ignore it.

However, my future manager (as I was about to laterally move teams) was friends with the guy who was bullying me. Before I moved teams, I brought up the situation to him and asked if there was anything I should do. Because I didn’t name his friend immediately, he actually said that he “wasn’t one of his guys” (a lie). I was becoming increasingly paranoid.

I ended up moving teams to have that new manager and was still doing really well, but tensions were flaring, I think in large part due to the rumors. My main bully was also sometimes being a dick to me in person at this point. I again asked my manager if there was anything I could do. He suggested I “hash it out” with my bully and we get coffee sometime.

I actually did ask that guy to get coffee, and to be honest, at that point I thought there could have been a genuine misunderstanding. But then he did something I didn’t expect. When I brought up the situation to him, he told me, in a blatantly insincere tone, that he was “so happy” to have me on the team. He also asked if I was “feeling like an outsider” and asked if I wanted to go to lunch sometime. I realized that this was a much worse situation than I had even thought before.

During my next 1:1 with my manager, he asked me how the conversation went, and I told him it went poorly. He became really frustrated with me and asked exactly what I wanted out of the conversation. I realized my manager had been feeding my bully what to say and was explicitly against me. I was still, at this point, doing well at my job and liked it so I didn’t want to quit, but I was becoming increasingly tempted to. I even talked to my manager’s manager and he also said he didn’t want to do anything about it.

After a lot of deliberation, I went to HR (I didn’t really see another option) and told her what happened. I asked for confidentiality and she promised it but I later found out this was a complete lie. I wasn’t even sure I wanted to take action at this point - I just wanted to know my options. At this point, I was completely isolating myself at work. I couldn’t bear to sit at the same table as my bully as he laughed with his “bros” all day long while trying to do cold calls. I was getting a lot of criticism for not being a “team player” and sitting with my team.

HR, against my wishes, escalated to the legal team, as they were I guess afraid of me suing. This completely freaked me out as my bully had already been spending time as I was isolating myself calling me a loser and disgusting and spreading false rumors to others at the company. My thought is, either he gets fired and everyone hates me, or he doesn’t and I go through a lot of emotional turmoil only to be pushed out of the company. I fought against a legal investigation being done and they conceded, however, this meant nothing would be done at all.

My next few months at the company were hell, with other salespeople talking shit about me behind my back endlessly. Sometimes I was even bullied to my face and told I didn’t belong there or given fake pity for the “fact I didn’t have any friends.” As desperately as I wanted to quit, my performance was still good, and I didn’t want to leave without another job. I put my nose to the grindstone and worked my ass off in order to get promoted. When I got promoted, however, there were still people who said it only happened because I slept with an executive.

______________

Things changed a lot when I was promoted to a closing role. I had a different (actually competent) manager. I ended up absolutely crushing it and exceeding everyone’s expectations for me. I made a shit ton of money and was getting awards and recognized left and right. I was told the leadership team loved me. I was considered one of the very best people at my job. I actually outperformed my bully (promoted at the same time) for 4/4 straight quarters.

But the effects of the bullying and torture lingered. For one thing, there were a ton of people at the company I still couldn’t trust. I was still largely excluded from the social scene because my bully had already made me out to be a gross loser, and you can’t really come back from that. Also, people still really liked my bully, including people that I considered my own “friends” at the company. It was constantly eating away at my soul and dignity. 

And so, even though I quickly became a top performer, I was still unhappy. I ended up getting a job offer at Google that was much lower paying. But I took it for a chance at better mental health. The company I left is now in hyper growth mode, and will benefit massively from COVID-19. It sucks that all of the people who stayed will likely become rich and successful off everything. I just was tired of this idea of myself as an outcast and as a victim of intense bullying. So I took the lower paying job despite promises of future promotions and raises at my last company.

I’m not entirely sure I made the right decision. But what I do know is that I am stronger than I believed myself to be. I accomplished more than I thought possible in a short period of time. I just wish that the scars from the harassment weren’t so deep. PS: I have no plans to pursue legal action against the company. I’m just so tired.",08Aug2020,1

533,"Hi. 
I’m a 23 y/o woman and i was molested by my best friends brother when i was about 8. I don’t know if it happened before or again after this incident, as i’ve repressed a large majority, actually, just about all of my childhood memories. which really does make me think it happened more than once. another reason i believe that is because when i moved away from their family to the town over in 2nd grade, they ended up moving to our neighborhood soon after. instead of being excited to know someone, that my best friend would be attending a new school with me, i remember feeling dread. anyway, even though this happened 15 years ago, i’ve never quite recovered from it, especially since i didn’t uncover the memory until a few years ago and it hit me like a ton of bricks then. since it still affects me, i wanted to confront my abuser about it. on my 23rd birthday, i spent the first half of my day tracking him down on social media. i messaged him on his inactive facebook hoping for closure, but he never read or responded. i found him on instagram so i could message him there as well, but he didn’t accept my request. this morning, i woke up to a follow request from him and he still hasn’t accepted mine. i don’t really know what to do. i’m not comfortable talking to anyone i know about this incident, so naturally i came to a group of strangers in hope for some guidance. i know that if i accept his request, he’ll probably recognize me (i’ve looked the same my entire life, i actually still get mistaken for a 12-16 year old). he’ll more than likely deny my request to follow him and block me. i could archive all of the pictures i have if my family and i, but i’m having a hard time deciding whether that would be worth the trouble. i feel sick to my stomach, nauseous and my head is spinning. i can’t stop crying. will messaging him even give me the closure and acknowledgement of his acts i so desperately want? what if he doesn’t respond and blocks me? or tells me my memories are wrong and it never happened?",08Aug2020,1
534,"We’ve lived in our house for two years and have only seen the neighbours were attached too (to speak too) once when the party fence collapsed. Prior to that they don’t interact, even been round a couple times but they don’t answer door. When the fence collapsed it took a letter through the door to initiate contact.

Anywho first 13 months fine, then without warning every day the lady gets home from work the door was slammed so hard you could feel it, followed by a succession of other slammings like windows. This was funny at first, we’d just say “neighbours back”. I’m fairly certain it’s only her, as every time the front door slams she walks past just before or after. The husband(?) and kid don’t make a noise after she’s gone outside the normal you’d expect when windows and doors are open, no slamming basically. 

But it’s escalated now. 6-6:30am slam, slam, slam, slam then another bang as the front door gets forcefully shut. Often I’m up but other times it wakes me up. When the front doors slammed now the force without fail is enough to make the picture frames move in our house. 

Then on days when I guess she doesn’t work three or four times a day we go through a period of heavy door slamming, which is escalated in recent weeks to being enough to be felt. This is mainly in the day but still goes on early morning and often at 11pm without fail daily. 

Sometimes I’ll be childish and retaliate in the middle by slamming an internal door as hard as I can 7/8 times, which stops the slamfest and it goes quiet for a few hours but always starts up. 

I don’t want to escalate things as everyone’s entitled to live their life. But when you’re daily going through at least three slamfests a day that’s making the house shake it’s getting to be a pain! Plus the houses are usual wood frame rendered cheap mass produced houses and idk what it might be doing to the building. 

How’s best to deal with this? As I say although they were pretty amicable when the fence fell down, other then that they literally go out their way not to talk to us. I probably sound like a bad neighbour but we live a pretty quiet life and never even got to introduce ourselves. They don’t interact with other neighbours either, our friends the other side of them have said they’d not be able to pick them out of a line up if asked, let alone know anything about them. 

One example being im working at home and our home office overlooks the back gate for them and us. The husband will wait behind the gate if he’s going to the car at the same time my wife’s going to work. He won’t open the gate until he hears her pull off up the road.

536,"I have two younger siblings, a brother (14) and sister (11), and my mum and dad have split up multiple times however around a year ago they split for good. My dad now has a girlfriend (who I have no problem with) and we live with my mum and visit my dad every other weekend. 

Recently my brother has been more difficult than he ever has and likes to pit my parents against each other to get what he wants. It causes a lot of stress in the household and just makes life hard honestly. Even without my brother my parents still argue constantly and they're not even together anymore and, even when we were younger, never really try to make sure that they don't do it in front of us or where we can hear which hurts more because sometimes it feels like they don't care?

My mum's become really hard to talk to because whenever I try to start a conversation about my brother or my dad I just get juvenile responses like ""no it's fine everyone else feels the need to point out my mistakes why not you?"" or ""fine then f\*\*k off to your grandparents, see if they can parent you better"" to which I just give up and go to my room, it took for me to break down and cry and scream at her for her to stop being so petty about my dad and his gf in front of us and she stopped doing it for a few months but she's doing it again now and I just haven't got the energy to stop it. My dad is kinda disconnected from everything so he's not really one I can talk to either. 

Woah so sorry that was wayy to much backstory lol. Anyway basically the point of the post was that a lot of the time I think how easy it would to just go to a university far away (obviously not just yet, would have to ace my a-levels first) and just slowly cut off contact, I'd still keep in touch with my sister and grandparents as they're practically the only close family I can talk to at the minute. I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything like this and has any solution at all? Or whether there is no going back?

538,"Hi all,

This is a long story so please be patient.

Recently I have started talking to a girl I have a history with after a minor falling out. Fast forward to a year later and she really helped me get through a tough time in my life and naturally I started to regain feelings for her again. Fast forward to a few days a go and I told her how I felt and I was delighted to find out she felt the same. However, I did not just mess things up with her but with two friends too. I have proceeded to apologise to my friends (I feel they have forgiven me and that is fine) but with her it is more complicated. I accidentally revealed something to another friend which she didn't want revealed. I have proceeded to apologise to her and make no excuses for what I did. We have had long conversations in the past about trust and I feel I have let her down tremendously. On the bright side I told her what I did so she did not hear it from a third party. 

I want to be able to earn her trust back. I have told her I would do anything and everything to earn it back and I intend to keep with my word. Has anyone ever been in this kind of situation and would be willing to give me some advice? Do i give her time? Should I invite her out for a coffee to try and make it up to her in a few weeks? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you.

(posted this on r/vent too)

i was in 9th grade. i had a friend who was the topic in our grade. she was one of my closest friends and i could talk to her about literally anything. she was vented to me in a messaging app, about one of the girls who she had beef back in 7th grade bc at the moment, that girl was also talking bad stuff about her. me, being the careless one, joked that we should add laxatives in her bottle and steal her phone and money. little did i know, i logged in my account in that girls phone a couple of weeks ago. she took screenshots and showed it to her friend. the next day, our entire grade knew about it and then the entire school. as i logged in twitter, i wondered why the tweets seemed to be directed at me and/or my friend. i compared the tweets to the conversation we had with my friend and it later on, i found out it was really about me.

this happened during a semestral break. 7 days of no classes. we had our conversation on a sunday and it got spread during monday. i tried to talk to some my friends, friends who i also recently offended bc of something i said. they were mad at me, they ignored me,, idk how to describe the feeling. it was like being on my own. 7 days of feeling so numb and then suddenly being scared as classes were about to resume. 7 days of wanting to suddenly disappear. i told my parents about this and told them i wanted to transfer schools, they listened to me ofcourse, but i didnt transfer.

7 days later, the inevitable came, i went back to school early. i sat on my chair and did homework that was left off. i tried to be as calm as possible. the girl and her friends arrived later on. she had a really intimidating set of friends including boys who you really dont want to mess with. they dropped shade everytime they had the chance and i had no choice but to listen to it all. ofcourse i had to be held accountable for what i said. even some of my own friends started to hate me because of what i said.

we tried talking with each other, me, my friend, and the girl and her friends. but it was more really of a confrontation. i was so embarrassed like i really wanted to just randomly be dead and disappear. a few days later the situation kinda settled down but the shade went on. i decided to tell my guidance counselor that i wanted to transfer schools. days later. i plead to my guidance counselor to not come to my room and suddenly talk to them bc that would seem like im trying to ""make myself a victim""

the guidance counselor told my class adviser. about 2 days later, the entire class and our adviser had a talk about this. everyone said what they wanted to say about this issue and so did i. i couldnt hold back my tears as soon as i tried to explain why i went to the guidance counselor to everyone. but because of my fear, i lied that the guidance counselor caught me crying and ended up telling her what happened. a few hours later we finished the talk. about a couple minutes, the guidance counselor came to our room. although caring as a counselor, shes known to be a terror teacher. she also kinda embarrassed the people who she viewed as the evil ones in this issue. this only made things worse. riding the bus home, i couldnt help but notice the shade my carpoolmates were dropping. ""haha pa victim"" (haha pretending to be the victim).

i just cried. i bawled my eyes out till they were so dry, everyday i cried. i attended my classes feeling so down. regretting what i said, thinking about what happened. i just cried, because what could i do?

all of this came to an end a few weeks later during lunch break, the girl smiled at me and told me to have a hug with her. i said my apologies but i felt like they werent enough. i wanted to cry as much as possible but i just couldnt?? i was so happy to just hug her and be forgiven by her. turns out it was my other friends who were trying to be neutral so they dont get into this mess who had been explaining to her and asking forgiveness from her FOR ME??? like?? wow??

the normal school life went on. although all of this ended, what happened left a scar on me. i am super guilty of what id done. i was traumatised by what happened and deeply regret what i said. id find myself crying and having flashbacks just because of the smallest triggers. i just wish i could talk to someone professional about this but we probably couldnt afford it.

and then miss rona came, i was super happy that school ended kinda early because of quarantine. about 2 months into quarantine the flashbacks were getting more vivid. even songs or seeing certain dates would trigger me. i started a journal to ease the anxiety. and it helped a lot. **i thought i healed**

5 months into quarantine (right now), the flashbacks are getting more vivid and im getting them daily now. id have difficulty concentrating on what im doing and id find myself crying anytime. its getting worse, now i feel like im hearing voices in my head. my guilt is going to eat me soon if i dont tell my parents i need help. but im too afraid.

I avoid them at all costs almost, I answer seldom calls and texts from them I rarely go to hangout because we have very very different ideas of fun, but for some unknown reason they all actually really like me(at least the me they think they know)and I feel so shitty for saying all of this and seeming so two faced but I don’t hate them it’s just that we are very different people and I don’t know what to do, I feel like there’s something wrong with me bc everyone else seems to value friendship and love their friends like family and that’s never ever been the case for me, I’ve never felt like i actually fit in but I change myself to fit my environment so I can fit in, and that’s exactly how I got my friends, and yes i “fit” in but i’m so miserable. sorry if this doesn’t make sense or it’s hard to follow or off topic it was kind of like a thought dump because I just needed to get it out because I keep EVERYTHING to myself and to everyone else “my life is perfect, I have so many friends, and i seem so happy” but it is literally all a facade and I can’t keep up with it anymore it’s to much but i don’t know where to start.

They've all already had the icebreaker conversation of meeting each other, telling a little bit about themselves, and laughing/having a good time. So far, it's going really well. 

But now that the icebreaker has happened, I don't know how to get them to continue making conversation without it being forced and awkward. My boyfriend is a little shy and doesn't know what to say or ask them, and my parents seem to be running into the same issue. 

So, what are some ways my boyfriend and parents can further build a relationship? How can I incorporate him into our family activities (dinner isn't possible for my boyfriend) without it being awkward because he's miles away? 

I've considered having him set up on my laptop and play some sort of game with us, but there's always a lag and I don't even know how he'd be able to play ANY games with us (or what kind would be easiest).

His sister however, seems to always be a problem. She lives in a different state and isn’t around all the time, yet somehow she continues to be a barrier in our relationship.

She is 11 years younger than my boyfriend. She calls him a lot and it’s never a normal call. She’ll leave voicemails where she sings him songs, she has all sort of pet names for him, she is constantly telling him she loves him and how he’s the number one person in her life, even though she’s had a serious longterm boyfriend for a while.

When my boyfriend told her that he doesn’t want her to be the #1 person in his life and that he needed to put his girlfriend first, she freaked out, cried and got really cold to him. 

She also copies literally everything he does and it seems like she tries to be him sometimes. He had a suicide attempt a while ago and not even two months after, she calls him and tells him she did a similar thing and says “i guess i really take after you.”

548,"I am a 13F. The girl that triggers me is 11F. She is my sisters best friend. This year my sister and her best friend are moving up to secondary school and unfortunately my sisters best friend got into the school that I got to.

A couple of things to note is that she is tiny (in terms of height) and I'm fairly tall. She is very sweet to some people but a complete monster to others. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts depression self harm anxiety and depression since I was 7 (ish). She is also very bright (so am I so we are kind of equal in that department). I'm also a black belt in taekwondo. 

The problems started in primary school. She started picking on another little girl (me and my sis have known her most of our lives and she is like a sister) who has autism. She also kept nagging me and my friends and bothering us for fun. Now I know this is normal kids stuff but it escalated. She would hurt my friends if I defended the other girl who is like a sister. She told me to kill myself and that if I was her sister she would wish I was dead. She also paid people to try and beat me up (they failed) and hit me with a wooden brick. Apparently I was too ""aggressive"" when I removed her from me while she was hitting me and removed her from the friends she was hitting and stuff. When she would grab me I wouldn't do any locks or anything I'd just pull my hand of whatever she had grabbed out of her grip. Just to note I have never hurt her but she has almost dislocated my knee before. But what really hurt was her telling me to go kill myself and my sis never did anything about it. The thing was she just reinforced everything I felt about myself. She told me to kill myself a couple of times a week. Once my mum found out about it I was moving to secondary school so there wasn't an issue. But everytime i see her i hear her voice in my head telling me to kill myself. And I end up cutting.

This is not the first time she has had an episode like this. She more often than not has the mentality that the whole world is conspiring against her and has put her in a Truman Show type environment. I hate seeing my mom like this and Im not sure what else i can do at this point.",08Aug2020,1
569,"Tl;dr- my brother cracked my kindle screen on his birthday pretty badly but he was really apologetic and nice and I don’t know if I should tell our parents because it might damper our relationship

I actually have no clue what I should do and just need some advice. My (15) brother (14) “Felix’s” birthday was yesterday and we were having a good time. He stole my phone as a joke and gave it back, then went over to the couch, and dropped my kindle face down onto the floor. 

My older brother and younger sister were there and were going crazy because apparently the screen was cracked really badly. Felix immediately freaked out and took the kindle and ran outside with it, before giving it back so I could look at the damage. It was cracked pretty bad. Like really badly.

I would’ve immediately told my parents right then but it was his birthday and I said I would tell them tomorrow. Also we all highly suspect that Felix is somewhere on the adhd spectrum because he has zero self control, goes through mood swings, and gets distracted easily if you let him. So I know that he wasn’t thinking when he dropped my tablet like that. 

And he was really apologetic and sad afterwards. Like he was crying and in his room hard and sent me a lot of apology messages. He was really nice to me too. 

This makes me wary on wether or not I should tell my parents he did it. On one hand yeah he should have consequences for his actions, on the other he’s being really nice and apologized a lot and I know he’ll be really sad and angry with me if I tell our parents.

I’m gonna tell my parents that my kindle screen is cracked soon so that we can get it fixed, but I’m not sure if I should say who did it.",08Aug2020,1

I am very not happy with my body lately. I am 161cm tall and I weight around 60kg. I used to be 55kg but I don't know what happened and I got back to 60kg and I am afraid it will go higher because I used to be really chubby and almost 70kg. 

I want to start exercise and go on diet but I don't know what should I exercise, what to eat or how long to exercise, how many times in week. What my goal is 50kg and I wanna make my legs perkier.

573,"So, I’m single and have been for a while. I have one consistent partner when I have sex (I’m extremely monogamous, even single; I know they may not, but I am ). There is a chance I am pregnant. 

My best friend is a married man (not the guy I have sex with). His wife is friends with me and she knows I have a thing for him (when he and I first hung out, I didn’t know he was married until a mutual friend of ours told me) because I told her. I’m a very open and honest person and wanted her to be aware prior to allowing us to hang out. He does have a history of cheating on her (I know why; that’s a thing for another day). He and I haven’t done anything more than kiss (which was before I knew he was married). 

Recently, she has begun to suspect he and I are messing around, even though we haven’t been. If I am pregnant, can she force a paternity test if both he and I decline? I ask because from what I understand they cost money, and I know exactly who the father would be (if I’m even pregnant) as I only have relations with one guy. I don’t see the need in spending unnecessary money on a test that will tell me what I already know?

576,"So I work with co workers who basically have attempted to murderer me over a friendship group sex story / family secret / next door sex predo story / drugs being put in drinks/ 

So I work for a supermarket and all the workers treat me like shit and I noticed the workers are not the average younger people you see say around the city. Like most the workers don’t even talk to me much ever and just randoms treat me like shit. Like there’s some story and they act like I’m some kind of outsider but I don’t know these people personally but my next door neighbour works at my store and his family are like a Asian gang family and a lot of his family work there as well but the neighbour guys family not who I thought they were one day he was talking about me and said to my co workers that I call him the Asian kid and that he my next door neighbour. But I generally like that guy I called the Asian kid that was like last year but that never came up thankfully😅  but he linked to my neighbours I don’t have anything against them generally but somethings up though. Like my family have had family fights that were loud and my mum has anger outbursts and screams outside but that not the issue just thought I would add that. 

My bro has this girlfriend and back in 2016 I found her account one night on and I was like who she and eventually saw pics on fb of her but thing is she lives in Thailand so she said apparently now we have realised that she lives in this country and used like automated photos of herself on Facebook. I recently just found she has a job at another store of my company but looks a bit different rom the pics and my bro knew about the fake overseas thing as well idk why he pretended and my company lets us do shifts at other stores so could of easily went to her store to work but as said looks a lot different from the pics of course so wouldn’t of even known but my manager kept rostering me 5 days back In the days I could of got shifts at her store but obviously my store in the know about this secret as well as this girl is my long term next door neighbour from my grand parents house so have been living there on and off over my life. But we’ve never really spoken to the neighbours much ever my dads like talked a bit to the older men. And her bro the manager of my department but he usually out in the Shelves but he always on my shifts and comes in to check up on me on his days off every shift I do at night he pops up and he has weird conversations on the phone about me like his checking up on me out of his spare time like it’s a big effort to come in he even might watch me in the camera room my whole shift as well but his family own like 5 houses I’m the areas of something just to add. But idk this guy might be her side boyfriend or something there’s confusion as there’s two Asian guys that work there but one of them her boyfriend and like it’s made my job hard cuz they bully me sometimes and have fake conversations based on me. But the story is like my bro and him have like accidentally slept with the same girl and they had like some big war and straight away tried to kill me over it😂 and I had no idea and still have not been of told it’s just with all the info I’ve got so far. But like they in some weird opened relationship and my bro got secret cash in hand job for my company also at her store and another store and I wanna transfer to theses stores but they always worried who I talk to and who I might sleep with😂 I’ve never slept with anyone at work. And still haven’t had full sex yet even. But I’ve asked family members and they still won’t tell me about this and I’m going to transfer to this girls store and she probably going to bully me thing is I’m just looking for a change and they wanna ruin my life over me leaving just cuz they won’t have the same manager who can control the roster and relationships that I am starting. 

Then there’s the girls trying to get people to look like me to work at the store because some random might come in to tell me the story that’s how bad and that’s how many people know about it😂 my manager wants someone to look like my so I never know the story. They want to apparently do sex acts as me because they say to work in my country you have to make porn videos and suck your mangers penis every week and they keep saying I have to have sex in the night club bathrooms every-time I go out but this is just what I have heard them say in Chinese whispers.

But then there’s the people who actually went along with all this like my bro’s girlfriend Asian girl tried to run me down when she found out that her bro and my bro shared the same girl she came to my work place and tried to run me down one night idk how they planned it so perfectly maybe by chance cuz I left the door like 3 mins early but people actually trying to help this girl she has even drugged my drinks cuz we leave the door open like the back one but my bro doing it as well and like they all bashing me even if they don’t know her it’s like founding out you have cancer and everyone abandoned you just to die even if I didn’t know them on social levels like not one person wanted to tell me and just let me walk in to burning house basically. 

They also say there’s a sex predo after me and there might actually be because of this girls brother he connected to a lot of bad people but they say there’s a predo in my street and one leaves apparently next door. But nobody has told me ever. Idk they have apparently raped me and they worried about my work transfer going threw but the coworkers worse then the predos in my thoughts. They said they tried to destroy and kill me just cause there’s a predo after me like this girl wanna banned me from 3 different stores of my company and banned me from night clubs they even wanna set up a guy to give me hiv cause they live next door to me so could easily inject hiv blood to me😭 and this girl apparently saying any men that date me have to be in open relationship with her just cause my bro slept with the same girl as her bro but my bro and her still together and in open relationship but that’s apparently why they won’t tell me the story but I keep saying why can’t they just not talk to her as we have free will in this would like apparently they wanna have like there body Guard date me because hey think I’m dangerously them apparently they have to text this person where I am all the time and do things for the person who wants to keep an eye on me like apparently it’s someone trying to steal my identity.  Why haven’t they told me about this evil person I might even be working with this person who’s doing this

581,"Throwaway account btw.  


TLDR:My sister manipulates me into doing whatever she wants from me, I can't stand up against her because she is 9 years older than me and my family won't step in. help.

This might just be a normal relationship or a horrible one, but I'm not taking chances anymore and asking for help after YEARS. It's between me (16M) and my sister (25F). Let me give you some background first.  


I'm not exactly an introvert, but an ambivert. I'm rather shy, and silent. I prefer to be by myself most of the time, and usually respond to bad situations with sadness/crying rather than anger. I'm quite logical and have strong opinions, but I don't like to voice them out since I don't like conflict/arguing with people (this is important)   
My sister, on the other hand, is a COMPLETE extrovert. She loves to be around people and do things with them, she is willing to spend a lot of money to make herself and others happy. So with her, my highs are higher but my lows are lower. Why? She usually doesn't care about other's opinions or emotions at all, she always manages to win arguments because she is the only one in the house with a short temper. When she's unhappy with something, she makes sure everyone around her knows. She raises her voice, yells at everyone no matter who they are, and if you DARE disagree with her, good luck, you're stuck with her explaining why she's right and you're wrong for 3 hours and she won't let you go until you say she's right. She doesn't accept silence, nods, you have to say ""You're right."" Take this with a grain of salt since I'm telling this from my perspective.   
She's very successful, speaks 4 languages, is loved by her friends, is physically attractive etc. so her flaws don't really matter to anyone else. I have 2 sisters, both way older than me, 25F and 27F. The eldest is married and doesn't live with us anymore, but she is even more introverted than me and they often fought about stuff. Since the younger sister doesn't have respect when she's angry and yells at everyone, my parents are, I think, afraid to step in.  


And I'm the only one in the house who is younger than her. And oh boy, do I go through the HELL of it.  


The relationship isn't a disaster at first glance. Actually, it would seem like we get along pretty well, and we do sometimes. But it's a toxic one, the truth doesn't get revealed easily. Here's what I have to go through:  


\-If she wants to do something with me, she'll force me. If she wants me to do something for her, same story. Going to the store for her, watching a movie with her even if I say no.  


\-She will force me to speak to her. If we get in an argument, and she attempts to explain why she's right, it will go like this: ""I am right because this and this ...... don't you think? Come on, we don't have to fight all the time. Just do as I say."" and she won't accept silence, or a slight nod. She will force me to speak. That's all I have to get her off me, I can't lie and say she's right even if I don't actually think she is, and I can't tell the truth because she will be mad if I do.  


\-She will claim she wants to hear my opinion whenever we get into a fight, but never listens, never gives me credit, and immediately starts to explain why my opinion is WRONG. She has never told me I have a point. Not once. Not one that I remember, at least. I started to be afraid to tell her my opinion and do whatever I can to get out without saying a single word. Saying anything makes everything worse.  


\-Our arguments are just dumb. A dumb example: I use a speaker for my computer, since it's the only way I can hear the sounds. It has a button to raise and lower volume. And so does my computer, like every other computer, on the bottom right of the screen. She told me to lower the volume, and I used the speaker to do it. Then she told me to do it from the bottom right of the screen. I was like ""Uh, they literally do the same thing."" She proceeds to get mad at me because I didn't listen to her.  


One day, she puts her phone in front of me and says ""I have video called my friend. You two talk for a while while I'm away."" I have known who this person is for a long time. My sister and him frequently talked, and I occasionally said hello to him but it's been months since we last talked one on one. It was just awkward small talk and I hated it. When my sister came back I tried to hand the phone to her but she wanted us to talk more. I told her I was umcomfortable and didn't know what to say. ""It shouldn't be this hard, just talk!"" I told her I really couldn't, and we have a LONG argument in front of him.  


She once told me ""Everyone has different personalities and you should respect them. Not everyone will be like you."" Yet she yells at me for being shy because she isn't.  


\-She keeps contradicting herself, as you could see.  


I could go on for hours but that's the main relationship. How my parents are included in this:  


\-They know how toxic she is and they think I'm right.  


\-My father rarely tries to make her stop.  


\-I can't stand up to her because I can't bring myself to be that rude to someone. I try to stay strong but I'm emotional and can't handle the ""I'm older than you so I'm right"" mentality.  


\-Yet my family tells me to stand up against her, they don't do much themselves.  


\-She is mostly at work so my mother tells me to just ignore her because I'm free from her most of the time. Ignoring it NEVER worked.  


\-I am seeing a therapist and she said that it's my parents' responsibility to stop her, not mine. They won't, so I feel helpless.  


\-They don't do as much as they should to help. I'm slowly starting to blame them because I can't handle this myself any longer.  


\-I don't trust them to help me with this, but I think I do need them.  


I would never consider leaving anyone, I love my family. I just want my sister to actually have a heart. I may be exaggarating stuff since I'm still emotional about this.  


Thank you so much for reading through all of this. I've been thinking about writing this for far too long, and I need help.",08Aug2020,1

There were two friends next to me tonight, mostly there much more. Sometimes they are more drunk than me, sometimes not, but we are always having fun. All of us are dancing, they are getting hit on all night, girls hugging them out of the blue(they are strangers to each other). They are fairly good looking dudes and I consider myself to be as well.

I don't carry myself with doubt or insecurity so it is baffling to me, that in all those years almost no girl approached me, whilst they get approaches several times a night. I would even consider myself to ""wear"" a lot more approachable face then they do. Girls are straight out ignoring me. I can't pin point what is it that stands up around them.

586,"For the last year I've had my mind 100% set on joining the army once I finish this school year. I'm Irish, I've asked around about how army life is here and I've not heard too much good things about it. I did some research and found out Irish citizen's are allowed into the British army without any need for permanent/current residency. 

I've told my dad about this and he said it wouldn't be a good idea due to our history with the English and the violence that happened in our country between us. He said talk about it with my uncle, who had applied to join and has also worked for years in England. He told me some stories he heard from his friends of things the English did to terrorise the Catholics in the north of Ireland but that happened decades ago during the troubles.

Personally, I have absolutely no ill will against English people, no matter what our history was. I know I'll probably get some slagging by those I train with if I join but thats just part of the package for joining any army.

588,"Hey All. So this is kind of a low-key confession of sorts, so I apologize if this seems like a ramble but I really need to get this out. 

The thing is I've been very back and forth on video games as of late, for a plethora of reasons. For one thing, I just have a really intense catalog of games. A lot of titles that I have are smaller indie titles that I know are playable on my laptops, which I got from going to college. At the same time, I also have a PS4 that has a large mix of titles both indie and AAA. My methodology used to be that any game I can't play on Mac, I'd get digitally on PS4, but now that I have a Surface Computer, that opens up the gates to me. Perhaps now that I have more access to indie games that can only be played on Windows, I'm starting to go overboard, when my original system used to be much more manageable. 

Even so, collectively I have almost 500 games across each of my devices, which is genuinely overwhelming, as I've only played about 30 of them at best. I think that this is giving me quite a bit of trouble as I'm thinking about my place in the world. I want to enter into the entertainment industry as a concept development artist, and I guess I worry that having this sizable catalog of games is bringing about a great deal of buyer's remorse, as I won't have the time to experience all of them with a potential career to focus on, never mind my goal of eventually starting a family. But regarding the games themselves, I always make sure to get titles that I know I'll enjoy on a mechanical/ artistic scale, so it brings just as much frustration to me that there's so many titles I enjoy which I won't have the time to fully experience. 

Perhaps the worst thing, however, is that even after I get these titles that I really want and feel I'll enjoy, I hardly end up playing them. It's almost as if I get more enjoyment out of acquiring the games than actually experiencing them, and even when I do get them I almost never make time to play them, usually playing no more than an hour or so. Most of my free time ends up devoted to my classwork, familial obligations, and browsing the web (that one definitely hits me hard). While I have tried to manage this by selling some of the games I have fully experienced or feel I won't be able to enjoy a second time, my worry kicks in that I'll miss these titles if I let them go; this is made even worse by the fact that I'd gotten a great many titles on my console digitally, so to let that go would likely cause a massive level of buyer's remorse for me. 

Anyway, if anyone could give me some pointers on this subject, I'd really appreciate it. Should I just stop collecting games, and even get rid of the physical titles that I have already? Should I let go of console gaming and stick to the smaller titles I have on my smaller computers, even if it means I wouldn't be able to experience more demanding games, and even though I'd lose a ton of digital games I purchased on console? Is there a way that I can overcome this inertia and find some enjoyment from the games that I have already? I apologize again, but this is genuinely interfering with my mental and emotional well being, and if anyone could lend a hand to me, it would mean so much.",08Aug2020,1

592,"For several years now, whenever i want to study or do pretty much anything, it takes me forever.

I remember back in the seventh grade when i was able to study 7 science chapters in 7 hours, but if i tried to do the same today i could study foe hours for weeks on end and i still wouldn't be done studying.

Concentrating in class, trying to do homework, studying for tests or even just practicing things i want to learn, its all so slow, and it feels pointless now.

I've been practicing how to draw for almost 6 years now, and im still not nearly at a level i wish to be. I try a lot of different methods, and sometimes go periods of time without practicing because it feels like im not doing the right thing, or am just doing things wrong. Since that happens so many times where i just waste days, weeks or months doing something only to find out it was stupid. Even when i do think I'm doing something right for once, it doesn't give any good results. (E.g I focused only on drawing loomis heads every day for about 3 hours for 2 weeks ,only missing about a day. I watched tons of videos, looked at how other people did it and just tried to draw drawings of real people heads in different directions, redrawing ones i did before etc, yet still i barely improved.

I've also been trying to learn a language for about a year and a half now, and once again im moving at a snails pace. Once again i keep doing things wrong and taking months to realise im doing them wrong. People keep saying to ""just start and not worry about finding the perfect method"" but i just keep doing things wrong/ or in a dumb way, which regresses progress tremendously.
Even when i try to be consistent, listening to the language everyday, trying to look up new words as i encounter them, really actively listening, i still end up barely understanding what they're saying, even after months of daily practice.

I know i don't practice as much as i should, but that's once again because i could pour weeks or months of effort into something only to find out it was wrong, and even if i read articles and posts and watch videos on ""how should i do this correctly?"" And try to implement them i still end up doing it wrong, or the methods don't really work for me, or (very often) i end up stressing about all of the above and if i don't see any progress within a day or to i bail on the method because i don't want to waste time again.

And there are days when i just can't being myself to practice/study/do the things i want to, no matter how much i want to, no matter how much i try to convince myself, i just end up wasting time on my phone watching videos (again, most often in the language im learning, still nothing)

I've been patient, and i keep telling myself that it won't happen quickly and it's gonna take years, but i know that even after years Im still not going to be even near where i want to be.
I don't know what to do anymore, I've read so many discussions and advice and whatever and it still doesn't help. Im pretty hopeless at this point.",08Aug2020,1

I never take things into my control, just let others make decisions for me and do things for me; like booking a hotel or helping me pick what clothes I should bring on a trip. this just happened today, my girlfriend was over and helping me pack a bag for our short trip away. I let her basically pick what I wear and didn’t have much of an opinion on it. 

the thing is, my mother has always judged me and my sister harshly for the clothes we purchased or wore, so now I rarely buy new clothes and don’t have a sense of style or anything. but it doesn’t seem important to me. should it? my gf felt that I was reluctant to pack ‘nice’ clothes to dinner but the truth isn’t that i’m reluctant, its that it really doesn’t make a difference to me what i’m wearing, but I feel like my mom will judge me completely, saying things like ‘you’re only going away for two nights why do you need those fancy clothes’. I’m annoyed that I can’t use my own judgement to decide what clothes I should wear for dinner. I doubt myself constantly and always have to get a second opinion, and if it goes against my own I just change it. I never go against anyone in a conversation, again, especially my girlfriend. 

I just feel like i’m going insane. how do I become confident in my own decisions and stop fearing what my mom, gf or anyone else will think. I don’t even know my own opinion on things like clothes because i’m so used to letting everyone else pick for me. 

I don’t expect many people to have read this far but if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated. thank you.",08Aug2020,1

A neighbor who was drunk walked onto our driveway and next to my car to complain about my speed. I was going under the limit, but I apologized to de-escalate as he approached in an aggressive manner. I was still in my car and my mom stepped out as I was dropping her off before leaving. After dropping her off I pulled up next to him and apologized again and he tried escalating the situation again and thats when I realized he was intoxicated. 

Do I have any rights here to file a complaint for trespassing and public intoxication? He also came pretty close to us with this virus going around. I don't want this neighbor to contact us again. He is troublesome to other family members as well. He let's his dog run around openly and his dog runs into our garage at times after we've asked several times for him to control it.",08Aug2020,1

607,"TL;DR: family member bailed out SO who is narcissistic sociopath and potential danger to her and her kids. Currently being stonewalled by Spike (felon) Every time I try to communicate with her. Will be at their house in person today, but do not think I will be able to talk to Mary alone. How can I communicate with her, and make sure she is OK without Tipping off Spike or causing her to be defensive and lie?  
  
FULL STORY: 
So my close relative, let’s just call her Mary, is dating a felon. This felon, let’s nickname him spike, has a wrap sheet the size of Texas. This mid 30’s guy, has done time for everything from auto theft, possession of stolen guns and drugs, to commercial burglary and production of illegal substances. So yeah, he’s been around. 

Mary on the other hand, is well put together, with a bachelors degree and works in the medical field with success. She met spike on tinder. He was crashing at motels (for convenience he told her) with a disturbingly large supply of hidden cameras, security cameras, hard drives, laptops, and binoculars? All in these large tubs that eventually ended up at Mary’s house after he of course, moved in. 
She claims that they never defined their relationship, and so every time she caught him with women in her bed, she never made a big deal about it. Even after she found video tapes of the women he slept with. 
He had recorded himself sleeping with these women, and i am unsure if they even knew they were being recorded or not. I do you know enough about the situation, to know that these women were using sex as payment for drugs. So the guy is a sleaze, obviously. 

If it’s not obvious enough to everyone else, Mary herself (prior to the video call proposal) admitted that she thinks Spike is a narcissistic sociopath based on his behavior. But that’s not even the beginning of the story. After he moved in, She realized he was running his drug operation out of her house. She had known that he was a big-time dealer from where he was from, but He had told her he was taking it elsewhere.  Mary, being a sucker that she is, knew all of this about him, and knew that not only was he an active drug dealer, but that he was on the run, because he had jumped parole. And was wanted several counties away. After a couple months, he ended up getting arrested again and going back to jail for stealing a rental car, and being in possession of multiple substances and stolen guns, Running from police, etc. It was a whole thing. 

While he was in jail, (on a probationary hold for three months) He confessed his love for Mary, Saying that he will be faithful to her when he gets out, and it’s going to go straight and narrow, and even proposed over video chat. He had her convinced that even though he was a 5+ time offender, and spent more than 10 years overall in jail, that he is certain he will only get sentenced with probation and community service. Hard to believe, as any rational person probably wouldn’t believe this nonsense, But not Mary. She managed to get hung on his every word. And not only did she believe him, she funded his commissary and paid for his phone and video calls, coming to an average of about $800 a month. And that’s not even including the bail money she put up To get him out.  

As the week’s grew closer to Spike being up for bail, Mary begin to instruct everyone in the family on how to interact with her once he gets out. This included, not texting her anything personal, And only calling her during work hours. Not calling her while she is at home. And not saying anything that might imply she is upset, or she has any suspicion of him if there is any chance he is around. Mary even considered getting A burner phone to keep at her job so that family could communicate with her without worrying if he is present or not. 

Since he got out of jail this week, Mary has flown off the radar. She has not return phone calls or text messages requesting calls In days. I received a random phone call from her at 1 AM two days ago, and I could tell in her voice that something was wrong. She did not tell me, and when I tried to return her call shortly after when I had more time to talk, she did not answer. 

I do know that at her work, she was on then ice because of the amount of absences she had from before Spike had gone to jail. And she had been telling everyone in the family that she could not miss any work or else she would be fired. After several failed attempts at trying to reach her, I called her job where she should have been, and she wasn’t there. 

Mary’s mother, is also dying. Prior to Spike getting out of Jail, Mary talked to her mother every day, and twice on most days.  But since spikes return, she has not answered a single phone call from her mother. she has let this man completely take control of not only her life, but the life of her seven and eight-year-old children. She told me that whenever he got out her kids were no longer going to have cell phones, and things were going to be “stricter”. When I asked for more information, she explained that those were spikes rules. And that he wants to raise the children a certain way. These are not his children. And they are not children he has been around for very long. 

I find it very disturbing that she is leading a complete stranger decide how her children will be raised, and letting this man who just got out of prison babysit her children without a cell phone overnight. I’ve seen how she is in previous relationships, and the children have been my biggest concern. Her ex Husband would verbally and physically abuse them, and her, but she would act like nothing was happening. Luckily, if that’s even the right word to use, that did not happen for a very long time considering he beat her very badly one night and she filed charges and had him thrown in jail. He has a restraining order against him now. I am afraid she is just gone from one bad guy and into bed with someone just as bad. 

That brings us to today, where at 6 AM, after three days of attempted communication with no success, I received a Phone call from her. But it wasn’t her, it was Spike. He did all the talking for her, and I could hear her in the background but couldn’t make out what she was saying. I have never met this guy before, so there’s no reason that I would want to talk to him over her. 

She is acting very strange, and her behavior is very worrisome. When I spoke to Spike on the phone, I told him that I had a few things for Mary that I needed to bring over. He told me I could bring them, and that they would be home all day. But I know he is not going to let me talk to her alone. So my point for this post, is how can I Ask Mary if she is OK or if she needs help without Spike knowing? And what can I say to get her to actually be honest with me? I Know if I ask her directly she will deny any suggestion that there might be issues. 

I’m not positive if he has ever physically abused her before, But based on his actual record, and her record of dating abusive men, I would not be surprised. It’s bizarre, like she is in a comatose state almost, similar to a 1950’s lobotomized housewife. 
She’s all smiles and happy, even when talking about the disturbing things he has done to her. And she has willingly let this man take complete control Of everything. Even though I’ve seen Mary act similar in her previous relationships, I’ve never seen it get as bad as this, or tried to called Mary and not been able to talk to Mary herself.   
 
I plan on going later today to take Mary her things, how should I ask Mary if she’s OK with Spike present? How can you ask someone if they are being physically or emotionally abused, when the abuser’s present? Am I just overreacting? Or do you think she could really be in a dangerous situation? Maybe not physically, or in any immediate danger, but danger nonetheless?  
Let me know what you think, or suggest.",08Aug2020,1

612,"***APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE: Long Post***
Me(25/F) and my fiancé (23/M) have known each other for 6 years and been together for almost 5 years. We started off as really good friends and then it just grew to something else. Within a month of dating we started living together. We had previous relationships before just not serious, and We were each other’s firsts.  On our first year anniversary, we decided that we wanted to be together forever and promised to marry each other. We went to a jewelry store and got me an engagement ring and then Later on, we got his. We promised no hurry to marry but this was a sign of promise and commitment to each other. 
- 
We work at the same company but different departments. His coworkers are older and criticize him for being tied down so early on and that he needs to sleep around and enjoy life. His sister tells him the same thing. He stands his ground but admits that he wonders what his life would be like if he was like a “frat boy” and slept around and partied(he doesn’t drink though).
-
We broke up briefly because an older woman(40+yr) kissed him, and while he immediately pushed her away, he started thinking the “what if’s”. What if he couldn’t make me happy in the future, what if he’s suppose to be with someone else. How does he know he loves me if he’s never been with someone else? So we broke up. He moved back to his mothers and we talked it more out the next day. On the third day, he broke down saying he missed me and he made a mistake. In his mind, he envisioned being free and all, but he was lonely and didn’t even have anyone to talk to. I missed him so much myself and we made up. 
-
We went back to living together again and he enrolled in the police academy. We have no plans of marrying right away because we’re focusing on being stable first. He’s always wanted to be a police officer because he wants to help his community, and I support his choice. He works at the company still and does the police academy, so he’s been so stressed and sleep deprived but I’ve done my best to have him lunch packed, dinner ready, his clothes always washed and clean, and the house spotless, so it reduces his stress. I always lend an ear about his tiring days at work and frustrating ones at the academy, and do my best to comfort him. 
-
Last week, he did seem abit off but I tried my best to make him feel better. Finally after few days, we sat down and talked. He’s completely overwhelmed and stressed, but he started saying things like, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, he reconsidering law enforcement, he’s rethinking life and he didn’t want children, he didn’t want to get married and he is better off alone and that he didn’t know if he loved me and He didn’t feel happy coming home. It hurt my feelings and I told him I didn’t want him to be with me if he wasn’t happy. So we broke up again that night. During the day, while he was at academy, His brother helped me move his main clothes, chargers and toiletries back to his mothers. His mothers is already crowded with 4 adults and 2 children, and I didn’t want to take his tech or important stuff there yet. 
-
That same day, we got together briefly and talked about “us”.  I asked if he wanted to be with me romantically, and he hesitated but then said no, but he didn’t want me out of his life. I agreed and asked if we should go back as friends. He said he would love that and that we can still talk and hangout. And maybe go back to dating again if everything goes good. We left on good terms and while I lay on this empty, cold bed after it being occupied for 5 years by that man, I agree that he’s young, needs to be around family and reevaluate what he needs/wants in life, but I’m also lonely. He became my lover, family and friend. I miss him and I want to text him but trying to stay strong and give him distance. Yet at he same time, I’m wondering if we will ever end back together. He finishes the academy next month, and he’ll be able to quit the company and focus on one job, and I’m wondering if being sleep deprived And stress caused him to have irrational thoughts. Im trying to be patient, stay active and see what happens, but I miss him and want him back so bad, especially in this empty house. I need some feedback or maybe some advice please. 

-Thank you for reading! I’ll make an update if anything happens.

It's come up a couple times now that he doesn't like being white.

616,"Hello.

I'm a 19 year old boy that has difficulty saying no to requests. I live in a pretty beat down extended family, with many of my cousins going to live abroad. This results in my aunts and my grandma always asking me to come over since they're mostly alone or with my uncles. I feel like they've gone through enough and I want to help alleviate some pain and be there to keep them company. The same goes for my father, who is a single parent because of the passing of my mother. I feel like I need to go and keep him company every 30 minutes to 1 hour and have difficulty saying no when he asks of me to go somewhere.

I feel utterly trapped and I don't know what to do. I have no chunks of free time and whenever I start working on a project (I'm a programming student) or start playing games, I get this urge to go and spend some time with my father so he isn't alone.

But I have a massive crush on her, I obviously know that there's nothing I can do about it as the age difference is extreme, but it is just an innocent crush, I'm never going to try to act on it. To be honest she is the first person that i have ever had a crush on.

I like her so much that its having a massively negative impact on my mental health. Ive talked to her about feeling depressed and she's been really nice and really supportive of me, she really helps me feel better, so I still really want to remain friends with her. She also messages me when she feels down and it feels nice that I know that she trusts me and thinks of me as a friend.

I’m proud of myself for finally having the courage to leave. 

I am well aware that none of this should matter, I shouldn’t care that he doesn’t care. I should be happy that he doesn’t care. But it still hurts. It feels like he never cared about me when we were together. Like he doesn’t recognize all the things I did for him (I did LOTS). I know that I was a good girlfriend to him. 

I keep finding myself trying to “prove” to him that I was a good girlfriend and I have continued to do nice things fo him around the house and what not. I’ve just been nice to him. There’s no reason to do this and I know I will regret it. Why can’t I just accept that he thinks I suck (even if I disagree) and move on? I will be out of his house soon, but I don’t know how I will handle my emotions once I’m gone. I’m excited to be free, but also scared.

629,"TLDR at the end

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this relatively short even though there was a lot that happened. So I'm a man, I just turned 18 and for as long as I can remember my life has been an emotional roller coaster. My mother was severely neglected, homeless and malnourished as a kid and for some odd reason she decided to have children before she even learned to take care of herself. My father is a narcissist probably due to his parents who didn't show him any affection even though other than that he had a pretty normal childhood. I do know that he was hit with a belt though. He got into cocaine and passed out on a beach one time where he was surprisingly found by family who lived in the area and didn't get into any trouble. They met at a homeless shelter and it was love at first sight... \*\*Eyes roll\*\*

So now there's me. As a kid, I would go to see my father every other weekend at my grandparents house, and I would spend the rest of my time at my mothers. At my mother's house, it was a disaster. I had two sisters both of whom would conspire against me, the oldest would beat the hell out of us when my mother wasn't home, and the other sister would stay on her side because she was afraid of being beaten too. The house was covered from top to bottom in cat shit, cat piss, mountains of trash bags, ripped up flipped over furniture and dirty dishes. It was also infested with a horrible flea problem. There wasn't one room in the house that wasn't like this. Including mine. At 5 years old we had a dog who later would be given away because she couldn't take care of it but for a month, two months I really don't know, he would take massive shit's and pee in my room, all around my bed and my mother would never clean it up. I was later to blame for the extremely stained and horrific smelling carpet. 

My father treated me with very little respect and consistently talked down to me, showed no interest in me playing on the computer and at one point forced me to go outside in the middle of Maine. I would walk around in the woods which seemed to never end for hours, I would blow up a tube and go float on a spring pond that formed out of melted snow. I had fun but was alone throughout all of it and I'm guessing that's why I'm so introverted. Little did he know that I'd be studying computer science in a few years and the time I spent on the computer as a kid would help me greatly. At one point I won a gift card from a fishing derby for a restaurant. I was pressured into bring his side of the family but I truly wanted to bring my mother out to eat as I had never been out with her before and he treated me wrong. This led to me being dragged out into the car, mercilessly spanked and told that I was selfish and ungrateful and left to sit in the car and cry while they ate for 2 hours. 

At home, around 6 I had bought a video game for the Wii; Super Mario Galaxy 2 if I remember correctly; with my birthday money from my grandparents and it was my only possession that I owned which wasn't broken or disgusting to touch. I tried to keep it for myself and would hide it in my room but once my sister was awake, she would come into my room and begin tearing apart everything looking for it. I would try to get her to stop and this always led to a beating. At one point she pinned me to the floor and spit a giant glob of mucus inside of my mouth as I screamed. She was nice enough to bring me a coffee mug with tap water in it to rinse out my mouth though. I ended up scratching the disk deeply so the beatings would stop and this led to even more anger from her. Everything I did wrong led to a beating. Eventually my mom got her friend to baby sit around 8 and her daughter bit me extremely hard for not getting out of the kiddie pool if I remember correctly. We stopped going and my sister was in charge again.

The beatings stopped when I turned 11 when she moved out, but now I stopped seeing my father due to him attacking me for not brushing my BUZZCUT. He claimed that he refused to be seen in public with me looking like I did.

Skip to the last day of my freshman year I ran away and lived with my friends family because the flea and trash problem wasn't being addressed. I was forced to move home in October due to her saying the problem was fixed (IT WASN'T AT ALL) and now we had 13 cats. Not exaggerating. There were also tensions with my friend because he didn't actually want a brother. I came back to my bed being shit on, my room smelling like piss, and my room being used as a storage for trash and furniture. I was about to kill myself after 3 hours of crying but luckily I had started smoking weed that summer and remembered I had a little left. I smoked and fell asleep. I ended up moving my room to a loft above my mudroom and by the end of the year I was adopted at 16. 

Ever since its been more an issue of finding my self after never being able to be myself. I suffer from extreme social anxiety and have a lot of issues regarding my appearance. I really just needed to get all this out and thank you so much for reading. If you could offer me advice on moving on and learning to tame my emotions in order to find myself I would greatly appreciate it. I meditate, have stopped smoking weed, and I'm really trying but even a babies birthday party which my adoptive dad is at right now had to be turned down because I'm so afraid of being around people. I don't fit in. After my ADHD was diagnosed and I began receiving treatment, I've realized that I'm an extremely; extremely; intelligent person. There is a spark inside of me. I just need to find it. Again thank you so much for reading and my apologies if this was long.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I was neglected and abused as a kid, got adopted and now am having trouble finding myself. Please offer any advice you can. Thank you.",08Aug2020,1
630,"A bit of backstory:

I was born (and still am living) in a pretty bad country for me (since I am gay). It has a law where gay people will face jail time and/or a fine if found being gay, and also a death penalty for muslims (which I am)

I always tried my best to keep my sexuality a secret (atleast irl), and for the past 3 or so years nobody irl knew that I was gay. Then comes today, where I came out to my best friend. He was always understanding about everything, so I didnt really think he'd tell anyone... I was wrong. Recently I got a pretty worrying text where some kids in my school will report me to the authorities about me being gay. Turns out my friend told them about me coming out

I honestly have no idea what to do, since its like a ticking time bomb for me to do something. I dont think I can ask my parents since they'll surely get furious if I tell them whats going on, and I dont know if I can tell anything to my other friends, since I dont know who to trust anymore",08Aug2020,1
631,"I (21F) have finally figured out my plans for the future but my mom is holding me back. 
Just some back ground information: I am a senior in college on the east coast and am currently looking for law schools in the west. My mom is a single parent (widow), only child, and never apologizes or admits when she’s wrong.  In the past couple years I have been fortunate enough to go visit other states in the west coast and each state I visited, I fell in love with. Since COVID started, being at home with not much to do helped me think more about my ultimate goals and dreams for my career and life overall. I realized that my dream is to be in the west with my boyfriend (21 M) in either Colorado, Utah, Oregon, or Washington. 

 My boyfriend will be going to a different school than me, but we’ll hopefully be in the same city. I believe that it would make more sense to go to law school in the state in which I will live in. So, fast forward to late June, I tried to nonchalantly bring up law school while also trying to include moving out further west. She immediately was shocked (understandable), but then looked almost disgusted? She then says she can’t picture me living there and other confusing excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. I just sat there and listened because I know it won’t take one day to get her to listen to me. I then start to look at what schools I’m interested in and what cities I want to live in. Thankfully, my boyfriend and I are in agreement with the same states so we’re excited. 

So, last week I tell my mom that now I’m really interested in moving to Colorado and going to law school there. Again, she just keeps saying negative things about Colorado and why I shouldn’t go. She then tells me that I am not “driven” enough, and at that point that just completely broke me inside. But again, I listen and ignore, but I am fuming yet crushed on the inside. A couple days pass and I start to give her an attitude (which I won’t deny, because I did) and she comes into my room and asks me why I’ve been rude. I told her how much her words hurt me and how she could say something like that to her own daughter.  At this point i’m scream crying at her and telling her how hard I have been studying for the LSATs and looking up information about the school, the cities near it, etc. I ask her why it is so hard for her to just accept that I am an adult and at some point I have to do what’s best for me. She then tells me that it’s hard for her to accept me leaving, but she knows at some point she has to. I understand it’s hard for her, but being in my house for too long with her makes me depressed. 

Thankfully,  my grandmother lives with us and we both have issues with my mom and have tried discussing them with her to no avail. So, two days ago I visited her at her job and we went to lunch together.  She brings up law school and asks me who else is coming with me. I never had the opportunity to tell her that my boyfriend is coming because she would immediately shut the idea down so why is it worth it to bring up anyways. I decided to take a shot and ask if we could live together since I won’t know anybody else there and feel most comfortable with him especially when it comes to my first year of law school. Understandably and not surprisingly, she said no and I never brought it up again.  Yesterday, we went out to lunch again (we lost power since Tuesday) and she then starts asking me so many questions about my boyfriend and why he wants to move there too and all this other bs. I told her that it’s not her problem because she is not his mother.

She of course didn’t like that response and then got so angry out of nowhere and called me a liar because I never told her about my boyfriend wanting to move with me. She said that I wasn’t “woman enough” to tell her, but she never gave me the chance to. And to top it all off I have to stay home for the semester because my school went online. I just really need advice on how to talk to my mom and tell her that this is my life without her getting mad and having tension for the rest of the year.",08Aug2020,1
632,"So I have 2 friends.

S (F/12)


E (F13)

And then there is me (f/14)

I found out a while ago that S’ parents don’t like/trust me, and that E’s parents suddenly don’t either. I’ve been friends with E for 4 years ( technically two but we’ve known each other for 4.) and this just got out now. 

Before you ask why the don’t like me, I’m honestly unsure. It could be the way I dress ( it’s extremely hot here and I have a history of getting heat stroke so I usually wear a sports bra, shorts and a light sweater to wear around their houses to keep it modest.) Apparently it’s because of the way I act but I’m also iffy on that because I consider myself polite and respectful, although a bit loud (I underestimate my volume and often speak loud.) 

The only other thing I can think of is my parents. My stepdad isn’t very nice and they probably told their parents that- so I get the consequences of his actions.

I’m more so asking for a parents view- what could your children’s friends do to make you like them? I’m beginning to distance myself in order not to cause issues with everyone. I feel guilty and I don’t even know what I did.",08Aug2020,1
633,"Here’s a long story. My mom began teaching high schoolers as soon as she got her degree in education. She then got with my biological dad. There was a kid in her 2nd year of teaching...let’s call him Artez. Back in February, she was stalking her older students on facebook and saw that Artez posted ‘Its snowing here in [prison he’s in]’. My mom sent him a direct message. They began talking and they began dating. I then approached my mother and explained how I wasn’t comfortable with that. She then ‘broke up with him’. I didn’t really believe it but then I found her nudes she sent to him while I was snooping. (Terrible idea, i know) I didn’t tell her. It really hurt that she was lying. They talk all the time and they say ‘I love you!’ and ‘Okay babe!’ and stuff like that. My mom claims she does it to make him feel good since he’s lonely in prison. Oh, i forgot to mention he’s in prison for ATTEMPTED MURDER AND FLEEING US CUSTODY!!! My mom doesn’t think anything of it and he gets out in 10 years. I just don’t want her to get hurt.

638,"For the last year I've had my mind 100% set on joining the army once I finish this school year. I'm Irish, I've asked around about how army life is here and I've not heard too much good things about it. I did some research and found out Irish citizen's are allowed into the British army without any need for permanent/current residency. 

I've told my dad about this and he said it wouldn't be a good idea due to our history with the English and the violence that happened in our country between us. He said talk about it with my uncle, who had applied to join and has also worked for years in England. He told me some stories he heard from his friends of things the English did to terrorise the Catholics in the north of Ireland but that happened decades ago during the troubles.

Personally, I have absolutely no ill will against English people, no matter what our history was. I know I'll probably get some slagging by those I train with if I join but thats just part of the package for joining any army. 

I know its my own decision but I don't want my dad to end up resenting me because of my decisions. But the last thing I want to do is have the regret of not joining for the rest of my life.",08Aug2020,1

Now, whenever we talk—rather, whenever I call her first—she makes me feel guilty about growing up, and how I never included her in my life.

642,"She was my best and first friend. We met when I was 10. She lived 2 doors down from me and we would walk to school together every day. She was a great friend and we had soooo much fun together. We stopped being friends once highschool started, she was in applied classes and started hanging around the druggies and stoners. She slowly got more and more into drugs, smoking and partying while at the time I was very against that. I still loved her and felt the room light up every time she walked in, but I feel like she was more interested in her party lifestyle and getting high than being my friend. In hindsight she was pretty selfish. She would go places with me and leave me there, she would only care about herself and what she wanted and she wouldn't listen to any of my advice or take any help. Most people would probably be annoyed by this but for some reason those characteristics don't annoy me. I care deeply for others and would rather her be happy anyways it was just too hard watching her go down that path and I didn't think there was a way to remain friends with her and stay true to myself and my beliefs. She died 2 months ago and the family did an autopsy and said they will tell our mutual friend what the results were but she told me she didn't hear. I'm thinking it's drug related because there is so little told about her death. They said she ""died peacefully in her sleep""... it's just hard and I think about it constantly it drives me insane and lately I keep having dreams too which are telling me that someone killed her. I feel like her ghost is always following me and always around me and I keep giving her the attention. At first it was all positive and I thought of her as an angel and only remembered the positive sides of her but as the dust settles I remember clearer. I still love her, I know she was a good, kind hearted person who loved everyone but I see her for who she was more so now than the image of what I want her to be. I had a head surgery last year and had a tumor in my skull that I slowly suffered from since I was young, so i have been near death myself. It has also affected my memory so all the pieces of the puzzle don't really fit. I remember as much as I can and as much as people remind me. It's just hard, the entire thing. I want to stop thinking about her and let her go but it seems so impossible. I'm considering doing a little ceremony for her by myself, maybe write her name down and write and letter to her and then send it out to the lake near me. Earlier on I was thinking about way to commemorate her and I thought about things like making a bench in her name but realized that's probably something the family should do not me and I don't have the extra money. I did make a vow to do whatever I can to help all the little Sydney's I find in my life tho. Just to help stear them on the right track, the way I couldn't for Sydney.

My dad was forced into an early retirement. We live in a country (Middle East), where we would be required to leave if we do not have any sponsors, despite me and my little sister being born here. We have been sponsored until next year but afterwards nothing.

We have no home or place to go to, we have always lived in rented houses, as you can't purchase houses here. My father's side of family has a home in a village and the conditions there are HORRIBLE, honestly disgusting. 

I thankfully started my first job six months ago, but I am on contract basis i.e. no insurance, no sponsor. My salary is low as well due to laws of preferring locals over others.

“No, but I’m a senior in High school.”

650,"During my childhood, my parents argued a lot, and my father was drunk most of the time. 

It did stress me out.

When I went to school, during the first years everything was more or less normal. However, as tension in the family was rising, I was feeling more and more anxious, I didn't feel safe at home at all. The most memorable episode was my drunk father pretending to shot himself with a shotgun.

The constant stress had led to various insecurities and eventually, I became the ""weird"" kid. That, of course, had led to bullying. I didn't complain the entire time it had been happening. I just thought that's how things were and nothing can be changed because I thought there was something wrong with me.

The most fortunate thing to happen to me was having access to the Internet. Although I used to escape from myself and the outside world with it, of course not without video games, I don't know what would have become of me without it.

So, now I've figured that there was never anything wrong with me. I shouldn't blame myself anymore. I've found out my insecurities and I've understood that they are not innate, their existence is not my fault. I've sworn not to hate myself ever again.   
Now I have clear goals in mind and know what I want to do. But this is so difficult to get rid of past bad habits and insecurities. I am still stressed out.

I even mentioned aside from the incident itself (which I got over pretty fast), I was more concerned on whether this person had the virus, and the fact he got so close to my face, did he just spread it? They laughed at that as well, making me feel weak. 

Trying to ""revisit"" the entire event, I was pretty nervous and scared when I saw the driver literally get to my door and close to my face. I had no idea what could've happened, especially when the cop didn't even do anything. I felt like my friends laughing and instead suggesting to actually ""square up"" and defend myself is the right move (and my concern about the virus is a joke), whereas my goal was to de-escalate and move on my with my day, safely. I personally wouldn't say I am a ""weak dude"" but man when you actually go through an event like this, I feel like its so easy to say ""you would've done this, or you should've done that"" and so forth. I honestly am not so sure after hearing what some of my friends had to say, and their reaction if I really should value these ""friends"". Mainly because it seems to them, it is a joke (and by all means, I doubt they would've even lasted if it came to some sort of physical altercation as the dude who got out of the car was pretty big himself, and who knows if he had some sort of weapon on him).

I guess my question here is, in moments like these, should I really start re-evaluating if these folks I call ""friends"" are true ""friends""? I know it could have been all jest on their part, but knowing them, they seemed pretty serious. I am just confused and feel like I may be over-thinking this, but their reactions should definitely be room to realize perhaps they think I am some so sort of weak person. I dunno, maybe I am just still confused over the entire incident, open to advice here. :)",08Aug2020,1

659,"I(18M) have a brother(19M) who I used to be very close with, we grew up together, walked our first steps together, played every game together, homeschooled and studied together. Lately I feel like we aren't as close anymore.  


During these 3-4 years he has developed a very bad gaming habit making him sleep 5-6am and wake up 3-4pm. He eats 2 meals a day and he's quite skinny. We don't have much friends IRL because we hardly go out, but we aren't anti-social. Though he has a bunch of friends he knew from the internet who he considers as good friends, none of them had IRL contact with him before.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't a problem for me at all, I didn't mind about him and his online friends, but lately he has been ignoring me quite a bit and prioritizing more on his friends than family. Since gaming is the main activity we have in common, I would sometimes invite him for gaming. If I invite him for a game, he can delay me for hours and never tell me he's ready until I ask him again, but when his friends invite him, he will be ready instantly whenever and he's willing to wait even though if his friends need him to stay up to 3-4am. He nowadays almost never invites me to his games, it's always me inviting him if we ever played together. I also feel like he has been hiding his thoughts away from me, I don't know if this is part of growing to adulthood but we used to share thoughts together. And to keep it simplified; he's also on a discord server with a private text channel (that I don't have access to) between him and his friends, he chats a lot in there. He hardly comes down to eat dinner with the family too, maybe due to his odd hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overthinking? Should I stop trying to be so close to him and just focus more on myself? He still talks to me, we still talk to each other but I wish he could be more open-minded with me like he used to be before and more prioritized on family than his online games/friends. So far I have not actually complained to him about it yet, these are just thoughts running in my mind. I've only encouraged him to fix his sleep schedule/gaming habits and asked in an indirect way about his online friends, he does not seem to care much about it.",08Aug2020,1

661,"So I became friends with this girl some time ago. She’s such a sweet person and was there for me during one of the biggest anxiety attacks I’ve ever had in my life. Thus, she has been there for me emotionally ever since. 

Now, about a month ago, I receive this really long message from her confessing that she liked me romantically. I declined her politely as I said I didn’t feel the same way and didn’t float in that direction, but I respected her nonetheless. We continued to talk and be friends, but a part of myself wonders maybe if I should have distanced myself a bit afterwards. Was it healthy to immediately jump back into a friendship? I’ve asked her before about if she still had any feelings and she said she didn’t anymore and views me as a sister, but I don’t know how truthful that may be. 

At first out of the respect for her, I did slowly start to distance myself, but she also immediately stopped me and said: “yeah I noticed you distancing” and “no, no don’t do that, we can finally be sisters again!” I find her behavior a bit alarming and clingy, but as someone who in the past has dealt with unhealthy habits, I’m still trying to figure out my boundaries and what makes me comfortable and not. At the end of the day, I know where I stand now and I’d be fine if we were friends, but I’m worried that she may still not know how to draw that line and exhibiting clingy behavior such as trying to talk to me everyday and occasionally throwing out “my girl” (which at this point, she claims is just part of her ‘personality’ with giving her friends love). 

I’d love a second opinion or advice. What would you do if a friend confessed?",08Aug2020,1

They’re in their early 50’s now and I’ve been worrying that they’ve never been able to save up money. 

I don’t even think they’re ever had a retirement fund from their jobs. They don’t understand stuff when HR or whatever talk to them about their employment contracts. Idk what to do, I barely know about any of this stuff too since I never had anyone to talk to me about this, I’ve been learning it and I barely understand it. 

I have 2 living older siblings and 1 younger, 2 of us are still struggling with careers, don’t own houses, and can barely afford to take care our family and kids. The other (not the youngest as he’s a teenager and doesn’t count) is living in my parents basement and she is over 30. Who knows how much she has in savings or if she spends it all on drugs and whatever else she buys. 

This is becoming more concerning to me because as I said they’re in their early 50’s and are probably going to be too tired to work in some years, they might be forced to retire. My parents always try to give us money especially if they know we’re struggling to pay bills or something.

669,"I've been friends with her for a good ten years,   
and of course I'd do anything to help her out, that's what friends are for, right?  
I haven't spoken to her in a year or so, not because I didn't want to text her,  
it's because she'll always send the least amount of text as possible!  
I'd always be the one to text her.  
Well, she asked if she could stay at my place (My Grandma's) a few months ago.  
We treat her like family, of course, but behind closed doors, I would like to pull my hair out!  
Sometimes I can have great conversations with her, it'll be a lovely conversation,  
until...it isn't!  


For example, she's an incredibly condescending talker. I don't bother to get into it, I just let her ramble on about her opinion, until she's done.  
I don't care about her views, but she's willing to proclaim them to me as if it were facts, and talk to me as if I were five for politely disagreeing with that.  
She brags an awful lot, as well. While she's rambling about her opinions, she says she learned them in this high-level class.  
Not to mention her pity parties! I would love to listen to her, but she complains about everything. Life sucks for everyone in one way or another, and I've tried to nonchalantly hint at that at one point.  
I simply say it is what it is, once you've done all you could do, what's the point in whining and complaining about it.  
She acted incredibly defensive, and talked down to me, telling me that I'm too lax.  


I rarely complain, and while I'm listening to her whine about her back, and this that and the other, I complained once, and that was to ask everyone to stop leaving crumbs on the counter, and while she agreed, she talked to me as if I were a jerk for even mentioning it, as if I made it out to be a big deal. Then she went on to tell me how bad she had it in her old house.  
Put it too you this way, she complains about being soooo blind, and how she needs her glasses, meanwhile their the weakest prescription out there, and I don't whine about my eyes, despite my optic nerve being torn in my right eye, and I'm unable to see out of that eye.  
I never pinch her arm about it. I do hate to make that comparison, but that is how she is.  
She has to have it 10x harder than it actually is.  


On top of that, she never tried to join us for anything. She's always at her boyfriends house, and as much as I hate to say it, those are my breathes of fresh air.  
She's become unbearable to talk to most of the time, and while I keep everything to myself.  
She sits in her room all day with her earbuds in, and only has conversations when she feels the need to put her two-sense in.

I wish her the best, but she's not my friend, I worry for her, but that's just about it.

Is there any way I could fix this, or is she gone?",08Aug2020,1

On my first day here they were both acting weird, I got high off a bong hit (haven’t smoked for months before) and was paranoid but I look back now and realise I was actually just following my gut feeling. They tried to make me sign something and the guy at the reception said “the manager isn’t here, but I can bend the rules for you guys” my gut told me not to sign shit.

685,"I (M22) have always struggled to make friends. When I was a kid I was always shy and didn't talk to many people. So nobody really knew that my family was a bit more wealthy than everybody else in my area. Since turning 18, I have made some very lucky investments using my parents money. And that has made me quite a lot of money. I haven't told many people about this.

Before I told people about this, my friends were not too nice to me. If I ever tried to make plans, they would either make up an excuse so they couldn't hang out or they just wouldn't turn up on the day. So I decided to leave most of those friends and find new ones.

I thought showing off my money would be a good way to make friends. It started when I started going to parties and I would always bring lots of drink. Everyone seemed to love me for that and I loved that feeling. Then I would make friends with them and go to the pub and I would pay for everybody's drinks. And it's now got to the point where I spend a lot of money on them for everything. If we go anywhere, I pay. Or if we get a takeaway, I pay.

The thing that has recently started bothering me is how my friends treated me on my birthday. When it's my friends birthdays, I spend a lot of money buying them gifts and then I will normally pay for whatever they're doing that day. My birthday was last week and not one of my friends got me a gift. I wasn't expecting anything expensive but I was hoping for something. Even my best friend got me nothing and I got him a car for his birthday. It made me really sad. Another thing that upset me was, I decided to go to the pub with 4 of my friends for my birthday and I made a joke about one of them paying for one of my drinks. He got angry at me saying it's disrespectful asking him to pay when I have much more money than him. And all my other friends backed him up. So as always I ended up buying all the drinks. Another thing that really made me feel down is that some people didn't even bother to message me saying happy birthday. But when it was there birthday, I spent lots of money on them. 

I really need some advice. What should I do about this. Do you think my friends are just friends with me for my money? Do you think I'm overreacting? Please just message me anytime, I would appreciate it. Thank you",08Aug2020,1

I work at Lowe’s mainly (appliance sales associate), a local grocery store (I face shelves), and I do deliveries every now and then (postmates only since I’m waiting for my DoorDash card)

It’s not stressful working multiple jobs, it’s all based on my Lowe’s schedule since I earn more money there and I’m only seasonal which ends soon. However, Lowe’s makes it stressful.

I always get assigned multiple things to do, and if I don’t do it, then I guess I was slacking the entire day even though I help out customers or sell appliances the whole day.

Usually when he talks he goes on long tirades mainly about video games like fortnite or cod, and me not really being into much of those titles just shrug it off, or try to change the subject. However when I do he still makes his way back. I spend an awful amount of times ignoring his calls and texts cuz its going to be a round about conversation where we dont really find any kind of common middle ground. I also find it increasingly perplexing that he still wants to keep a relationship or convo with me given our history. I wasnt always the best nicest older brother. Its been near 4 years since ive been gone. How do I make a connection?",08Aug2020,1
691,"Hi,

I (20,m) have been good friends with a girl(19) who i know from an online GC. We always talk and understand each other well. I suffer with am ED(bulimia) and when i feel like complete shit or want to be sick i message her and she makes ke feel alot better.

The past week i've wanted to self harm and i messaged her and she made me stop. Today i just kinda did it and after i felt really shit so i messaged her. She got annoyed and said that she didn't know what to say and was annoyed that i didn't tell her. If im being very honest that is NOT what i wanted her to say, it was far from it(i didnt tell her this).

I was really pissed off and so was she so i just said to her i'll talk to her tommorrow as i might end up saying something silly as i get immature when im mad.

Was this the mature correct thing to do?

692,"Hello all
I have been dating my boyfriend for barely a month so it's very new. 
I like him a lot but a thing that is getting on my nerves is weirdly when he uses baby voice. 
It's weird because he only says nice things when he does it like ""you're so cute"" or ""I love you baby"" or just ""babe"".
I don't really show him I dislike it because I feel so mean since he just means well and wants to show love. 
It makes me uncomfortable because I am not a baby or a pet. It turns me off. I feel horrible since he just says kind things. But the baby voice thing.... It's not sexy. 
Maybe he tries to talk the same way as me but I have a naturally high pitched voice, and I know you all will hate me for this, but he is a man! 

Any advice for me?",08Aug2020,1
693,"My parents found my stash of cannabis cartridges and bud earlier this week, and took all of it. Cannabis was my only source of relief for back pain, chronic diarrhea, and anxiety. I’m currently sitting on the toilet experiencing extremely painful abdominal cramping, and I can’t even stand up without being in pain. Additionally, working all week has caused my back to tighten up and I have multiple knots that hurt whenever I move my arms too much, bend over, etc. I am usually an adamant runner, but because of the pain in my back and the constant abdominal pain, I haven’t been able to exercise since monday (the day they took everything). I tried to explain to my (very Christian) parents that cannabis was my only source of relief. To them, it is a gateway drug and they believe that if I would continue to use cannabis, I would move on to other dangerous drugs. I have been going to a gastroenterologist and have gotten multiple tests, and even a colonoscopy, and my doctor has no idea how to help me. Thankfully, I’m going to college in just 12 days, and I’m planning on getting a medical card as soon as I get there. I’m just so worried about the $250 fee that is required, as my insurance won’t cover any of it, and the medical program in PA is extremely overpriced. Additionally, my parents are not giving me any money toward college, so I am constantly burdened with the fact that I am too broke for all of this. I fear that when I get there, I’ll have so much schoolwork to do that I won’t be able to  get the relief I need. But right now, it seems like the only option, because if I stay here, my parents will not allow me to get relief in the only way that works.

Growing up I’ve always wanted to travel to different states and countries and it’s always been a dream of mine to live in a different state/country for at least a year. However my boyfriend doesn’t want to do anything like that at all, he likes to go on trips for about a week at a time but I always want to stay longer so I can see how people really live in the areas and be able to experience all the little things instead of just the touristy things. He says he wants to have children around the times he’s 25-26 years old and stay in the same city/area we both grew up in.  I love the place that I grew up and I would love to live and have a family here but I just feel like I need to get away and see different places for a while also. I’ve talked to him about this before and all he really gives me is “we’ll see what happens” and I’m starting to get frustrated with his answer and he knows this.

701,"I have been debating a new video doorbell for weeks and have yet to pull the trigger on the Ring Pro or the Nest Hello. Looking for any comments, advice or knowledge to help me make a decision finally. 

Background: my husband and I are currently building a new house that comes with some smart home features but not a full package. We currently have a SimpliSafe alarm system that we are not too impressed by so we are switching to the Ring security alarm. We debated Ring or Nest alarms but it wasn’t really a hard decision because we preferred Ring’s alarm setup for multiple reasons. As a part of our new build home package, we are getting 3 Nest thermostats. This is where it gets tricky because we are now buying into both the Ring and Nest ecosystems, both which offer a video doorbell.

Originally we were going to choose the Ring Pro because Ring seems to be a “tried and true” brand for video doorbells but after some research, it seems that the lag time to open the app when you have a doorbell notification is so long that there are hundreds of complaints online. I do like that the alarm system and the video doorbell share the same app. I like that the $100/year security monitoring for the alarm also includes 60 days of video storage for the doorbell.

Then comes Nest Hello. Personally, we prefer the look of the Nest Hello. It seems that the Nest Hello is made of better quality materials. It appears that the Nest Hello has better video and audio quality than the Ring Pro. We need to have the Nest app for our thermostats and the Nest Hello would use the same app. I like that they share the same app on our smart devices. Nest Hello is also $20 cheaper so that is a plus. 

I’ve gone back and forth many times. Started with Ring then to Nest back to Ring and then to Nest and now I’m undecided. If reviewing previous doorbell footage was not a factor, I would choose the Nest Hello. What I am getting hung up on is that I already have to pay $100/year for the Ring alarm monitoring which could include video playback of the Ring Pro. If I go with the Ring alarm and Nest Hello, then I’m paying 2 subscriptions annually.

One question I have: if I don’t have a Nest Aware subscription, can I not view ANYTHING that was previously recorded? If someone steals a package at 1pm but I’m in a meeting until 2pm, can I not see what happened unless I have a subscription? 

For what it’s worth, we are heavily invested in the Apple / macOS / iOS ecosystem so Amazon (Ring) or Google (Nest) loyalty doesn’t really play a factor here.

Ring Pro: $250 one time. 
Monitoring subscription: $100/year

Nest Hello: $230 one time.
Nest Aware subscription: $60/year. 

Thanks in advance!",08Aug2020,1

704,"For the last three years, I have spent what I estimate is $1000-ish a year on clothes, give or take. I spent around $250 three or four times a year. The reason I would do this is because every season, based on my mood and how I was feeling, I used my clothes to portray myself and how I wanted people to view me, as I also cared a lot about what people thought about me. Essentially I went through five or six different clothing styles in the span of a few years because I was constantly changing as a person and now I have a closet full of clothes, a lot of which I do not wear, as I feel it no longer suits me as a person.

I have done a lot of figuring myself out. Mainly because I am recovering from PTSD and I have had a really hard time trying to figure out who I am. I’m doing a lot better now, but I feel guilty about how I’ve been acting over the last few years. I was terribly mentally unstable and really stressed, anxious, and dependent on the people around me. I’ve finally allowed myself to enjoy things again. I’ve been going for walks, reading, writing, and honestly? Feeling like I can breathe again. I’m finally starting to feel some freedom from my past and my thoughts. I feel like I have myself back.

Looking at all the clothes I have in my closet has been making me uncomfortable. Mainly because of what I associate it with, but also because there is so much I do not wear. I don’t want to get rid of all of it since I had spent so much money (definitely when I couldn’t afford it), but wearing a lot of the clothes reminds me of my past and I would really like to move forward. I find looking at pictures of myself difficult and I have been trying to take new ones. I guess this is all just a part of my recovery.

I don’t have any friends that would give me that much money, the bank account is empty because we had to pay the bills, the rest of our family also have money issues so we can’t ask them anything. We’re pretty much screwed at the moment. So yeah, any (serious I repeat) advice about how to get out of this are welcomed.

707,"This is going to be a weird one, I apologize if you don't feel like it belongs here. I've been politically active since I was 18, I'm 34 years old now. I don't view politicians the same way people who aren't involved in politics or aren't politicians do.

I lost that election about 3 and 1/2 4 years ago. Like everyone, I have friends, people I date, social circles etc and sometimes you get into arguments with people. I cannot tell you how many times I get into an argument with someone and out of anger they say ""that's why your people voted you out"" ""yeah like that election you lost"". I find it really weird and I just heard it again last night with a girl I was dating that I didn't even tell I had ran before. She had googled me on her own time.

Why do people keep on bringing this up? I lost the election because the demographics in my town shifted to a different party once new apartment complexes went up and a bunch of people who used to live there moved out because of rising housing costs. There was never any dirt on me or any scandal or anything like that.

I guess I'm asking people who arent involved in politics, do you have some negative viewpoint of a politician who lost an election? I know tons of politicians who run, and win, run, and lose, run, and win, run, and lose etc etc. I don't think anything of it. it seems every time somebody is upset with me about something they bring up some election that was upsetting to me, but not that much. the way things are going in my life it actually would have been devastating if I had one.

711,"So there's this girl who I really like talking to, and seeing her texts makes my day. I'm 15M and I almost never text people with a ''hey, how are you?'' let alone call, just because I'm too scared to. I'm not socially awkward or anything, and I sit with my group of 5-6 friends on our Discord server though.

Anyway, back to this girl, so whenever I text her, I'm always asking her for a favor, asking a question, taking advice or something like that. I never text her just like that because I feel shy and feel like I need to have a reason to be texting her. I just realized that she might not be enjoying talking to me because all I ever do is ask something and never make actual conversation.

Also, I've hurt her feelings a couple of times and can be a jerk too, but unintentionally though. She never gets mad and me and forgives me for stuff. She's also helped me go through a sort of 'tough phase' a few months ago. Whenever I messaged her with a problem, she always tries her best to help me out.

I had a crush on her till about a year ago but now I don't. She doesn't know I just want to able to talk to her normally like friends do. We are in the same grade and we talked a little when we used to go to school as we are in the same social group. Then quarantine started in March and we haven't met since.

We used to talk quite a bit on chat in March and April but we've drifted apart since. I don't really blame her as I had mentioned, I've hurt her feelings a couple of time too. Also, it's quite possible that she doesn't enjoy talking to me as I always ask for something. She's also been busy lately as shes started a hobby and spends a LOOOT of time working on it.

I've known her since 3 years but we've only started talking and have been a part of the same social group since about 1 and a half years.

I really want to talk to her, so any advice that I get will be appreciated

My grandpa passed away earlier this year and I miss him so much. My grandparents used to live with my dad and my 2 aunts in this house that is near where I work and they lived there for 20 years.

713,"My best friend and I were the epitome of a bromance. We did every thing together and were together pretty much every day. He was always by my side through anything just as I was always by his side. We were brothers. The minute his girlfriend came along, everything changed.

He would cancel our plans to be with his girlfriend or even disappear for weeks at a time, and this was when they first started dating in 2012 during high school. Then eventually they would break up and he would spend more time with me and we’d go back to normal. Each time though, they would get back together and the cycle would continue. About three years ago, his girlfriend cheated on him and I instantly began to hate the bitch. I felt like she was taking advantage of my friend and was too controlling and he knew this. I started trying to help him move on by setting up double dates for us with other females. Eventually they got back together and got over the whole cheating scandal, fine, not my business, but I still hated the bitch. 

She would block me from his phone and make it completely hard for me to contact him. She would complain to him that I called him too much and that the fact that I wanted to see him almost every day was “weird” or “annoying” and she would even ask him to ignore most of my calls if they were together. Just a real bitch who demanded most of his time, if not all. 

About 5 months ago, they broke up again and this time for about two months. During that time, we were doing everything together and bonding more than ever and he was pretty much always available and down to party, and even available to chill with other women, something that I personally was trying to set up just to push him into moving on. I had made a plan for us to do a hotel with two other women, one woman was a woman I was interested in and the other was a woman who was interested in him. A few weeks later around the time we were supposed to get the hotel room, he disappeared for about two weeks. Once I finally got a hold of him he told me he had been ignoring me because he was back with his girlfriend and she found out about the hotel plans and was really offended that I would try to get him to fuck other women knowing about their relationship and that if I was his “real friend” I wouldn’t be trying to destroy their relationship. 

He also told me that he didn’t talk to me because our friendship was apparently “disrespectful” to his relationship because of how often I try to get him to cheat on her and how much time I demand from him. The fact that me just simply trying to be there for him was considered too much or disrespectful really did fuck me up inside. I just enjoy having my friend around and the fact that his girlfriend is against that and that he is just okay with cutting me off over her truly does suck.

He told me he wanted to talk more about it in person and I decided to cut him off. I haven’t spoken to him in about two months and honestly I feel shitty about it. But if our friendship is considered disrespectful or too much for his relationship then I just can’t do it. I can’t be friends with someone who can allow his girlfriend to block his best friend or dictate what he can or can’t do. He obviously chose where he wanted to be since I haven’t heard back from him either...or maybe it’s just me refusing to coexist with his girlfriend. I could just be being immature but idk, anyone else experienced this? What do you think I should do? How would you handle it?",08Aug2020,1

I am a 21-year-old college student in Texas. I currently study psychology, but entered school as an art major. I am struggling to dedicate to a field of study because of my passion for the arts. I feel as if I have to pick a “formal” area of study or my degree would be a waste. Here is where it gets tricky. When I think about what makes me happiest and what I’m best at doing, my mind anyways loops back to singing. I. Love. Singing. It is my passion and I’ve been singing my whole life. Another important detail about my voice is that I used to be a Soprano 1 part. This changed, as I am transgender and transitioned physically. So, now my voice is baritone BUT what I didn’t expect is that my voice is more pleasing and technically more advanced than before. My dilemma is that I have no idea how to start working my way towards professional singing. I am under the impression that the training starts very young, so there is no hope for my passion. I have realistic dreams. I don’t want to be a big star or anything, I just want to express myself musically. I have a musical background and used to play 4+ instruments, but I have not played in a while. How can I work towards getting my voice noticed? Is it too late for me to try? Again, thank you for reading all of this. I greatly appreciate any help",08Aug2020,1
725,"I have an older brother we went to the same schools untill he went to college. He is better then me at everything, some examples : art, he is so much better then me at this subject, he is so much stronger then me also has better martial art like skills and whenever we get into arguments he would always win, after he wins he would show off with It and at the end of the day that makes me look weak in front of my parents, grandparents and cousins etc. He is much more creative. He is well remembered at school due to higher grades, we had same maths teacher she even made fun of me for having worse grades in front of my class.
He is also much more social and therefore more accepted by people, sometimes I feel like the my one and only best friend would like to prefer to talk to my brother then to me I feel like in the whole family I am the one that is the loner I noticed that even my 3 younger brothers get more attention from my parents and even my older brother gets more attention from my dad as he is stronger, he can help him in much more different stuff they have a lot to talk about and my mum as she as well went to an art school, and my brother gets a lot of help from her.

Whenever we played with younger siblings I was the villain/hero the guy who was against everyone else. When I had enough and stopped playing they would be so friendly to each other like I am the odd one out.
Henis better then me at everything I get to try to do first I tried toing some stuff with wood and of course he was better then me then I did some running and of course he could run further and faster then me.
I just really don't know what to do I am growing up with him 15 years now and whenever he said something to me that wasn't funny I would take It so seriously and even when sometimes I get a haircut or buy some clothes I would always ask him for his opinion, It has gotten to a point where I am relient on him and I don't want to. We are really close to each other as a whole family but no one looks at It my way and thinks about how I feel.

What made me write this is we had an argument today and got into a fight he destroyed me with one hand. And due to having a lot of friends and being more social and being older he has much more motivation and help in gym some friends may give him protein powder and as he can get a after scho. Job he can buy himself protein powder which helps him build mass and makes him basically ""The Rock"" and If you look at me I am a thin guy. He was always so sure about what he wants to do and I still have problems finding out and If I try to think or choose a school matching my interests I would always as him If that would be the right option for me and If It was something he didn't like or thought of the interest to be funny he would make fun of me. I am the second child of 5, I would need some motivation. Tips on what should I do, anyone in the same situation?

728,"I’m going to be a third year right now. I get financial aid so that’s a bit in question as well... 

It’s just a thought. I don’t see myself dropping out like tomorrow lmao. I haven’t done enough research on mortuary school. 

So, I’m a third year, and I’ve always been into psychology, but I sort of convinced myself out of that major because I didn’t want to go to grad school so I switched to environmental management... did terrible in the classes required. I was on academic probation twice! Although I loved the idea of working in that field I couldn’t even see myself doing it, but since I was too far into it, I decided to stick to human development, which I did well in the classes that both EM and HDE shared (basically anthropology and statistics) Well, now that i’m back with human development, (similar to psychology) grad school is back on the line because of the career I want. First of all, my gpa is quite low from trying the EM classes, so that would affect my chances of getting into grad school and with how hard those classes were... how I handled the difficulty with these classes intimidates me with how grad school will be. 

And idk, the future with going to university always seemed like a blur. Since middle school I always wanted to go to college but when high school hit and I actually got the acceptance to the college I actually liked, I started thinking maybe it wasn’t for me. I felt pressured by my family that I should go to college but I don’t think they would have been disappointed with me not going, i don’t really know how to explain it.. idk maybe it was just me forcing myself. Especially since at the time i really hated my hometown. 


Right now I’m thinking about finishing my bachelors. And then figuring things out from there.

I didn’t say too much about why I would want to go to mortuary school on this post because I haven’t done much research and I don’t want to sound more stupid.

735,"I started tutoring on the side for a bit extra money back in college but now that the schools in my area are going virtual I have gotten a lot of people asking me to host mini teaching sessions of 5-7 students per class. Now I charge A LOT for my teaching classes, I went to a really good University and have a pretty good job plus I live in a decently well off area.

I want to make sure that everyone who I teach gets the most value from it so the class is fast paced and we go over more advanced concepts than just the state's curriculum. I don’t want people holding up the class so I just ask everyone have an SAT math score above 700. I find it to be the most fair rubric since grades vary so much from teacher to teacher and in general grade inflation.

No one has objected or been upset by it, most parents like the fact that it is more rigorous. It was all good until this woman came by and wanted to put her son in my tutoring. I was like sure can I see your son’s transcripts and SAT scores.

She shows me her transcripts and his SAT math score is a 580. I tell her that its a bit too low that this course is for students that are a bit more advanced. She tells me that her son has got A’s and B’s that he will be fine. I was like sorry but no.

She just starts getting angry saying that the SAT is a useless test anyways that it just measures test taking abilities and that colleges are ditching it anyways because it's useless. I was like look mam, I don’t want to debate you on this.

She then just starts raising her voice more that I am just saying it because I don’t want her kid because he Black. I was like no I don’t care about race, and most of my students aren’t White anyways. It just makes her angry.

She then posts on Instagram about how I am a loser. That if I was so successful why am I teaching anyways…. And that my shit is overpriced. And the comments are agreeing with her, like what's the point of teaching if you are going to teach people that already know the stuff. Teaching is about helping those that don't know not ones that already know it.

I don’t know what to say to this. I would love to take more money but I owe to my students so we aren’t stuck going over algebra and stuff when going over Calculus. Like I don't think anyone would think twice that if I was teaching Spanish 3, I'd expect students to have done Spanish 2. Yet so many people are agreeing with her, wondering where I stand here. Also want to clarify, this family is WELL OFF, they have a big house in an expensive zipcode they have more money than most of the families I am teaching.

I am not sure what to do here. The families that I am teaching are happy that I have a high entry standard. But I am worried about my personal image and reputation from the nasty comments I have been getting.

I already tried posting this in r/teenagers but I just need as much help as i can get.

Right now Im in my fourth semester in university and corona really destroyed any hope i had.

I didnt have friends from my school days and the field that I studied wasnt social to begin with (I have no social life ). I have felt lonely in college before, when I had to study on weekends in a public library, only to take the train home at 23 PM and see people of my age having the time of their lives. The problem with corona is that even the part about socialising with strangers in a common learning environment is now completely gone. I have lost all of my motivation over the last 4 months and dont see a point in studying anymore. I ""study"" chem in a EU country so I dont have any debt to pay off but I am really desperate to just quit and start working somewhere just to talk to some new people again. 

The friends that I made in the first few months all quit out after 1 semester. :(

742,"...

At first I was very eager to meet my boyfriends family before I actually met them. I’m starting to wish I waited until much later into our relationship to meet them. For starters the first time I met my boyfriend’s mother, she was very… Unwelcoming. When she first met me instead of asking me how I was doing she jumped right into asking me what I do and where I work. I felt like I was at a Job interview. She was really giving me the third degree. I understand you want to know what kind of girl your son is with but it was too intense for it to have been the first five minutes of me meeting her. Things got even weirder when my boyfriend stepped out the room for a second and she made a comment about him being her “lil man” (his nickname when he was little. He is 23 years old now). She said this while staring me in my eyes. I was creeped out. Lol. 

Earlier in me and my boyfriends relationship, he would tell me that his aunt would tell him not to move out with me after he graduates from college in six months because “ The first thing they try to do is get pregnant”. This annoyed me because for one, she doesn’t know me and for two, I’m not like that at all. My boyfriend also told me about an incident with his previous girlfriend where his mom and aunt told him that he needs to “keep his options open” after meeting her because she didn’t look the way they wanted her to look.

After that I figured I would wait a few more months before I go back around his family and I did just that. It wasn’t until last November that I went back around his family and got to meet his two other aunties. His family was having a Christmas party and I decided to look nice since a lot of people would be there. Whenever I arrived, his mother told me I looked really pretty..but I could tell she was almost forcing herself to say that much. When jt was time to start eating, my boyfriend started fixing my plate and his mother looked at him and said “why are you fixing her plate? She can do it herself”. Strike two. That same night, we were watching tv and a young attractive woman came on the screen and his mother made it her business to say “yeah that is a pretty girl”. I mean she said it multiple times and one of his aunts turned around and said “just like (my boyfriends name) girlfriend”. His mother said nothing.

I also met his other aunt that night.. my bf refers to her as his “stuck up” auntie. And she is definitely that. She was nice to me at first but the entire night I noticed her looking me up and down from the corner of my eyes. It made me uncomfortable but I pretended like I didn’t notice.

. A few months ago, A rumor started in his family where my boyfriends uncle lied and told his mother that my boyfriend plan to run away in a loop with me. This sent her into a frenzy. She cried to him and told everybody in the family about it. She even had Her coworker call him to come over her house so that she could advise him not to marry me. She told him that he did not have to settle for anything and that if he needed help his family would help him. He had to defend me to all of his family. Because they really thought I was trying to trap him (for what..idk.) The funny thing about this whole situation was that it was all a lie. He wasn’t trying to run off and marry me.  He assured her that this was not the case and she has since then calm down. I still think about the situation from time to time because it was almost as if she was trying to convince hit her family to convince him that he needs to leave me.

Since then, his mother plays nice with me and tries to talk to me..but I can tell it’s not genuine. She tries to be nice to me but in the back of my mind, i always think about how she was when I first started meet her (about a year ago). There have been a few more incidents recently that have made me reconsider if I even want to be around his family anymore.

1. My boyfriend just graduated college last week. A few days before, his mother called and told me that they all planned to get a room at the same hotel for my boyfriend and his cousins graduation. I was taken aback when she recommended that I pay for the room and have his cousin stay in the room with us. My boyfriend would absolutely not let me do that but it kinda bothered me that she would even suggest that.
2. At the graduation, I decided to sit with his family because I had no one else to sit by. When I first met up with his family, I noticed that his aunt made a noise under her breath as soon as I walked up. I didn’t pay that much attention to it at the time but...no lie that entire day..I noticed his aunt looking me up and down. At this point, I’m annoyed because what are you even doing?
3. During my boyfriends graduation, his mother asked me if I loved him. I said of course and she laughed and said “you better love my son.” ???????????? What.

I try to treat his family nice and with the utmost respect, but I’m starting to feel like it’s time to stop being nice. This entire time, I’ve felt that his mother was intimidated by our relationship because my boyfriend is not close to her. He pretty much keeps her at arms length. I should’ve known when he was hesitant about me meeting her at the beginning that I should’ve waited until we were together for at least a year. I met her when we were 6 months in. I guess I really just want to know..have any of you had to go through situations similar to this and how did you handle it? I wanted to continue to take the high road but I don’t know if I can wait any much longer.",08Aug2020,1

744,"I have a very complicated situation going on with a friend right now. I’ve known this girl for quite awhile, and we are connected in a kind of weird way... we met because we dated the same boy. The story goes like this.

5th grade- I meet Boy.
7th grade- I start dating Boy.
8th grade- Boy cheats on me with Friend. Me and Friend aren’t friends yet at this point, but she knew Boy had a girlfriend and that girlfriend was me, so that still kinda sucks.
I’m one year older than Friend so idk what happened here. At some point they split but have an on/off thing.
11th grade- Boy and Friend get back together. Me and Friend have a class together. We become friends. We talk about Boy and my new boyfriend at the time. 
Over the summer Boy and Friend break up. Me and new boyfriend also break up. Me and Friend kind of drifted apart over the summer and didn’t really talk.
12th grade- I have an extremely short fling relationship with Boy at the beginning of the year. We were both rebounding. Boy cheats on me with another girl. 

After this, Friend texted me to check up on me. We started talking and she reveals to me that Boy was abusive to her and she was glad I was out of there. Friend has a new boyfriend at this point and introduces me to his best friend and I start dating the best friend. Everything seems pretty good. 

Then quarantine started and Friend reaches out to me a few times and I responded and we hung out. Then Friend stopped reaching out to me and stupidly I didn’t reach out to her either. I have a really bad habit of not reaching out to people. Finally I reached out to her and she wasn’t responding, so I tried again, asking if she was mad at me even thought I couldn’t think of anything that would’ve made her mad as not reaching out to people is normal for me. She said she felt like the friendship was one sided and was waiting for me to reach out to her. By the time I did, she felt like it was kind of too late. Then the big one. She says that in the time we weren’t talking, she was thinking about how I dated her ex. And she is really hurt by it. 

I understand why she is upset. I was truly a bad friend for dating her ex. But I’m also really confused. I already had a history with Boy, even before she did, and Me and Boy had both just gotten out of year-long relationships and liked the attention. Me and Friend hadn’t really been talking at that point, so it’s not really like I went behind her back and did it. I also didn’t know how Boy treated her until after Me and Boy’s fling. If Friend didn’t like that I dated him, why did she reach out to me when we broke up? I am really just so confused. I don’t understand why now, all these months after it actually happened, she is feeling mad at me. 

Again I acknowledge that it was selfish and mean for me to do. I was definitely only thinking of myself and not Friend when I got with Boy. But I think it is important to remember Me and Friend hadn’t really been talking at that point. Maybe a “hi” if we saw each other but that was it. And Friend and Boy had been broken up for a few months by that time. It just won’t really sit right with me if she ends our friendship over this, when we’ve already been friends through it. And now we’re putting a little bit of strain on our current boyfriends friendship. 

I just need some thoughts on this. Maybe I’m delusional and she really does have all the right to never forgive me. All I can really do at this point is apologize. We’ve been talking about it and we both know it was a mistake, and I don’t know how much more I can express to her that I never wanted to hurt her, I just really wasn’t thinking about anyone but myself. 

She said she needs some time to think about it and will get back to me on where she wants our friendship to go from here, if anywhere, but it’s really eating at me. I just want to know what other people think about the situation. Please be nice, I really do feel bad.",08Aug2020,1
745,"We're all girls and recent college grads if that matters. I went to high school with all of them.

They've all been playing DnD for over 2 years and I recently joined a ""rebooted"" campaign with them. It was my first time playing and I really disliked it. I wrote more about this in another post if you want to check my post history. But basically I just found it really boring and slow-paced. Which might be more the fault of the DM than DnD itself. I played a few more times to see if it would get better (it didn't). 

The last couple times they played (they play once a week), I made excuses for not being able to go. This week one of them asked me if Saturday would work. I felt guilty for flaking on them so I said yes. Now that they're playing tonight, I'm really dragging my feet about going. It's a boring 4+ hours. It's a long drive for me. They all prefer sitting on the floor (ouch) in the hosts' unfurnished apartment. I'm tired from work and want to be lazy and play video games or watch a movie.

The twins who always host also aren't the best hosts imo. Maybe it's entitled thinking, but I think hosts should always provide food, at least snacks. That's what I've always done and that's what my other friends do. But these twins just offer leftovers or nothing. 

When hanging out with these friends, they don't want to talk about their lives or anything interesting. They just want to play DnD. So there's no fun conversations.

So I should probably stop going if I'm not having fun. But they *only* hang out to play DnD. I tried planning a hike but plans fell through. I also have no idea how to phrase that I don't enjoy the game. I don't want to offend the group, especially the DM. I could really use some help on how to handle this situation.

My gf is very quick with everything. If it were up to my gf, we would probably have married after the first six months. Im quite the opposite. I take a long time to make big steps. Maybe too long, but I feel like thats my business. But at the same time, thats part of the issue. Here is probably all you need to know: We are in a relationship for about 2 years now. Im in my mid 20s. Our relationship has been bumpy at times, partly because of the pushing.

When it was about saing the magical three words, my gf did it way before me and criticised me for not being able to say it yet. I did say it at some point, and I did mean it when I said it. Now I say it every day and all is cool.

On sex, we were on the same page because Im a horny little bastard. As is she. Big plus. Same level of horny.

When it was about going on holiday together, she pushed it. We went and it was nice. Although it did feel forced. (We split the bill, she is not a gold digger, dont worry about that. I can say that 100%)

When it was about moving in together, my gf pushed me again. I reluctantly said that I would and did, although I cant say that I feel very comfortable about this still. Has been a few months now.

She is currently pushing me to get a dog together and she wants a big one. I dont like dogs much. I mean, I like playing with them and every doggo is a good boy, i get it, but I dont want to have to care for one and have one beside me 24/7 (yeah, you can hate me for that, I stand by it).

Now, she does a lot of pushing and tells me that its basically her right to be upsed with me when I ""move too slow"", because it is hurtful towards her. I feel like Im an asshole if I dont give in at some point, because that would make me an asshole and I would be actively hurting her. Pushing me, however, is not, because what she wants is ""normal"" and Im not ""normal"" for not wanting it even earlier than her.   
Now, saying I love you, going on vacation, maybe even buying a car and things like that are not so serious. However, moving in together and getting a pet is a big deal for me. If I were to get one of those shedding four legged creatures, I know I would fall in love with it immediately, but I dont know if I want that right now, as I have other responsibilities. Also, she is dropping hints about marriage, so yeah. When we talked about that, she was like ""we dont have to hurry with that, dont worry"", but given her usual self when it comes to these things, its only a matter of time before this becomes a regular argument: ""So yeah, no pressure \~\_\~"". 

It feels like im under pressure for not going quicker. Whats even worse, and this makes me feel even more like shit: Whenever I give in to something, she gives me all this talk about ""she has to force everything in the relationship"", ""in dont take any steps myself"", ""im not serious enough about our relationship"", ""im a dick for putting her in the position of pushing me"" and all of that good stuff. She also gives me shit about the stuff i DID give into. ""You are an ass because I was the one pushing for our vacation and you are giving me all the responsibility in this relationship with everything while lean back and make me do all the heavy lifting"".

It has gotten to the point where I dont know anymore if I do stuff, because she is expecting me to, or if I do stuff, because I want to. I dont know if Im too slow or if she is too fast. I dont know if Im too hard headed or she is too pushy. My fear goes both ways:

I am scared that Im too slow and might jeapordise our relationship because of my unwillingness to make these decisions that I am not yet ready for. That Im moving to slow, letting life run past me and being the problem in the relationship.

I am scared that Im letting myself get pushed into a life that I dont want and that I will regret, making many irreversible mistakes along the way.

I feel like I dont know my own thoughts and desires anymore. Need help, what should I do?

I have talked to her about this a lot and it always came down to ""Well, you are right, I cant and shouldnt push you, but I will and you are kind of a wimp and asshole for not going even quicker than my ridiculous pase"", but with nicer words. So that seems like a dead end. I cant really talk to my friends and family about it, because there are not many people there to begin with and they are kind of biased one way or the other. (Most would either want us to split or to get married. E.g. Mother wants grand children asap and also pushes me, most friends mutual).

Now, I want you to keep in mind. This is MY version of the story. Please try to look at it from her view too. I dont want an answer that ""pleases me"", I want the ""right"" answer. If thats even a possibility. Thanks in advance.",08Aug2020,1
748,"I’m sorry for the formatting, I’m relatively new to reddit, and English is not my first language (throwaway account). TLDR at bottom. I am also sorry for the long post I am super stressed. I (20M) feel extremely guilty for masterbating to a photo/video (non-nude) of another woman (call her “X”) while I’m in a relationship with my gf (20F). This happened a couple weeks ago and I’ve been feeling super depressed.  

X is someone that used to visit a school I went to. I’ve only ever seen X a couple times in my entire life in the halls of that school. That being said, I have never been friends with X and I never hung out with X. I don’t follow X on any social media and I am not in contact with this person (never have been in contact with this person except one small text conversation that happened 6 years ago which consisted basically of “who are you” and resulted in me blocking X) and the last time I saw X was 2+ years ago before I left that school and I doubt I’ll ever see X again. 

All that being said, since the incident I’ve been super guilty and I am not sure what to do. I have been crying and upset as I feel that I cheated on my gf. I truly love my gf and the fact that I did something that would upset her breaks my heart. This is not the first time I masterbated to X as I done it in the past before the start of my relationship. I did the deed not realizing that my actions could be perceived as unfaithfulness when it meant nothing than just masterbation to me. I spoke to a couple friends of mine and they told me that I am over reacting and that it’s not a big deal and that I should forget about it and not do it again if it makes me feel this way. I swore to myself that I’d never repeat such actions because it is disrespectful to my gf. But I can’t shake the feeling that I was unfaithful to her. I’m not sure what to do, how do I move past this feeling.

tl;dr: masterbated to a photo of someone who I saw a couple of times (never spoke to) in my old school. Cant shake the feeling I was unfaithful to my gf. I’m not sure how to move past this problem.",08Aug2020,1
749,"This guy who’s my friend of 3 years is mad at me because according to him I say stuff that is not true/he didn’t say he said I always make shit up when someone doesn’t say something. 


See now I don’t do that, what I feel like he’s talking about is on snap when someone asked me if he liked me I said no he doesn’t like me and I also said I’m not his type. 


We had this arggument yesterday and now he’s not talking to me or replying back anymore. What I don’t get is  why does he care if I say that and I mean it’s true it’s not like he does like me or whatever because when I told him I liked him like last year he said he’s only looking for friends or something like that.

750,"*this is going to be written poorly i apologize*
A few weeks back, on one of those blurry drunken nights I confessed my feelings to them. They told me that they felt the same way, but they told me that i dont know what love really is, because its obvious i don't love myself (self love advise is also welcome, im trying but its not easy). Since that night things have been really strange and they seem to be avoiding me. Last night, however, we went to bed together for the first time in a long time. Shortly after, they left without saying anything. We are housemates, so i know they will be back, im just very confused. Im not sure how to react. Haha. Any advice would be really great? I dont even know what I'm asking for really?
*Little back story* I dont trust many people to me bed, I've had some really awful childhood experiences. These feelings are really new and just dang confusing. We have had some weird intimate nights in the past, but we've talked about it and we are not going to mess around anymore. For the safety our friendship... but this hiccup",08Aug2020,1

753,"I don't know where to start. Long story short, I was dating/engaged to a woman that had a daughter. I was in this kids life for two and a half years, every single day. I raised this kid from the age of two and a half until she was almost five and a half years old. When I say raised, I mean her dad wasn't in the picture besides about one day every month. So she lived with me and all of that. So in my eyes and hers she was my daughter and I was her dad, she called me dad. I was in her life every single day for two and a half years straight. Taught her how to talk, write, all of that. She was my entire life baaically. Point is, after all of that one day her mom sent her to her dad's and unexpectedly out of nowhere left me for no reason whatsoever and still can't give me one. Worst part is I just never got to see my stepdaughter again, no sort of closure, no warning signs and no chance. It's been a few months since me and my fiancee split up and all she has done is use her kid as a pawn in arguments and to get her way, but not once have I gotten even a phone call with that kid. Idk, I just thought the more time that went by it would get easier, but nope, it's just getting harder. I get that it's her kid, I have no rights, but to me and to that kid I was her dad. Going from seeing her every single day all day to just nothing is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. Idk what the fuck to do, I just feel stuck and it's all I can think about. And the worst thing is, every time I try to talk to anyone about it they all just say ""well, she wasn't really yours so blah blah blah."" I feel like killing myself every single day.

757,"Hi, so, I have this very close friend who has helped me through a lot and I love them very very much. Since last september they really changed a bit, and it wasn't that bad in the beginning. Now  since January, All I have received from them are critiques. Shd constantly puts me down for jo reasong, whether it be my appearance, character or something I did. It really hurts, especially since they KNOW that I have struggled with self esteem and anxiety. In the last few months they have started critiquing my body, which really really hit me.. after keeping quiet for some time, I finally spoke up. They accused me of lowering their self esteem and telling them a lot of awful things about their appearance (note, I have NEVER in my life, purposely offended or lowered someone's self esteem. I always try to get it up and always help people who struggle with it, cause I have once struggled with it and now it's very very good, and plus they told our other friend that I said that, not md directly). I confronted them after that and they admitted that they PURPOSELY critique things I like about myself and are confident about to lower my self esteem, cause my higher self esteem is lowering their! I was shocked! I couldn't believe what one of my closest friends said! Later, our other friend told me all the awful things they have said about my body and face, everything that I was satisfied with they said it was ugly, bad, or that their's was better. They say awful things about my makeup and clothes as well. They apologized and stopped for now. One thing to note is that they always (when they are with me) tell me how they feel ugly, and average,  and are unsatisfied with this and that, and I always make them feel better. I still can't believe that they were PURPOSELY lowering it just to make themselves feel better..... what should I do from now..?

759,"I have to type this quickly before they take my phone so sry for grama and other shit. So house we live in is absolutely trashed and noone do shit and everything wrong happens, I get blamed. My brother doesn't clean his part of house? I get punished. Mom kick in table and breaks mug? I get screamed at. I always go my part of chores at morning so I can rest while my brother always plays games and just do anything except his chores whole day and I get screamed at cuz why am I resting while house is dirty. It's his part but I get screamed at. I could take it for 18 years but now I really just can't. If she screams for longer than half hour I start screaming back idk why and I can't help it. I could bare if she screamed for something that is in my power and I could do something about it but if it's something absolutely out if my control that's extremely traumatizing. Now she is mad I don't obey her and mom and dad now are against me and want to cancel my school and kick me out of house (they want to cancel my school so they don't have to pay me 30% of their pay cuz I wouldnt be coinsidered as self-sufficient when I'm student) but I would be left with just middle school,jobless (cuz I'm working as student and if I'm not student they can't keep me) and homeless so my life would be fucked.

Update: So me and my brother got list of things we have to complete in 24 hours and if we both don't complete them I get kicked out. Is this some kinda fucked up experiment or what the hell? Do they think I'm some labrat or what? Now brother, lazy as he is, don't give shit and threw away that list (I already done mine). Is this even legal? Is this common? Dahell is wrong with them?

760,"I’m 19F. I have psychiatric issues and they keep getting worse. I was in an abusive household and things were weird there. I would go through what my parents called “conditioning” where they tried to get me used to touch but I know I don’t remember all of it. My mom acted inappropriate towards me and really creepy and clingy in general. There’s so much aggression and anger in my family and I don’t know if all of my aggression is just from being in the abusive household, as I showed signs of self harm and depression at a really early age. Plus I tortured things as well when I was little and that stuck for awhile until I got older and new better (inanimate objects that looked like animals and people that’s all I know). But my mother used to lecture me and my sibling about how depression wasn’t real, or at least wasn’t inherited, meanwhile it turned out it ran in the family. 

Additionally I don’t remember everything I do. I see lines and patterns and they can get worse. I have fits of rage that are getting worse to the point where I feel like I’m just watching myself. I know I was allowed to inhale chemicals as a kid and I don’t know what else happened. I know I used to get sick a lot but the times I stopped eating from the house I stopped getting sick and now I’m fine and have been fine. Additionally I’ve had medicine I wasn’t supposed to strongly suggested by my mom a few years back and ended up vomiting some blood and she refused to take me to the doctor. She also blamed me for certain things that weren’t my fault and claims others didn’t want me, as well as manipulating everyone in the household. My dad went along with it but I think he’s just a follower. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m slipping, and when that happens and I feel like I need to harm something or break something I end up taking it out on myself. And about a month ago I did that as a split decision (there were animals in the room at the time and I panicked because I didn’t want to hurt them) and ended up banging my head to the point where I fell. After that I got up and still felt rage and just cried for help. My dad said I was extreme disoriented (he saw me after I fell) and I know I’ve been disoriented from whatever emotional thing happens like this before and maybe this was a repeat. And it’s weird because I don’t always feel my emotions in full, but when I get like this I end up feeling a lot or at least feel the need to act automatically. I ended up going to the hospital and they were monitoring me consistently. 

I read the reports they did on me and what I said wasn’t written down. This happens a lot with my psych evaluations and the first time I remember going my parents lied, and convinced me basically my whole life up until a point that symptoms I had were normal and didn’t exist as symptoms. Additionally, ACS has been to the house multiple times for reports even as bad as giving me and my sister too much drugs and sexual abuse, but no charges and we were never taken out of the house. I’ve been told what happened was discipline but it was far worse and I have proof of what my mother said but ACS doesn’t seem to care because our neighborhood has a lower crime rate so they think that it can be worked out ourselves. Then one time a worker said he would send a referral sheet and he never did. And the first time ACS came where we were getting help, the therapist working with us ghosted us. But she’s alive and her practice still exists. I can’t contact ACS again because my sister called to them and lied so I’m sure they won’t take us seriously even more. 

Basically anyone who helps us or says they are gets information wrong or turns me away (for some reason not my other family as far as I know except that one lady). I’ve been shut out of doctors visits because of an apparent mix up. Whenever I try to schedule it gets postponed or something happens, or I go and the doctors don’t believe that my family did such things or that I can’t be the way I am because “my grades were good in high school” because apparently years later that’s what matters as far as saying your symptoms don’t exist, because you had good high school grades. I’ve broken things, hurt myself, and nearly hurt others. I don’t always feel like I’m in control. I’ve been better recently but things still come up and I was told by the hospital to schedule an appointment but there’s apparently problems now and I’m told to call them then I do but they tell me they need to get someone else and never get back to me. Also they’re calling my parents, something I specifically asked them not to do, and my parents are now somehow partially in charge of this even though I asked this to be handled between me and my grandmother if anyone other than me needs to handle things. 

Is there any way I can get help without giving my insurance, maybe online, any name of practice in particular so I can be sure none of them have connections with my parents? I have no choice right now but to be part of my parents insurance, and after the hospital visit I seem to be treated less competently and I don’t knew how much of a day I have in anything (even when I asked the doctors to take things up with another adult if not me but that doesn’t seem to be working). Is there any place that will do a full diagnosis and any necessary tests/blood work without telling my parents anything and where I don’t need to give insurance? Or is there anything I can sign up for as a sort of replacement insurance for the time being since I can’t get out of my parents? And is there any suggestions on how far out of the way if I have to give my insurance but need to ensure that no one is in contact with my parents?",08Aug2020,1

762,"Tldr; I know my friend would not provide the same care and attention to the sweetest cat. I want to keep the cat because we've bonded and Idk what to do because he wants him back.

For the past 3-4 months I have been taking care of my friend's cat whilst he goes home during the lockdown. Its been a very lovely time taking care of this cat and I spent a lot of time caring for him, gaining his trust... and it shows because for as long as Ive seen my friend with the cat, he has never showed him the love he does for me. He follows me around, sleeps near me whenever he can (not really a lap cat), and comes up to me to head butt me and jst is my shadow. On the other hand, he has never showed this behavior to my friend, so much so that before I had taken over, he wanted to give this cat away for another one because he thinks the cat doesn't love him etc etc (RED FLAG). Funnily enough, by now I would have had the cat longer than he has had him. I have really taken to the cat and really don't want to give him back. 

The cat has a bit of a medical issue, diarrhoea of an unknown cause, and as a result he needs to be fed a special diet and special diets are a lot more expensive than normal ones. I am not slamming anyone for not having money, that is your business. But my friend always brags about how much money he has etc etc and it seems surreal to me that he can't just buy the good food for the cat's health, because that's what I would do, that's what any responsible cat owner should do. Ironically, he spends more than the cost of a month's worth of really proper healthy cat food on weed. I mean, you do you, but please don't neglect this cat's health just so you can indulge yourself. In front of me, he bought £120 worth of weed, and to me he also said that buying cat food that's £30 for a month's worth is too expensive. I am baffled. 

What more can I do. I want to steal the cat. He's taking the cat back in less than a week. I don't want to return him. I don't want the cat to suffer and not be properly taken care of. I know the cat is happy here. Idk what to do. Please someone give me advice or reassurance.",08Aug2020,1

766,"I’m going to put in some information about the kids first, and I would like to say everything I am saying below is as straight as I can be about the situation, not speaking out of opinion. 

This nephew, we’ll call him Sam (7M), is my older sisters (26F) son. My sister is a current heroin addict and has not had contact with him in some time now, so Sam stays with his father mostly and we get him a couple days every week or two as we are able and as his father lets us. His father and him live in a single wide trailer with over 8 total people (including 5 small children) and several large dogs. It’s filthy, the dad smokes pot in front of the kids, watches anything in front of them and plays very graphic games, he has dropped him off with us in filthy clothes with no shoes and no clothes for the time we’ll have him. We purchased his school supplies, most of his clothes, and most of his toys that he has. We love him very much and always have. He was the first child had out of all my siblings and I and the first boy born in the family in generations. My sister is very sick and that is a whole other story, but the point is we care very deeply for him and worry about how he lives at his fathers house. His father has severe anger issues and will stop letting us see Sam for long periods of time now that we have no way to see him unless he lets us at the drop of a dime. We also know that Sam is not disciplined at all and is even bullied by the bigger children living in the trailer with his dad, as we found him hiding things under his pillow when he would stay with us saying it was so no one would take them. So whenever we discipline him if he misbehaves he doesn’t want to come back over here for some time. And Sam misbehaves a LOT, not just little things either, we took him swimming once and he was shoving his little cousins head under the water and laughing, he’ll kill small animals like frogs and lizards and thinks it’s funny, he’ll punch other kids. His father has not only exposed him to this kind of behavior, but encourages it now that my sister, Sams mother is no longer involved. He is also very far behind in school due to his father not encouraging it and drilling it in his head that school is boring and awful. He is 7 and can not read, he just learned the alphabet, and gets confused counting above 10. This is very important to the story. 

My niece, we’ll call her Sara (6F), is a DIFFERENT older sisters (29F) daughter, so Sara and Sam are cousins. This sister homeschools her kids, owns a business, and is doing fine overall. Her kids are very sweet and caring and listen well. They are also very sheltered as my sister is a very passionate Christian and does not even allow her children to be exposed to swear words, alcohol, nudity, etc. Her children are very easily frightened and very emotionally vulnerable since they have been so heavily protected. 

Yesterday, my sister (29) had Sam over to her house. She was in the kitchen and all of the children were next to her in the living room, no wall, just a table separating them. They were in full view. Sara walks over to her and very sheepishly says “Sam tried to kiss me on the lips a lot.” My sister stayed calm and had her husband very sternly talk to him and spanked him. Sam wanted to go home to his dad and started yelling for us to call him. She decided to have him stay with our mom that night. 

So. Here is where we are stuck. We very much love Sam. He does not have his mother and he doesn’t understand why or where she is, mind you she didn’t get bad and stop seeing him until he was 5 and then a time or two when he was 6, so he remembers her fully. He lives in this awful filthy house (we have all been inside when picking up or dropping off Sam. Dog shit &amp; piss all on the floor, windows all shut at 4pm with no lights on in the house and the kids in the dark, filthy clothes everywhere, diapers, it brings me to tears knowing Sam has to live there) and we have tried to look into CPS and we were told flat out unless they are doing drugs while an officer is present or they’re beating Sam we cannot have him taken out of that house since that is his only active parent. We know the dad, he was with our sister, Sams mother, for 4 years. If we were to sit him down and tell him what his son did to Sara, he’d laugh it off and say “oh boys will be boys” or be like “oh yeah that’s my boy a ladies man already” and if my sister, Sara’s mother, or her husband hear that they just might kill him. If we try and make it serious and say that Sam needs more discipline in his home he will take offense and stop letting us see Sam. This will leave him with that awful hellhole as his only home being picked on by the bigger kids and not getting to have anything of his own. 

 I don’t know what we should do. I am about to have to go back to college (specific program, can’t be online) and won’t be around. Sara’s mom is fully willing to become the full time caretaker of Sam if she could. All we want is for Sam to be in a safe environment where he doesn’t have to hide things under his pillow so they won’t be taken and will also be taught right from wrong and not be exposed to things children shouldn’t be like excessive drugs and violence.

I've found one major problem is data structures and algorithms problems. Being frontend, I really don't work with any complex DSA problems on a day-to-day basis. I might have to do some basic things, but rarely will I ever get a question like ""find the path through this maze"". I can tell you which algorithm you *should* use and vaguely explain how it works, but in the matter of an hour, implementing it seems near impossible to me.

I've been doing problems on leetcode recently to compensate and it just has made me continuously feel like an absolute idiot. Like half the days I think ""maybe it's time to just quit"". I look up videos explaining it and they have these incredible solutions that make me wonder ""wait, am I supposed to come up with that *in 40 minutes?*"". When I looked up videos on it, they were 20-40 minutes long to explain the solution, for questions classified as **EASY.** Facebook specifies you have to more or less complete three of these questions in an hour to even be considered for the possibility of coming onsite. The only ways I can see to make this work is either to memorize every question or to completely learn an entirely new skillset

Now here's why I am very confused about this whole thing. **All** of my previous coworkers at all levels have left me extremely strong recommendations. My current job has said I am doing fantastically. I've really never had complaints on the job. It feels like there's a strange separation.

I've come to a point where I've wondered if it's time to quite and try to find something else I can do, or if I am doing something so fundamentally wrong that should be obvious to me

what should I do?",08Aug2020,1
769,"I need so much help! Just turned 18!

Might be long but please please bear with me. I need advice. I just turned 18 at the end of april. From age 16-18 I didn’t work very much because I played varsity sports the whole time (per my parents request). I started working again early march but then couldn’t work because my parents didn’t want me to because they’re high risk. I said okay that’s fine. Then comes my birthday. My parents asked me for rent money. $300 a month, $75 a week. THAT IS CRAZY. I haven’t been able to work because of them and now they want rent money. Flash forward to 4 weeks ago. They let me get a job but am only working 11-15 hours a week at 8.55. Now say I work the max 15 hours a week. That’s around $400 after tax I keep a month. Leaving me with only $100 after rent. I can’t move out because I have no car (i have my license so I just need to buy one) and no credit or big enough income to even look at apartments. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. If I can somehow manage to get a car, my plan is to sleep in that and then have a gym membership so I can shower there and then get a job that has free meals. Would that work? Is that a smart idea?

773,"Hi Everyone-

So I’m a Political Science/Public Policy student in college who hopes to pursue a Doctorate in Public Policy. I am really passionate about government, and am pretty good at what I do: I ran social media for a state level campaign, created my own political group in my hometown, worked with multiple nonprofits to write and lobby for bills, and ran voter registration at my school. I know that I love it, and that it’s what i want to do with my life. 

The only problem is my social anxiety. I have a stutter when I talk in front of people that has gotten worse over the years, can’t look people in the eyes, get anxious, sometimes to my breaking point, in big groups debating, and struggle with coming up with my points when I’m in debate even when I know the information. I know my shit, but all the time, I’m in situations where it seems like I don’t. 

I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I can’t pursue my dreams because of my social anxiety, which is a shame because I love this field and am generally pretty good at it. I just can’t be shaking in fear whenever I have to work, and I don’t want it to get worse. What should i do?",08Aug2020,1

778,"Hi everyone, I [21F] am planning to finish my bachelor’s in psychology in 2021 (I am hoping to graduate in the spring but I may have to take my last couple of classes over the summer). 

I know that psychology is one of those fields where you need to go to grad school to do most things. I’m hoping to go to grad school down the road but I really want to work for a few years before I go to grad school because 1) I’m really burnt out on school and I just need a break, and 2) I’m currently living with my parents and I want to get on my feet financially before I go to grad school. 

I really have no idea what I want to do with my life. My goal is just to find a job I don’t hate and then see where life takes me. I’m thinking of trying to find some kind of medical job that doesn’t require a medical degree but would pay enough to make ends meet. For example, my mom knows someone who is an x-ray tech, and she said it took her about a year to finish training and now she makes about $50,000 a year. I think something like that would be good for me to do for a few years while I get on my feet and figure out what I want to do, but I’m by no means set on it and open to other ideas.

I guess my question is, does anyone have any ideas of jobs that might work well for my situation? I’m looking for something with decent pay that isn’t miserable and could give me an idea of what the working world is like, since I’ve never had “real” job (all I’ve done is babysit and work fast food).",08Aug2020,1

She had gotten my account deleted and stolen my robux. I was gonna message her, then I found out she blocked me on all my socials.  She ignored me at school for several months, and I gave up on trying to talk to her.

783,"I know there's probably not any black or white answer for this, and that's why I'm struggling with it.

Backstory (Optional)

Me and my girlfriend have struggled with dog issues since our entire relationship. Other than this, she's been the best romantic partner I've had in my life. I'd planned to get a large dog and she'd accepted this since before we dated, but she was involved in a dog attack. Since then it's been back and forth - I don't want to cause her unnecessary hurt or trauma because what happened wasn't her fault, but I also felt like my life wouldn't be complete (getting a house and a dog was my dream). 

Ultimately, we reached a decision the last week. I accepted that maybe I'm not actually physically active enough to have a large high-energy dog (I work from home on a commission basis). Of course, months ago I would've sworn up and down that I was willing to give three hour walks every day, but I finally became truthful with myself. I realized that what I really wanted was just a lap pet. She had told me previously that a small dog would be the only compromise that she would make for the sake of her own health, and so we brought it up again.

Current Situation

We looked at a few breeds closest to what we would consider and my girlfriend laid out the ground rules. Well we are talking about it, I let it slip that I thought we would easily be able to find a dog at local shelter. She quickly corrected me that the final stipulation that I had was that I needed to get a purebred because she wanted a puppy - No one year dogs, no adult dogs.

Would it be a dick move if I asked her to pay for some of all of the breeder's cost? I know it's my dog but I never needed for it to be purebred or a puppy, that's just an extra cost on me. A non-puppy mill option for some of these particular small breeds (Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Maltese, etc) can be well up to $1,500.",08Aug2020,1

I've been masturbating for longer than I can remember, and I guess because of the parental blocks my parents placed on my computer as a kid I ended up on less savory porn websites. I eventually found my way to hentai, which in itself isn't bad, but has a lot of, sometimes not so subtle, pedo undertones. And I straight up know how to find toddler hentai now. I hate myself for it. I don't know who to go to, I don't know how to get help. I'm afraid of myself.

786,"Some background. I talk to my 3 person friend group every day. Lets call friend 1 Bob, and friend 2 Mark. Me, bob, and mark play video games, like every day. Also, we face time when we play, and i admit, we swear a lot. The whole friend group is very aware that Mark’s parents are Italian, and really strict and also do not like video games or swearing. Often, Mark sneaks in an extra bit of video games and swears when his parents aren’t near him, and sometimes, he gets caught and gets yelled at, and me and Bob both agree thats normal enough. More often than not, his parents think he is swearing, but he really isnt, and he gets grounded unfairly. (He isnt a crybaby, and rarely cries, except the moment before he leaves the call when he is getting brutally yelled at by his dad.) Another note. I dont know if bob notices, but whenever Mark’s dad gets in trouble, he ALWAYS asks if he is on a call with his friends, and asks him to mute it if he is, even though mark doesn’t.
Now to the story. (This morning)

We are all playing video games, until noon, when bob gets off to watch soccer. That leaves me and mark, who play video games for about half an hour until this. 
We are in the middle of a Warzone game, and me and Mark get killed, sending us back to the lobby. He says exactly: “Holy Fricking God!!” He doesnt even say the f word, but maybe his dad got sensitive to saying God’s name in vain. His dad comes walking towards Mark, and i can hear this entire conversation:

His dad: Excuse me Mark?
Mark: Oh, Hey dad. Whats up?
His dad: I heard what you said. Mind explaining that? 
Mark: I- i just died in the video game, im playing with OP! 
His dad: Are you on a call with him? 
Mark: No. (He is lying about this.)
His dad: (yelling) WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT SWEARING?!
Mark: I-

His dad: Listen closely. This is your last warning. Swear again, (i kid you not, he said these words) and RUN. If i catch you swearing, RUN.

At this point, i have to mute my mic because this is the type of stuff i hear in horror movies and im getting chills.

So i started to record, and the part i caught, was “if i ever hear that again, i swear to god, you will regret it. Do you understand that?” And then i hear my friend whimpering and starting to sob, and then he ends the call. He hasnt been online since then. I have been sort of shook and ive been contemplating what to do. My parents are really supportive, so they would help, but they wont just do nothing about it if i tell them, so im worried i could get in trouble if Marks parents get in trouble and mark gets mad at me. Also, what if im wrong? I would be really embarrassed and i just have no idea what to do. Please, im begging, help me reddit.

787,"I try to be good and selfless. But when someone does something negative to me, even if just accidentally, I deal with it really badly. Yesterday, I made plans with my friend for today and when I asked her when and where will we meet, she replied with ""oh shit, I thought we were talking about next week"". This happened even though I clearly said ""what should we do tomorrow?"" etc.

The day before that, my other friend canceled our plans because she was sick so it made today that much worse. I don't have a job or anything like that and I have depression so I don't deal too well with suddenly being left alone.

But the issue is the following: I got mad at her and she knew it, and I kept being an ass. Even after we settled it, I kept making these tiny comments in group chats that seem normal to others, but my friend has to notice them (something along the lines ""well, my plans got canceled so what we doing today?""). Basic passive aggression to make her feel as guilty as possible.

I never know whats its apropriate to talk to them about. Is it literally whatever is bothering me? Or is there a line that I shouldnt cross? 

Sometimes I have wet dreams/nocturnal emissions and wake up with a sticky bed. And HAVE to wash it as soon as I am able to. Hasnt happened for a while thankfully, but theres all new staff now that dont know that I sometimes have that issue. 

If i just tell them i had an accident they will presume i wet myself. Which i dont want them to think because its not true, I dont want to give false information. 

So do I just tell them when/if it happens again? Tell them exactly why I need a bedding wash ASAP. Or do I talk to them about it anyway, so they know before it/if it happens? Like a sort of pre wanring that it can happen sometimes?

My first job was brought on by my parents at 15 because they forced me to go to a fast food restaurant and tell them that they were to pay me $9hr. The manager laughed in my face and said he didn't even make that. I didn't know though because my parents literally said ok you're doing this. When I finally got that job my highschool bully came in with her girl friends and laughed at me in my face. While taking photos of me working. I also was failing all of my classes because of this job only 2 months into working there.

Another experience was working at a small business my boss let teenagers boss me around and they ganged up on me. They made me look like the bad guy to my boss for things I didn't do. And the last was my emotionally abusive uncle who I worked for a year with. He would make sure to sit me down everyday and tell me how much of a failure I was at my life. If I cleaned something it was always wrong, if he asked me to organize something and I did I got yelled at for organizing. He would tell me he didn't say to do that. 

This wasn't just with me either, he did it to my dad too. Even though my dad was like hey...I'm not crazy let me record him asking me to do something. So one day he did. My dad recorded my uncle telling him to do something. My dad did it, and my uncle got upset with him and told him the recording was a lie. 

I start to disassociate and have a panic attack whenever work comes up or if I'm looking for a job. I really want to change my perspective with it because I'm tired of being fearful everytime I want to do a DoorDash order. I'm tired of being fearful. There's way more bad things that have happened and this isn't the only reason why I have anxiety. I just didn't want to make the post too long.",08Aug2020,1
803,"Greetings. I have a friend online , that I have been talking for 6 years. In those last 2 years we have started to drift apart and fighting sometimes, all due to the fact she doesn’t care about me.


Some information about this friendship. We were friends that found each other online in minecraft. One month later she found a new Minecraft friend, let’s call him John. Me, her and John played nearly all day long and chatted, I admit I had a crush on her but turns out John asked her to be his gf and they agreed since they live so close ( about 4 hours away lol). In the span of the 1.8 years the relationship has lasted, she slowly started brushing me off and even John noted it. I had and still have no ill intentions towards John since he put in the effort to include me always. Anyways , we were still good friends with the girl. One day John left the group and the girl revealed to me he “cheated” ( not really , he just started talking to a girl and nothing ever came out of it), and that he wanted to brake up. She was heart broken and pretended to cut herself and be depressed ( yea , I have no proof but I’m the shoulder she cried on and I can tell she probably lied ) months later I talked with John and revealed he didn’t really care and told me how shit she treated him, ignoring him at times , him having to start the convo all the times , her showing disinterest. Etc ( all Shit she did to me). After she cried to me a lot about it and refused to ever talk about anyone than herself we kinda stopped talking to each other , 6 months later we pick it up and play like 1/15 of what we usually played. I had to do the same shit John did and start the conversation , she kept leaving me on read, ignoring me and saying “her phone run out of battery “ even though on the old Instagram you could see she kept liking posts.

I admit , I wasn’t very good at starting conversations and when we started fighting that’s the first thing she brought up, like how I asked constantly how the whether was to start the convo, I explained to her how I was only asking since I’m interested in one day migrating to her country for studies. I have tried to make the conversations about her , asking how she was, what she did today , any plans, what she thought of topics we liked , what she would do in a situation.

999/1000 times I always had to start the convo. No matter how much I replied she always, and I mean always replied with “nm,dd?”, dd means wbu?

She wouldn’t try at all, so when I mentioned this when we fought she says it’s not her fault she has irl friends like that has to do with anything , long story short , we talked again a couple of months later in an awkward face time call and agreed to be friends again. 

I admit she started trying again but you could tell she want actually infested , this would go on where I would ask her something , she’d answer , And I’d reply with another message and she would always reply 6 hours later, so I stopped really caring, she turned lesbian and said she hated men, dated someone , became their gf, she cheated on her and she cried to me again. Got drunk and made out with a guy friend and acted like she said “ like a total whore”, found another girl who cheated on her , then another guy became her bf and then she refused to talk about him saying they are over.

Long story short , she became a total mess. I only became a shoulder to cry on , and she would always leave me on read , so there’s periods of 8 months we wouldn’t talk each other , because I would respond , she would leave me on read , then respond , then she leaves me on read , the next day I would do the exact same thing and she would leave me one read so I reused to talk to her for a months and then she would send my a snap on how she misses me and why we don’t talk.


It’s been 6 years and I tried a lot, she totally changed as a person and I really do feel like I grew up with this person and she stopped caring. With her and her bf we used to talk about a lot of things and even 10k messages a day. Now it’s like 3 snaps a month and like 20 texts a month if I’m lucky. She treats me like shit so cue rn she apparently 


Messaged that she got cheated on and found out but she still loves her (??) and she doesn’t know what to do and she is sobbing 

I said really ? What happened 

And left her at that

I really don’t wanna converse with her shitty love life just so she can use me as a pawn to talk to her, because I really missed when she actually cared about me. I have studied a lot on how to talk to people or continue a convo to the point I really don’t think it’s me. We used to be so close and now she makes some light flat responses and questions and then leaves me on read

804,"I am (was? Idk at this point) part of a large friendship group of around 15 people (we all had our groups of close friends but we all sorta hung out together occasionally + at school) I only regularly communicate with 3 of them. 

One of them (16nonbinary) hasn’t spoken to me since the very start of my countries quarentine (March). They have never very talkative before so I just assumed they went into their shell. 

One of them (17F) hasn’t spoken to me for the past two months. I’ve found out from my parents seeing her parents Facebook that her step-dad was put in hospital last week (obviously, I understand that she might not want to talk then, but he hasn’t been there for two months) and that she has a boyfriend now. I didn’t know any of this. 

The third and final one(17M), was talking to me and taking around three days to respond to each message, and my last message has been sitting un opened since the of july now. I tried messaging in a groupchat a few days ago and had no response. 

Oh I don’t know if I mentioned but I am 17F. 

The final person I have to talk to regularly is my own girlfriend. She’s been the only one here for me and is an absolute life saver. But she goes to a different school to me, and I don’t feel her friendship group would appreciate me joining. She also can’t speak to me too often because she has a regular job + is often busy or asleep. 

So... I’ve obviously been feeling lonely as fuck. I wanted to make online friends, but last time someone in my family did that my parents freaked out and took their phone away for a month... so that’s not an option. 

I told my parentsthat my friends were no longer speaking to me and I didn’t know why.They told me i was exaggerating and overreacting, but I’ve tried texting, asking to FaceTime or call, but I don’t get any responses. But I feel constantly alone. My parents are work-devoted and my sisters don’t like me, and my brother moved out with his girlfriend. One of my sisters and my dad are also homophobic so me being an out lesbian really doesn’t help with anything...

I’ve turned to just spending time with my cats. But they don’t really fulfil my social need. I don’t know where I can find new friends. A lot of the people in my area think I’m a bit odd already because I’m not a native to the country I live in.

Luckily travel within my country is allowed, so me and my girlfriend are going to visit her families holiday home next week. 

But even then, I don’t know what I’ll do when I have to go back to school. I’ve been thinking of moving at this point.",08Aug2020,1

Basically what happened was I warned my boss about the panels over the counter falling easily and hurting someone a couple weeks ago. I warned him someone might sue. Instead of doing anything he mocked me and made fun of me saying I would sue the store.

Come a couple weeks later, the panels fall in the middle of cleaning and one nicks a customer. Thankfully he wasn’t hurt but it could’ve been a lot worse. My boss the goes to fix it and says,

“Weren’t you suppose to fix this weeks ago? You said you would” even though I never did and he implied he might fix it. 

Why would he do this ?",08Aug2020,1
806,"Like the title says, I'd like to meet new people and get new friends, but I have no idea how to get started. Yes, the very obvious answer would be ""on the internet"", as it's relatively easy to find people with similar interests here, but that's not exactly the kind of relationship I'm looking forward right now. I've already met a lot of amazing people online, including my best friend, but I can only see them 1-2 times a year, because I still live with my parents and I'm in high school, so I can't really travel whenever I want.  I have a boyfriend currently, but he's the only local relationship I have, and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot - sleepovers, parties, going to coffee shops together before class etc. The problem is that I have bad social anxiety, so I don't know how to approach people and where to meet people that are not tiring to be around. Any advice on this?:(

807,"I’ve been going to the same hairdresser for some time day and we get along well, have a jokey time together and always greet each other with a kiss on the cheek ( we are European so it’s nothing.., ) we obviously we do not greet each other in this way because of covid). I am 24f and I don’t know how old he is, maybe 46- 52m ( and married ) but I found his behaviour this time verging on inappropriate. 

Btw this man is super successful and v. Wealthy  so I don’t really think he is bothered about trying to flirt with me to get a tip but what do I know 

- so he sees me and I’m standing up and he starts holding my back and stroking me (covid so we should not really be touching unnecessarily)
- then i sit down he starts rubbing my shoulders
- then the haircut starts and he goes on about how he is so happy to see me, how I am such a fun person to be around and he is always so excited to see me and so excited for our appointments. (I don’t really know how to respond, I hate compliments and it’s just too much so I’m like. Aha reallly in a sarcastic tone) 
- then he goes on again about how he is so happy to be able to be with me and I’m just like wtf am I supposed to say. Maybe this is normal but none of my guy friends would say this 
- fast forward to end of appointment and I told him wow thanks so much I love my hair etc and then he goes “I don’t care about Covid restrictions I have to hug you” and proceeds to grab onto me and hug me. I think this is pretty inappropriate given covid
-I walk out. I prepaid but he didn’t know so he calls me back into salon as it looks like I walked out without paying and he proceeds to put his hands around my body again ...

The whole thing was just too much 

Is this verging on inappropriate given the excessive compliments and touching or am I being too sensitive . I know this whole thing is my fault as We have greeted each other  with a kiss on the cheek before",08Aug2020,1
808,"Im 18 years old and have a relatively good relationship with my parents. I was supposed to move out this fall for college, but ended up staying home because of COVID. Because of this, it still feels a lot like I'm still under my parents' ""guardianship"" or whatever. In the past (when I was 16), they  let me get a large tattoo on my back, and i have 3 other small stick and poke tattoos that they don't know about. (They're all in easily coverable locations). 

My mom's never been a fan of tattoos, but my dad is generally cool with it. His big problem though is that he's always warned me against getting one somewhere I can't cover up. The new tattoo that I've been wanting to get would be relatively large, and I'd like to put it on my right forearm. Is this something I should get the ""okay"" from my parents before doing since I'm still living at home?

809," 

I  met a great woman on a dating app. She's beautiful, funny, college  educated, and almost a registered nurse in less than 5 weeks. We talked  for over a month and finally got to meet up as COVID-19 has complicated  alot of things as well as I got sick with it.

We  would talk daily, and I had asked her what she was looking for in the  very beginning and she said an eventual relationship, and so was I. She  lives about an hour and 15 minutes away from me. I came and stayed with  her for a weekend and had a great time with her, but was sad when I had  to leave.

We went on another date  just last weekend, another great time. The problem is, my work schedule  and night school are starting next week. I will be working M-F and going  to school M-Th at nights, coming home at around 1030 PM. I told her  Friday nights and the weekends would be for us, but I started thinking  how I couldn't handle it not seeing her all week and doing the distance  thing.

I got her hopes up and feel  like an asshole. I was very short with her all day two days ago,  because I really didn't know how to say how I felt. She asked if we were  still going on our date (supposed to be today) and I said yes.. but She  picked up on the vibes and asked me if everything was okay and I told  her how I felt. She tried to say she would love to try and make things  work because I'm special to her, and she is there to support me and be a  stress relief to talk to. I told her if I'm feeling this now I'm not  sure if it will change.

So she and I both said our lasts words and goodbyes. I know she feels upset because I told her this would work out originally...

The  problem is, I'm now missing her and regretting this badly. I got  psyched out and the distance thing scared me, but I know that even if I  was to start another relationship with someone closer by, my schedule  would remain the same.... she is juggling a hard nursing program/NCLEX,  her job, and still making time for me... I feel awful.

Any advice on what I can do?

813,"Hey all, 

So my girlfriend has recently moved out of her house and has moved in with a friend of hers. They are both splitting the rent on a house that is owned by her friend’s Dad. They rent out the basement of the house, and there are other tenants who rent the upstairs area- there is a locked door separating them. 

My girlfriend’s friend (I’ll just call her Y from here on out) has been letting her boyfriend stay there despite there being a rule against Y having him over (Y’s dad hates her boyfriend) but they’ve been trying to keep it lowkey and he hides in the closet any time Y’s dad comes over to do maintenance on the house. 

Here’s the problem. He smokes pot and drinks nearly every single day, he’s sloppy, messy, he doesn’t have a job, a car, or a drivers license (despite being almost 21) and doesn’t clean up after himself. He also is inconsiderate of the upstairs tenants. They complained about loud music being played around 2 am one time while Y was out of town (it was Y’s boyfriend playing the music) and my girlfriend had to take the blame for it because Y’s dad couldn’t know he was there. Then my girlfriend had to take the blame when the upstairs tenants complained about clothes being left in the washer and dryer and all over the laundry room (that was also Y’s boyfriend, and Y couldn’t take the blame because it was obvious they weren’t her clothes as she’s really small and he’s big, but my girlfriend is much taller than her) and she also had to take the blame when Y’s bf left food in the microwave overnight because Y wasn’t home that night. It goes on and on. But basically I feel I need confront this guy and make him leave. Y wants to break up with him and make him leave but is too scared. I’m obviously not gonna ask my girlfriend to do it. So that leaves me. 

Here’s the problem. I’m 5 foot 9 and 165 pounds. Y’s bf is HUGE. He’s 6 foot 8 and 220 pounds and he’s in decent shape for someone who drinks and smokes pot every day. 

I have a brown belt in both BJJ and Judo and I have 12 years of Muay Thai and wrestled varsity in high school. I also run and lift weights regularly. Because of this all of my friends are telling me I’ve got no reason to be intimidated. But I just can’t help it. This dude TOWERS over me and it’s just so hard not to be afraid even with all of my martial arts experience. 

So how do I confront this guy without showing that I’m intimidated by his size? What would be the best way to handle this situation? 

Thanks!!",08Aug2020,1

821," My husband and I have an urgent problem. We are empty nesters. Our last little bird, Jason, left for the big city a few years ago now. We tried to stay busy, but found ourselves puttering around the home and, frankly, getting on each other's nerves. We decided we needed a new challenge and took a plunge on a 1907 Queen Anne in desperate need of rehabbing. I fell in love with the wraparound porch, but my husband (an accountant) and I (a veterinarian) bit off a bit more than we could chew. Our love for our home has been challenged and tempered. Tetanus shots from rusty nails. A roof collapse and a broken elbow. A burst sewer line. The greatest challenge was the critters. The mice chewed through our food and my husband's socks. They pooped on the kitchen floor. They scurried in our walls as we tried to sleep. As a veterinarian, I took an oath to do no harm to animals. So we tried humanely caging them and releasing them in a nearby forest. This did not work. After much back and forth, we opted for quick snap traps, believing a sudden death would be the most ethical. However, the mice were too nimble. As a last resort, we turned to using the sticky pads, which truly lead to a gruesome death for these rodents — days spent starving to death. My husband Ted was in charge of disposing of the dead mice (for which I am eternally grateful). After we were confident that we had killed the last one, he vowed to never kill another mouse. For a few months, we settled into blissful home life. The house was restored to its original glory, and we had it all to ourselves.

Then came ""Jason.""

Bill was prying off a squeaky floorboard when he heard rustling and looked into the hole and saw a tiny mouse. Bill claims they made eye contact and looked at each other for at least a minute before the mouse ran away. Bill named the mouse — ""Jason Jr."" When I asked him to set out a trap, he refused. I started noticing he was leaving more mess in the kitchen, particularly crumbs on the floor. He even bought an expensive cheese and left it out on the cutting board overnight. When I confronted him about trying to feed ""Jason,"" he denied it and was defensive — even a bit indignant. While I love animals, I could not allow this to stand. My husband insisted on using the humane traps this time so we can release ""Jason"" (though secretly I believe he wants to keep him). The traps were not working and more crumbs were being left out. That takes us to this morning. I was tidying up in the kitchen when I saw ""Jason."" Acting out of instinct, I grabbed the broom and attempted to strike ""Jason."" But he ran and hopped into the open door of the dish washer. Without thinking, I immediately shut the dish washer door. Bill heard the commotion and asked what had happened. I explained we had trapped ""Jason."" Bill demanded ""Jason"" be released, and a standoff ensued.

Based on decades of my own experience as a physician for animals and some research online about the water temperatures within dishwashers, I think it is best that we run the dishwasher on ""Heavy"" and ""High Heat."" While it will be painful for ""Jason,"" the water temperatures will rise quick enough that I am sure he will die within a few minutes. It is not ideal, but this is ultimately a much more humane way to kill a mouse than a glue trap.

Bill thinks I am a monster. He believes if we open the dishwasher door slightly, he will be able to capture ""Jason"" in a grocery bag, but I once saw Bill pull his hamstring while bending down to grab the corndogs out of our freezer box.

What should we do? Should we run the dishwasher? Again, this mouse will die within a few minutes of high heat cycle beginning, if not sooner. 

If someone could please respond to this question within the next 24-48 hours, I would be very grateful.

Thank you for your time.",08Aug2020,1

If anything, it would just set her off even more. So instead, all I can do is just hide in my room and hope she sobers up soon.

I was actually having a nice Saturday afternoon. This morning, she had spent it binge drinking and getting plastered but by the time I woke up, she had passed out on the couch and laid there for several hours. I was face-timing with my best friend when heard her scream from the living room. That's when I hung up immediately and had to figure what the matter was. Than she started cussing at me over something I did wrong and threatened to destroy my computer. 

She gets really violent when she's drunk and it's obvious she didn't sleep long enough to sober up, so I had to run to my room and hide. Right now, I'm listening to her switch between banging on my door and cussing out my step dad as I'm trying not to remember some traumatic shit she put me through. This is a typical weekend for me. 

My friend is over dad's so I hide over her house and no one else lives close enough for me to escape.  When she calms down, I might sneak out and go to the park but right now, she's fired up.

First off, I would like to say that I am not judging anyone for their personal sexual choices and I'm not completely against masturbation etc. when it is done healthily. I'm just going through a personal struggle at the moment with what I guess could be described as a fetish of sorts and I would appreciate some advice on it.

Somewhat recently I have gained an affinity for trap porn. Not so much the mainstream shemale porn that can be seen on PornHub etc, although I have dabbled in to that as part of my addiction.

It's the anime/manga type of traps that I'm into. The problem is that they are fictional and just drawings etc. No disrespect to any transgenders or crossdressers out there, but most of them have almost no resemblance to the type of traps that I'm into.

Anyway, I am a (mostly) straight male as far as I know and I believe that I might have never gotten into this stuff if I didn't watch porn. It seriously makes me depressed just thinking about my situation. It's like I want something that's unattainable and I can't help it and I am led to believe that it is just my mind looking for an exotic source of dopamine.

To make things clear, I am attracted to females. I used to watch and get turned on by straight and lesbian porn all of the time. But now, I look at most straight porn and I see boring, plain people having sex with each other for money etc. instead of out of love and compassion. When I see trap porn, I really don't know what is in me that is so drawn to it. It seems like the perfect combination of cute and wholesome and sexual, attractive and exotic.

But I would consider myself as somewhat of a realist and if I'm going to be happy I need to be attracted to a real female that I can genuinely love. But I keep getting caught up in these fantasies and I can't do NoFap for more than 4 days without getting really strong urges and thoughts and so I always usually end up relapsing on around the third or fourth day.

Thanks for reading this all. I really appreciate any of you who take the time to reply with advice or what I should do. I'm going to try to start doing NoFap from today but it is very hard and I would like to hear what advice you guys have to offer me to help overcome my",08Aug2020,1
825,"I recently just moved to a new address and my drivers license expired about two weeks before. I was waiting until after I moved to renew my license because I didn’t want to have to take double steps to renew and then change address. I’m a California resident. 

I know the dmv offers a good amount of their services online and I’ve submitted my change of address online. It says it went through, but I was always told you have to change your address at the dmv so I’m not sure what the online service is exactly. 

The change of address went through successfully, then all I have to do is renew my drivers license online and I should receive a new one with the updated address correct? I’m just a bit unsure about all this? And I’ve had no success trying to call the dmv for more info

Earlier this week we got a note in our mailbox that we were being too loud and needed to keep it down because she works mornings and we kept her up. After reading the note we made it a point to walk around as quietly as possible and keep our tv volume low ECT.

We were settled in within five minutes of me retuning from work and silent aside from him watching YouTube at about half volume on his phone. 20 mins later He shifted his foot and accidentally knocked over a half empty water bottle. This caused our neighbors son to knock on our door and be extremely rude and disrespectful to my bf. And then the neighbors kid invited someone over and they stayed for hours being loud as heck.

For Wayne State, I will be living at home and classes will be online. I have a scholarship so it will cost me $0. If I go to Wayne State then I will get an engineering major. I will stay at home and that will be boring.

For Miami I will live down there and there will be classes. It will cost 50k. If I go to Miami then I will get a marine biology major, or I might switch. I'll be in Miami and it will be very fun.

My parents will be paying for Miami, however, I think it is selfish as 50k is a lot of money. If I were to major in marine biology in Miami then the money would be well spent. However, if I were to switch my major to engineering then the money would be wasted because Wayne State has a good engineering program. 

If money didn't exist I would go to Miami because it is Miami and I want the experience. However, I don't think I truly know if I want to do marine biology. 

Miami has the social aspect, but Wayne State has the financial aspect. Miami has marine biology which I might like, but at the same time I might not like engineering.

834,"(tw) was this sexual assault?

when i was fifteen or sixteen, i went to a movie with my best friends at the time. one of my friends from then had been asking me to occasionally make out with her (we’re both girls), since she said i’d “glown up”. i had recently come out, was heartbroken over someone i loved rejecting me, and was also (now that i’m looking back) like going through a manic episode at the time. 

we made out a few times because i didn’t want to reject her. even though it made me feel really weird and kinda gross (she was like a sister to me), she was the kind of person who, if you told her you didn’t even want to watch a movie with her, would cry and freak out and threaten to kill herself. 

anyways, at this movie, with my other best friend sitting next to me, she started doing random things. touching me, sucking on my fingers, kissing my neck. that whole movie was a complete blur because i just remember feeling really anxious and scared someone would notice, or that i’d ruin the night. i had never done anything like that with anyone, and emotionally i was panicking. i just froze up and let her do it, but i didn’t do anything to her. after the movie, our other friend (who didn’t notice until she saw the hicky) was like “oh my god”, and we joked about it. but i cried because i was worried about my parents seeing the hicky, since i wasn’t out to them lmao.

me and this girl are no longer friends due to other reasons as well. i don’t think we really talked about this, but i brought it up to another friend the other day and she reminded me how bad i felt afterwards. i had never thought to consider this sexual assault. i never said no, never told her to stop, never even moved away or anything, even though she was like half my size. she might have thought i liked it, but i just felt used. would this qualify as sexual assault?",08Aug2020,1
835,"Anytime we get together and talk about what we're up to, (I seriously try to believe I'm the one misinterpreting, but I'm not) he always has something to try n prove he's doing it better than I am. If I'm doing something new, he'll want to pick it up and best me at it. It's really self conscious for me being exploited (or so I feel). I just hate the idea of having to be into something and because of that someone else tries to best me at my lane, because it's probably better or because it comes from me. I don't know. I just hate this feeling and hate that it happens every single time, literally, that we meet. I present opportunities for him to help me find work, but he gets the skills and gets himself the opportunities instead. If he had them previously or was doing it before, I wouldn't mind. But doing it because I'm your inspiration (he says it to me), and making me feel bad (intentional or not) makes him come across as snakey. Come to think of it. The only time he contacts me or wants to really converse, it's about what I'm up to. Anytime I dodge the question, the conversation dies. Honestly I don't trust him, but just slip up sometimes because I'm a loner and he's the only friend I kind of have. Aside that, I support all he's into, but he wants to mix it all up with mine.

836,"I'm 25NB and I work on the checkouts at one of the UK's biggest supermarkets. I've been there for a little over two years and in that time, I earned myself a 2:1 degree in games design, except that I no longer want to work in the games industry. As time has gone on, my confident has been worn thin by rude and obnoxious customers (primarily during the pandemic). Not only that, I've recently been made aware of just how little upper management thinks of me, with one manager going so far as to call me ""just checkout staff"" when I asked about a new queueing system that was being implemented and why it had been brought in.

They've brought in extra security cameras specifically to make sure we're following protocol, there's no element of trust that we're doing our jobs correctly, we have *zero* flexibility because whenever we need time off or are ill, there's a lengthy interrogation we have to go through before my employer decides if we really do need the time off (and don't even get me started on just how unfairly our attendance percentage is calculated), and if we need to change availability for shifts, for example students needing certain days off for uni work, we're expected to bring in detailed timetables for our manager to peruse and decide what our availability should be. Not only that, the manager I mentioned in the previous paragraph marches around the store like a former general of the KGB and breathes fire at anyone who dares even remotely diverge from what's considered ""protocol"", regardless of how much more efficient it may be than the standard procedure.

837,"Long story short,

I had best friend for 13 years (I'm 23 now so basicailly more than half of my life) who was more to me like brother than my friend...

Him and his gf were kicked out of his parents home (police was called etc.) so they moved 40 km from his home (which is close to mine) to hers...

After she came back in her city she reastablished old friendships...

Long story short, my ""brother"" , she and her friend moved together in to same place because that girl found the job for my friend gf so they all moved together to be closer to the job...

After couple of weeks my friend gf wanted me to meet her and they were just pushing her to me a lot, which I found repulsive and I felt like little Indian kid in arranged marriage.

Three weeks later I celebrated my birthday and I invited her because she lives with my best friend, his gf and this last month we all went together on drinks, clubbing etc... So if she didn't live with them I probably wouldn't invited her... But ok, I invited her and on my birthday I had like 20+ people so I was least with them because I'm hanging with them like almost every day... That girl thought I was avoiding her, and then like couple of hours later my friends gf took me aside and slapped me (not hard just like friends do) and said something like ""are you crazy? She came because of you here, she changed her work shift because of you, she wants to be with you"" and then 5 minutes later I pulled her aside and started making out... If my friends gf didn't say that I wouldn't put a nove on her, I saw her as a friend...

Long story short, after a month which felt like a honey moon I snapped because of something she said and in that moment I felt like she was playing with me and my feelings (she didn't want a relationship and if she said that to me at first I wouldn't even tried something with her)... We started arguing, insulting each other... I insulted her, gave her some harsh insults etc... I tried to apologize to her multiple times, she didn't accept... I tried to show her I cared about her, she again ""spat"" in my face (i bought her a present, wrote her a letter and she said that I did all that just to get pussy...)

After bad first fight we've gotten in more multiple worse fights and after last fight she said to me that she doesn't want to see me anymore...

I again ate shit and apologized, she didn't accept so I deleted and blocked all three of them, I pushed back my best friend, his gf who was like a sister to me.... Because: 1st) When we started arguing both of them (friend and his gf) just moved aside and when I needed most help they were just quite 2nd) I can't more hang out with two of my best friends because of hers... When I want to go at their place, I need to start a call with ""is she home? "", when I want to go somewhere with them I need to start a call with ""do you have something planned with her?""... We always hung out and now I feel replaced and I don't know what to do... I didn't see them both for a month, and they were only persons in my life which I can speak with and see everyday and don't get bored...",08Aug2020,1
838,"I have recently been offered a job in London and I currently live in Scotland. Both my childhood friend and I came to the country at the same time but went to different parts. At the beginning we were great, and I would go down to London and visit her as much as possible. However she only came up to see me once.

Later i would drop hints that I would love her to come and visit that she would sort of glaze over and ignore or make empty promises. I told myself it was the distance but the thing that hurt the most was seeing her visit or go on trips with the new friends she had made. I even lost someone close to me and all I got was a text and not a phonecall. The last time I went to London she came and briefly hung out for an hour then left for a tinder (first) date. I didn't know how to bring up my hurt feelings but from that point I realised that that's not someone I trust and don't even know if its worth the bother as we rarely see each other nowadays - our visits back to our hometown never overlap. 

Of course I did feel guilty because I was behaving just as badly to protect myself and I dont like being confrontational with people who I care about as I imagine it would hurt them to know they've hurt me and I don't want to hurt them. Which I know sounds pathetic. 

Now, i have been offered a job in London and thanks to social media and mutual friends its not like I can hide without being shady. But I also don't know how to honestly broach the topic that I feel she didn't put enough effort into our friendship and wasn't there when I could have used a close friend (It's not like I didnt have other close friends to be there, but it felt odd that she wasn't and didn't account for it).

I guess I do want to save this relationship if I understand why things went the way it did but the fact this all happened makes me wonder if she's still someone I want to be close with. 

How would people approach this issue?

5 years ago I met with 2 friends online through video games we quickly became good friends. This friendship I had with these 2 other guys lead to us meeting more and more friends and we all shared a close bond.

Throughout the years I have never spoken to them vocally and instead I just listened to them talk as I wrote in chat or something like that.. This has never been an issue with them first 2 years or so but they quickly grew to hate the fact that I never speak more and more to the point where I'm basically being made fun of on a daily basis for that reason and this has led to me being on the edge of finally hitting that unmute button and using my voice.

The reason as to why I never speak with them? I'm young. And not just younger than them. I'm 13 (14 this year) and the youngest of my group of online friends is 16 and the oldest being 21. They never suspected that I am young although theorized about it in the past.

840,"The news about this was broken to me on Wednesday night, but I still don't even know how to even begin processing or dealing with this.

I (18F) have known these two guys (we'll call them B and C, both 18M) for around 6 years. They were my first friends when I moved to where I currently live and they've always been great friends to me. B has always been able to give me rides when I need them and we've worked with pre-k kids at church and have always gotten along really well to the point that I see him like a brother. C and I dated a few years back and actually went on a date last May, but we decided that we're better friends than partners. He and I also really get along and I give him advice when needed and he helps me stay grounded when he can tell I'm freaking out. All in all, I know these guys and their families well and really care about them.

The past few months, I knew they were out partying and drinking a bit (yes, even during a pandemic), but I didn't think it was anything too serious until 2 weeks ago when B and I went to lunch (fast food, not a sit in because no thanks) to catch up. He told about having run-ins with the cops and how he was lucky he wasn't in jail, but he'd gotten 3 jobs to both save up for a place to live and keep him busy and mentioned C was doing the same.

Cut to this Wednesday. I saw they weren't at church, but that's not unusual, they've been pulling away, so I wasn't super worried. Later that night, B's mom posted something on FB about how this was officially the worst year of her life. Of course, my family and I got really worried, but there was a comment that said, ""I went through the same thing with my son and now he's better and a fine young man."" Without even thinking, I said, ""B got arrested."" We checked arrest records and sure enough, there's B's mugshot. Right below his is C's and another guy's who I didn't recognize, but was arrested with them. All have felony charges that, in my state, can result in 10-40 years, on top of one of them having a gun and pointing it at someone (it was never specified who had the gun, that hasn't been released, all we know is that someone did).

I was, and am, absolutely gutted. I was trying to rationalize it and think that maybe it was wrong place wrong time, after all, they were with another guy with a laundry list of pending charges, so maybe it was a misunderstanding or they were too drunk to realize what was happening or that the third guy planned it all and took advantage of them being drunk. But the police report came out yesterday and they admitted to planning the crime, being on board, and knowing that there was a gun. They said B was cooperative, which makes us think there's a (albeit small) chance that he may get some leniency, but C was not and caused the cops trouble when they were pulled over and arrested.

I'm really upset and confused and hurt and just angry because I know they didn't need the money. B had 3 jobs and C, at 18, was a manager for a construction company and was set to climb even higher because it's a local company and he's worked there since he was 14. And the worst part to me is that in B's mugshot, he's grinning. There's clearly a smirk on his face and I don't know if it's because he was drunk and didn't understand what the hell he just did, but he's smiling like nothing is wrong. Even in family pictures, he doesn't really smile, so I don't know what to think or how to feel. Truly, I don't understand and I have no idea how to even handle this. How do I try to heal or move on from learning that two of my closest friends of 6 years may be going to prison for at least a few years? How do I start to handle and cope with the severity of what they did?",08Aug2020,1
841,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the place for this kind of posts, if not then I apologize! I just got contacted by my lab manager saying his partner came down with a fever, among other covid symptoms. As precaution, he will be taking the next shift rotation off (4 days). The problem is, the manager also cares for our animals (mice facility) and splits the work with another technician. So they rotate every 4 days. I used to have the technician’s job, but was actually transitioned to only bench work back in December. So the manager reached out to me to cover for his rotation. However, I’m the only lab member who takes immunosuppressants which is why I was almost the last one to return to the lab. 

I’m a little freaked out because even though I’m in the rotation with the technician and not the manager, the manager lives with another lab member and this lab member is in my rotation.  

There’s someone else who could potentially cover, so after I got off the phone with my manager, she texted me this one person could do two days if I did the other two. Then kept messaging me that there weren’t exactly any other options, etc.

Now my anxiety is building due to this situation, I’m not really sure what to do. I have housemates as well (3), and they all very upset with me going into a lab that has been potentially exposed to covid and coming back to the house and potentially exposing them. In addition, they care about my wellbeing as week. 

I am also really upset at my PI, she has not sent out an email to notify that someone was potentially exposed. Instead, people went in to work as normal. 

I just need some advice, I’m not sure what to do or if I can really refuse going in to cover for them. The thing is, I have covered for them before so I worked 12 days in a row (three rotations) so that the lab manager could have a break and go on vacation with his fiancé. This was a few months ago. So I’m clearly okay with helping. I just feel bad because my lab has had to be accommodating for me due to my illness but also other instances (Broke my leg, had tonsils taken out, etc. Just serious of unfortunate events lol).

Anyways, thank you for hearing me out and any advice is appreciate it!",08Aug2020,1

Last night I went on a date from what I thought was an attractive young lady off of a dating app. The pictures all looked like Female and I specifically opt to match up with ""woman"" on the dating app as I am a straight male.

I ended up having drinks with the person and afterwards, it progressed into kissing and making out and hangjob back at their place.

At the same time everybody has their flaws, so i can’t expect them to be perfect.

This is why it becomes hard to talk things out with them as i might come off as rude or something.

Any help would really be appreciated, i also sometimes wish i didn’t have anyone and was on my own because apart from myself and them, i don’t really trust anybody else. So i was thinking i’d be better off with myself. 

Thanks!!",08Aug2020,1
848,"Hello,
Long story short I had a terrible day. I was turned down by everyone. I'm in a weird relationship with a girl I'm dating right now. She told me last minute that she doesn't want to hang out today and is ignoring all my text.
I was put in a group chat with old friends who asked to hang out today. Before I could say anything someone removed me, because they had me confused with someone who hast the same name as me and didn't want me there.
A very good friend said she would call me today but also turned that down. I understand that she was tired from work  but it still made me sad after being let down twice today. 
I always do anything for these people. I'd walk to their house at 3 a.m if they needed me. I put so much energy in my relationships and am always taken for granted.
On top of that my parents got mad at me today because I disturbed them watching TV. 
Right now I'm just procrastinating, but I'm incredibly hurt and feel the need to cut myself again. But I really don't want to do that.
I feel very empty and don't know what to do with myself.
Any advice on how I could feel better?",08Aug2020,1
849,"For context I'm apart of a discord server with a handful of my friends as well as some people my friends know. We have a serious talk chat which we use specifically for talks with depression or general tragedy. Now a couple of people on this server which I don't know to well have made some comments which are really concerning such as ""I hope I get shot"" and ""I love just not mattering"". I'm afraid that simply talking to them might make them feel worse. I'm also not sure whether or not they actually mean what they are saying or are just looking for attention. So far the last comment made was a couple hours ago. They said the ""I love just not mattering"" bit. Any advice on how I could help? or if I should just ignore it since I don't know them that well?

850,"So I was using my brother's pc to play computer games (with his permission, he was outside the house) and accidentally I noticed in recently opened folders a folder nammed with some girl's name. I opened it and I found a lot of photos of some girls, downloaded propably from Facebook, etc. In this folder was also another folder with nude photos, without face shown. I googled some of this files names and I found those photos in some reddit kind of portal, where this girl posted them. I also found a screen shot of this girl's profile on some website where you can find prostitutes (I couldn't find here her profile there). This screenshot looks faked and photoshoped. I found this girl on facebook and she is my brother's facebook friends.  I searched through my brothers and hers coversation and its totally neutral, collegue, to collegue. I also found similliar folder of two other girls.

I don't know what to do, they all of age, I don't have problem with some girl posting or sending nudes (if she is doing it on her full consent), of course, it's disgusting for me finding this. Should I tell her what I found? Should I tell my parents or my brother?",08Aug2020,1
851,"I am a social media manager for a milk distribution company and I work remotely during the pandemic. we have two Facebook pages to run and I have been asked to do a post each day to each page. I enjoy the freedom of working from home and I feel an increase in creativity since I am not confined to an office. here is where I need advice: 

since I came to the company during the pandemic, I don't know anyone working for the company other than the owner and my manager. they are both kind people and they appreciate my work. the problem is there is this guy who does everything to mess with my head. he works at the distribution warehouses and has nothing to do with the pages. before I came, he was temporarily given my current role until they found me. the first thing he did when I came is he restricted my role to only a few features. since he was still the admin. I went through a lot with my managers to force him to stop restricting me. after that, he starts posting things randomly which are not according to company standards and acts like he still is the page manager. from time to time, he deletes the posts I make out of nowhere. one day, he decides out of his authority to put a random person as a page manager and that person starts reposting old images and causes havoc on the pages. that was the last straw for me and I start confronting both of them. I kicked the woman out of the page after a while of talking but the guy was very stubborn and didn't remove himself after I told him so many times. my manager and the owners are being very passive about the whole ordeal but it's driving me crazy.

852,"So the titles pretty self explanatory, but i feel some explanation is due.

 I've been noticing since quarantine started that I've been the only one initiating conversations with the few friends i have.  If I don't text or call someone, then I don't talk to anyone.

Normally I wouldn't be bothered much, but since hanging out with them isn't really an option atm, and texting and calling has been one of the few ways to keep in touch, its started to pick at me more and more over the past month or so.

Im not really sure how to feel or go about it.  I'm kinda split down the middle with this, and could use some advice on this.

On one hand, part of me is kinda hurt.  It feels like I'm not exactly worth keeping in touch with or talking to, or that they just don't want to; especially when some of these people are regularly keeping in touch and talking with others.

On the other hand, the other part of me feels like I'm being a fucking idiot for being upset about it. It feels like I'm being petty and should just suck it up.  Who cares if Im always the one to initiate conversations with them, they still respond so it shouldn't be a big deal right?

Im not really sure which feelng to go with, its a bit confusing and I'm pretty sure I'm just overthinking shit.  That said, some outside advice to help figure stuff out would be appreciated.

Hope everyone's staying safe",08Aug2020,1

856,"I know I've asked an iteration of this question before but I thought of something else that comes into play and I figured I'd ask about it.  Long story short, I was not at all a career-driven person in high school (still am not to be brutally honest) and so when an engineering scholarship miraculously landed in my lap due to good grades and impeccable timing, I took up the offer.  \~6 years later (4 years of school, 2 years in an internship program) I am having a hard time staying motivated in my field when deep down I feel like I'm still that stupid teenager who just wants to stay home and play video games or develop other non-STEM hobbies.  I shiver at the thought of having to spend any of my ""Precious Free Time (TM)"" practicing my engineering skills when I """"""""""""earned"""""""""""""" that free time on the weekends and should be free to blow it off as i see fit (aka, video games).  I'm 25 years old and while on paper I should be \*extremely\* grateful to be in the position that I am, I am starting to grow weary of my position and am scared that I'm stuck in my field with little wiggle room due to my limited expertise (I was very much the ""Cs make degrees"" kid in college) and I'm scared to go back to school if I want to do something else.  The people around me actively enjoy their career and take huge stock in STEM in terms of economics, career, and even hobbies.  I'm struggling because while my adult self wants to be a good worker and gain everyone's respect, my child self is still screaming and crying because he wants everything to go back to the way it was in high school when he had no responsibilities.  What complicates all of this is the fact that (due to my borderline autistic tendencies imo) I don't really have any goals or dreams that drive me to excel and achieve.  The biggest thing is that I want to have my own place to live and even that's kind of basic since I don't feel the need to own the ""nicest"" house or have the ""fanciest"" car.  I don't even want to get married or have kids because it seems like a giant hassle to me (again, autism).  My conscience is telling me to grow the hell up, but deep down I'm kind of resentful of the fact that I don't even know what I want out of life other than independence and simplicity.",08Aug2020,1
857,"""D"" is the assaulter

""S"" is the family member

So this is going to be really hard for me to talk about and I'm honestly not sure what to say. I will be leaving out A LOT of details to stay as anonymous as possible.

A little bit of a back story: My best friend, ""S"", who is a close family member has been in a relationship for some time. I never really liked their significant other due to some things that happened at the start of their relationship that I will not disclose. However, recently I got close to ""D"", and we have been on good terms.

One night we were all together and drunk. I was blackout drunk and high (I'm a light weight and ""D"" is not). I ended up getting quite sick just a little bit after having another drink. That kinda killed the vibe, so we all went to bed. ""S"" was sleeping and ""D"" was not. I was barely awake. Again, I was blackout drunk so I can not recall much. The only thing I remember is ""D"" having their hands all over me. I didn't even move. I just sat there... and let it happen. I was so weak and looking back I had no idea what was going on. It's so fuzzy and sometimes I hope it was just a dream, but I know it's not.

I have only seen ""D"" and ""S"" once since that night. It was so much harder than I ever expected. I was nauseous and could barely breathe being at their house. I couldn't even look at ""D"" and when I did they were always looking back at me. I am so close with ""S"" and see them constantly but now when I think of them I automatically associate ""S"" with the assault. I can't stop thinking about that night. Although I only remember extremely few parts of that night I still can't stop replaying it. It's like I'm constantly reliving it. I have been through this before when I was a child, but I have since overcome that. However, overcoming this is extremely hard for me.

If I tell ""S"" what happened I'm afraid they may hurt themselves if the relationship were to end. ""S"" has been through a lot and believes ""D"" is the only person they'll ever love. I'm also afraid ""S"" may think this is my fault, or be mad because I didn't tell them sooner. Unfortunately ""S"" favors they're significant other over me, and I'm afraid they will still choose ""D"" even if the truth comes out. I can not live without ""S"", they're all I have left.

Either ""S"" will never speak to me again and continue on with they're relationship, or will hurt themselves if the relationship ends. I have no idea what to do, and I'm not even sure if anyone will see this. Can I just suppress this memory and make the pain go away, or will that not be possible?

Side note: I am a minor and ""D"" is an adult. Please don't tell me to report this to the police, because I have no evidence. The police likely won't be able to help, and it would probably hurt ""S"" more.",08Aug2020,1

I gave this person my number when we first met so it's not like they don't have a way to contact me, but I don't even feel like it could work out even if she contacted me again. I feel heartbroken.

So he's very nittpicky when it gets to it, must be Smart, can't want to have kids, not religious, no marriage, and the list goes on to a silly degree. The thing is he got depression and always whines about being lonely. He even gave away his dog cuz he has to work 8 hours a day.

871,"So my girlfriend has recently moved out of her house and has moved in with a friend of hers. They are both splitting the rent on a house that is owned by her friend’s Dad. They rent out the basement of the house, and there are other tenants who rent the upstairs area- there is a locked door separating them. 

My girlfriend’s friend (I’ll just call her Y from here on out) has been letting her boyfriend stay there despite there being a rule against Y having him over (Y’s dad hates her boyfriend) but they’ve been trying to keep it lowkey and he hides in the closet any time Y’s dad comes over to do maintenance on the house. 

Here’s the problem. He smokes pot and drinks nearly every single day, he’s sloppy, messy, he doesn’t have a job, a car, or a drivers license (despite being almost 21) and doesn’t clean up after himself. He also is inconsiderate of the upstairs tenants. They complained about loud music being played around 2 am one time while Y was out of town (it was Y’s boyfriend playing the music) and my girlfriend had to take the blame for it because Y’s dad couldn’t know he was there. Then my girlfriend had to take the blame when the upstairs tenants complained about clothes being left in the washer and dryer and all over the laundry room (that was also Y’s boyfriend, and Y couldn’t take the blame because it was obvious they weren’t her clothes as she’s really small and he’s big, but my girlfriend is much taller than her) and she also had to take the blame when Y’s bf left food in the microwave overnight because Y wasn’t home that night. It goes on and on. But basically I feel I need confront this guy and make him leave because if I don’t, he’s gonna get my girlfriend kicked out. Y wants to break up with him and make him leave but is too scared. I’m obviously not gonna ask my girlfriend to do it. So that leaves me. 

Here’s the problem. I’m 5 foot 9 and 165 pounds. Y’s bf is HUGE. He’s 6 foot 8 and 220 pounds and he’s in decent shape for someone who drinks and smokes pot every day. 

I have a brown belt in both BJJ and Judo, 12 years of Muay Thai training and wrestled varsity in high school. I also run and lift weights regularly. Because of this all of my friends are telling me I’ve got no reason to be intimidated. But I just can’t help it. This dude TOWERS over me and it’s just so hard not to be afraid even with all of my martial arts experience. Plus... there are weight classes in mma for a reason. 

So how do I confront this guy without showing that I’m intimidated by his size? What would be the best way to handle this situation?

875,"I recently met a friend from Australia who is absolutely WONDERFUL and her 17th birthday is coming up very soon! I want to do something nice for this goofball, but after much thinking trying I honestly need some help on what to do for it. Here are some details:

- She lives in Australia while I live in the US so meeting is a luxury we don't have

- She enjoys drawing, poetry, books, philosophy, writing and learning about cultures

- She loves everything about nature *(animals like lizards, dogs, racoons)*

- She's a total nerd for Marvel media, The Witcher, and Game of Thrones

- She's likes memes too

- We share a few inside jokes so maybe that can come into play?

- BIG THING is that she recently did something for me that pulled at my heart strings so I really hope I can do something bigger for her

This is all that I can put here without feeling werid about her privacy. Also I hope she dosen't see this and ruin any potential surprise. Also also I'm pretty sure I'm starting to like her romanticly, like ALOT *(The thing she did confirmed that)*. I'm not sure if she feels the same way and that's okay. I'd hate to ruin our friendship. Please if anyone can help with coming up with a gift or a gesture I'd very much appreciate the support!",08Aug2020,1
876,"I have general anxiety that is worst when it comes to driving. I don't feel like I'm missing out on much, though. I am alright walking, biking, or ridesharing.

As I get older, though, my avoidance of driving is joked about more and more. Recently multiple people have said things like I am like a pet they carry around, and I never have to do anything difficult because a ""real adult"" is always around to help me.

If I do catch a ride, I have never gone without chipping in moneywise or expressing my thanks. In those situations, the other people usually say they're satisfied, but apparently many of them are not.

These comments have increased over the past few months, or at least I am noticing them more. I pointed it out to two people whose responses were basically ""I'm sorry what I said hurt you"" and  ""Well, if you had your license, no one would say things like that anymore"" but there has been no improvement.

I know if we lived in a city with better public transportation, I wouldn't have to hear so often how I should really know how to drive by now. So what's a good way to ask people to stop commenting on this? And, I don't know, what are some ways people either accept being unable to drive or get comfortable with the idea of driving?",08Aug2020,1
877,"I am a 23 y/o black female who is the 2nd of 7 children. I am the 1st in two generations to graduate high school with a diploma, complete an undergraduates program at an accredited university, and go on to pursue a career. 

Throughout my life, my mother has never seemed to care about any of my achievements and I am unsure if it is because I am a lesbian or because I have always been independent of my family, regardless my childhood and teenage years were an incredibly painful experience. After graduating high school I began to work and give her money whenever she asked, I paid her bills with my credit cards and threw away my savings to help my family as a way to buy their love. No matter what I did, she gave her full attention to my siblings even if their lives were in shambles. Especially whenever I am compared to my older sister who is the much prettier one out of us. My sister dropped out of high school, began dating a man who has children from previous relationships, and a criminal record (S.R). I took it as a personal attack but refused to allow it to change how I felt. I have been upset with my family but always wanted their love and approval. Throughout my college years, I have had to ask my mother for financial assistance even when I knew she didn't always have it. It made me feel awful and I would try my best to avoid stepping over barriers. 

Two days ago I found out my mother put a cable account in my name and failed to make payments, I spoke to her for months during this time and not once did she, my grandmother, or sisters mention this. When I comforted her she pushed me off and pretend that she could fix it. I blocked her and my entire family. I refuse to speak to any of them but I would be lying if I said this wasn't the most painful thing I have had to experience. 

Looking back, I know we grew up in poverty and my mother did do all she could for our family. She always told us she loved us and wanted more for us as a family but I would be lying if I said she didn't say things that I still bring up in therapy especially about my sexuality. Now that I have blocked her, I want to keep it that way but I feel guilty. Why? How do I go about my life without my close family?",08Aug2020,1

	I have my sexual dopamine release in the form of porn and I'm having all my perversions explored and I don't have to go through the annoyance of knowing girls

My current job isn’t completely unbearable and I genuinely like my boss, but  currently I am the only person doing my particular job and I need to work 12+ hours a day just to stay afloat and it’s going to be this way for the foreseeable future.  The new job would be a solid 8 hours or I would get overtime, which I don’t get now as I’m salaried. I’m a parent so these extra hours and the inability to take time off is killing me. The benefits at the new job are slightly better than I have now, but again I’ll be making less money.  I have been with my current company for about a decade but I do feel that this as far as I’ll be able to go as culturally, 12 hour days are the norm.  Before I became a parent, this was fine.

888,"Hello.

I have been asked by friend to move in to their house. Now I'm having trouble deciding because of a few reasons. 

So after 4 months of being unemployed, I finally found a job. This job is kind of far from where I live (an hour by bus) but is still manageable. If I were to move, the travel time would be doubled, which would be 4 hours wasted per day just on commute.

On the other hand, I'm not comfortable with the current house I live in now as the landlord and landlady are toxic people. They've had issues with all the other previous tenants which caused them to move out. I like the people in the other house a lot better. 

The reason I stayed here was because it was really close to my work before it got shut down from coronavirus lockdowns. I also still stayed because they weren't making me pay rent until I found a job. 

Now I don't think wasting 4+ hours of my day wouldn't be good. Maybe if I had a car it would be much easier but seeing as I've just started my job I can't afford that right now. 

My friend said that they could help me find a job that's closer to the house but in the current situation I'm really scared of losing the current job I have. I don't like the feeling of being sp insecure about the future. The past 4 months have been really tough on my mental health because of having trouble in looking for jobs and such.

889,"Right now I work at a small restaurant in a small town. Its a tiny space with less than 10 people. Nobody except me and the boss were wearing masks.

One person got COVID. So my boss had the place deep cleaned, but opened a day later. I didn't come in last week to isolate and get tested. I just got my test today. Negative.

I'm debating if I should go back or quit this job. I have a college degree(Biology/Wildlife), but its been hard/slow waiting for responses. I am firing off as many applications as I can. I have roughly $4500 in the bank right now. I don't pay rent, just a few bills.

I want to quit because I don't want to get sick or pass it to my family and I don't think the restaurant is taking it seriously. But I have to answer to my mom and her boyfriend. They had to get tested because I was exposed at work, but they didn't take it seriously. I don't want to sound like I am lazy at my age(26) either

So I think I have two options:

1) Quit and just focus on job applications. My plan would be to tell my mom and her SO that I'm giving it a month of job applications before I go back to working something else in town(grocery store).

2) Stay at the restaurant(the COVID employee is isolating) and work to keep getting money in(I only get about $400~ every two weeks).

So essentially I (F17) have just been through hell with my family (constant fights, emotional/sometimes physical abuse, constant fat/sl*t shaming, not being able to do normal things for people my age like staying out past 9 or even going over to friends places, and it’s gotten to the point where my overbearing mother and my abusive father (who i haven’t spoken to in years) have driven me to the point of wanting to move. My breaking point was seeing my father not take accountability for his actions when we confronted him about treating my siblings (both older) and i terribly for our entire lives. They’re both somewhat mentally unwell (undiagnosed of course) and it’s been getting to the point where i’ve developed an eating disorder, severe depression, anxiety, and ptsd from all the trauma i went through (only found out when i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt) and i’m currently getting the help I need but however, it’s gotten to the point where even my therapist said i really need to get out of that environment if it’s effecting my mental health that badly.  

However, I spoke to my mother about potentially moving out and she started shouting at me saying that i’m not ready to leave but i’ll have roommates when i do leave. So right now i’m just focused on getting a new job and saving up.

899,"Growing up, i (19f) always thought there's something wrong with me. Being Asian, academic excellence is held at a very high regard here, and i, all of my adolecense, felt 'abnormal' for never being able to cope up in class like my friends did, at ease. I always saw students my age, all the way from primary to high school, excel at subjects with no discomfort. They never seemed to have any problem reading, understanding and memorising a chapter altogether in minimal time or solving problems without confusing formulaes when put in pressure. Whereas, i couldn't read a paragraph without zoning out 4 times. I thought i was silly (and stupid). I could be reading a book for an hour with full on ""focus"" but if i decide to go back and ""revise"" what i had just learned, i'd find everything just brand new, like i had never seen those words before. I used to break down a lot, especially as i couldn't understand what was wrong with me and blamed myself for being dumb and a ""retard"".

 I never secured high marks, or held ranks. It's not i never tried, like my parents think. I do. I just get distracted so much, it gets annoying and exhausting trying to refocus and reread and recollect my judgements over and over again.

My parents always kind of looked down on me, saying i don't pay attention enough, or am just not focused on my studies, sliding towards being a failure adult, ruining my own future; and after my sister's birth and her turning out good in studies and outgoing and social {I'm introverted and asocial (inferiority complex and anxiety)}, they started resenting me. I could feel it. It hurts. 

I have severe anxiety too. Have always had it. Discovered that like 4 years ago. Could finally understand why i never could give speeches, or stammered during my presentations even though i was fully prepared, or couldn't voice the answer (i most definitely knew) loud and confident when being called out in front of the class, or couldn't board public transport or just go buy a pack of chips from a nearby store without thundering heartbeats, fiery hot face and stammering words and nausea. 

All these on top of bullying, body shaming and financial crisis led me to my severe depression starting age 14.

Back to the main issue: I could be talking to you for hours and the moment you left, i wouldn't be able to recall what you even wore. Like, forget material, print, cuts and style, i couldn't even tell if it was a trouser? Jeans? Skirt? Or nothing at all. I thought i had some memory problem and cussed myself over it too. I felt CRAZY, still do.. I always wished i had some disorder - dyslexia, autism or anything to make sense out of it and take the weight off me. That i'm not some big idiotic slow-headed loser.
    People would come up to me bright ""Hey [my name]!"" And i'd stare at them blank trying to recall HOW or WHERE i know them from. It really makes a bad impression of me as most people think i'm just rude, but the truth is even though they seem familiar, and i know that i've talked to them before.. i just couldn't put pieces of info together.

I don't even have hobbies anymore. I can't. I just can't keep focused on something for too long, even though i love it. Forget sketching and poetry, I love doodling too. Just as i do maths and physics.

All of this together has affected my relationships and my self-esteem. I have NO friends, and i've stopped socializing. I don't really talk/share to my parents or sister (and nor do i intend to.)

Don't suggest me therapy as that's not an option here. My parents are too poor to afford it and i wouldn't bother them with this bs anyway as they'd just push their ""it's not real"" agenda on me. 

So, kind redditors, if you have any tips, or advice or suggestions on how to deal with my ADHD so as i could just finish college with a good GPA and find myself a means of living and stop being a burden to my family, and remember good people and events, and indulge in good hobbies or simply just make my day-to-day life a little easier, i'd be forever grateful.

Those people make me feel worthless. 

The only thing that keeps me going is a quote from a tv series. The quote is: ""Forward, always forward"", I just think to myself that I only have control over my actions, so I can just try to go forward in life and that's it, then all we can do is hope that everything will be alright which I am certain will eventually happen.

I have a friend who is great and funny. I used to meet them quite often before the pandemic but after the whole situation I have not met them even once. We talked through text here and there but not a lot ( I am not great at starting conversations through text).

My friend has not explicitly shown any suicidal tendencies or any sign of depression when we used to meet. We never talked about any serious topics about life, we only used to talk about normal day to day stuff.

Recently I found my friend's reddit account and went through everything that my friend has posted, most of it was harmless, but I found 2-3 posts that were posted on r/suicidewatch (and the last post was made 2 months ago)

I don't want them to know that I saw their post because it would make them angry and kinda lose trust in me, also my friend might disable that account and make a new one.

My Plan: I will text them everyday like a friend checking up on what's going in their life, also I will create another reddit account and befriend them anonymously and talk about deep and heavy stuff there.

904,"TW: Anxiety and references to rape, depression and PTSD.

TLDR; Please give tips for overcoming anxiety. Thank you! 

I used to suffer from ptsd, depression and, it was always a shock to me, but anxiety too. Long story short, my dad had Huntingtons disease (and died from it), my sister is suicidal, mum was depressed, bullying and I was raped. I had a lot of therapy and generally have been fine for the last 4/5years. My therapy also ended around this time. Well today I realised I'm not sure I'm doing so fine anymore.

I say I'm surprised about the anxiety because I always thought of anxiety as social anxiety and I've never had that. I'm very social (almost too social). My anxiety came out in that I have too much energy, constantly moving and taking too fast and of course worrying and stressing. Note personally I've never had panic attacks which is something I've incorrectly always associated with those who have anxiety. Depression I felt I knew as it was sadness or numbness or self defeat etc. It was only when I got therapy properly I realised I had anxiety. I think this is partly because I'm naturally very extroverted and when only thought of anxiety as social. The point being Im not attuned to noticing it.

Well, as for most people it's been a stressful few months. My sister attempted suicide again. Lockdown generally. A house I was purchasing had many issues and then fell through. I'm living with housemates but they aren't very considerate, but are my friends so there's a lot of house politics. I've just found somewhere to rent and my long distance partner is moving up from Bude to Bristol to live with me (across the country for non uks). We've been together a year. I'm about to start my dream job which I've been preparing for literally for two years (mentally for eight years). All these things good and bad have put me on high alert. I've not been sleeping properly and I'm just finding myself very easily stressed out, lacking self confidence and generally just not a great person to be around. Tonight I finally put two and two together and think my anxiety has come back.

I'm really scared. I'm scared of letting people down being a burden and just working out how to get over it. I don't think I need therapy again or to go on pills as I feel it's very situational. However, I'm not sure what next steps to take. If any redditors can pass on their advice I would greatly appreciate it.

Please note, I'm currently (pre noticing it), ensuring I go on two walks outside the house a day, exercising three times a week, socialising with my friends and partner to discuss my issues, and listening to guided mediation to get to sleep. However I'm still feeling very easily stressed! Anything else that can be recommended or general support I'd really appreciate.

906,"Hi! I’m unsure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, and I apologise if it isn’t (Could someone perhaps point me in the right direction if that’s the case?) 

My family owns a beautiful, 100 year old mansion in the countryside. It’s very well kept and despite being a financial strain on my now retired parents, it is by far their most loved asset and they have devoted their married life to it.

The house is full of my family history as we are the 4th generation to own it. It’s therefore very “authentic” and has been kept practically in its original state since it was built in 1919. It is also tangible testimony of a very niche moment in my country’s history.

I would love to hear some ideas on how we could make a small profit from it without having to sacrifice our ownership to it- friends have suggested making it into a restaurant but that would sort of “violate” the condition we currently exist in, if we go by a normal restaurant set up. I love film and was considering perhaps offering it up as a set for producers to “hire” but I don’t even know where to begin with that. As you can see I’m at a loss for ideas here but would love to know if anyone could think of a solution. Thank you so much lovely community!",08Aug2020,1

i’m dysphoric about most of my body. my hair, face, chest, hips, height, voice, name. i’ve dealt with this during quarantine pretty well by wearing oversized clothes and wearing hats whenever i leave my house. when i’m staying at home, it’s hoodies and avoiding mirrors. but i’m not allowed to wear hats at college and i want to be able to exist outside my home and wear what i want without thinking about how my body and hair looks.

i like wearing makeup too and have a more “edgy” / “out there” style and i’m always worried it makes me look more femme. i always see guys on social media who look how i want and i know i can’t execute it because of the body i have.

there’s just hella stuff that i know is gonna bother me about having to go back to college because i’ve not had to deal with the stricter rules and expectations that come with being a student for a few months lol.

idk. sorry this is long. but any advice is really great :/",08Aug2020,1
908,I just bought magic mouse and i tried it for several minutes when i got back to go through my mac i found the my mouse was under my macbook when I listened to those clicks coming from left side it was smoother than the right one ..is this normal,08Aug2020,1
909,"So I (M21) have been with my girlfriend (F20) for a year now. It's been going really well but there is something that's been making me feel really insecure.

I'm not very good looking and I'm very insecure about how I look. My girlfriend knows this and normally laughs this off saying I'm being silly as I'm really attractive. I have lots of friends who I would say are much more attractive than me. And whenever I talk about them, my girlfriend sometimes mentions them being hot. This can sometimes make me feel insecure as I'm not very good looking and most of my friends are all like big handsome muscular guys who go to the gym 24/7. 

There have been a few incidences where she's made me feel really insecure. So I'm friends with this YouTuber who my girlfriend has always had a crush on. So when I introduced her to him, she was acting really strange. Like how a 14 year old girl would act when she would meet her celebrity crush. She wouldn't leave him alone all day and kept giving him hugs and even flirting with him. This made me feel insecure as she's not like that with any of my other guy friends. 

The 2nd incident was when she met my friend James. He's really handsome and works out a lot. So he has a much better body than me. So we were at the beach together and he was shirtless and my girlfriend kept starting at his abs and was zoning out while staring at them. Again this was making me feel really insecure. Since then, I've caught her looking at his abs on his Instagram many times. She tells me not to worry as she loves me and not him. She then said she finds his body attractive and it's the same as me finding a model attractive. But I don't find anyone else attractive. I only find my girlfriend attractive. To me, she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and no model even comes close to her. So I can't relate to the feeling of finding someone else attractive

The final incident was when we were hanging out with her ex. I got a bit jealous as they were talking a lot. She noticed I was feeling jealous and told me not to worry. She said I shouldn't worry as she loves me and not him as I have a better personality. And she then went onto say even if I'm not as hot as him, I'm a much better person who treats her well. This really hurt me. She was calling her ex hotter than me and that made me feel really insecure for the rest of the day and I could no longer have fun. I know she won't ever get back with him as he was really toxic but I'm feeling really insecure about how I look.

Do you think my girlfriend is in the wrong for doing all this? Or do you think I'm overreacting about all of it? I would appreciate any advice. Thank you",08Aug2020,1

911,"I'm in kind of a rough situation.
I'm 13 and this guy catfished me for my nudes and is threatening to leak them at my school. My mom said I don't need to go there anymore but my brother still goes there. 
If he shows my brother is there a way I can sue him for distribution of child pornography without my dad/brother finding out?
This has been really scary for me and I really need help. I could ask my mom to pull my brother out of the school but I'm not sure if she would.
Is it possible to get him locked up or something if he's also a minor?
as to why I sent them it's complicated, he was pretending to be a girl and we were good friends for a long time. One day she asked for nudes and said we couldn't be friends if I didn't send them I am VERY starved for female attention so I did it.
I looked it up and apparently I can get arrested and sent to jail for 1 year and a $1,000 fine.
So if I go to the police and ask for help I will be charged? I'm asking because that doesn't sound right, I would be going to them for help and that's not very helpful.",08Aug2020,1
912,"im very young, so sorry about grammar and everything

my great grandmother has been around for a long time, and is currently in her 90's! the last time i got to see her she seemed very happy and healthy for that age, still walking and having celebrations on holidays. sadly, my aunt recently texted me to tell me that my great grandmother had gotten the corona virus, and is in really bad condition. she was taken to the ICU, and denied an oxygen mask (i dont know why, sorry). from what it seems like, she probably wont make it through this, and i never really got to know her. they also cant have visits, of course, because of the virus. so my question is:

what should i tell my great grandmother who i dont know very well to comfort her in what may be her last days here? i plan on calling her through the hospitals number, and just getting to talk to her while i still can. should i even call at all?

thanks for any advice in advance.",08Aug2020,1

915,"im a teenager, to start off. so in many cases, I haven’t had the experience one person that’s older than me might have. for example, with relationships, I’m not the best and I make a lot of mistakes. I know this isn’t a relationship advice subreddit, but this post will be long and my last relationship has a lot to do with it. though mainly this has to do with me. 

when my last relationship ended, I ghosted the person I was dating ( a girl, I’m a boy ) because I felt like I needed to liberate myself from everything she had put on me. I won’t name names, so I’ll refer to her using pronouns. I don’t believe she was a bad person, at heart. she always had suicidal thoughts and never really had the mind to love herself. of course, I always tell myself that “ if she couldn’t love herself, how could she love me?”.  she hurt herself, a lot, and for a while I got her off of it. she really loved me, but she always had a problem with something in her life. no matter what she always had something to complain about, something she hated about herself. she constantly left me worrying about if she would hurt herself or worse when I went to bed. of course she never pressured me into helping her, I helped her because I loved her to death and only wanted to see her succeed in life. being teenagers we made a lot of empty promises to eachother, but I can’t help but feel like I made the most empty promises. my parents told me not to promise a whole lot to her as we are just teenagers. and I made the mistake of doing that. I would promise I would be in her life forever, saying I would never leave. I said this because I always ignored the signs, that she wasn’t getting better and she never truly stopped hating herself. for 8 long months I ignored these signs, big or small because I genuinely loved this girl. it sounds cringe but she meant so much to me and it hurts that I made a lot of empty promises to her and ended up leaving and ghosting her. it’s mean, I know. but I didn’t realize how much of a worse person I was becoming because of her problems that always felt like were being put on me. I got angry easier, I was always on edge and sometimes I felt like I had bipolar disorder of something like that ( of course I didn’t, I just felt this way ). she’s alive, and hopefully getting better and I can’t ask for any more than that because I just wanted and still want her to just live a good life. whether she finds someone or not that makes her truly happy I’ve always loved the things she indulged in like painting, writing, and drawing and it made and makes me so happy thinking about how passionate she was about those things. my point is, I feel like a bad person for making huge mistakes in my last relationship and I feel like I don’t deserve chances with anyone else or even friends. I have minor ( minor ) anger issues and I can’t help but feel that one day I’ll be past the point of improving myself as a person and I’ll never be able to put my past behind me. I’m constantly thinking about the mistakes I made in my last relationship, I can’t stop. I hate the thought of the things I did and the mistakes I made. I then proceed to tell myself “ it was your first serious relationship. it’s okay to make the mistakes you did.” and while that’s true, as it was my first relationship with a girl that was real, as the one before treated me terribly. but I feel like me thinking of that is just my mind making up excuses to hide the fact that I am a bad person in some way, I just can’t believe it myself so I think about these “ peace of mind “ solutions to calm my nerves about it. 

going a little back in this, in my last relationship, I say I made big mistakes. and I want to elaborate on that a little. I want whoever’s reading this to know what happened, and I want to be as transparent as possible. i almost feel completely obligated to so here we go. 

me and my ex were a good match in some ways, we shared some interests but mainly we both liked different things, had different senses of humor and so on. but in other things, we could relate and love eachother from what we had in common, and conversely with what he didn’t have in common. I don’t want this entire thing to make my ex seem like the she-devil or something because she genuinely is a good respectable person. it took so much time to know her and I was a little controlling in the process of it. I hated the thought of her wanting to talk to other people about her problems because I didn’t want her to hide things from me. I understand that’s a mistake, it’s okay to want to talk to other people about your problems, it doesn’t HAVE TO always be your significant other. but looking back, I was controlling. I didn’t abuse her, or anything but I felt like I did make her feel like I was the only person that could truly help her and that’s completely and utterly wrong. I feel so bad that I may have made her feel that way and it’s eating away at me. i made one other mistake that does eat away at me aswell, and that was making her uncomfortable when we were trying to pleasure eachother. I know none of you probably want to hear the details so I’ll keep this part short, but this is what eats away at me. we were trying to pleasure eachother one day, which we shouldn’t have been doing at all, by the way. but when we were she had, beforehand, given me FULL consent about anything, except for going “ all the way “ because we knew the consequences. we were responsible, and we didn’t do anything huge. we both know to be responsible and we both agreed on giving eachother consent on the things we did. I would be asking her over text if she was fully sure she wanted me to do certain things and if she was okay with it. she always said “if I didn’t want you to do that I wouldn’t say I want you to “. of course we did these things out of impulse and things like that and I know it was all a mistake to do those things in the first place. she always gave me constant and never really showed signs of not wanting to do anything, just being nervous and telling me to give her some time. which I did whenever she asked me to. 

I know this whole thing is convoluted, but I’m getting to the point know. I needed to give backstory and I’m sorry If you think I’m a total jerk and I don’t deserve anything. I hate the thought of that being true because i am so terrified to tell anyone in my family what happened because my father is super strict on things like that. understandably so, because he should be. I don’t know if I’m ready to tell them and it’s not really the fact that I haven’t told them, it’s the fact that I did it in the first place and I made the mistake knowing full well I shouldn’t have done those things. me and her both made bad mistakes in that relationship because it was both our first serious relationship. 

some months go on after we did those things, and we kept getting into arguments about minor things like if she was cheating or ever going to leave and vice versa. mainly, I was always worried about her cheating and it ended up being the catalyst among many other things that produced the downfall of our love. I know it sounds controlling and messed up but she showed signs of cheating sometimes and it scared the living life out of me. I hated the thought of seeing her love someone else because I loved her so much in so many different ways and I’m being completely honest right now. she made me so happy a lot of the time and I was always willing to excuse the bad things because I was so caught up in my sexual and romantic feelings for her that I lost sight of the things we always did wrong to eachother. we always got into bad argument and I wouldn’t let her leave until we resolved arguments, and it made her less able to come to an agreement with me or even a simple compromise and it was blatantly wrong to do that. im sorry. after eight months I had lost a lot of feelings for her because it was fight after fight after fight. and one day, she didn’t respond to me and I freaked out. I did that, because she was at someone’s house who made her do some things in the past and made her really uncomfortable. so I was on edge and I spammed her because she wasn’t responding at all for about 25 minutes and she finally responded saying we are over. I get that, I was being too controlling and protective and I should have given her a chance. the thing is though, she’s bisexual, and the person that was there was a girl, the person that made her uncomfortable. she would tell me “ I like girls more than boys, but I still love you more than anyone “ and it scared me thinking that she could cheat at any moment or fall in love with someone else at any moment. I fully accepted her sexual orientation, but it always scared me. I got worried and she broke up with me but then immediately regret it after and said she didn’t mean it. I told her it was for the best we did, but we ended up staying together for a little longer until I broke it off myself, and ghosted her and all that stuff I said at the beginning.

there are so many little details I wish I could say, the small things that pushed we closer to the edge of being a worse person and all the things she did wrong as well. she hated herself, constantly, and she ALWAYS had something wrong going on in her life, to the point where I felt like it was all an act. still, of course I tried my best not to question even if I did at some times and support her and change myself for her. I learned so much from her and learned how to control my anger a little bit more by the end of it all, and learned what not to do in a relationship and learned how to love someone better. I know for a fact I wasn’t a terrible boyfriend and I know for a fact I treated her better than anyone she had before, because she told me that herself. I loved her so much and it being my first ever serious relationship with how young I am I made so many little and big mistakes and now I just want full closure to move on and be a better person. what’s scaring me is that I’m not a good person, and I myself am hiding that and I can’t even see it. I want to be forgiven for the stupid stuff I’ve done and the tiny and little mistakes I’ve done because I know I deserve a second chance. 

she texted me a little after we broke up telling me about the thing I did that made her uncomfortable, and how she is so scared that I can use those things against her to embarrass her at school. I told her I would never ever do that because I wouldn’t, I hate the thought of her doing that to me and I would never forgive myself if I ever did that to her. I have nothing to gain from ruining her social life especially because I still care about her. I wish I had done more things right and it eats away at me every day, more than anything that school is right around the corner and when I get back everyone in my grade could hate me for not being a perfect boyfriend. seriously I did so much for her and I tried my hardest to fix myself when I knew I needed to. I was writing a literal book for her, I was going to paint a Rubik’s cube with each face representing different aspects of our relationship, I wrote notes to her all the time in school so by the end of the school day she could have something nice to read to make her feel better. god I loved her so much and I don’t care how cringe it sounds I never put more effort into anything else in my life other than school. 

I’m just scared she is going to spread rumours and tell everyone how I made her feel uncomfortable or used, which was never my intention as I always asked for consent and I always made sure she was okay with the things I did. I don’t want everyone to hate me for the things I did, especially because I don’t have many friends at school already and I can’t get the thought of my mind that I will be sitting alone, known as the weird kid that treated his girlfriend bad or something. and if my parents find out and the hate me too I couldn’t even describe how terrible my life would be. my grades could risk being dropped and I could become and even worse, sensitive and on edge person than I was with her. I want to move on and be her friend which I’m afraid isn’t possible anymore with how I ghosted her, but I did that because I needed to think about myself because she constantly hurt herself and threatened to do worse and it ate away at me so much. I hate the way I was and I just want closure and forgiveness to move on and not let those things I did out of impulse, urge, or anger define me as a person because I know I’m better than that.


to sum this up, im scared to death no one at school will like me and eventually my parents won’t. my parents are super loving and I would do anything for them to know the truth but not hate my guts for not telling them. im so sorry to the people I hurt in those times with my ex and I just want to move on and not make those mistakes again. 

thank you for reading this, if you did.",08Aug2020,1
917,"I’m moving back to college at the end of the month and rooming with my friends in student housing. Because of the law and university policy, they’re requiring students from restricted states to quarantine for 2 weeks. Some of our friends are from states with higher COVID rates and are choosing to quarantine outside of the student housing but one, let’s call her Karen, is kind of refusing to despite being from one of the top 3 states affected by COVID right now and has ALSO been traveling around the country to other restricted states AND will have to travel far again to get to our university. We’ve talked about the quarantine policy a lot and as much as I’ve tried to explain, Karen only seems to focus on how a 2 week quarantine is fucking her over and is so unfair to her—not how it’s meant to keep everyone else safe including her. My parents are both high-risk so I’ve been trying to be as safe as possible while I’ve been home, so going back to school is a big and scary deal. I've already tried to express this to her, but she just keeps saying how good she's been about mask-wearing and washing hands and how unfair it is that she has to quarantine and other people don't.

When she comes to school to “quarantine,” what she’s really planning on doing is staying in a hotel and lying about actually quarantining. This is one of many different conflicts we’ve had and at this point, I feel like I’m the only person who’s outwardly pushing back against her but she won’t listen to me or anyone else’s concerns and is acting incredibly selfish. So I've just backed down. I’m not sure what to do. It’s really weighing on my mental state to the point where I feel so angry every time I get a text from her and I feel really anxious about living with her.

I know I probably shouldn’t have been roommates with her in the first place and the ""easiest"" solution is to just not live with her, but she thinks we're friends and I’m way too anxious to have anymore conflict with her if I back out of living with her at such short notice. I also don't want to leave my other friend and I don't want to put her in an uncomfortable position between me and Karen since she's been trying to stay out of direct conflict, but definitely is on my side. I don’t really have a lot of friends and Karen doesn’t either, so despite her being so selfish and mean, I know how guilty I’d feel and how badly she'd feel if we left her alone during such a scary time. Also if I report her to anyone she'll know it's me who did it. I don't know how the school is planning to hold students accountable for quarantining outside, but the fact that she won't take it seriously unless she thinks she's being watched is an issue that will probably affect the future. 

She’s not sharing a room with me, she has a single room in our suite, and our group got assigned to the residence hall that we’ve been dreaming about so it's not like I'm sleeping 4ft away. But it would feel really unfair if me and my other roommate had to give it all up just for her to stay. I think that might make me feel a lot worse than I do now. This is my college experience too... If anyone should be giving up anything, it's her for making everything feel so toxic and unsafe before we even get to school I guess ultimately the place where we're living is not a bigger deal than feeling safe, but it feels like she's always been the one to get what she wants. She makes a really big deal about where she lives.

I don’t want to make enemies out of her since we’ll most likely be living together for the year. As much as I wish I had it in me to tell her I don't want to live with her, I don't have the guts to do it and I don't want to be the one to leave. 

I just want to know how I can make the best out of this situation and cope with all of this. How can I set boundaries? How do I call her out respectfully and effectively communicate my feelings to her without making conflict or making her hate me? How can I make sure that I’m safe without compromising my mental health or my happiness? Should I just pick my battles? Maybe I'm just being stupid and it's not a big deal.

923,"From now on I'll refer to the person as Emma (F23) (Not their real name):

I  (M23)  first met Emma in university when we both started our degrees on  the  same subject. She left an impression for her character and  wittiness but  due to us coming from 2 different upbringing backgrounds  and having  mainly different groups we did not hang out much the first 2  years but  saw each other occasionally in classes and lab work, plus  having to work  to survive did not help as I was paid tuition fees only  which I was  grateful for either way for my University and always worked  hard to do  well.

By end of 2nd  year Emma  invited me on the spot randomly one day after exams with my  best friend  at her place whilst she was living with her ex-boyfriend  and even though  I had a close the next day I was happy to tag along  without realising I  liked her and would usually choose to not do this  before a long shift.  This is important to the story as when I went  there her boyfriend(now  ex) was weird. It kind of slipped on the way  when I told her a bit more  about me that she works as well (albeit   mainly summers) and she pays  all the rent for the flat she lived at in  which I felt sad internally  but also respected as I was doing the same  so this showed me they are a  hard working person. After staying at her  place her ex would even ask  for money by hugging her and telling her  they need it for different  reasons. She agreed and only after telling  him to buy some things for us  as well. I found the whole interaction  bizzare and still remember it as  yesterday. I left home earlier than my  best friend which was friends  with Emma as well and since that day we  spoke again more occasionally.

Without   me knowing they had broken up, in end of 4th year she got a  scholarship  to study in our field and I got into a different  scholarship in a  domain close to ours field so after messaging her to  congratulate her  she told in a huge chain of emails that that last year  had been very  tough for her as she had broken up with her ex of a long  time (\*6+years)  and it had affected her a lot as he had abused her... I  felt horrible.  The part I mentioned in the previous paragraph was  replaying in my head,  maybe if I had reached out earlier I might have  done something, or  maybe I was just empathizing, either way even though  I had grown up  abused as well I could feel for her and asked her if we  can meet in  general to catch up in person whenever she was back in  town (as her  scholarship was abroad from where we stayed). A few months  later we did  meet and without going into details Emma had learned from  my best friend  from the first day at uni as she had found my name  interesting (cause  personally I find it weird, my origin is different  from my nationality  and thus paperwork has a funny spelling in my  name). This is something I  do not share with many people as I come from  a ""third world"" country in  Europe so I was happy she found it  interesting and after elaborating  more in the pub and her for her life  we spoke about many things (and she  introduced me to her friend as the  ""smartest guy in class and that he  would always ask questions"" which I  found amusing but also slightly  untrue as she is brilliant herself  especially with the institution she  worked for her scholarship abroad)  she also apologized to me (from some  unknown reason) for dating 2  people now in the country abroad, but I  told her she needs not to  apologize as they are all adults and if there  is consent and  understanding from all sides and especially after such a  long  relationship is normal for people to go out and have fun.

After   talks from politics, science, art, music and meeting another good   friend of hers we walked back at her place by 3am when I thought I would   have gone home by 8pm. This is the part when I realized my feelings  are  real and why its important to the story as she hugged me (she in   general loves hugs, so it might not have been she liked me as well)...   but, when I went to let go... she did not let me go and hugged me even   tighter. I, without knowing how to behave, hug her again and we   awkwardly stay a few more seconds like that. She lets me go, looks at me   and after we both say goodnight I walk home... it made me think a lot   on the way back. After that day I kept up in touch even more, and even   though I am quite on the fence about social media (personal opinion, as   with everything it can be used for both good and bad according to the   user) I started ""liking"" her posts and photos more often, even love   reacting some. I even told my best friend about it as he was the one   that shared my real origin with her (nationality wise) after she had   asked about me and being very intrigued every time they worked together   in class.

Thus, when she was back   near before new years (and before Corona hit) I was so excited when  she  told me to meet up I went out of my way and bought a cologne (made  the  girl at the store laugh as I was telling her what should I pick  based on  budget, but also to not be too strong with the smell and what  would a  girl like) I bought a cheap watch and tried wearing better  clothes. We  went together and I thought I would see more friends of  hers but it was  just me and her. After staying in the pub till 1-2am I  learned more  about her abuse and I shared more about mine. We spoke  about the future,  and she even asked me what I wanted to do. I told her  my plans about  the possibility of abroad work and she said another  thing that confused  me as she mentioned she would be sad if I chose  that place as I would be  so far away from her... I lost my words and  just said reluctantly that I  could see closer to her country abroad  that she was working at. We  walked home, and after speaking one last  time we hugged each other, but  this time I chose to hug her tightly on  my side and after staying  a bit  awkwardly we both went our ways.

After   new year eves I was sending her understandably by now that I had   feelings longer and more frequent messages. She is a bit of a tomboy as   well and even friends have made fun of my huge length messages, but I   never double text or demand answers and I usually curate them for them   as I tend to remember many things closely about people I care and   whoever has seen it has told me in person how much they appreciate it.   The reason I am mentioning this is because after she send that she will   be back in a huge message of her own responding to mine (which she did   not have to) and me being excited replying after an hour with an equal   lengthy message and that I would be happy to see her after she told me   place and date, she just ghosted me and left it on seen after I was   waiting for her message as she said to tell me exact place from the 2   she recommended... in the beginning I did not think ill, I thought she   probably is busy, late etc. But by midnight, in comparison to the   original message on us meeting by 7pm, there was nothing...

I   chose to not bother her as I saw her active and did not want to make  it  awkward as honestly it happens, but it did hurt... she was dating   another guy as well as I saw photos online but again that is ok we are   not together. So, after being sad I continued my studies. Fast forward   to 2 months when corona hits, I message after a week or 2 all my family   and friends that I care for, and since Emma was alone (in the sense of   not having family in the country abroad) I thought about her so I   messaged her without mentioning the previous interaction (which had been   like 2.5 months ago in comparison to almost weekly and 2-3 day  messages  between us in frequency).

She  was  delighted to hear from me answering in more lengthy text messages  and I  was to hear from her. And at the end she mentioned she  appreciated me  checking up on her, in which my messages were more  moderate than past  times, I only reacted with a thumbs up emoji...

We   continued speaking every week or 2 and then recently we even had a  call  which she asked me if I wanted as she did not like texting as much  in  which I agreed and we ended up speaking for 4+ hours...in which she  also  mentioned with a sad but caring remark that she cares about me  when I  expressed some frustration with some family matters and that I  care for  her as well when I told her I did not want her to be sad about  me as I  will manage.

After that  call I  told my best friends about it (and they both knew most of the  things as I  share most things with them and trust them as my 2nd  brothers) and they  told me that they care for me, and the she is not a  bad person, but  perhaps I should not choose to ask her out in person  when she is back.  Mind you, again she is not a bad person, she is  wonderful, witty, smart  and one of the most strong and beautiful women I  have ever seen. I know  my friends are just looking after me but I was  thinking on doing so soon  when she is back but then she mentioned (for  the first time ever as she  never told me these things) after me sending  her a link to a common  interest of ours that she would try to see it  as soon as she can, (even  though I already said when she can and wants)  and then she mentions due  to the date she has (again mind you she is  more wealthy than me so I kid  you not she had flown to see family, ofc  with precautions) that she is  even was going on a date. I could not  help but find it amusing and told  her to enjoy it! (and lowkey wanted  to respond with  ""Bruh, dating in  another island in the middle of a  pandemic? I am not even mad, that is  amazing, respect!"" as its true its  too surreal but not surprised as well  entirely as she is a great  person.). I should also mention that in our  last call I learned more  sometimes, not always, she is a bit of a  ""bubble"" by mentioning that I  should travel more, even though I don't  have the capacity right now  both due to the virus and financially, (but i  am getting better soon as  I managed to get a good job, again I  understand in these trying times I  am very lucky and am very grateful  and looking forward to help my  family) in which she felt sad when I had  to tell her directly but also  caringly that I can't afford it hahaha.

I   really really care for this person. I know our future, and most of the   world is going to be slightly more chaotic especially with Corona. And   people are literally dying and I really should be getting back to   finishing my work for the degree before I start work soon in 2 months,   but still I could not sleep that night...when she told me she has a date   this time I was having a deep feeling in my chest and could not  breathe  100% when sleeping, and for 2 nights I was just thinking about  it.

I,  as I usually do, went  online to research on why would a person mention  they have a date. Most  likely answer I read where about being friends or  not being interested  but I have told her indirectly that I think the  best love stories (as  yes... I am a hopeless romantic slightly) start  from a good frienship  and she agreed. And in the pub last time when it  was the 2 of us when  she mentioned some bits about the emotional abuse  from her ex I  answered back on those statements and even told her she is  beautiful,  and we are both quite smart, or I would like to believe, and  hopefully  she sees I never hid most parts of who I am with her. Heck i  even  mentioned to her many times when she was surprised with some things  on  my background that I choose who to share with. Another response  online  was that some girls also test guys they like by saying this to  show  that they are in demand and that we should move faster if we care  for  them... (in retrospect I am indeed slow for these matters, but that  is  because I care, like even for sleeping I can't do it immediately it   would take me some time to know the person etc and again personal   opinion no worries at all if you like having fun! Heck, my friends are   telling me I should be more open to these approaches but honestly I have   not had time, but my life its getting slightly better so thus all my   feelings and emotions for Emma re-surfacing even mores strongly as I   have run out of excuses on why no to do something).

OH   and I forgot I also got to her place one more time before she went  back  after the last time in the pub, but it was many of us hanging out,  but  again I swear, in the end when we were not as drunk and I was  ready to  walk home, we hugged each other tight and even my best friend  told me  what was that about jokingly (as we live nearby and we walked  together  late at night).

So guys,   especially gals if possible, am I just overthinking this? (quite  likely I  know...) or is there hope that she has feelings for me, but  due to her  just being out (for close to 2 years now) from a very bad  and long  relationship she is just finding herself so she does not want  to risk a  more serious relationship as she also sees me as a good  friend?  Honestly, she is a great person, she also loves her family a  lot and I  just want to see her happy with whoever she wants, but... if I  did not  care I would have not written this huge message, and I am just   perplexed...

Mind you, we are  both  going to be in different countries when the next academic year  starts  (trying to be vague as possible again due to anonymity just in  case) so  even if something were to happen I have never asked her  directly what is  her opinion on long distance relationships but I am  aware they are not  as good from my best friend and in general reading  online. But, do you  think I am alright in thinking long term, that  perhaps when we both  settle down I can ask her? But I also mean the  world is also more fluent  in traveling (I mean pre-Corona, hopefully  with new terms and  protections from now on) so I could hope for  something like this? I am  sorry if I am not making sense, but I would  appreciate as I said some  feedback.

Thanks again and sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, English is not my native language!

**TL;DR:   Person I developed feelings for after knowing them for 4-5 years and   that we have been getting closer lately, in the middle of the pandemic   told me after our last message that they have a date. I do have feelings   for this person and they have shown me the same, so are they just   trying to play hard? Should I persist if they think I am taking it slow?   Is there anything more to it? Quite confused.**

926,"I know that sounds super dramatic but hear me out. 

In 2015 I accidentally took some synthetic LSD (acid) and had the single handedly worst night of my life. 
Here is a quick rundown of what I experienced.
I was watching cool runnings when it started really kicking in, I literally got sucked into the TV screen and was inside the bobsled! Everything was awesome until I remembered the sled crashes in the movie.. thats when my night had a turn for the worst. I then convinced  myself I was having a heart attack for what felt like hours along side going in and out of a white room where my ex girlfriend was screaming at me. 
Pretty fucked up right? That night changed my whole lifes trajectory. In a strange way I am thankful that happened to me, it helped me wake up to myself and escape the drug path I was heading down. 

Anyway there are now times where I am dreaming and it is super similar to the feeling of LSD, and because its been so long I have slowly started to be able to control it. So I'll be dreaming and me self aware! Then ill be able to manipulate the world around me its freaking insanely awesome. However this is super hard to do and I am still getting the hang over it, I want to learn how to get better at it and well.. become the master of dreams 🤣 pretty cool title if you ask me haha. 

My question is does anyone else who has dived deep into hallucinogens had a similar experience? Or anyone else know how to control their dreams? 
Please share your experiences with me 😀",08Aug2020,1

928,"Apologise for the massive wall of text! 

So for background:  I'm living in a house share. I live with two other girls. When I first moved in I was working a local job but as soon as we went into lockdown I lost my job as the firm's recruitment slowed down. I did manage to find other work for a while but had to quit because my mental health has not been the greatest during the lockdown. During this time I've decided to work on myself and my health which I have been neglecting. I've also decided to work on a few projects that I wanted to start as a side hustle to keep myself occupied and to teach myself new skills. I will try to find work later on in the year after my health is better. I just don't think I'm in the best shape right now to cope with a job.

Last month, when the lockdown eased up I decided to rent a studio over the weekend and spend some time by myself. I was becoming anxious about being cooped up in the same house all day and seeing the same faces. I just wanted to get away and go somewhere different. This was not a planned trip and I had not discussed it with my roommates. I told them on the day that I was leaving but neither of them asked me where I was going or why and told me to enjoy my trip. I assumed they were fine about it. Neither of them texted me all weekend. 

Now prior, to the weekend getaway, we had an incident in the house. Long story short, one of the girls  (S) out of nowhere decided to mimic rappers, pulled her hood up and did a rap stance and everything. They both started giggling and then the other one (F)  went up to S and said 'n\*gger'. Which S started rapping in a verse whilst they were both sniggering. 

I was really shocked and uncomfortable. Just to give you a bit of background I'm of Pakistani descent. I immediately asked them why they thought it was okay for them to use that word? We got into a small argument where S argued that it was okay to say because 'they' call each other that all the time and she and her boyfriend use it amongst themselves. I pointed out that I would be unhappy if someone called me a 'Paki' or used the term around me. She instead that she would never do that to me and she is sorry she made me uncomfortable. 

Now the other girl, F,...well she speaks four languages and is from Spain. She insisted that she's never heard of this word...and doesn't know what it means because she is Spanish and '...in Spanish we say 'negro' and that it is the British who twisted it and she isn't to blame.' Okay, well you were the first person to say it? 

I just gave up on the discussion as it was obvious that no one was going to agree and I could not be bothered to argue anymore. 

Anyway, after I booked the trip I came back and felt better in myself and started being more productive. The break from the house did me good and it was nice to be in a different city even for three days. When I came back I noticed there was an atmosphere in the house and both of them we're kind of standoffish with me. Forward, to two weeks later and I found at that the Spanish girl, F, thought that the only reason I went away was that my other flatmate was going back to France. She thought that I didn't want to spend time alone in the house with her. I had also refused to go on a shopping trip with her, the week prior so obviously I didn't want to hang out with her and hated her. Now, these, are all the things she had said to my other housemate, S. There was more dumb shit said but these two things stood out to me because I thought they were really fucking bizarre. 

So here's the thing. I don't hate her but we are different people. I feel happier being alone in my room and doing my own thing. I like to be very independent and prefer to have friends who are similar. I don't like to rely on other people for things and will always try to find a way to do my own thing. I very rarley ask for help from someone else. 

Now F  wants to be active and do something every day. She will offer to take me shopping but when I refuse and tell her I can sort out my food shopping she seems unhappy. I think she thinks I'm refusing because I don't like her. This isn't the case. I just prefer online deliveries because it saves me time and I can bulk buy and I don't have to rely on anyone else to drive me there and back. 

I do find her to be rude at times but I don't think she does this on purpose and suffers from a case of foot in mouth. I've not really paid her much attention.

Am I misunderstanding her in some way? I found some of her behaviour and reactions to be odd. For example, we all went to town the other today and out of nowhere she kept insisting that she was better than me and that I was a rude person but tried to play it off as a joke. I don't really react when people do things like this. I tend to assume they have low self-esteem and just pity them. I just ignored her. There's some other stuff as well that she does that is really odd. Like she will put her food on my shelf in the fridge and if I move it to her shelf she puts it right back. She once put 6 beers on my shelf.  I asked if I could remove them since I was going shopping the next day for food and wanted my space back. Anyway, I think I upset her when I asked to remove them because apparently she put them there for everyone in the house? 

Am I overthinking this? Or is this girl just bizzare? My gut says there is something off about her.",08Aug2020,1

* when I was a kid I was not allowed to play with the other kids, because I was ""weird"".

* I have never really had friends.
* I've never been in a relationship. 
* I never had sex.
* when I was 16 I was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and neglect.

# the major change 

* a few months ago I decided to start going to a BDSM Dungeon because I haven't had physical contact for 4 months, because of Corona.

* my plan failed. I found someone nice beautiful, caring, and responsible.
* I fell in love pretty much immediately.
* we talk everyday.
* we see each other every Thursday for bondage.
* I have been to her house multiple times, it feels more like home than my apartment.
* she visits me in my apartment.

* she's married. ""her husband is nice""
* they are Polly, but because of society and kids I cannot move in with them.

936,"I (22m) matched with girl (24f) last week of April. So we had that chemistry and we used to talk till 4 or 5 about random stuff. Things were going great until June.

So this girl had a usmle exam this November and she wanted to focus on that. Suddenly 2nd week of June she blocked me on social media. She said she's sorry but I am too distracting for her and she couldn't focus on studies because of this. I told her okay and since it's lockdown in my country we couldn't really meet. We decided to meet on 1st December similar to plotline of movie before sunrise.

After 2 days she texted me again and we decided we'll keep in touch every weekend sat and Sun. But I was quite mad because she blocked on other social media and I could just call her that's it. So last week of June I told her that we should just meet according to plan.

As I was detoxing from her, I texted her that I would like to continue this strangership. After come 2nd week of July, she called me and said a guy is flirting with her and she didn't knew what do to. I got jealous and tried to cut this strangership off (PS it's lockdown my mental health is already fucked up couldn't think straight). She confessed that she actually wanted to know my opinion of how to shove the guy off and not that she was interested in him. 

After couple of weeks, I was really tired of calling her and she mentioning that she's busy studying which I understand and would often not call till 2 days. The thing about us is that we used to write musicals and so I wrote a song and told I am sorry but we should continue this after her exams. And she was okay with it and said she'll miss her favourite person.

So again after 3-4 days I called her again(detoxing and lockdown effects). This time she didn't pick up and texted that she's busy and she'd call me tomorrow which she didn't. We exchanged a few emails discussing life and love. I called her again after 2 days, she didn't pick up. Next day she calls and we had a tiny chat because I had to work. She texted me that she's near my area but with friends. I wanted to meet her but she wanted to keep it a secret. I called her later at night and she said plans and she'd call me tomorrow which she didn't.

Now as I texted her funny incident that happened with me a week ago, she didn't reply for a week. As I said we write each other love poems which I did today and called her. She didn't pick up either , so I texted her. She emailed me her poem and informed me that she is super busy with studies now and that if she doesn't revert to my email or calls, she's call after her exams.

Now I feel like I just lose my self respect. Here I am trying to stay in touch because I realised that 2020 is fucking bitch year and I don't want to miss out on such incredible girl and there she is ignoring my texts calls.

What should I do, should I just be straight forward and tell that it's over and self respect &gt; possible love or should I just stay patient

937,"Now,to clarify,the culture,it's great,honestly,but what i hate is the ""gangsta"" approach to everything. For example,in my school(i'm quite young)almost the whole class smokes,most weed too,and they act like you're some sort of pussy if you don't join them,now you could argue,well that just sounds like a your school problem,but no,that's literally EVERY.WHERE. not only in school,in the street too,literally every where,it's this gangsta 1990-2000 kinda  vibe. most of the streets are shitholes,LITERALLY SHITHOLES,rats,trash,homeless people,not to  mention a certain group of people that is a big minority in my country but i would be called racist if i mentioned them,with a certain knack for pickpocketing and other such behaviour. again,the people's general behaviour is honestly disgusting(again,the gangsta type of behaviour). You could argue,well you're just a pussy,or a snob,but honestly it's a prefference. Me personally,i love politics,LOVE politics,and where i live,well..let's just say that the former prime minister was memed about his corruption for 3 years.Also,there ain't many job opportunities.Like the economy is quite a big pile of shit,and there is no future for me,i cannot rise up,above say middle class,even though,obviously i would want to,who woulnd't?!,i was honestly thinking about yknow going to college,studying abroad,emigrating somewhere,but i don't really know if i,well,my parents,are financially well enough to help me out with that. Now to clarify,this isn't some snobbish dream of mine,my ma actually was very on board with the idea of our whole family moving to the UK a few years back,but we decided against it,and lately she asked me quite a lot about studying abroad. Now,besides the financial issues,i would see some obvious prejudice from people in my new country,some obvious stereotyping,given the actions of that group of people mentioned above.

944," Im 19 my boyfriend is 20, our one year is in 2 months and we’ve been friends for a few years and I often think of leaving him just because I want to be single? Firstly I can’t make that seem like a valid reason to break up and I dont really know what I want to gain from it guilty enough I think I want to experience more connections and moments without a boyfriend before I settle down with someone for a longterm and the creeping realization of this relationship lasting long is becoming bittersweet. 

 I love my boyfriend, he’s special to me, every so often he gives me butterflies when we kiss I like how we have our inside jokes and our dynamic is not something Ive gotten with other’s but Im a live life to the fullest person and he’s a “I can stay in this comfort zone forever” I think with love our relationship can last as long as it’s meant to considering we’ve developed healthy communication and things as so but out of my own personal selfishness it’s coming down to me just wanting freedom and of course with that freedom and us breaking up I dont expect him to stay tied down and waiting for me to come back when I feel “content.” Im just confused I’ve only been in one other relationship and it only lasted 4 months and my current boyfriend is my first long term and the only person i’ve been on dates with, we both had sex for our first time’s together, he’s been the first man to treat me well and love me whole, etc. 
(Last boyfriend was a toxic piece of shit)

 He’s a good man and I can’t say im dodging a bullet letting someone like that go but the thoughts on this can sometimes feel suffocating because I feel a sense of betrayal towards him when i know full well he’s expressed how happy he’d be staying with me for the long run. I want to be with him yet I want to live a single life while im young but I don’t want to lose him forever and even if I accept that Im risking that by breaking it off over this obviously my love for him doesn’t want that. Maybe im suffering from commitment issues but I dont think of cheating I think cheating is insanely wrong and you could just break up if you’re plotting on that, but I’ve never settled down with the past guys I talked to before me and my boyfriend got together, I guess I just need advice and feedback from people who have been in similar situations or can help me figure this out. I dont wan’t to make a decision i’ll regret. 

TLDR: I want to be single but then I want to be with my boyfriend who I love and it might be commitment issues causing a war between the two, I dont know if I should stay or go.",08Aug2020,1
945,"I cannot switch to another provider. There are only 2 that service my house and one of them has data limits. My ISP is clueless and unable to resolve any of my issues. I have intermittent internet that makes me drop from discord calls, facetime, frequent disconnects from games, queues dont show up for games, i have lag to certain games servers when running trace routes.  My speed tests are all 400 download 20 upload. I have a strong connection when the connection is established, but the reliability of that connection to not drop makes the internet next to unusable for what I use it for which is gaming, work calls, etc. I am exhausted with this issue.

I am not connected to wifi and it happens on multiple devices that are hard wired as well as our phones that are obviously wifi. I'm literally at my wits end. My ISP can't figure out the problem because my speed tests are normal, even though I have virtually unusable internet for the things I use it for.

Sam and my sister have a kids together. We all live together in the same how with my grandparents my dad and sams mom, my room is next to sister/sams room. The other night (maybe three days ago now) Sam sent me a text saying he wanted to talk but not over text so i said just come into my room (cuz it was 12am and i was in bed) and he starts saying “hey i wanna tell u something but idk how this is super hard blah blah blah” and i said “just out with it im sure its not that bad” and then he proceeds to tell me he finds me attractive, he’d fuck me, he wishes my sister was like me cuz she is so insecure and manipulative and im not, he’d throw “jokes” every so often “hey can i see something” or “r u sure u dont wanna fuck” and i keep saying now, keep in mind im in SHOCK not knowing really what to say, and he goes on “just keep the between us blah blah” and im like i understand and he hugs be but does that weird slide his had across my side so her glides one across my left boob (idk if he meant to do that on purpose but whatever) i move away and he keeps talking repeating the same things just in different ways and then when he goes to leave he leans over my bed (im sitting up at this point) and kisses me on the cheek.... im freaking out inside and he leaves but not without saying “r u sure u dont wanna do anything” and im like “im sure BYE.” Since then ive been paranoid (i dont think he’d actually do anything else) but ive been locking my door at night and shit like that and trying to avoid him as much as possible but im the designated babysitter cuz Sam,sister, Sams mom and my father all work and my grandparents can barely get around for themselves let alone the babies (sister has a two year old from a previous relationship) they dont make enough for a babysitter but my dad but he isnt gonna pay A TON for a babysitter so because im not working im the one to babysit so i cant avoid him entirely.... the big question WTF DO I DO??",08Aug2020,1

949,"I'm at college. I'll be there for another three years. I enjoyed school, mostly.

Whilst at college, I have come across so many people who engage in what I can best describe as 'moral posturing'. It's people putting others, or other groups down in a way that seems to be to make themselves feel better or 'morally superior'. I didn't see this sort of behaviour so much whilst at school.

To give an example, I saw some people trying to say that those who went to fee paying schools (not me, in case it's relevant) are immensely privileged (compared to those who went to state schools), don't deserve money/scholarships from hardship funds because they \*must\* have rich parents, don't have any excuse not to do well in life etc. It's all just so judgemental and fails to treat people as individuals, considering their individual circumstances. It makes me sad.

Other examples include people turning on or outing their friends for not following their strict views on social distancing (e.g. for not wearing masks in the streets, which isn't even recommended or mandated by the government in my country). There then seems to be some sad mentality of people trying to 'catch people' who aren't complying with particular COVID rules to report to the police/college. But it's in the sense that they seem to by \*hoping\* that they'll catch someone. They're going out of their way to \*find\* people who aren't complying. They seem to \*enjoy\* the idea of being able to report someone and get them in trouble.It's like neighbours are turning on each other instead of helping and supporting each other.

Similarly, I see people being pushing for 'feel good policies' that they try to pressure the the college into implementing, but have absolutely no evidence to back up their efficacy. Again, it seems like people come out in favour of these simplistic and evidence-less policies as a way to be like ""hey everyone, look at me I care so much about issue X, I'm going to start a petition to implement policy Y"" and look like morally superior gods. Of course, anyone who points out the flaws in their solution is shouted down and told they don't care about issue ""X"". Again, this makes me so sad, as there are so many problems in our world and we need to come together to fix them with evidence based solutions, not policies that sound good on a petition and make your Twitter/Facebook feed look good.

I lay low and just get on with my work - I've never been on the receiving end of any of this. But it makes me really really sad to see. People putting others down, turning on each other, trying to catch each other out and get them in trouble. People who prefer more to \*look\* like they care about making a change rather than \*actually\* doing something to make a change. People are just so ready to tear other down, instead of focusing on their own problems. Is this what everyone in life is like? Will it ever stop?

How can I just cut all this out? I could cope if this was a small minority, but it seems to be more like a culture? I can't explain how much I hate it and how sad and hopeless for the world it makes me feel. I just think when I finish college I'll find somewhere quiet to live off the grid(ish) and keep my self to my self? I know that sounds ridiculous but I think it's the only way to avoid this and stay sane?",08Aug2020,1

We were perfect in the beginning. And then she lied to me and went behind me back and snuck around with a guy. And that hurt me greatly. Ever since then i noticed that i went back to my old toxic ways. I dont want to be this person. I want to move on. I want to be better.

953,"So for a bit of background, after a shitty manipulative relationship when I was 14-17, I've struggled with severe self esteem issues. I also suffer from anxiety.

I'm 20 now and currently dating a genuinely kind man who I trust. However, my insecurities are getting in the way of the relationship because every time I remember the fact he masturbates to erotic photos/videos on Twitter/Instagram, I'm filled with anxiety and I physically start shaking. I want to emphasise he has is not addicted to porn, he watches this stuff a normal amount (whatever that is).

Even though I cognitively don't see a problem with it, my anxiety plays it up as some sort of lite cheating, which is crazy. My insecurties persuade me that it's wrong that he's being almost ""intimate"" with these sex workers. I get flooded with concerns that whoever he's watching is probably better than me in many ways, and that he's watching it because I can't fulfil his needs. My anxiety believes that if I can't fulfil every sexual need he has, then I'm just not good enough; it's just not good enough. 

Part of the issue is I've never really been that interested in porn and I feel like I don't GET it?? If that makes sense at all.

This is getting in the way of our relationship. I just want to be a normal person who is cool with their partner getting off to porn. He's even offered to stop watching it and only use my nudes etc, but I said absolutely not; I'm the problem here. How can I just be okay with it and not feel jealous/anxious/scared?",08Aug2020,1
954,"I was part of a group project, but ultimately with the way things worked out, I ended up doing a majority of the work myself. Towards the beginning of the course, they were more receptive to working as a group, but as time progressed, I found that many of my group members started making more and more excuses to get out of it. (I.e. I have a final for another class.)

Towards the end of the class, because I was concerned we wouldn't finish on time, I started trying to create the outlines so we'd have a general idea of what to do. While another group member would set up the actual sessions over zoom, a lot of the time, it was either me or another group member talking. They were either silent, or just ""uh huh"" most of the time.

Group member C of them created a form to do the data sheets, but I ended up having to really set the outlines for a lot of the project. When one of them said they'd do the results, they said they ""ran into trouble"" and put out the most basic data entry from the statistical software. Group member A followed through and wrote the discussion...but it was very vague, blamed external events for our results, and I ended up having to rewrite essentially the entirety of that section. I wrote all the addenda. I wrote the introduction and abstract. Because of the time crunch, I did group member C's part and really highlighted that the results section was left and if he could work with group member C who had that role. Group member C did do some number crunching which we added to the report, but ultimately it was 10 minutes of work and a small part. The night before the final, I tried communicating what was left but Group member A totally ignored me and group member B blamed me telling me I didn't tell her what to do (when I have proof on the google doc and texts that she needed to write up the results.

I gave my TA and instructor a heads up in advance that I was concerned that I was doing disproportionate amounts of work. However, I got a follow up today with my professor asking what everyone did. I'm not sure if it's my fault for being too pushy (I swear I wasn't trying to be anyone's boss, but we genuinely would not finish on time otherwise).

955,"So the titles rather self explanatory but I want to give a little context.

I go to NCA&amp;T and have recently moved in as a freshman and I don't know anyone else on campus aside from my cousin and my friends boyfriends, other than that I have no other connections. Because of the threat of Corona, some of us (me) were given rooms to ourselves so it's one to a room instead of two. (In suites where its normally four to a room, there's only two to a room but that's a tangent). I feel like I have lost my chance of befriending a roommate.

Our welcome week is going to be mainly online, aside from a few things that we will have to walk somewhere to do. I have mainly online classes but I assume that the classes I have in person will take social distance measures and separate the students whenever possible. Since we are all encouraged to avoid large groups of people and try to keep all necessary gatherings to a minimum if possible, I find I can't really talk to anyone in the cafeteria. Additionally, most of my friend group branched off into different school or went to pick up a trade.

956,"So my boyfriend of almost a year has mentioned occasionally before that he texts his ex sometimes but they were just friends and it was nothing to worry about. Early in our relationship i became upset because my boyfriend has depression issues and one day he was upset and i literally couldn't say or do anything to make him feel better, which made me feel completely useless and then suddenly she texts him hello and pops a joke and suddenly he seems happier.

I never expressed my sadness that she was able to make him feel better because i didn't want to come off as a jealous freak that early in our relationship. For awhile after that i never heard of her again and it's was told to me that they didn't talk regularly just on occasion. However around our 8 months he had a complete break down cause he hadn't had his anti-depressant's and i was on call with him but again I couldn't do anything to help him and he said he just needed to be alone ended the call.

The next morning he called and seemed better and i told him i was glad he was okay and then he told me that he had called and talk to his ex that night and she helped and made him feel better. Maybe it's because i'm emotional but i started to cry and I told him that it really hurt me that i his girlfriend couldn't do anything to help him and it really hurt that he confined in his ex another girl who he use to have a romantic relationship with instead of me. He apologized but said they are friends and that's all 'that they ended their relationship for a reason'.

I know i might be just acting out of jealously idk, but it makes me very uncomfortable that he talks to her and goes to her, another women in such an emotional state. I made it known that because of my insecurities and trust issues due to past relationships that it made me very uncomfortable that he still spoke to his ex especially in such situations. He said he understood. Again after this I hadn't heard about her again until yesterday.

So my bf has run out of his medicine and he can't get his new prescription for a few days and a lot of things annoy him because he is off it. I'm suppose to be starting to wake up early because my college classes start soon but for some reason i keep sleeping late and i don't wake up till like 1. so he has been trying to help me and the other morning he was spam calling me at 9am. I picked up but i was still out of it and he was trying to talk to me but i was barely responding so he got angry and was like ""fine just go back to sleep"" and then hung up.

2 mins later he texted me he was gonna go hang out with that ex in a few days just to hurt my feelings cause he knew how i felt about it. I called him and we argued and he said shes been wanting to hang out with him lately so now i also knew they had obvi been texting and i didn't know.

Later that day he eventually called back and I told him that him saying that to me was very bad and he can't treat me like that just because he was annoyed i was still asleep and he apologized and said he wish he could take it back. I also told him i was absolutely not and never will be okay with him going to hang out with his ex. He is also a very jealous boyfriend and i asked him if he would be okay if i ever texted or went to hang out with my ex and he admitted he wouldn't and said he understands but he feels like he is being rude to her. At this point I want to say SHE IS UR EX U BROKE UP FOR A REASON WHY DO U CARE UR IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME NOW. but i didn't. so i honestly don't even know anymore.

961,"My friend suffers emotionally from something and I want to help him and understand the cause of this issue.

(We'll call him M)
M told me that he feels as if he fakes his emotions and is scared that he is manipulating people. He said that he is good at reading people's emotions and can anticipate their reactions. M feels like he is emotionless and that his other friends think that he's a robot. They think he's very cold and calculating, and when arguing about something he forgets the emotional side of things. 
He likes facts and logic. They are clear to him. M tries to understand other people's raw and complex emotions, but he finds it extremely difficult. He is very smart and enjoys debating with people, but it frustrates him when emotions are involved. He believes that logic=science, and he doesn't understand why people bring emotion into the conversation. This frustrates him a lot because he feels as if everyone else is in this club (of being able to process their/other's emotions) but he is excluded. 

This is kind of all over the place, so I'll give an example:
At his friend's funeral M made himself cry (even though he was actually extremely sad) because he felt that if he wouldn't, others would think he's an emotionless robot. After he got home he cried for real (or at least he felt that was the socially appropriate thing to do when alone). I told him that everyone deals with death differently, but he said that he feels guilty. M felt guilty that everyone who cried at the funeral was real and that he was a faker.

M is a good person, and he hasn't told anyone about this except for me. He was afraid that I wouldn't trust him if he told me, that I would be worried that he'd manipulate me. I told him that I'm not scared.
I also mentioned multiple times over these past months speaking to a therapist but I haven't convinced him yet. 

I just want to know if there's an explanation for the thoughts M has. Of course this whole thing doesn't truly describe what goes on inside his head, but I tried my best. 

(I've looked these up after reading similar posts, from what he's told me, he does not have the symptoms for:
Antisocial Personality Disorder, Schizoid personality disorder, Alexithymia.)

962,"Names changed for identity protection. Long but need advice.

I (23F) will be visiting my sister (26F - Lia) this weekend (I live in LA, she lives in SF). She rents a house with an older old friend of ours (48 - Mary) who has two boys (12 and 13 years old).. Recently my sister's goddaughter (Bella), her brother (9year-old - Max), and their mom (Sara) had to go live with Lia and Mary due to some issues with Sara's husband. Mind you that Sara is also Mary's daughter and is the two other boys half-sister. Lia, all of the people mentioned and I, have been friends for a really long time and we don't want to lose the friendship but after seeing their personal life so much we are starting to reconsider if they are good people or not.

The two boys don't like Sara, Max or Bella. They have always treated them badly but their parents have never punished them for such behavior or any bad behavior while we are at it. They think anything the two boys do is funny and because they're ""boys"". Sara is also not the best mom, she is more interested in messing around with various men than care for her children even tho she can't shut up about them on social media while she ignores them at home. 

Now that you guys have some background this is where the main issue is right now. My sister called me today to tell me that things have gotten really bad for Bella and Max. She told me that the two boys constantly slam doors on their faces and take control of any toys or electronics if they see that Max or Bella are using them. They also constantly speak in English saying bad things about them and laugh (the two younger ones don't speak English yet, they're learning). She also told me that about a week ago, one of the boys hit Bella and left her arm bruised. Obviously Lia went ballistic and told Sara and Mary about what had happened and questioned why they didn't do shit to protect the baby. After a long argument, what Lia said just went ignored. Noone got punished and life went on. 

Fast forward to yesterday, Sara, Mary and her husband left the house to go watch the stars and left the kids alone. All four of them. They didn't tell my sister they had left and even then, it isn't Lia's responsibility to take care of anyone's kids. I can maybe understand leaving the 3 older ones alone but how in the fuck are they gonna leave a 3-year-old without supervision. How stupid can they be? My sister eventually took care of Bella and Max because Max came into the room begging my sister for food... He had been hungry for hours... Lia again became super upset because when she called Mary to ask why they had left him without eating, she replied saying ""I offered him food earlier, he said he wasn't hungry. Just ignore him, he can eat tomorrow."" My sister wanted to cry because that's so messed up... She told Mary that if it was one of her two boys she would've come back to the house in an instant to which Mary just got mad again and hung up on Lia. Lia fed max and took care of them but she doesn't know what to do. 

The issue is that these two kids are having such a hard time and my sister and I don't know what to do.  As much as we want to we can't reprimand the two boys because they are our kids to punish. I believe that it all starts from their ignorant ass parents either way. Because they let them become assholes. Oh, I forgot to mention the younger of the two boys, hits his mom and she still doesnt do shit. I live 7 hours away and my sister has talked to them various times. You could say it's none of our business since they aren't our kids but their kids at the end of the day.. they shouldn't have to worry about food or feel scared or be bullied. What can we do to help them?",08Aug2020,1

But my whole life I've been groomed to feel ugly-only being exposed to eurocentric beauty standards and ideals- I'm a black girl (just a side note for reference).

But I don't know what to do or where to start. Everything I've tired has only made me feel worse.

965,"I'm 16 going into my junior year of high school.  A couple days ago my school sent out our plan for going back.  Basically every day half the school goes while alternating every other day plus a bunch of social distancing/mask wearing stuff that seems pretty straightforward.  I can opt out of this and stay home entirely.  I absolutely hated remote learning and the spring but at the same time I'm not sure how safe it is for me to go back to school.  

I live in an area (New Hampshire) that has COVID almost completely under control but I'm still not sure.  Everyone I know is saying I should try out going to school and decide if it's worth it after a couple weeks.  This seems reasonable but there's something I can't explain holding me back from doing it.  Am I being irrational or is trying it out for a while a bad idea?",08Aug2020,1
966," I'm not looking to self-diagnose /ask you to give me a diagnosis, but I've been suspecting I might have ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) because I have lots of Autistic traits. I have no idea what to do about this suspicion, hence why I'm posting this here and asking for advice. though I strongly believe I might have ASD, I also have a lot of insecurities and doubts. I don't want to tell my family that I think I might have it and then end up not having it. but at the same time, if I end up not having it, it might lead me to actually figuring out what is actually wrong with me. 

I've been reading lots of articles and watching lots of youtube videos of people with Aspergers/ASD and I've found that I relate to practically everything they've said. there are unusual things I've done in my childhood that everyone who knows me has found odd but we've always chalked it up to me just being different or me just being a weird kid. now I'm realizing that all of those things were a sign of autism/were autistic traits. even now that I'm older, there are things that I've doing that are different/unusual to others that now I'm realizing might actually be a sign of Autism.

though I relate to practically everything they are saying, there are a few common traits that everyone with ASD seems to have but I think I might have mildly or not at all. I know that everyone with ASD is different and that it effects everyone differently, but i don't know if by not having these traits it means that I don't have ASD and that the traits I do have might point to something else, or if I actually have ASD. 

if I do have ASD and I do go through with getting a diagnosis, knowing would change everything. I'd finally know why I am the way that I am and that there are others who are just like me. but if I don't have ASD or anything else and I do go through with trying to get a diagnosis/take the tests and go through the process of telling my family I might have ASD, I'd feel embarrassed. 

there was a time in my life when there was a possibility and talk that I might have ADHD/ADD (I can't remember which one it was exactly) because I found it hard to focus/concentrate on topics in school that I didn't like and I'd zone out all the time (which impacted my report card significantly). What my doctor and guidance counselor made me do was take an ADHD/ADD questioner to three teachers who I've had difficulty concentrating with and then they'd hand it to my guidance counselor who'd then send it to my pediatrician. I remember all three of the teachers I had handed it to looked at me as if I was crazy (which did not help my confidence or my difficulty with socializing) . one even asked me if 'I' thought I had ADHD/ADD. even though my family are some of the most supportive people I know, they too thought I didn't have ADHD/ADD and thought the idea was crazy. though the results were that I don't have ADHD/ADD and that I just have trouble concentrating on topics I don't like, the experience kinda traumatized me. I'm afraid that everyone will say things like, ""You don't have ASD"" or ""You think you have ASD only because you have similar traits, everyone has these traits. it doesn't mean you have ASD."" or my primary doctor will say, ""you don't have ASD, I can tell."" and then not refer me to someone who is a specialist, even though my primary isn't a specialist in ASD and only knows the stereotypical traits. I'm afraid they might not take me seriously even after showing them all I've researched and pointing out everything that could mean I have ASD. 

Should I seek a diagnosis even if I might be wrong?  could there be something else wrong with me that's similar to ASD or am I just being overdramatic / too analytical ? is it worth looking into or should I just keep going the way I've been going and stop researching ASD? and if you think I should consider seeking a diagnosis even if I might be wrong, can you give me advice on how I can tell my family (I know there's a lot of stigma around the subject and that most of the stereotypes aren't true for everyone who has ASD but my family might believe these to be true) ? how should I present to them everything I learned? (also note, I have difficulty talking about hard topics like this or anything that involves too much emotion. one of my problems is that I keep everything inward; meaning, I don't tell others how/what I feel. whenever I try to, I get extremely anxious to the point that I want to cry (which I don't like to do in front of others and makes everything worse) and I have trouble breathing/I tend to hold my breath and I get shaky and lightheaded. I always end up not telling them and keep it to myself. and no, this isn't because of toxic masculinity, I'm a cis female. ) 

any advice would be helpful! Sorry for the long post and thank you to those who've read to the end! have a nice day!",08Aug2020,1

968,"Over the past few weeks, my mental health has really been battered about. I’ll give some reasons as to why:

-My cousin A has been making death threats towards my aunt and uncle. After getting them in serious trouble with the police (she has bipolar disorder and has put in fake sexual assault claims to get them arrested), she has now gone missing. Myself and my family are terribly worried about her mental health and who she is with (we know that she’s being groomed and have tried to speak to her, but she ended up pulling a knife on my uncle). 
-My grandad for the past week has been in hospital on end of life care with pneumonia. To sort out his will and bungalow and such, my immediate family have had to rejoice with my dads sister and her daughters. It’s safe to say they love a good drama and are making things into a legal shitshow. 
-All of my ‘friends’ have decided that instead of spending my 18th birthday with me in a few days drinking in spoons, they would rather sit inside and “code on python and do college admin” They’ve only ever been there for me when it’s appropriate for them and have made disgusting sexual jokes about me many of times. 

I feel like 2/3 years ago, I had found myself. I was enjoying life all the time, and even through the hardest most unbearable section of my life (my mum tried to commit suicide and then spent 4 years in and out of mental hospitals with psychosis) I was still okay, keeping my head up and supporting my family and friends. I felt as strong as ever.

But now I just feel as if I’ve lost myself and am mentally exhausted. I’ve lost passion for many things that I care about, like old hobbies and activities. About 6 months ago I went through a period of feeling suicidal and self harming. Although ive improved a lot, I can feel myself slipping into that hole again and it scares me. I go to bed in tears more than half the nights of the week. I pretend to be asleep when my parents knock the door to say goodnight, so they don’t see the tears rolling down my face. I’ve started to wake up feeling anxious and sick even though there is nothing to be nervous about. I don’t want to get to a point where I self harm again. I just feel so alone, and my mental health over this pandemic has plummeted. 

I feel so alone. I’m trying my hardest to support my family, but it’s really really hard. If anyone can please give me some advice, would be truly appreciated",08Aug2020,1

I couldn't really even hang out with friends or if I did, they had to know where I was going with whom and what time I'll be home and shit, I even had to cancel my first date ever with someone I really liked because my mom didn't want me to go.

972,"Hi guys, this is obviously a throwaway acc,I am too embarrassed to talk about this to anyone I know but it really bothers me. 
Little background information: I got some issues with my health lately, I always had something going on with my stomach,it has never been life-threatening but lately I had a variety of symptoms so I have to do a bunch of examinations and a lot of them require to take my shirt off. 
And here's my problem, I get really stressed out/nervous, even close to panic attacks when I have to undress in front of anyone, but especially in front of women. 
A lot of medical workers are female and I know that they are all professionals and see shirtless dudes everyday and don't care at all but my psyche wont have that. 
Yesterday I had to do an ultrasound and I literally started crying when the nurse told me to get undressed. I swear I could do nothing against it, my whole body just went full panic mode, I did not want to cry it just happened and I could not even explain why, it clearly irritated everyone involved and needless to say I was super ashamed.
I will have to do some more examinations and I am so scared this will happen again, this has to stop somehow. 
I have no idea why this triggers me that much, objectivly speaking I have a very average build for a guy my age, I don t hate my body(I am pretty neutral when it comes to my looks)I also have two sisters so I am not unused to being among females. 
Especially for a guy, this is very unusual and I want to do something against it, I just don t know what.
(In case anyone wonders: I also don't go to public pools/beaches, and I also get anxious when male nurses/doctors see me undressed, locker rooms at school used to cause a lot of discomfort for me too)
My next appointment is in a vew days and it already gives me chills when I think about it, so if anyone got some advice for me I'd be very grateful.",08Aug2020,1

I want to get into writing again and I’ve been getting better at forcing myself to but still it’s only for like a half hour a day, the rest of my nonworking hours are spent on my phone Reddit or YouTube apps

Literally first thing I do every morning is scroll Reddit for an hour or two, then get breakfast and then go back to Reddit while eating and for a while after

I just have no motivation at all to do anything else. I keep telling myself to just get off it, it’s boring, but it’s just way too easy to keep scrolling and filling my head with content.

I literally cannot find a way to force myself off of it. I don’t want to delete the app either because at work my longest break is a twenty minute and honestly there isn’t much to do in only twenty minutes except Reddit while eating and smoking. My coworkers and I aren’t very close and conversation is usually out of the picture but I do take the opportunity to chat when there is one. Other than that I only have Reddit

I told him that i was done and didnt want to watch the show anymore with him.

We were going to have a hamburger night, and bc of this my dad said he didnt want to do it anymore and for us to just eat something else. All while he was very agressive about it.

I hate when hes rude to my mom, shes not confrontational so she doesnt say anything but i get really bothered about it.

979,"Hello Reddit,

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Middle &amp; Secondary Education (Biology). I love being in the educational environment but I'm realizing that the enlarged bureaucracy has made most schools inefficient for both students and teachers. I quickly learned about wage theft as I student-taught. Additionally, this COVID-19 pandemic drama has demotivated me from applying to schools. 

I feel like I should've been more productive this summer in applying for jobs in other areas of the economy. I feel like I'm not living up to the American Dream that every refugee family strives to achieve. I'm seeing peers of similar backgrounds go on to graduate school and getting married. 

I also regret spending 2 years of my life on a guy who seemed more focused on his successful career advancement without giving me guidance/advice on how to be successful. With all the energy, time, and money spend on him, I could've strengthened my resume and made more social connections. I seriously thought he was working hard so the both of us would be able to get married and have a stable family. I'm foolish for assuming since he never said this. It seemed like he enjoyed the moment with very little future thinking outside of his career.

On the other hand, I realize that COVID-19 has put great inconvenience in people's lives. If I were in grad school right now, I'd have to think about potential on-campus COVID exposure and/or complaining how my online classes weren't worth the outrageous tuition. Additionally, I was recently informed that Trump signed an executive order to delay student loan payments til the end of this year.. one less thing to worry about *for now*.

Question(s):

1.) What are some habits/skills/goals that I should develop now to set me up for success?

2.) What other career fields can I work in with a B.S. in Education? (any job site suggestions would be great!... I live in a Southern state that touches a midwestern state \*USA)

3.) What are some things you've realized about life after university?

4.) Where can I find a serious, family man type of man? Is 'the age of commitment' a thing?",08Aug2020,1

981," 

Whenever I question whether I am a good person or not, I always inevitably conclude that yes, I am a good person. In my mind I always try to be good and do good- I always stop to help strangers when I see them in need, I put my neck out for my friends constantly and always try to make them happy. I don't anymore think I am a good person, despite this. I think in that aspect I am a good person on the surface, but I tell white lies to save my skin.

An example of such a lie is why I am having these thoughts. My friend, whom will be called A, and I became friends in second year 6th form and initially I had a crush on her. I told my friends about this, but when I found out she didn't like me, I moved on. Someone- a year later- told her I used liked her and I didn't want to admit that I did so I lied and said I never liked her.

I feel like because I can lie so easily, because now my friendship has a layer of lie in its foundation, that I am a bad person and I want to know how to change that, because it seems to be built into me.",08Aug2020,1

I don’t have any support from my family and I know that being alone will send me into a spiral, but I also know that I am far too desperate for connection and friends - to the point where I am afraid of becoming toxic in the future. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I really, genuinely don’t. And I want friends. But I’m not good for them. I just don’t know how to tell them to leave.",08Aug2020,1

So, this is my first ever time coming online about this, I mean I have a boyfriend, but that doesn’t actually count as friendship, and slowly throughout our 4 years, I’ve been getting better at going out (I can even order my own subway now) but I can’t go to collage or anything just yet. I’m a 21F, love video games, especially heavy story based ones like Skyrim and Mass Effect, art, animals, and just anything macabre, cause I’m also a goth (Ironic that I dress as I do)
