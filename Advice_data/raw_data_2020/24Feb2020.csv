0,"I'm currently in my junior year, which I know is one of the most important years with the SATs coming up. I have ADHD and Asperger's, focusing is such a hard thing to do outside of school and I often find myself cramming at the last night before an exam/project's due date. I always feel the urge to check Reddit, go on my phone, play Xbox, watch YT, or ""stim"" (a problem that's kind of only relatable if you have my issues) if I'm overthinking/overstimulated. It drives me insane with my inability to focus. I tried ADHD meds but they only slightly help my focus improve. This is my most important year yet I can't focus enough and I'm nervous I might tank and not get accepted into the colleges I want.",24Feb2020,1
2,"Any advice would be awesome. To try to make this a bearable amount to read I’ll shorten it. The apartment neighbors next to me harass me, and knock and drop stuff everyday to annoy me. Only when I’m alone to make me go crazy because they don’t do it when other people are around. I had the idea to do a nanny cam, but is there anything else I can do? They don’t respond to knocking on the door. They are purposely trying to make it seem like the downstairs neighbor, unfortunately I thought so for a while too.  But is there a way to prove it, because I can only go so long ignoring everything. Also to emphasize its only happening to me!",24Feb2020,1
3,"Everyone says that to be happier, you should cut offl negitive/toxic people. Well I dont have any toxic friends. But the only thing seperating me from being a better me, is my family. They're toxic af. 

I'm not the smartest person common sense wise. And it really bothers me. My brother, sister, and mother call me like retarded, stupid, idiotioc. And more not just like dumb things.

Another thing they do is call me out and everything I do wrong. Like the tiniest little things. 

My brother is a horrible person, he is ten years old, he does nothing at all but complain, yell, and command me doing things for him 24/7. And he gets treated like a king. My sister is on the wrong path doing the wrong things (morally) with the wrong ppl. Like she is going to have a child to get out of something that she signed up for. So in conclusion I'm the best kid out of all us. All I do is get attitude sometimes, when. People bother me. I wait hand and foot on every living creature in my house, and get yelled at for it. 

All my friends are having their glow ups, and I'm so happy for them. But like they are all fabulous and have a great home life, and have great friends, and I'm not jealous of them or anything, but it made look for what was stopping my glow up,and it's my family.

5,2 years ago I’ve auditioned to get into school of music. I really believed that I wanted to pursue music as a career. I wanted to play and be good and live life as full as I can. I was only able to get a minor in music education and the second time I auditioned I was rejected. I don’t have any talents. At this point I feel like I have no other option and I might possibly get kicked out out of school because I just want to do music. I’m sorry for how shitty this is but I really can’t do this anymore.,24Feb2020,1
7,"My husbands side of the family has always been pretty rude to me. Especially his sister. His sister is one of those people that always needs attention and is always playing pitty party and saying she’s going to kill herself when not getting her way and is always talking about me. Now his grandma who was with me in the delivery room because I was being nice and allowed her into the room when I gave birth because I thought she liked me started cussing at me calling me a piece of shit and lier for no reason. I was so angry I wanted to cry. I told my husband that she is not allowed in my sons life if she wants to be disrespectful to me. And he kept saying “no, no, no! You can’t do that. We’re not doing that.” And then went “if she can’t see him than your dad can’t see him”
But the thing is it’s completely different because my dad has never ever disrespected my husband or my family in any way. My husband says we’re not going to be one of those family’s that keeps children from their grandparents or aunts or uncles. And I don’t want to be but I hate being disrespected and belittle and talked about. Anyone been through this?",24Feb2020,1
9,"To make a long story short I met my current partner online. We are in a long distance relationship. I live in FL and he lives in CA. We've video chatted and we are both verified to be real people. Neither one of us mind the distance and have set plans and set timeline to meet in person so please don't judge. 

But this is what drives me crazy, He doesn't keep me in the loop. I'm more organized then he is and I like to know things ahead of time. He doesn't let me know when he's going to be busy in advance. It's honestly just a huge pet peeve of mine. I have to ask him what's going on or find out at the last minute.. he says that he just gets caught up in the moment, and he says he's working on it. 

I guess with us living so far apart I'd like to just be notified... After all he wants to know what's going on with me. Do you think this is a deal breaker? And how can I be more patient and understanding with him?",24Feb2020,1
11,"Context: I’m 17F, and I’ve had a history of ED’s (I’m still struggling with them, both anorexia and BED) but I want to lose weight, not only for my looks, but for my health (my BMI is on the overweight side) last time I went to the doctor, I weighed around 73 kgs (160 pounds) and I was about 1.65 (5’4”)
And since I have my graduation coming up (this July) I want to be my healthiest. However, my mom is ALWAYS buying junk food, even though I begged her not to, since I’m trying to eat healthy. She just doesn’t care. And whenever she knows I’m on a diet, she worries about me. But she also fat shames me, (even though I eat somewhat healthy, and I workout 3 times a week) by asking me when I’m going on a diet, by stashing waist trainers in my closet, you get the idea.
Anyway, she’s not so healthy herself: she smokes every single day, she drinks soda every day (I haven’t drank soda for like 6 years. I drank a glass 2 years ago, but I don’t count it lol)
It’s hard to diet when she’s constantly bringing me down, it’s like a competition where she wants to see me fail. I told her multiple times that I want to see a nutritionist, but she says that I’m lacking self discipline, which is true, since my ED’s left me tired and drained from it. I don’t know what to do. Please, any advice is appreciated!",24Feb2020,1

13,"My boyfriend and I have been seeing each other since late last year. He's genuine and kind, and I never thought I'd ever meet someone like him. His life hasn't been easy (won't go into too much detail), and because of some poor choices when he was younger, does have a record and is a felon (nothing serious, or at least I don't think it was serious enough to leave him). His last conviction was over 10 years ago, and he has not done anything since. 

He first met my parents during the holidays, and our first meeting went well. The second meeting, however, wasn't so great as my boyfriend tried too hard to impress my folks and my mom in particular became suspicious of him. Fast forward a month, and she contacts me and goes in on how he 'lied' to her about him being a felon (keep in mind, they never discussed this at all during any of the two meetings. She apparently did a search on him and found his court cases. In my opinion, it's not something you really discuss the first time your SO meets your family).  She was also mad at me, saying I helped him lie about his past. She says she no longer trusts him, and that if I ever get 'caught up' in anything he causes, she or my dad will not help. She says her and my dad spent too much time raising me to have me screw up my life by being with a felon.

I know family is out to protect you, but I feel that she is taking this way too far and being too judgmental. We never lied about his past situations, and when our relationship progresses, it would've been something we bring up. People make stupid decisions when they are younger, and a lot of people aren't the same people they were 10+ years ago.

Her reasoning is that because of his felony, he'll never have a good job and will be regulated to fast food jobs for the rest of his life, and told me not to expect my life to change for the better because of this.

I really want her to come around, because I do see a future with this man, but I've known my mom all my life and she tends to hold grudges for the slightest things, so I wouldn't count on it.

I love my mom with all my heart, but I also love my boyfriend dearly. How can I get over the fact that she may never change her opinion of him?",24Feb2020,1

Ive barely seen any of my friends since Summer of last year. Ive ran into F19 a few times in public, she normally waves me down and says hi before I awkwardly make conversation. 

Just for clarity, we are all mutual friends. I asked F19 out in Spring last year, but nothing came of it. She claims she was busy all the time, and I believe it, but I dont think she was all that interested. Its whatever. 

Im planning a date for me to go to an amusement park with the couple, in a month or so. They are both in. I want to ask the other friend too, but for some reason Im stalling. Im wanting to phrase it just as a friends thing, not as a date, and thats what I plan on it being. Same way I asked the others, but for some reason, whereas I was confident with the others, Im nervous as shit when I havent even messaged her yet.

my whole life my little sister has been the center of attention. her wants, needs, and issues have always come before mine. when we were younger she would constantly make fun of my weight (i’ve had weight issues since i was about 8-9), say i’m fat, ugly, loud, annoying, stupid, etc etc. my mom would always tell me to just let it go and quit being so sensitive. we grew up in a abusive household due to my father and witnessed a lot of things that were pretty traumatic, so we are both depressed in our own ways. as we got older she would still continue the verbal abuse and i’d turn to my mom for help and get told to shut up and learn to take a joke. i’ve struggled with depression for as long as i can remember, an on and off eating disorder, and self harm. and my mom brushed off all of it. never tried to get me any help, told me to stop being so sensitive. my sister started showing depression signs around 14-15 and immediately my mom rushes to get her help and was always trying to spend time with her and stuff to help her. she constantly asked me for advice on what to do to help her and i’m only 16-17 and still struggling and she would get mad at me for not knowing what to do when i was battling self harm and suicidal thoughts.

22,"I grew up with very controlling parents. When I was 18, I had my first relationship. My father wanted me to give it up, and I didn't, so to punish me, he wouldn't help me to get to university for 5 years.

The relationship actually only lasted for 3 years, so for the next 2 years, I eschewed any romantic relationships and focused on trying to get to school. I was actually accepted to university twice, but I didn't have any way to finance my education. I tried to get a loan, but I didn't know who I could ask to sign up as my guarantor. I sat the SAT, and got what I'm told is an exceptionally high score. My instructor encouraged me to sign up for an Ivy League school, because with my score, and my status as an international student, she felt sure that I would win a scholarship. However, by that point, I had lost so much confidence in my parents and in myself that I didn't even bother to apply.

It was embarrassing. Many of my high school classmates went to university and finished before I even got to start.

I finally started university at age 23. I've tried my best, but I feel really disappointed in what I've accomplished. Many of my peers have impressive work experience or run small businesses. I feel like I'm barely accomplishing the bare minimum. I'm not even graduating on time.

I know that I've been doing a lot of personal work - I've been going to therapy to deal with trauma and mental illness, and I've had to make lifestyle changes in order to manage an autoimmune illness (which I suspect has been triggered by all the stress I've been going through). However, dealing with all of these things has taken away from time I could have invested in other academic pursuits. I know there's value in the personal work I've done, but that doesn't matter to anyone else - not peers, not lecturers, not potential employers. I feel like others might look at me as an underperformer. I always used to be at the top of my class, and this situation that I'm in has been very embarrassing.

I feel like I've been trying so hard to make up for lost time and catch up, but I keep feeling like I'm just marking time. Everyone else seems to be progressing and leaving me behind. 

What can I do? Where should my focus be right now? Should I be focusing on working harder to catch up with everyone else? Or should I just try harder not to compare myself to others?

30,"After never being single for more than a month from 15 to 30 years old, I fell into a severe depression that took 4 years off my life. Last year I was finally over it but I came out as a whole different person - new career, new hobbies, new friends, new interests, new way of coping with life, you name it. 

Last year I thought I wanted to find a partner so I started dating. I live in a small city where everyone knows everyone and Im kinda attractive so im not lacking in options. However I get bored of every guy I meet. Last week, this guy I´ve been crushing hard on for months asked me out. We´ve been friends for a couple of years and we had sex on our first date. Sex was amazing but I kept thinking that it was too much work and if I had just used my satisfyer it would have been over in a couple minutes. The next morning I had lost all interest in him. 

I started analyzing what the hell was I doing and I think that I just dont want to put any effort in a relationship. I dont want to share my time, my space or my energy with anyone. I have an amazing group of friends where most of us are single and I think we are all so comfortable with our life that its going to take a lot to change it - At the same time I feel like its because I havent met ""the one"" yet and everything will change then OR maybe I will never find a SO ever again. 

I brought up the topic with my friends yesterday, one of them said she´s been feeling the same way, another one just got divorced and already has a new boyfriend but they keep fighting every day, another one is married but she sometimes wishes she was single...I just dont think its worth the hassle you know? 

I love my life and I no longer feel like im missing on something for not being married (the amount of married men who have asked me out has showed me that being married isnt a guarantee of anything) but I feel weird for not WANTING what I am supposed to want?

Then I started to think about it, it is a good amount of money not a crazy amount but a good one, and also I started to get more and more scared as time went by, I still haven't decided what I want to do for life, which college I want to get in and all that stuff. People have always told me that they are sure I'll be successful one day but what if I can't, the path in front of me is really blurry and I don't know which way to go. And so I got to the conclusion that I could use that money as a lifesaver or some kind of start for my life on my own, it seemed like a rational idea and ended off accepting the money.

However a voice in my head has been getting louder and louder, saying that I'm letting go an once in a life time chance as I'll probably won't see many of my friends in a long time for different reasons, and that I'm taking the most coward way because of fear.

51,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

For the past few years life has become progressively more difficult and stressful. Nothing I couldn't handle of course, but recently things have started getting a lot harder. To start I'm a high school student in multiple AP classes and I am swamped with school work constantly, I also recently turned 18 so legally I am an adult despite having literally zero money right now. Anyways my mom has mental issues like bad ones, they prevent her from working and she is at a really bad low point right now, it's really bad and she refuses to apply for disability, so for the past few years my father who doesn't earn very much money has been the only source of income in the house. Until recently however he was fired for a harassment complaint, which despite the lack of evidence and his clean record still got him fired. However they did give him $1600 severance pay so for the next couple of weeks he was going to be okay. Now keep in mind no one in the house is earning any money, so the next logical step is for him to apply for disability and me to start working. This didn't exactly happen the way we planned, I applied for 50 some jobs (still looking) and either haven't heard back or have been rejected, and these are minimum wage bottom of the barrel type jobs, but still no luck. And my dad had also began taking some new medication (well it wasn't exactly new he had it for some time, but only recently started using it after he got fired). These pills absolutely wreck him he isn't able to function and earlier I found him passed out with piss in his pants, and the other day I had to essentially carry him off the floor to his bed. So he got laid awhile ago and I'm trying to get him to apply for unemployment and look for a job and every single time he says ""I'll do it tomorrow"" in some sort of fucked up slurred speech not even the heaviest of drunks could attain. It got so bad that I eventually decided to apply for unemployment for him, and of course he made it as awful an experience as he could've. While my mom on the other hand has been non functional for a couple of months now I mean just out of it the majority of the time. I've tried to get my dad to apply for a job and unemployment, and my mom to apply for disability. And they either fight me on it or absolutely refuse to do it. I'm extremely frustrated right now, because I don't want to be here right now, and if they don't do something soon we may not even have a place to stay. I'm really just frustrated and upset right now and I don't know what to do.

55,"Okay, let me preface this by saying that I am a 21 year old, female. 

Tldr; I've been taking walks in this park, near my home. And lately I've had some creepy encounters and need advice on how to keep myself safe. 

Hi, hello. This is my first post on Reddit and I really wish it wasn't for this reason. Anyways, for some context I've been going to this park near my house for years. When I was little, I'd go with my parents for walks and have always loved it. It's a gorgeous park and many people go, to do various things. When I was little, it was always magical place but now that I am older, things have changed a little. 

I usually go to walk my dog and get a good work out, since the park is so large. My dog really enjoys his walks, he is older and super energetic so these help him get some energy out and stay in good health. I go nearly everyday unless something prevents me from going. 

Now, I've had a few creepy encounters with people before at this park (which I think is common?) I usually try to keep alert while walking, watching my surroundings/carrying a knife and a walking stick too. We use to have mace but it expired a few years ago, and I really need to purchase more. 

I usually like to listen to music/pod casts while I walk, because it's enjoyable and helps me pass the time. I love walking and listening to good music and enjoying the beautiful atmosphere however I feel as if I can't enjoy it anymore. A place where I use to feel calm and at peace has become a place where I feel anxious and on edge. 

A few weeks ago, I was heading to the other side of the park with my dog, jamming to some music in my left ear (I usually keep only one earbud in at all times so I can hear other things) I see a car park on the curb and immediately move to the other side of the road since I usually avoid parked cars, whether they have people or not. I noticed that someone was sitting in the car, too. And of course as I pass, the person in the car decides to open their windows and call out to me. I ignore them, just wanting to be left alone. This person makes a few inappropriate comments about my body then when I continue to ignore them, decide to insult me. I'm fine with that, just want to be left alone, like I've mentioned. But this person isn't done, they drive up next to me and asked me if I come to the park often to walk, I was taken aback and alarmed. Before I could do anything else, they just bolt. I mean as in, they take the turn to leave so fast that they would have wrecked if another car had been going down the road. I remember feeling pretty shaken by their words and for the next week I was very anxious. I keep my eyes peeled for any sign of a car like theirs. But I didn't see it, so foolishly I told myself that I'd probably never see them again. 

Now fast forwards to today (Sunday) I decided to take my dog for a walk since it had been raining all morning and he hadn't been able to play outside much. I also happened to ask my mother if she wanted to go with me. She usually doesn't go because of back pain but she felt good today so she agreed to go with me. We headed down to the park and as the road comes into view, I felt my gut drop. It's the car. I know it's the car, I remember how it looked, to the color and how the windows have no tint and you can see everything inside. I averted my eyes and quickly told my mom about how it was the person. She had us turn and head a different direction and we kept an eye on the car as we went. 

I didn't have the nerve to actually look at the person again, but my mom told me that he was staring at us the whole time. Until the moment he took off fast down the road again. I was nervous the whole time after, worried he'd circle back. My mother too felt very anxious and told me she didn't want me walking over there alone anymore but I don't really have a choice. I love the walks, and my dog loves and needs these walks. I don't want to give up my freedom and independence because of this person. 

I'm worried he will be there again. I'm worried he knows what time I go and is waiting for the chance when I'm alone again. Or maybe he is just some person who sits at parks and hits on women and won't bother me again. I don't know if I'm just letting my nerves get to me. So, this leads to my question. What else can I do to keep myself and my dog safe while walking? Precautions I can take, or red flags I should be looking out for. I am not completely clueless, but I feel like there should be more I can do. 

Anyways, thanks and sorry if this was too much information. I just felt like I needed to say all of this. Sorry for any errors or odd writing, this is my first post on here.",24Feb2020,1
56,"Hey.

I am disabled and I really need the handicapped spot in front of my apartment or I have a hard time walking to my apartment on the first floor.

Well tonight he (the young college athlete) took the handicap spot. I had to park in a spot that was further away and thankfully there was someone with me who was able to assist me to the front door. But otherwise, what can I do about it? He has a South Carolina license plate. This is in North Carolina. It has a photo on the handicap placard and I know for sure it is his father (his parents, or what I thought were his parents, came in from out of town a few months ago so that's how I know). I just want advice because I don't want him to retaliate against me for calling. I have been reading online and people say to call the cops and they'll ticket him. Then that means he could call the cops on me and they would give me a ticket as well. I have my registration in the car's glove compartment so if he calls them late at night and I don't see them come, I would not be able to prove that I am supposed to have the placard.

I wrote about what happened with my partner and I had on the way from my friend house to my boyfriend house while we were drinking.

I just wanted to post an update: we are still together as we have been together for nearly 8 years but I feel like I am getting sick of him and our fights. I love him I really do but I feel like 'am I in love with him?' or do I just love him? and that feeling is upsetting me because I do love him I just feel put into a corner where I resent him.

I want to be with him it's just every time something like this happens I always keep thinking 'Do I want to put up with this forever?' or 'Do I really want to marry this guy?', I came up with the idea of going on a date tomorrow to the cinema and behaving like we don't know each other and we are gonna behave as if we are learning about each other for the first time, my boyfriend isn't the guy I fell in love with all those years ago as I am not the same girl either and it is frustrating me as I want to make things work out, I just feel overwhelmed with it all. But the date is set for tomorrow and I don't know how to behave for our 'first' date as I haven't been 'single' in nearly 8 years so how do I behave in order to make it seem real?

69,"I broke up with my girlfriend a little over three months ago. We spent most of our time together so building a larger social network in the new city I'd moved to wasn't a priority. But in the time we were together my best friend moved  away. That cut my social network in half.

I've avoided my typical post breakup spiral out of control for a little bit pattern. But yesterday I realized I'm spending a lot of time in my apartment with my pup. Other than dating it's I'm spending almost all my free time at home. My human interaction is mainly coming from dating, people I hire for stuff, people who bother me at work, people I'm forced to interact with while in my day to day. Even though I'm out of the apartment a decent bit it still feels like I'm going stir crazy. 

The issue is, the idea of making new friends just feels weird to me. I used to have a huge social network that sort of grew organically. I didn't have to work at it at all. Then I moved a bunch and got old. Going to a group of strangers and forcing myself on them seems bizarre. Asking someone if they want to hang out, ugh. And that's on top of this social anxiety situation. I can survive in a large group of people. And apparently I present myself well. But it's kind of a baby Yoda using the force deal.

72,"Over the past 22 years, i have been with my wife. We have 2 sons together and she has 2 daughters from a previous marriage.

When me and my wife first were together, people kept thinking she cheated on her ex with me. Didn't happen, we got together after she left, i did know her when she was still married but was not around when they broke up and later we got together. Her 2 daughters didn't believe that and begun their shitty attitudes towards their mother and me. (this was probably speculated by their father)

Soon after my wife was pregnant with our first child and then the second happened quickly too. The daughters didn't like their new step mother and moved in with us. The younger daughter reached the rebellious stage of 14 years old and started the smoking, skipping school, dying hair black, makeup dark phase. I normally picked her up from school and found her a few times at the shops before school was finished. Didn't tell her mother, its what kids do. She eventually grew out of it and had a new group of friends at school, but she wasn't getting the attention she wanted. So she took the ultrasound photo from my youngest sons photo album and told her friends she was pregnant. When asked who is the father of the baby in the photo = me. (Accused of molestation)

This resulted in friends telling parents, parents telling child crime police, me being removed from the house, can't go 200 meters near school/house/shops/her. Then i had to prove i didn't do anything, even when they knew she wasn't pregnant. Eventually i could move back home but the step daughters lived together. The older one actually blamed me for doing something to her younger sister. Then a few months later, she also accused the older step daughters boyfriend of touching her too. Then she kinda believed me. (This resulted in never being left with a young girl ever again)

Years later, my wife stole money from her work. added up to a substantial amount and the boss thought we were both in on the scam. I knew nothing about it, and the boss was underpaying my wife anyway. so when she was spending more money i just thought he was paying her correctly finally. When it was discovered by the boss, he went full psycho on the phone to her which caused her to disappear for a few days. I was looking for her and the boss was telling me he needs the money back now, all of it. During this time i found out from his son that he knew she was taking money only a few weeks after she began taking it and let it go because he wanted it to build up for some reason. He was doing some tax dodging so, this was probably his reason. (Resulted in me being blamed by my wifes family for not knowing or questioning why we had money and keeping an eye on her mental health)

I found her in a hotel, she tried to kill herself but didn't go through with it. Took her to hospital, they helped and things returned to normal. The boss still wanted the money back, and i payed it off slowly over the course of a few years, which is how it was taken out. Because i was making regular payments, no legal action or debt collection could be done. It was all i could do. (still was blamed for taking it but it wasn't me, they just saw it as married, so stole too, told many people WE stole which affected my business.)

My wife worked from home and my kids were finishing school. She was in high demand for work and we needed someone else to work for us. At a clients work, a receptionist was not getting paid most weeks and if she left the job or went to fair trading, it would cause more problems. they were at least 3 weeks behind in her payments. So i thought, we need someone working for us and she will get paid. I introduced her to my wife and occasionally over christmas holidays the girl came over because her oven was broken and needed to use ours. She baked for her dog training group. Because she was around, my wife began believing we are sleeping together as a few times i had to go to her house to repair things. My wife got drunk on new years and went psycho, blamed me for cheating. So i left the house, stayed with my sister for a few days. Meanwhile, everyone believed i cheated. I came back and kept working, (still was blamed for cheating and we haven't been close since.)

To top it all off, i also helped another client because my car is larger, i had to help her get a tv. She just recently broke up with her husband. I hooked up the tv for her. A few days later she didn't know how to use it and needed me to show her how. I went to her house, the air conditioner wasn't working also. I knocked on the door and heard the car running in the closed garage attached to the house. I opened the front door and the whole house was full of smoke, the lady was passed out on the lounge, so i picked her up and put her outside. She was ok but very upset about what just happened. She was trying to cool the house down with the car air conditioner and ended up carbon monoxide poisoning herself. IF i had been 5 minutes later, she would be dead. I sat with her while she was crying. Everything was alright.

But her ex husband sighted us shopping together the days before and me sitting with her out the front of her house. So he speculated we were cheating before they broke up. This rumor got to my wife. (Blamed for cheating again)

Everyone believes i have cheated 3 times and sexually assaulted a minor. I have done nothing, there is no proof so nothing has actually happened in the legal side of things. Yet it is everyone believing i did these things. They treat me like shit because of it and sometimes there is a mention of 'Don't leave my daughter with him.' or 'why was he out so late at that customers house'.

74,"I know this is a fairly common thing that happens to everyone when they start a new job, but my history with mental health has made this completely unmanageable. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression (on the mild end of the scale) around five years ago. One thing that triggers this for me is change and not being completely in control. I’ve recently started a new job that aligns with that I’ve studied in university. Some would call it a dream job, the perfect opportunity to live out my dream career. But life has been the opposite. 

The job has me working from 1pm until around 9/10pm, instead of a more normal 10-6/7 that I was working before. This is a really small change in hours, but working just a few hours later has thrown all of my schedules and routines off- I don’t see friends of family during the week, I can’t do my normal workout routine after work, I feel slobbish because I have no morning commitments so I sleep til 10/11 during the week, I still live with my parents (housing prices/rent is crazy where I live) and when I hear them leaving for work at 8am I get emotional and usually have a sobbing panic attack. I don’t understand where these emotions have come from. 

During work I mostly just sit at my desk and tear up the whole day because I’m so unhappy. My parents have constantly told me that they don’t care what I do or how much money I make, as long as I’m happy and I have enough to pay rent, but groceries etc, but I just can’t help feeling so helpless and lonely. They’ve told me to give it six weeks and then, if I still feel unhappy, I can quit knowing I’ve given it a decent go, and find some other job with better hours and less stress. But I feel like weak and like a failure going through university and then not even using my degree in my work. 

I don’t really know what advice I’m looking for, but any pointers or observations would be amazing. I just can’t honestly see the point in doing anything because I have no passion at the place I spend the vast majority of my life and I just wanna be fucking happy.

TLDR; I started a new job that has me working pretty late at night, which has meant that my routine has been flipped on it’s head. This had made me anxiety and depression skyrocket, I feel lonely in a way I never have before, and I don’t know if I should stick with it because this is the job I studied at university for, or if I should quit and just do something less stressful and with normal hours that fits around my schedule to help ease my mental distress.",24Feb2020,1

I was offered a job as a waitress. However, it's through a hospital, and I know they drug test before hiring. I've been smoking pretty much daily for the last two years. I also don't really feel too determined to quit, because it'll have to be for atleast 3 or 4 months, and I could just work somewhere else.

I'd like that job though if it's possible, so has anyone ever tried a detox drink for weed? Did it work?

They didn't look like animal scratches because they were in one neat column, were all perfectly straight and some looked older than others. Not only that, they were only on one arm. The more I think about it, the more it seems fishy. Maybe I'm overthinking, but it also looked like she was trying to hide the arm too. I don't know if I should ask about it because we're not close. She's also older than me by a few years, so I'm not comfortable talking to her. Mental health is a very touchy subject where I live too.

I was in this position before. I was maybe 11. However, it was more like a mutual friend was trying to get me to tell her to stop. We were young and not very exposed so we didn't tell anyone.

85,"**TL;DR at bottom.** 

Brief background: I live in an older apartment building, meaning thin walls and ceilings. I knew this moving in, and accepted that I'd likely hear the daily goings-on of my neighbors. All was fine and dandy...until my upstairs neighbors moved in. Constantly dropping and dragging things late at night (12am - 2am), stomping around, etc. They'd have screaming matches, featuring doors slams and items breaking, about once a week. Their yelling would wake me up, and even once I was on FaceTime and the person on the other side could hear what they were screaming about. I often debated calling the non-emergency line and making a domestic/noise complaint with my landlord, but was scared of retaliation. One of the tenants sounds mean, strong, and angry. Eventually things seemed to quiet down. Showdowns still happen, but they're rather infrequent.

Enter the bed. This thing is so squeaky I can hear them turning over at night. During their nocturnal fun time, I can hear the squeaking in my living room. Multiple times a week for the last 2 months I've been woken up by this bed and their 'movements.' I've tried drowning them out by sleeping in the living room, TV, music, even noise cancelling headphones. Nothing works. I haven't made a fuss about the squeaking because hey, it was better than shouting, plus half the time it's happening during normal operational hours and the other half I'm often awake (night owl).

The problem: Today that changed. I was rather sick and had finally fallen asleep when I was suddenly awoken early in the morning (still within quiet hours) by the squeaking. Fed up and feverish, I (granted, not my finest moment) pounded on the inner bedroom wall; three brisk thuds. Immediately the neighbor started angrily shouting laced with profanities. I just ignored them. The squeaking stopped. I was able to fall back asleep. Until about an hour and a half later, when angry neighbor takes  begins **STOMPING** on the bedroom ceiling, again screaming with profanity about the pounding along the lines of 'LETS SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT. TRY IT AGAIN I DARE YOU' for about 10 minutes. Once again, I ignored it because dude is scary. 

The advice: I'd like to file a noise complaint with my landlord about this neighbor and their bed. Usually I'd try to address this kind of thing in person with the other individual, but as stated I do not feel safe attempting to calmly talk with this person. I don't have a problem with them, their everyday movements, or even their nocturnal fun times. It's honestly the bed. If the bed wasn't so damn loud then there wouldn't be an issue. What is the best way to make/word the complaint to landlord to ensure that something is done and retaliation is not received?

**TL;DR: Angry upstairs neighbors have stupidly loud squeaky bed. Need advice on how to make noise complaint with landlord in most effective way, but worried about retaliation.**",24Feb2020,1

I literally do not have anyone. So it’s really discouraging wanting to finally get out the house and do something fun and enjoy being young when you have no one to do that with. Not to mention, especially as a young woman I would feel safer going out at night and stuff with someone for safety reasons. I am naturally anxious so that’s another reason why I really would prefer to have someone to go out with sometimes. But I don’t have that option. So what do I do? I don’t want to stay at home and waste my youth waiting for someone to be my friend so I can go out and have fun but at the same time, some things (not all of course) are better or even safer if you go with someone.

Two of my closest friends recently got accepted into great graduate (PhD) programs in my subject. I am very happy for them because they've worked very hard for this and they deserve it 100%. 

But the thing is, I got rejected for the same programs. And as a result, even though I hate it, I am rather jealous of these friends. I have also been working really hard for the past few years to get into grad school and I got rejected last year too (same as these friends). 

Admittedly, my background is not as 'pristine' as these guys', but I've really burnt the midnight oil this last year improving my research abilities and skills - yet it clearly wasn't enough. 

Another thing that compounds this general feeling of shittiness. Ever since middle school, I've been told by various people that ""you can't do X, can't do Y"", because of reasons that I cannot change (like not being 'intrinsically' smart, for one).

Till now, I've haven't paid attention to stuff like this. Plus my gut feeling says I can do it - both getting accepted into grad school and getting through the thing.

But as of now, some of things that people (including my parents) have said - that I'm not 'cut out' for grad school - is weighing me down.

Islam is the one true religion, the gays are bad, girls can’t move out until they’re married, etc etc etc. Well, I realized at a very young age that I don’t believe in god and that I am, in fact, a raging homosexual. My parents don’t know. 
It’s really hard to love yourself when you hear your own mother rant about how she wishes god would make the earth beneath “the gays’” feet to crumble, and suck them straight into hell. She rants about non-Muslims a lot, too. 
Above all else, she does everything she can to control every aspect of my life. She has to know where I am, who I’m with, what I’m doing, and when I’ll be back, and even asks questions like what that noise in the background is, why she hears wind when I said I’m at home (when I’m standing on the back porch or something), and why she hears music when I’m on the school bus (kids using their speakers).

I’m a senior in high school. I want to go to college for a specific career path that doesn’t necessarily require a college education. Here’s the issue. A community college near my house offers the courses I would need to pursue my goals. It’s less than $10k per semester before scholarships/FASFA, and it’s only twenty minutes from my house. Another college is nine hours away. It’s $30k per semester before scholarships/FASFA. I’ve been accepted into both. The second college has an excellent program, but it’s expensive and a lot of people in the industry say it’s not worth it. I could end up with a massive amount of debt when I could be saving tens of thousands dollars. I could end up miserable, paying off my student loans for the rest of my life. 
I still want to go to the more expensive college, not only because it offers a better program, but it also gives me a reason to leave home. The only other way out would be to leave when I turn 18 in a few months, but that would likely involve my mother finding out about everything I’ve been hiding from her. I feel lost and honestly I’m terrified either way. I absolutely cannot live in this house once the semester starts, let alone another 2-4 years.

104,"Im a junior in high school and i had been hanging out with this girl that i had liked. I didnt really know anything about her really before last December but thought I would give it a shot of going out with her because one of my buds told me she thought I was cute. So we go to the movies one day and get food after and pretty much end up having a great time. We started talking more and more at school and would hang out almost every weekend. We would do different things like go to the movies, golf, eat, etc and she always gave me the impression that was enjoying our time. But since i barely met her I really didnt want to do anything yet because i dont like rushing into relationships at all. Even though i was catching feelings and clearly into her, I didnt do anything. She also kinda gave me signs she didnt want to be into a relationship either. She would tell me her mom would ask if I had made a move or anything and she would say ""no but were just getting to know each other, thats a ways off."" This to me was a sign to steer clear of making a move. Another time, we were talking about relationships and she said how she was trying to focus on herself and school, wanting to get into a good college. This also gave me signs to not pursue anything. However, the biggest instance that gave me the red flag was when she asked if I liked her. She asked if i actually liked her to which i replied ""honestly, how could I not like you?"" She asked again asking if I was serious to which i said, ""well I mean if youre asking, kinda yeah"" When i said this, she pretty much turned me down, saying she had to go.(she had never said this to me before, and I was crushed). I thought at this point it was over; that I had moved on too quick for her and ruined my chances. Her behavior reinforced this too. No longer would I get the compliments from her, when i called her cute or pretty or fine, all i got were ""thanks"" and move on. At this point i thought i was stuck in the friendzone and pretty bummed. Around a month after she asked me if i liked her , I brought up how some younger girl had texted me and wanted to start talking to me. I reiterated how pointless it was to the girl I liked to have this girl text me because i would not pursue her, but she would always tell me it was a good idea to text her. This made me think she wanted me to get at the other girl so she would not have me on her. Shortly after i brought this other girl up she told me how there was this other guy she was interested in and they ended up hanging out and that he put his arm around her when they first hung out. I again was crushed. Then a couple weeks later she told me how they went out again to catch a movie and later went back to his house. This right there killed me. Except it gets worse.

My entire grade had a trip to an island nearby as a seniors celebration. All the families at this school are wealthy so this trip is completely financed out of school and so it is basically just a trip to drink and party. Everyone was separated into groups of three for the hotel rooms, however upon we were offered to join two groups into one large 6 person room. Me and my friends took up the offer, and we got a huge room. Due to this the entire grade would constantly hang out in our room especially when there were no activities going on elsewhere. At one point I was hanging out in the room with a few guys from other rooms when I got called to smoke a joint with one of my roomates who was elsewhere. At this point I tell the people I was with to please leave the room, as I am leaving and I didn't want to leave them alone in my room. They all came up with a bunch of excuses like ""just give me 5 minutes so I can charge my vape"". My friend who called me was getting tired of waiting so he told me if I didn't get to him he would light up without me. At this point I just left the room and let the people stay there, I told them to leave the door open so I could enter later as I had no idea where the keys were. Like an hour later me and my friend were returning to our room to look for rolling papers as we lost the ones we had due to being drunk. And surprise surprise the door was locked. At this point I had to call all my other roomates to see if I had keys. Once all my friends returned to my room they began berating me for not standing up to the other people and making them come all the way to my room because I was too much a pussy to kick them out.

Let me explain, I am a perfectionist. I want whatever I do to be perfect.

Here is the problem. It has been around 14 days of school. On the first day, they gave me the wrong period 1 class so my English class I already have 1 absent. Everything is going fine, I am on track but then I got sick. I was very sick 103-105 fever for a week. I got it on Thursday and went to the doctor on Friday. The doctor gave me 6 days off school notice. I tried to go to school on Monday but 1st period in I couldn't take it so I left for home. I proceeded to miss 5 days of school, I fell behind, etc.

I now have 7 absent in English class

6 in science, french, and geography

I managed to collect my English, geography assignment and had 1 day to do it and couldn't make it perfect so I probably got around 80% for both which is an A-. I am truly disappointed &amp; angry

Alright science was hideous I missed 6 days worth of class and then the next day we had a worksheet and I got 66% on that a C+. Holy shit.

French is good, my overall grade is 97%

English I missed so much and the work I handed in is probably an A-. my grade is probably a B+ in this class.

Geography I probably have around 80% / A-.

Science I don't know I have missed so much work probably a B grade.

What the hell do I do? First, 1 month (pretty much) is a disaster. I am sad, angry, disappointed and hate life atm. I really hate this. Going in I had it all planned but this stupid flu i got messed me up. What do I do :(??????????

She said we'd just be friends and I was ok with that but the constant texting continued including good morning and good night texts and we actually started meeting up. The texting and in person interactions became very flirty and physical(no sex, just alot of cuddling and touching) so I thought she was beginning to reciprocate. We spoke very openly about our feelings and I felt like I'd put my foot in my mouth some with her but when I asked her she assured me that we were fine. After one particular get together, she began to distance herself and told me she needed a break. I said that was fine and told her I'd be there when she was ready to talk again. So we stopped texting and a few days later she texted me back saying ""thank you for giving me space."" We began talking again some but not as much and sometimes she actually seemed like she was annoyed by me even though I'd just be simply answering her texts.

 When I was 8 a friend's dad gave us porn/sex toys to use and watched us. I didn't realize what had happened until I thought back to it as an adult. I got off pretty easy in this situation but I imagine his son didn't and things might have escalated if he kept doing it to other kids.  I realized I now have the responsibility to do something about it or I would just be another adult doing nothing about the problem.

So I did a background check.  He's never gotten in trouble for pedophilia. Just a bunch of petty crimes.  I was hoping he had been caught before so that could backup my story but no luck. I tried looking through the dark web to find a hacker for hire. I was hoping to have them break into his computer and if they found anything, anonymously report it to the police. Unfortunately hackers are much harder to find than drugs on there and I came up empty handed.

I don't know what to do now. I know he's out there blending in and possibly abusing kids but it seems like there's nothing I can do about it. I'm inclined to go to the police but with no proof, I don't think there's anything they can do.

116,"I’m not sure if it’s ethical or not to but I had a friendship/was in love with a person I knew for a year that abused me physically/mentally/emotionally and the entire time they compared me to their ex, how I was just like them how I looked liked them etc. 


They took their anger out on me because I resembled the ex and I’ve left this abusive friendship but now I want to meet the ex. Especially since my abuser thinks they raped their ex (I’m not sure the validity of the story) I want to know if the ex was abused by them like I was. But they broke up over a year ago and idk if that would be overstepping. I’ve never met the ex but I know how to get in touch with them. 


I partially want to fill in all the blanks/get closure but I’m also hoping that if they were also abused by them that I’d have someone I could talk to about it especially since there’s a lot of nuance to the abuse that my friends don’t understand that the ex would. 


So idk if I should reach out or not. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated",24Feb2020,1

124,"My partner and I are thinking about moving in together. We both have our own homes and separate mortgages. They would move into my place and rent out their own place, so the rent would cover their entire mortgage with a little to spare just in case they need to make repairs. All of our individual debts like student loans and credit card stuff would still remain our own (they have no debt while I have some credit card debt and student loan debt). 

As a preliminary conversation they suggested a 50/50 split on the utilities, which in my case the utilities cover water, electric, and internet. We would also be splitting groceries. This sort of arrangement would reduce my monthly expenses by a small margin. Maybe reducing my utilities expenses by $300? Their mortgage is about $1250 a month and mine is about $1000 mortgage plus an additional $350 HOA fee.

They suggested that since I would still be getting equity in my home and not giving them that equity when I sell that it may not be right to pay part of the mortgage. My partner is getting equity in their own home regardless as it pays for itself by being rented out. 

TL;DR - my partner is moving in with me and we are unsure of how to split to bills while we both have separate mortgages (theirs will be paid for by a renter). Would charging them rent that would ultimately offset some of my mortgage, HOA, and utility bills be unfair?",24Feb2020,1

130,"I have had my dog for almost 4 years. I love her to bits, but I’m in a predicament with if it’s best for her to stay with me. I live with my parents, brother, my dog, our family dog, and my mother’s other daughter(21F). Both she and I are adopted from separate place in case you were confused why I call her that. 

My mother’s daughter(I’m going to refer her as She) has the tendency to hit, occasionally kick(not very hard), and taunt my dog no matter what I or my mother say. In fact, both dogs do not like her. 
My family dog always growls, barks, and hides away when She enters the room. 

She enjoys getting the dogs to fight, a dangerous action as my dog is larger and younger than my family dog who is 13 years old and weighs 10 pounds. 

Her latest act of terror occurred yesterday morning as I was cleaning, she came out from her room to throw pieces of chocolate(ones from a heart shaped box) down the stairs for my dog to eat(she could hear my dog walking around the bottom of the steps), I was able to wrestle it from her mouth. However, later that night while my dog and I were in my room, She had slid pieces of chocolate under the door and unfortunately my dog was able to eat a piece before I was able to block off the space between the floor and the door. 

I love my dog so much, and both my dogs are the reason why I haven’t tried to kill myself already as they are my best friends and depend on me to take care of them. 
But, with my mother’s daughter around, my dog is always a target, from being jabbed at to getting spit put on her. This type of behavior doesn’t happen everyday, but it still happens. 

Would it be best if I try to find her a better home? She’s already been given up twice before and I don’t want to give her away, but is it the best thing for her?",24Feb2020,1

133,"\[WARNING this'll be very long\] I met this girl online through instagram a little over a year ago, and eventually started talking to her on discord. I met all her friends and they were just, the worst. I really like some of them but most were these toxic nice guys who only talked to her because shes cute and would constantly berate her by treating her like a toddler. I eventually confronted her about the situation with most of her friends and she did *nothing*. Eventually they all found out how I felt about them and convinced her that I was toxic to her and the reason why she was so depressed and anxious at the time. So within a week or two I got banned from her discord server and we took a break from talking for a couple weeks. But we started talking again and became really close because she met a guy off of tinder that she really liked, and all the people who I said were desperate and ""nice guys"" proved what I said about them by not even giving this guy a shot. I thought he was a fairly decent guy and didn't see much wrong with him. Then I noticed red flags, like how he didn't give a shit about me and her other friends, he never talked about her to his friends, and he didn't share anything about his personal life to her even though she was sharing a lot of her personal life with him. But out of fear that it'd just be a part 2 of what happened with her toxic friends I didn't say anything and just prayed she would see the red flags. But she didn't. (she met him in early July btw shortly after I got unbanned from her server and we started talking again) So in early August he moved to the south, and he only told her a week and a half beforehand even though it was something he planned with his friend before he even met her. By then I told her he was getting really suspicious and I was worried. So in mid August he was already settling in his new state and out of nowhere left every discord server he was in that had her and all her mutual friends and unfriended everyone, I friended him again and asked what he was doing and he just said ""not in a good mental state rn, need a break from stuff"" and unfriended me right after. Later that day she managed to talk to him and she asked why he did what he did and he said something along the lines of ""I miss home and you guys remind me of home"", and that would be fine, but he was still talking to his friends and playing games with them. Some of them he's known since he was a kid, call me crazy but wouldn't they remind him of home too? It wasn't adding up in my head. So she spent about a month and a half talking to me and some mutual friends a lot and thats when I fell in love with her. There wasn't any drama cause all her toxic friends became irrelevant and her tinder bf wasn't in the picture it seemed. It was the first time ever I actually got to talk to her with no shitty people around, and I loved it. But then in late September he came back, and I flipped shit. I told her it wasn't a good idea and that she was gonna fall for him again and she just said shit like ""don't worry I just want to keep him as a friend"" and 'I'm not gonna get attached like last time"". Well that didn't age well because she DID fall for him within a week and on the 1st of October she got high while talking to him and he convinced her to block me and ban me. I found out at 5 A.M when I woke up for no reason, checked discord, saw what happened, and had an anxiety attack. I stayed home from school and didn't leave bed at all that day, I just kept talking to a mutual friend that convinced her to unblock me and unban me. I got my apology and everything but things didn't feel the same. so in that time frame of a few months he flew out to meet each her twice, she payed for HIS plane ticket BOTH times even though she was the broke college student and he was the 20 year old man with a job. But relations between me and her seemed to take a turn for the better in January when I finally told her that I loved her and cared about her. And a week or two ago I convinced her to buy GTA V and I began playing it with her a ton while he was at work or sleeping. He didn't like that at all, and he began guilt tripping her saying it made him feel shitty that she was talking to me and that if she didn't pick a side he'd ""pick one for her"". And for that following week she ignored my messages and only talked to him. Last night he convinced her to block me on discord (I already got banned from her discord server by him in December). We still follow each other on instagram and we're still friends on facebook, so it wasn't a complete cutoff, but I DM'd her on instagram last night after I found out and was having another anxiety attack. I haven't gotten a response, hell she hasn't even read it. I have a couple anxiety disorders (general anxiety and OCD) along with Depression. For the entire time I've known her it wasn't uncommon for me to overthink situations revolving around her and for me to overreact and think she was mad when she really wasn't. But the past few months with him back have been hell for me, I've never had more bouts of depression in my life and even a few times all the stress made me suicidal. I love her more than anyone I've ever met and I don't know what to think anymore. I ask for advice from friends and family but they either tell me that I should never talk to her again or sugar coat things and say it's in the hands of god or fate (I live in a christian household).

TLDR at the bottom

So I (21F) for some backstory have always busied myself with a lot of self and life goals/task at all times to keeps me busy and I hadn't realized until recently, it was because I have depression and being left with nothing to do is the only time I get to feel it.  I was mainly able to complete a lot of  tasks and goals because I had competition (even if they didn't know it was competition). All of my motivations runs on competition, it seems to be the only thing that keeps me going, and it has gotten me pretty far very quickly. 

It's not a malicious thing, it's genuinely fun to me and has been the catalyst to a lot of my accomplishments. I know that competing with yourself to do better is a thing, and I've tried to use it as my own motivation for a while now because I'm desperate for something to push me forward, but it doesn't stick for me. Maybe I haven't been looking at it right, but it just feels like I'm playing a group game by myself, maybe I'll entertain myself enough get started but it just ends up feeling overall lonely and pointless.

 I have more goals and things that I want to accomplish but I don't have any tangible figures to challenge me to work at them. The goal itself, is never enough for me, I want to succeed, do well and better myself in all aspects of my life but I can't see myself getting there without competition, or an ulterior motive. 

Anyways, since I've reached a goal of mines that I thought I would be working towards much longer (getting into my dream career), although there are more goals that I have set up for this aspect of my life, it'll require me to build my portfolio and experience which the position I'm in will allow me to do with time, so I'm in autopilot for a while, and this has been the first time in a very long time of grinding where I don't have enough to do to keep me busy or in competition...and I'm becoming depressed.

I was in denial for a while now that I was actually depressed because attaching myself with that label terrified me. I thought that the floodgates would open up for me to feel all these terrible emotions, but admitting it didn't do anything to me, which scares me a little more because it feels like I don't even care. Although thoughts about killing myself haven't been something I've ever thought about, the thoughts of what would happen if I were to die suddenly have played around in my head a little. Personally I'm not too concerned about that because I feel it's something everyone thinks about every once in a while.

I would do anything to stop feeling like this but don't seem to have the energy or motivation to genuinely try and get out of this. I don't know where to start to stop feeling like this, but I think coming here is going to bring on enough to get me started. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I can't find any motivation to keep working on myself and this is bringing on depression.

I know it’s not super huge news to this sub, but I’ve finally decided (29F) to take the plunge and quit my job of 7 years (where I’m slowly burning out and becoming more aware of this growing call to do something bigger with my life) and go on a 3-4 month sabbatical to reset, challenge myself, and find inspiration! But I’m slightly terrified...


I’ve been dreaming of this type of trip for maybe two years now, and have been saving up for something big (45k+ savings, 250k+ retirement, 1.5k+ monthly income freelance gigs, no debt, don’t want kids). My gf is super supportive, I’m ready for a change before turning 30, and feel like I have marketable enough skills to get a job when I return (I have a career in design, technology, and product innovation). I have traveled abroad extensively in the past (study abroad and many trips with friends), and also love being by myself. 


My plan:
I hope to leave after a company wide bonus this June (~$10k) so it can help fund my trip. I want to spend 2 months in Italy (I speak conversational Italian and dream to live where I don’t need to use English again) primarily based out of Florence in a longterm rental, then take small trips around the country.


Then, 2 months backpacking across New Zealand so I can live up my outdoor adventure dream!! (Mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking, bungee jumping, drink wine with an epic view, etc).


Advice needed:
1. Am I crazy?? (Career change, expensive countries, non standard life plan)
2. My intention is to have a creative, mindful journey where I can grow as a person, learn about what really drives me, and acquire new skills in my free time... any tips or stories for how you’ve personally grown as a solo traveler?

150,"Hello!

So I have been working as a part time art teacher for an art studio. I have been here for over a year now and recently my fiancé has gotten a stable, higher paying job at a new plant.  I also do commissions and juried art competitions/shows that have been taking off lately but it has gotten to the point to where I have to shove these things to the side during the day for my job.
I have a 18 month old son that my grandmother normally babysits for me while I work. Recently she has broken her humorous bone and has to do physical therapy for at minimum three months. I now have my uncle and aunt watch my son but I tend to get home late and my fiancé is on nights. They are older than my grandmother and can get worn out more easily so I feel as though I am putting them out though they offered to babysit. 

During my work week I normally get up at 7am get my son ready, drive 30 mins to pick up my grandmother take her wherever she needs to go to get out of the house, to physical therapy, take her home, take my son to my aunts, and drive 30-45 mins to my very part time job and get home at 8:30-9pm after picking up my son. I don’t get to see my fiancé, I had to quit school this semester, and I feel as though I am stressed and not able to keep up with housework and other commitments.

I tried putting in my two weeks with my boss and she told me it is difficult for her to find someone this close to the end of the school year. (Our studio is not associated with the school we just follow our nearby districts calendar for holidays and such.) I did tell my boss I wanted to come back during Summers because I am planning on not taking Summer classes right now and would be available for Summer camps. So with her guilting me about finding a replacement and me already agreeing to work summers I really put in my last seven months instead of two weeks. I don’t know how much longer I can last. I explained my current situation to my boss and she suggested my grandmother get a social worker to take her to physical therapy. (This is not an option because 1. Family obligations. She’s helped me out watching my son. 2. Her and my grandfather make too much to qualify and 3. My mom has me super young so my grandmother is also just too young enough to qualify.)

I am at a loss at what to do. I feel like I am running around constantly half assing my day. When I speak to my boss about this I get super red faced and feel as though I am doing something wrong even though I am just being honest about my current situation.

Despite having an anxiety disorder, I feel like I always need everything to go my way before I’ll go out of my way to be nice.  I feel like I have a lot of growing up to do.

153,"Hey

I'm in a position where I'm living pretty closely with some friends of mine at a beautiful spot in nature , one of whom I know better than the other two. But neither I know very well.

I don't do drugs anymore. Personal reasons. Actually when I was younger I used to be quite psychonautically oriented until I discovered Buddhism and meditation and now the drug world, yes, even the psychedelic world, seems like a shallow and confused world comparatively speaking. I look back fondly on those days when I would get high with my buddies and contemplate life and draw trippy pictures, but to be frank I feel disenchanted with that stuff, I feel like I want to put that behind me. I'm not judging but I'm just not super interested. 

These people are very adventurous types, world travelers, all about freedom and independence and not getting tied down and not having responsibilities and having all the experiences the world has to offer, YOLO and so on. So for them it's quite natural that they would want to be doing acid. And it's also quite natural that they'd want me to join in on the fun.

Actually, I recognize how special an opportunity this is, because due to certain circumstances it may well be the last time I ever get the chance to drop acid. I know how rare acid is and how special it is to be trusted enough by a group of people to be invited to share the acid experience. And the conditions are perfect, it's the most beautiful place you can imagine, no heat from cops or anything, super chill. So it's an intriguing proposal at least, I haven't done psychedelics in years snd it would be interesting and fun I'm sure. 

But I still don't really want to do it. And they really want me to do it. I think that they would see my rejection of the experience as a direct contradiction of their adventurous lifestyle, and they may even find it insulting. Every time we talk they constantly question my commitment to Buddhism because they see it as so restrictive, and they are of the modern opinion that all religion is just a mind control structure and so on and so on. I see it differently, and having been in their position I understand where they're coming from. But that's not my belief, my conviction. I think there's value in my own belief structure and I don't want to throw it away just like that. In Buddhism a lot of emphasis is placed on normality and down to earth sobriety and not using drugs or alcohol is one of the main training rules for earnest Buddhist practitioners. Over the years of practicing this way I've actually found a taste for normality and sobriety, and come to prefer it to wacky peak experiences.


But the thing is despite me visibly showing my discomfort, they're still pressuring me into it. We've been here for a couple weeks together and I've been abstsining from the daily rituals of getting stoned and drunk. The one guy I don't know too well will say things like ""cmon, you're gonna get fucked up at least one night before you go,"" and his wife keeps asking me leading questions like ""When are you going to smoke weed with us, like you promised?"" (Not true, I said I would think about it.) 

I mean, real friends wouldn't do this. 

Truth is these two kind of give me bad vibes. If there's anything in this world I am in tune with, it's people's vibes and these two are a little off kilter and frankly make me uncomfortable. I don't like the idea of doing acid with people I don't trust or see eye to eye with.

I mean I would feel a lot better if it was just an open invitation, but it's not. There's a lot of peer pressure for me to do it, and *soon*, like tomorrow, which makes me feel rushed and under pressure to make a decision.

I haven't actually said no directly because I have a very hard time establishing boundaries with people actually. I'm wondering if anyone has some input on how to handle this situation. I don't really want to hurt anyone's feelings but I want to stand up for myself.",24Feb2020,1

Math is one of my strongest subjects, and now I can’t stand looking at it. Our school is quite small so I can’t switch classes as our teacher also teaches the normal classes. I need advice whether I should try and change, or ask her to see if we can have a little bit of difference. I have spoken to other students in my class, and they for the most part agree.

We've been dating for almost 5 years and are talking about marriage. We're both in our mid 20's

He told me a person from his highschool messaged him saying she was going to ""ruin your relationship"". He didn't say how really. I guess some screenshots of him asking her for nudes or something? Well I guess he took it upon himself to block her from my Facebook so I ""won't have to work about it"".

This is a little fishy to me.

162,"Hey all, I(f) am a teen stuck in a pickle right now.   So, I met this guy a little over a year ago through mutual friends.  He seemed cool and we had quite a few of the same interests. 

Since that time, we learned a lot about each other, from favourite foods, to insecurities, and our hobbies.  It didn't take long for me to become attracted him, but overall we were just best friends.  We are inseparable.  It was (and still is) to the point where we basically call and play online together everyday.

January of this year, he told me that he had a crush on somebody.  He only gave vague details of the girl he liked.  It made me suspect that it he was talking about me, hence such little information, but I didn't push the subject.  Plus, I believed he was showing signs of romantic interest (holding hands, constantly begging me to hang out with him 1 on 1, etc...).  However, he said that he was going to ask her out on Valentine's Day.  From that day forward, I couldn't stop imagining him asking me out in all different scenarios.  I was falling head over heels for my best friend.

So, Valentine's Day roles around and he commits to asking the girl out.  It was not me, but a friend of mine!  Sadly, she turned him down, telling him she appreciated the gesture.  My best friend isn't a wreck, but I can sometimes still hear the heartbreak in his voice whenever she is brought up in conversation.  I feel so bad for him!  I've really tried being there for him, as supportive and sensitive, telling him my stories of crushes and rejection.

Recently, we both went for an outing with a few of our friends and it was great.  **Too** great.  We had a blast together, spending most of the time talking with each other and laughing the whole way.  It's made me realize that my feelings are stronger than I thought, I can't let go of this crush like I have done in the past.  He has become my motivation to go to school now.  I am just so lucky to have a best friend like him in my life!

I want to ask him out **so bad**.  I am afraid that this might be too sensitive for him right now though.  Not only could our friendship be ruined if we decided to date, it could also hit a sore spot for him to deal with more romantic drama.  Tough part is, I will be moving by the end of this year, and if I don't ask him out soon, I will never know what would have been.  I am not sure if I could handle a long distance relationship on top of everything else happening in my life either.

Do you think I would be unsupportive or dumb for asking my best friend out, or should I make a move?",24Feb2020,1

164,"I'm 28 years old, and I'm very anti social. Not because of anxiety or difficulty being social, in fact I'm quite skilled in socializing. I can go to a random public area and be the star of the party, I can make friends with everyone I meet at a job.. But the problem is, I never want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have pretty niche hobbies that I keep to myself, because I don't enjoy socializing with ""normal"" people. I like anime and honesetly gacha games, but I also don't like people liking the same things as me. Does that make any sense? Because it doesn't to me.

But I hate being ""alone"", I've spent 14 years in  a small group chat of about 10ish people, talked to them every day for that long. These are people I've never met IRL, purely online, and we all play the same stuff even 14 years later.

And I can safely say, I hate them. They're toxic, and I'm always extremely defensive because they legit attack me on a constant basis now. It's quite clear there's been ""cliques"" formed and they simply don't like me anymore, there's been evidence of side chats made that just confirms my suspicions. After 14 years and several years of trying to deal with this (some of the members who I have been pretty nice to only talks lately to say I'm wrong 5 times a day which is pretty weird, especially since I'm usually not), which gives weird and toxic vibes.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm stuck. I'm not here to deal with the drama, but I'm just stuck in general. If you want to ""leave"" a toxic group pushing you out but it's been your only tiny circle of friends for 14 years, what do you do? Everytime I socialize outside it, I just feel weird and that I don't fit in (because I don't fit in with anyone), and like I'll never make a circle of friends I can just be myself with again.

167,"I guess this question could actually go toward any situation, but specifically relationships. I won’t go into too much details but I’m in an argument with the BF right now, and now we’re even arguing about apologizing to each other. The thing is, this man never apologizes to me (we’ve been together for 4 1/2 years) like, ever. Anytime we have an argument I’m expected to just drop it and move on, and if I don’t it just causes more arguments so I’ve learned to just do it. Well I brought this up and to my surprise he decided to apologize for once. Until I was let down again, because his apology essentially went like this “I’m sorry for ___*insert what he did*___ but I wouldn’t of done that if you didn’t say ___*insert what I said*___” so he basically said he’s sorry, but it’s my fault he did what he did. I feel as though that’s not a sincere apology. You don’t apologize for something you did that hurt someone but justify it and blame your actions on the other person all in the same sentence. How can he truly be “sorry” for what hes done, if he’s still justifying it and saying if it wasn’t for what I said he wouldn’t of did what he did? So then when I brought this up, he said how he tries to apologize and then I’m telling him it’s not even a real apology so he’s just not gonna apologize anymore. And when I try to explain again why it’s not, he’s still justifying it saying “yea I know cuz I wouldn’t of did that if you didn’t say that” so it’s clearly just useless trying to get this through his head. Anyway, my question is, do I have a right to feel this way? Am I right in regards to if you’re apology consists of saying you’re sorry but immediately after you justify what you did and blame it on the other person, that that isn’t a sincere apology?

171,"Background: I'm currently a 20 year old woman (nearly 21) and I was sexually abused by my older cousin (22 year old woman; nearly 23). Anyway, we are cousins (our parents are siblings) and our families hang out a lot (our parents work together).

Anyway, this person messaged me 13 months ago to apologize for what happened, and ever since then all of my memories have come back and have been hitting me. I was diagnosed with PTSD a little over a week ago, and I can't even look at her face without wanting to freak out. She was being abused by other people and then took out all of it on me, so I don't 100% blame her, but still. I can't even smell my own breath without freaking out because I remember the smell of her breath so vividly (tmi sorry). 

So, because our families are so close, I don't know what I should do. I don't want to be around her because I remember everything and I'm worried I'll have a panic attack infront of her/our other family, but I feel cruel about kicking her out of my life, especially since she has children.

Also, she told her mother what she did, and I think she told her husband because the last time I saw/spoke to him he wouldn't talk to me like normal/look at me normally, which I wish she hadn't done as I don't want people to know about it. I'm also worried she told other people.

So I guess my question is, am I cruel to want her out of my life/wanting to distance myself from her, or am I justified?

172,"Like the title states, and a TL;DR, it is long, I have a noisy upstairs neighbour, but I'm also concerned that other activities upstairs are going to affect my peace and enjoyment and functionality of the building, and I'd like a kind way to let them know how loud they're being and how their activity potentially will cause damage to the building *before* going to strata. For reference, I have lived in the complex for nearly 2 years, in my current unit for 7 months, and my neigbours moved in about a month ago.

They have a small child who has just learned to walk, I suspect. I am also a parent! My son is 4 and we're always working on being good neighbours. I understand that children make plenty of noise. I have always tried to be respectful of my neighbours and I told my son that if he wanted to bang pots and pans that he needed to do it on the couch or something else that would muffle the noise between floors or even on the second level where noise wouldn't carry (I previously lived in an upper unit in the same building and then moved to a lower unit two doors down; these are townhouses with lower suites that have separate entrances). I never received any complaints about my son but I was proactive in ensuring he wasn't bothering the people below us, and constantly vigilant. These new tenants have a child that is constantly running back and forth through the unit and slamming things on the floor. They are large family (there are around 6 people in the 3bdrm unit) who frequently have many house guests despite being told that they need to rent the amenity rooms for large gatherings. Granted, they are within hours set forth by city bylaw, but the noise is, in my opinion, excessive. I feel like I'm living in this video at this point: https://youtu.be/4IRB0sxw-YU

There is also a playground in the courtyard within view of their front patio, stairs accessible from ground level, and the nights are getting shorter so I feel like this child needs to burn some energy outdoors before coming inside for the night.

As well, from living in the upper suites and making friends with the legacy gossip in our complex, I know the pipes in this building are small and interconnected in groups of 4 and that garburator use is heavily discouraged; if the unit upstairs gets clogged it will clog two lower units and an adjoining upper unit. In the upper suite, we once had a clog so bad that the unit below us flooded in the middle of the night and all 4 units needed to be serviced at strata's cost. The plumbers said they'd never seen clogging that bad and that the previous tenants likely put too many starchy foods down the drain such as rice and pasta. They recommended zero garburator use because our plumbing is just not fit for it despite their presence. Based on the noise I hear when I *am* home, the new upstairs tenants run their garburator upwards of ten times a day for appx 30-40 seconds at a time, and not only is the noise terrible, but concerning re: plumbing issues.

My unit is rented to me via the property manager of the complex on behalf of the company that built the complex. The unit upstairs is privately owned but is subject to strata. The legacy gossip is, as i mentioned, a good friend of mine, but asking her to say something may cause discord with the upstairs neighbours that I don't want because her personality can be caustic to people who dont know her very well. Shes honestly my closest friend, and I'd ask her to say something if I didn't care, but I do. I do not want this family to be fined or to hate me because i said something. I dont really want to go to the property manager because i like to limit the time i spend communicating with her as shes fairly irascible (not just to me, but in general). 

I would like to speak to them in person or if anxiety gets the best of me to write them a letter; what is the best way to approach them without being hostile or making them put up their guard? The noise is untenable at this point and I cant afford to move, but my anxiety has never been higher. Please help me.

181,"So I met this guy like two years ago and became friends. We did have a little bit of a sexual relationship but we mostly just had oral sex. I hadn't seen him for a while so last week I texted him and asked him what he was doing. He said he was at a hotel three hours away for work. He asked me if I wanted to come up and see him. I didn't really want to at first but I missed him and drove up there. When I got there we just talked and caught up. I remember telling him that I didn't know if I should come up there or not. I laid on the bed and he got on top of me and was like ""well you're here. Let's just make the best of it."" Then he started kissing me and we had sex for the first time and we cuddled the rest of the night. 


Yesterday night he texted me and asked me what I was doing. I told him I had just gotten home from work. He asked if we could hangout and I said I would think about it. Then he was like ""well maybe we can go out for dinner if you haven't already eaten or go see a movie like we used to or just chill and smoke or something."" I told him I wanted to take a nap for a couple hours and he said it was fine. I ended up telling him I was too tired to hangout that night and he said it will all good.


Earlier today he asked me what my plans are today. I told him I was going to do stuff around the house but other than that nothing. He asked me if I wanted to hangout and I told him I would let him know in an hour or so. I ended up going to his place. When I got there he gave me a hug and a kiss on the lips. We sat on the couch and talked for a little while. I was really tired and started falling asleep. He asked if I wanted to go lay in bed and I said sure. So we ended up going into his room and we talked a little more and I ended up falling asleep for six hours. When I woke up he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner and I told him I wasn't feeling the best and went home. 


I just feel really stupid for going to his house just to sleep and not taking the opportunity to actually spend time with him. I honestly want to ask him if we can still hangout but I'm not sure what to do.

183,"So when I first started school I became best friends with this guy who we will call D and through out all of primary school we would do typical play together stuff

Then in secondary school he became a lot more critical of me and would find any excuse to shout at me despite knowing of my sensitive hearing but we remained friends, cut to third year and I was being relentlessly bullied and decided to talk to him about it, he responded by basically telling me it wasn't his problem and he wasn't going to help

Despite the state that left me in I stayed friends with him because I felt lonely but our friendship slowly turned into a cycle of us bejng friends, him doing something hurtful (insulting my autism, telling me I don't deserve friends, on one or two occasions punching me, starting arguments out of something like me being happy about an achievement etc), me not talking to him, him acting nice and constantly talking to me to get me to talk to him again, I forgive, we friends for a few days, he goes back to doing hurtful things to me until I stop talking to him, it was a never ending cycle

Eventually I became friends with someone in my year and we started talking constantly and for some reason D decided to be rude to her and imply he doesn't want to be anywhere near her at all, when we asked what was wrong he went on a long rant about how insufferable I was and how I don't deserve friends and all that 

So after that i finally put my foot down and decided I wasn't going to put up with him anymore and of course he does the typical fake nice thing, but I refused to say a word to him and would often just put earphones in and act like I was listening to music (and whenever I did he would rant about how insufferable I was)

So after a while of this I get word from new friend that D has been constantly bothering her and trying to convince her that I was obsessed with her so I break my silence and message D asking to stop, he tells me it was a joke so I send him screenshots where it shows he clearly wasn't joking, he responds by sending me the dictionary definition of a joke and then goes on about how I should be lucky he even talks to me because I don't deserve friends and that I should be happy he wants to talk to me, this causes a massive argument where I tell him I sick I am of all his bs while he tells me I'm horrible and i am lucky he's even willing to be my friend, this all leads to me asking why he even wants to be friends with me when he clearly finds me insufferable and send a screenshot of him saying he's sad that he has to sit next to me in maths, he claimed that he said he was sad because we were friends and I wouldn't talk to him and that's why he said he was sad in the message, so I completely lose it and tell him and I don't ever want to talk to him ever again 

So after that not much happens, I enjoy my last year and a half of secondary school pretty happy but after I graduated I randomly came home to a letter from him saying he's sorry for the way he's treated me and such

After forgiving him a thousand times I decide to ignore the letter and get on with my life but I've never stopped wondering why he was the way he was, did he keep me around so that he can have someone to complain about to his actual friends? Did he just find my autism that horrible to deal with? Was he really sorry? Why was I the only one he seemed to have treated this way?

I don't plan on ever talking to him again but I desperately want to know why he was the way he was",24Feb2020,1

I have an orientation there in a few months which my dad may attend and even if he doesn't, he'll introduce himself to my roommate or later to friends and they'll all be confused! I don't want to admit to my dad and I don't want to have to introduce myself as my given name.

A couple of my institution's research papers were accepted to be published and offered to be presented in an international conference in Bali. My work is sending me, due to my presentation skills and availability to go. 

I do not have much in terms of disposable income and had not had the chance to travel the world after school like I would have wished too. So for me, this is a great opportunity to fulfill some of that dream right now, see Bali and stay at a luxurious hotel for 4 days all expenses covered. The experience of presenting your research at a conference would be nice, and there is even a high chance I can bring my girlfriend along as well.

But this is all **IF** I get the disease somehow. My management left the decision up to me, and I have to give them an answer tomorrow.

195,"(Abridged question at bottom)

I am a freshman in college and I have no idea what I want to do or how to get there. Classic.

I excelled in high school academically, but I never really thought ahead about what I wanted to do so when college applications rolled around I was like, ""Okay, guess I'll do it too."" Classic.

I've switched majors 3 times. I can imagine myself as a doctor, but others I have met who pursue medicine are real depressing to be around, and that's deterring. I seem to understand physics and math much better, but I don't know if it would be more rewarding in terms of fulfillment and financial stability.

I've thought about joining our military program. While I feel like this would waste my potential and effort toward getting into med school, I don't know if I can compete with my peers who are also vying for med school. It might coincide with studying physics better. The financial compensation is good too because I worry I'm wasting my parents' money by not knowing what I want to study.

Also relevant, I'm still feeling down from a long-distance, nonmutual breakup several months ago. She's incredibly ambitious and knew what she wanted to do since she was little. I had the ""I'm happy as long as I have someone"" mentality. These did not mix well with long distance. I went so far as to intentionally avoid talking to people because I thought she was all I needed. Welp, here we are. Despite no contact, I think about her every day and it makes me sad. I beat myself up so hard that I don't trust my own intuition on anything, from answering questions on tests to thinking of things to talk about in conversations.

I'm basically living day by day, cycling through thoughts of being a doctor, an active duty soldier, or an engineer; and I keep thinking about how my ex might see me in the future. Simultaneously, I'm taking a couple of classes that 1) are not required for my major and 2) are mentally draining and unenjoyable. I don't even know what I enjoy anymore outside of school because all of my time goes toward studying; forcing social interaction to compensate for what I deprived myself of from first semester; and daydreaming about meeting my ex again one day. All while trying to figure out what it is I want to do with my life.

**tl;dr How do I find what I enjoy? How do I move past an ex? Is it worth doing what you enjoy if you could earn more money by doing something else you enjoy less?**",24Feb2020,1
196,"In no way at all does their divorce effect me other than it being sad for my mom. Making this post because I’m an adult and this is her second marriage.

197,"Tldr: my sister doesnt clean and i need advice. 

So for well over a year now I have been living with my sister in a place that we both found together. It's a 2 bedroom and 1.5 bathroom town house with carpets and a fairly substantial back yard. 

My sister and I both work, she has a full time job with weird hours and I collect jobs where I can but can always pay rent and bills except for 2 months last year when I was finishing my thesis which my sister covered and I have paid her back for. 

My partner also spends a lot of time with us and I have gotten no complaints about from my sister and he helps me do chores. 

Now here is the hairy part. My sister doesn't do any cleaning unless specifically asked every time and even then she doesn't do a good job. She cleans her dishes if they like up too high and does her own laundry. But that is it. 

Every time I bring it up she cries for at least 30 minutes, but we came to a solution of a weekly chores chart. But it hasn't changed. 

I confronted her in a very careful way this morning asking her to do the chores weekly. To which she said that I need to ask her to do despite the chore list. And then she sobbed for a good 45 minutes and I haven't seen her since. 

Thus wouldn't be such an issue if I wasn't in the smaller room, organise the maintenance, get the lawn mowed, have more chores, stay home from work when we have inspections, and chase her up every month for days about sending me our utility bills so I can pay half. 

I have no idea what to do in this situation. Our lease is up in july, which is when I plan on moving however what are some reasonable solutions? Lower my rent or swap rooms and do more chores? Hope that she will change after months of asking? What do you think?",24Feb2020,1

207,"Okay, where to start. First of all, im 20,male, my best friend 19,female. We met 2015 online and have had contact every single day up to last years february. We live some 600km away from each other and have seen each other the first time in 2018, skype aside of course. Now, selfpityful as it might sound, i didnt have the best time in my life the last 5-6 years. Massive beef with my mom resulting in me cramping my room full of stuff all over and not leaving the exact same place of my couch for months, problems in school which resulted in me switching schools for the last year of school which had me isolated completely, now my apprenticeship which makes me do slave like tasks 12h a day for 10+ days straight isnt helping me either apart from paying the bills and the friends i currently have require me to put on a fassade all the time to a point where i dont even know who i am anymore. With her, however, i could express myself freely. She was my only social contact i truly enjoyed and that all the time. She has got a pretty sophisticated life, she has upon other things literally everything i long for, again as clichè as that might sounds. Great friends, family, money, vacations, the looks, fun in life with a positive attitude. I began to envy her and she knew that, we both disliked that, but i couldnt help myself. If your dream life was lived right in front of you for more than 1000 days straight, how are you supposed to not feel the long for that? Especially if that person is your only true friend. I believe its no surprise that i began to fall for her pretty quickly, i now believe it started because i wanted to have more part in her life fleeing mine and got stronger because we almost grew inseparable. I know that as her closest friend talking to her daily i had shared a huge part of her life already. And i was more than glad i did. But as such close relationships go and me knowing she had at least a crush on me early on that pretty much went to nothing because of the distance i wanted to be her closest companion like she was mine. Then, she met her now boyfriend. Obviously, that broke my heart hearing from her that she grew more and more attached to him daily, lets not bore you with that, but more importantly, i have felt like a third wheel big time. My most important friend suddenly found an even more important relationship than we had. For 4 years i felt needed, and irreplacable, but all of a sudden that wasnt the case anymore. If i wasnt there for her, he was. If i havent written her most of the day, suddenly it wasnt a big deal anymore. What was my point in this relationship anymore apart from being second choice? My already growing negative attitude towards life and its bs suddenly spiked to a point i couldnt hold my tears just seing pictures of her. I still struggle now, a year later. I couldnt bear this for long, she realised how crushed i was and then asked me whether or not my feelings outgrew that of friendship. I then told her crushing her as well. She had a hunch of that already since i couldnt stand hearing boyfriends name, let alone talk about how hes the nicest person she ever met aso. She told me shed always love me -as a friend- while crying her eyes out as well and then we cut contact. 

Now, there are a couple of additional things that came with this: i moved out of my former flat i shared with someone since their sexlife killed me inside to a point i  have kind of developed an anxiety of hearing that sound and not being able to gave it at all .i heard shes happier than ever from another friend which makes me feel not validated, third wheelish, unneeded, although im beyond happy for her.i am absolutely lonely, no one that understands me or really wants me, partcially have been suicidal, depressed, sleep deprived,eating alot, feeling pathetic about myself.
Its her birthday on feburary 26th and mines on march 13th. I really want to wish her a happy birthday and talk to her but also dont wamt to crawl back to her. I want to be wanted by her and if she doesnt write me on my birthday, Im gonna feel absolutely replaced. If she does, i dont know what to do. I know that being dependend on one person is stupid, but can you blame me for that? I want to know.

I’ve been best friends with my crush for about 3 years. I didn’t rlly start liking him until a year ago. Things were going rlly great and we talked 8-20 hours every day. It was probably the best and happiest time period for both of us. Then he started talking to me less and less until we eventually only talked every 2 weeks. It took MONTHS for him to finally admit to me that he’s been depressed.

I tried helping him by being there for him and supporting him. He appreciates it and tells me I’ve done nothing wrong, but I’m worried for him and I don’t know where I stand. I’m pretty sure he had romantic feelings for me too, but recently my brother told me that if he rlly liked me he would have continued talking to me. I’m torn because I don’t know the extent of his depression or what it even feels like. I want to help him as much as I can, but I don’t want to overstep my boundaries.

Eventually, she ghosts me, that hurt the most. I didn’t except it from her, I asked if I could get some stuff back I lent her after 3 weeks and she finally replied, and said she felt like she was leading me on, and it was always awkward because it was just the two of us, which absolutely crushed me. 

I told her how I felt, basically put my heart out to her and she never replied, and unfollowed me manual from her insta. It’s been months and everyday I still breakdown about it and think about everything I could have done differently, and stuff reminds me of her all the time because we had so much in common that I just break down when I’m alone.

My parents are charging me about $400/month in rent with the promise to give it back to me some day (don't know if that's going to hold, but I'll assume they're telling the truth). On the other hand, I want to live outside of the house and move out. I have a roommate lined up and my girlfriend is up to move in as well, so I can choose between them (probably the gf). That'd bring any rent down to around the $600/month level, plus maybe $150/month of split bills for internet and utilties ($750/month total). 

The logical thing is to stay at home, pay no real rent, and just save up money for grad school. I'm finding it really hard to fight the urge to leave though. My gf and I have been dating for 3 years and we've been wanting to move in together for a while. She's in a bit of a fluctuating family situation though and still has to go to school because of it holding her up for the last few years (in addition to her holding herself back a little bit as well, though she's been working on that and making progress). Here at home I'm also of course not really allowed to be me. My parents are relatively single-minded, my-way-or-the-highway kind of people so generally speaking I have freedom to do things, but I'm always held on a figurative leash that can be taken back at anytime (curfews, restrictions on doing things like videogames, getting shamed for doing things they don't like such as videogames or going out late, etc.).

I want to move out and be free, as stupid as that sounds. But I know that if I were to make the right financial move, I'd live at home until either they kick me out or I go to grad school in a few years. As much as that makes me cringe, I know it'd be the ""right"" decision. 

I guess that's my question: do I choose the ""right"" thing and accept the limitations of living at home, or be the ""normal"" young adult and move out?",24Feb2020,1

Hey guys :/ (18) 
So I’m halfway through my first year in a private institution and it’s pretty much a for profit hellhouse. I was tricked into thinking that it was a good idea. I mean 1 course every 5 weeks. Learn at your own pace. I thought that “wow I can stay at home, work and get a degree.” 

I did not truly know how stupid that decision was until now. For the first couple of courses I thought wow this is really easy. No stress, nothing. Then I realized how much it was costing me per class after loans. And how much the program was before loans (55k 😓) I owe the school currently 10k after loans. After just 8 months. 

I know that a lot of people will probably dog on this post but, I’m just not happy. I’m not learning anything towards my degree. They are just milking me with these dumb classes that don’t pertain to anything of interest. The teachers are awful and don’t help with anything and the advisors are just props, that hang out in the back and are not useful. I’m not happy with where I am, I don’t know if this is the degree that I truly want in the long run. 

So the question is, “was dropping out worth it, and how did you plan for the money that you still owed the school.” 
( I do know about the 90 day grace period)

226,"This ""problem"" has always been bothering me and I don't really know who I should talk to about it. I live in a world where I constantly fear my mother. People say that your parents know you more than anyone in the world, but for me, my mom knows just the tip of the iceberg. My mother grew up a muslim and encourages me and my sibling to practise islam as well. Because of this, she forces me to do things that I do not agree with. First of all, I do not want to be religious. I have no problem with religious people, It's not like I hate them, It's just that I don't want to practise a religion. I'd rather live freely, or discover religion (or islam in this case) on my own. My mother forces me to practise Islamic things which I DO NOT want to do. She wants me to pray five times a day, read the Qur'an, Fast during ramadan, attend Friday prayers, and even go to Islamic lessons. She's been pushing these things since a young age, and in any case I say no to doing so, she beats me. I hate being beaten from my mom. She gets very VERY aggressive quickly and does not stop being aggressive for a few days. My father mentioned that what she has is something called ""bipolar"". Im not quite sure what it is, but my mom gets angry VERY fast. Because we are an ""Islamic"" family, my mother is completely against her children dating. When she found out that my brother had a girlfriend, she want crazy. She slapped my brother in public and even called my brother's girlfriend calling her a ""dirty whore"" and telling her to ""satisfy herself by dipping her pussy in vinegar"". I was stunned when I witnessed this. I had never been so terrified by anyone in my life. When we got home later that day, she took a rope and started beating my brother with it. She even took my brother out of school for a week and sent him to stay at a mosque to re-evaluate himself as a muslim. She took him out of school for a week during his IGCSE exam year. She even thought of holding my brother back from school a year so that he wouldn't be in the same class as his girlfriend. It was outrageous. Another big part of me that my mother doesn't know about is that I have been dating a girl for 13 months now behind her back. We'll call her Emma. I love Emma from the bottom of my heart. She's brought me so much happiness and I don't know where i'd be without her. But I dread the day my mother finds out about her. I fear that what happened to my brother will happen to me, but 100x worse. I don't know how much longer I can hide my relationship with Emma from my mother. Because of my religious household, Ive tried to stay out of home as much as possible. I do multiple extra activities during the weekend to stay away from home and I always have extra classes after school to avoid going home. It's gotten to a point where I fear coming back home and leaving my room. I fear my mother in general. And I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. What should I do?",24Feb2020,1

I didn’t say anything for a couple days to see if she would tell me and she did and she asked me “would you feel weird if I dated your friend” and of course I lied and told her I wouldn’t but I did tell her that I wouldn’t talk to her about the things we talk about now because I wouldn’t want to upset my friend. Btw my friend knew I talked to her earlier in the summer. So they tried it and it didn’t work and then come October they try it again and at this point I’ve lost feelings for her completely.

They try it again earlier in February and it didn’t work out again and she comes to tell me that she can’t find anyone that she can relate to as much as me and just connects with me and she tells me that she has feelings for me and stuff and I’m awestruck by this and I really don’t know what to do because some of her friends have liked me in the past and my friend has liked her in the past and I don’t wanna break bro code but is he really my bro if he talked to her after I tried to talk to her?

231,"     Okay I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible. My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) broke up over a month ago and I moved to another state. I started looking for people on tinder so I could make friends and get to know the area but I wasn’t sure if it would work out that way. I thought I’d be lucky if I found someone who only had intentions of being my friend. Well I did, and I matched with this guy (22M) who ended up being an awesome person and didn’t make me in anyway uncomfortable. 

    When I first started talking to him I thought of him strictly platonically. He’s been trying to introduce me into festival stuff because I’ve never been into it but I figured I would give it a shot. So we went to a show the other night together and prior to the show I started thinking about him a bit more sexually.. during the entire show I literally just wanted to kiss him and made him hug me like 3 times. He’s honestly just a great person to be around and we have connected so well, we even call his house my second home already. 

    Honestly I get the vibe that he may like me in that way back but when we started this friendship it was kinda understood that we would just be friends. Now, this guy is not my type at all looks wise and he seems to get friend zoned a lot. Which makes me kind of sad because each day I spend with him the more attractive I start to think he is. I just do not know what to do? Should I wait it out to get more of a feel or should I just straight up say “I find you really attractive”. I’ve never hooked up before so it’s just terrifying to me. Also it’s only been 18 days that we have known each-other lol. Please help me before I drive myself insane. 


TL:DR; I (20F) met a (22M) guy off tinder as a strictly platonic thing. I’m only 18 days in and can not stop thinking about him sexually. I think he might like me in that way too, but I don’t know for certain considering a platonic relationship was very understood at the beginning.",24Feb2020,1

240,"I’m sorry if this ends up being really long but here it goes.
I have this guy friend that I’ve known for a few years. We used to hang out quite a lot with another friend, but never actually just the two of us. We’ve sort of drifted more recently and don’t really hang out at all but I still see him at school every so often. 
A few months ago he randomly just snapchatted me asking if I could keep a secret. I said yes and he told me his au pair was back in town and asked him if he wanted to hook up. He told me he agreed and proceeded to tell me some disturbing stories of sexual stuff they had done together while he was just 12 years old. He always tells these stories in parts and says he needs me to reply so he knows I’ve read each sentence before he can go on.
I told him I didn’t quite feel comfortable with these stories he was telling me but he somehow made me feel guilty afterwards like I was the one in the wrong because I wasn’t “helping him.” So I let him tell me more of these stories because I couldn’t stand not helping my friend even though I felt extremely uncomfortable. 
The thing is, every single one of his stories sounded like they were straight out of a porn movie. The way he described these women, some of them more than twice his age, basically doing anything just to sleep with him. They always had the the same general story line which began with the woman being in utter awe of his size.
The whole thing just didn’t sound right. So I would say something like, “wow that sounds almost like a fantasy or dream. It doesn’t seem real.” And he would reply with, “trust me, I dream about it all the time.” But he would never actually confirm that these were real. 
At one point he sent me a photo of his dick to get “advice” or “approval” because he wanted to send it to his au pair. 
Now since this is on Snapchat, there isn’t really any evidence of anything he had told me, except for the first story or two he told me, because he had me save them so he could remember where he was in the story. But he would sometimes save a few of my messages completely out of context and made them sound sexual. 
He also would try to get me to talk dirty to him or send him nude photos of myself to “help” him. I told him I felt uncomfortable with this so his compromise was just talking dirty to (or more like at) me instead. I know I shouldn’t have let it keep continuing but every time I wouldn’t agree to something I felt like I was hurting him. 
So I wouldn’t reply right away or just not open anything he sent me until a full day had passed. The longer and longer I would wait, the more he would snap me asking where I went. 
Recently I was talking with a female friend of mine who has known him pretty well and I brought up the subject of him telling me all these stories and she said he does the exact same thing to her too. Even at the same general time.
Both of us thought we were the only ones. But now I’m wondering if he has done this to other girls, and if they have done anything about it. My friend hasn’t told anyone but me but I feel like we need to say something to someone. But I don’t know who or what to even say because I somehow still don’t want to get him in trouble because I have to see him. And I still feel like I could have stopped this earlier so it’s somehow my fault. 
Anyway, if anyone has somehow been in a similar situation before or could offer some advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",24Feb2020,1
241,"So long story short yesterday my friend was going out and the girl she invited brought so many people, and friends of friends and all that. I guess this girl brought her cousins and one of them happened to be my brothers friend, or maybe he knew him. Im a sophomore in college and the thing is I don’t want the high schooler to tell me brother that we hung out together or anything, and the only reason I went out to eat with that group is bc this one girl (the high schoolers cousin) was all over me and the attention felt good so I just went with them. And just to clear it up everybody was 18+ and I’m only a sophomore in college, it was just him that was still in high school.

I know how high schoolers are and he’s gonna want to brag that he went to a party or something and tell my little brother, but i was in downtown drinking and doing shots, and my parents just thought I was hanging out with friends. I want to text the girl and be like tell your  little cousin not to say anything to my brother, but I don’t know if it’d be too much. 

I don’t really like the girl that much either so I wouldn’t really care what she thinks, but would doing so make the high schooler more inclined to talk to my brother, or maybe by not saying anything he’ll just hopefully forget. 

The worse case scenario is he tells my brother that I was drinking, feeling up basically both his girl cousins and my brother would probably tattle. I think my brother would probably use it against me and tell my mom or something, and I really just don’t want to deal with that tbh. What do you think I should do?",24Feb2020,1
243,"Hi all,

I’m a 21 year old college student whose frustrated with my parents obsession with my grades. I’ve always been naturally smart and have always done the bare minimum in school. I prefer learning independently, classes always moved far too slowly and since starting university I’ve noticed a substantial drop in the quality of instruction (last semester 1/2 my teachers didn’t speak English!) I average about one non-fiction book a week and have for the past 4 years, I’ve gained infinitely more knowledge from those than anything I’ve learnt in school - and the best part? No evaluations and it’s at my pace. 

I now go to one of the top schools in my country and have the equivalent of about a 2.3 GPA. Now I’m not naive enough to believe that that’ll get me a good job offer after graduating so instead I’ve focused on building a strong resume. In the past 3 years I’ve worked a professional internship for 8 months, travelled solo to 5 countries with the money and am currently launching a unique non-profit clean-tech company within my school. Everything I know about business came from reading and flipping thrift-store goods while I was in high school. I’ve been interviewed by top firms in my field, met several CEOs and have never once been asked for my GPA, so why bother? I skip all of my lectures and cram for midterms and finals enough to get a pass. The rest of my time is spent working, exercising, reading and socializing. At this point I’m only at school for the degree. 

I look at my peers who spend most of their time studying with nothing to show for it except for a high GPA. I feel like I’ve had a much richer and quite frankly exciting university experience than them in addition to being much better positioned to find a job or start my own business post-graduation. 

I’m honest with my parents about all of this and they don’t really seem to care or congratulate me on anything I’ve done - all that they care about is my GPA. They disagree with my assessment of the university system being deeply flawed and outdated and seem to believe that the only path forward in my career is to study hard. It’s a frustrating conversation to have with them every time I go home and it seems impossible to flip their point of view and I don’t want this to remain a point of contention between us.

I don't want to seem like im judging her, but she tells me how much the mess stresses her out daily. I just don't know how to help her. Do I offer to pay for a cleaning lady? Do I offer to help her organize everything? Do I offer to pay for organizational furniture? Do I tell her the cold hard truth that her place looks like our hording mother's house? Do I mind my own damn business?
I have the means to do any of the things I offer, but I don't want to seem like a dick because she works hard and is doing her best. She needs a place to bring her peace and her home isn't that place right now, and that makes me sad.

251,"Okay, so, I'm still very young (compared to everyone else on this sub) and I am taken care of by my grandmother. I'm basically forced to eat, she always makes me food for when I come home from school even when I try to tell her that I'm not hungry, she still tries to make me eat. I don't eat at school and lie about what I had for lunch (water) and say it was something like pasta. I don't eat at school because I know that she's going to make me eat when I get home, and when I tried to avoid eating for a while, she took me to the doctors because she was concerned about my weight. I was 116 at 5'2, and I take that as I'm fat. I've seen the doctors charts on his computer and it shows that I'm above average, and because I forgot to tell him things, I had to go back a week later, and I had gone from 116 to 121. She's making me eat and I don't want to. Does anyone have any advice on how I could slow down my eating while still showing her that I am so she doesn't force me to eat as much?",24Feb2020,1

253,"Hi Reddit. Right now I live on New Jersey, USA. I moved out of Florida 2 years ago, and away from my parents and my sister. A year ago or so, my parents got into a complicated situation that almost ended up in divorce, and now they're living in the same house (to save money and all) but never talk to each other. I really don't care about my parents' problems, and I moved out mainly because I wanted to be as far away from them as possible.

However, my sister (who is the only person that I really care about and love) spends most of her time with my mom in her room, and it's been quite difficult for her to endure this situation (she's 15). She has been really sad and overwhelmed by homework and college plans, and tells me that she misses me so much and that she really needs me in her life. I only visit them twice a year, and she really enjoys spending time with me. To make things worst, my dad is kind of depressed, my mom is always manipulating my sister and wants no one to contradict her (she never cares about what my sister or I want, just that we accomplish the dreams that she has for us and that she probably couldn't accomplish by herself when she was younger), and she has no one to open up to, except me.

In addition, I've started to hate NJ and NY a bit. I live in a rrrrrealy small apartment, and the city life has just given me a moderate depression, anxiety, an isolated life, f*cking winter and, well, more money than what I was making in Florida.

What do you suggest? Should I move back to FL (not with my parents, but close to them)? I've never really cared about many things or many people, but I think that if I don't go there and make my sister happy, the only person I care about, I'll regret it.",24Feb2020,1

256,"sorry this is really long- 

We were in a LDR and only got to see each other a few times a year. 

This relationship didn’t start off the best. We met online and instantly flirted hard. But then he was talking to another girl who I revealed as a catfish. A very obvious catfish at that. The flirting started getting serious and I told him LDR wasn’t for me. Somehow I ignored that and kept talking to him, falling for him. After almost a year we talked about meeting up and we did after that only a handful of times. It was then I made sure he knew I could never leave my family. I’ve always shared with him how close I am with my family- I lost my dad early on in my childhood and that made me close with my remaining family. 

I’m going to call him “D” for the sake of this post. D assured me he understood and wanted to come to me in the future to live. We talked about this many times. I opened up to D and D gave me love and attention. 

And a lot of insecurities. He made fun of me constantly and said it was teasing and joking. I would be put down for being so uptight and not taking a joke. He made fun of me over things he knew I was insecure about. My facial features, my small boobs, etc. And when I would tell him I didn’t like that he would say but I like those things about you even though the way it was said was negative. “Why are your boobs so small” or “goodnight tiny tits” apparently isn’t mean if D likes those things about me, even though it was putting me down in a way and pointing out my insecurities it was okay. D’s logic was hard to argue. And someone liking my flaws is a good thing, right? 

D also gave me trust issues. We were open about our social media as that’s where we first met. We were active on Q&amp;amp;A sites together, FB, instagram... I noticed D always liking the same girls photos. And not just liking them, commenting on them. Heart eyes, compliments of them being “hot” “pretty” or “beautiful” - I told D this all made me really uncomfortable. D said I’m just acting like a kid. I’m just jealous. I have issues. I have jealousy issues. I have insecurity issues. It’s all me. D said it’s not like he’s cheating. It’s just photos, it’s just comments. They don’t mean anything. If he’s not cheating how can I be mad? 

(TW eating disorders) Around the time I met D I was in a back and forth swing with anorexia. I had some secret tumblr accounts, but at this point in time (a little over a year in our relationship) I was really working with recovery. But with D’s constant flirting with other girls and not being in person made me so insecure I did something wrong. I asked for his passwords. I felt this was the only way for me to feel safe in this LDR. If it was just comments and likes then what was there to hide? Weirdly enough D agreed to this. Maybe it was because he would have lost me then if he hadn’t agreed. Now I wish he hadn’t so I could’ve left and moved on. 

D’s communication with other girls continued. It wasn’t serious but it was flirting- physical comments. But I can’t be mad, it’s not cheating. It wasn’t until it was that is with girl #1 we will call A. A was in a relationship so for me to question D about her was insane. Can he not have friends who are girls? Thats what he said until I found him telling her he liked her and thought she was pretty. I also found at this point that he saved some of her photos. Saving photos became another issue. This is when I decided to walk away. I was completely heartbroken. I had told D countless times about my biggest fears of relationships- being cheated on, being left, being unloved. I was destroyed. I refused to talk to him. Until he wrote me a love letter. Apologizing, saying he loved me. And how he would never do that again, he regrets it all. I bought it, unfortunately. Another mistake of mine. 

I felt so close with D. I felt a false sense of security. D sees my flaws and still loves me. He could’ve left me for A but he didn’t and he regrets it. D now promises to never hurt me. I opened up to D not long after even more about how in love I was. That he could do anything and I would still want him and love him. Boy was I wrong. And I know now that wasn’t love. It was D making me feel this way through manipulation. I was completely hooked. 

Throughout years 2-4 we had some of the same issues. D’s flirting, comments, girls photos. That’s when I found he saved a few particular celebrities photos. Beautiful ones of course. I thought this was kind of weird but D said I’m not there and he’s a guy. Even though I sent him hundreds and hundreds of my own nudes and videos it just wasn’t enough for D. He already used those ones, he’s bored of them. He needs new ones. I was often harassed about giving him more, when I said please stop asking he said yeah okay but would ask an hour later or the next day. I went completely unheard no matter how many times I said stop asking. Here have some now please stop asking that can’t be the only thing our relationship is about. 

D would say I complained too much. I was too jealous. I was too insecure. All I do is complain about him- asking for him to not ask for nudes, telling him of girls he was making me uncomfortable about. That wasn’t fair because D was going through hard times. He didn’t have a job, he was ‘homeless’ aka living on his friends or cousins couches. But I believed in D. this was bad circumstances. This was because of his bad childhood, because of his mom. So I shut up for awhile again. 

Until he cheated on me with two people and I caught it. This time the cheating was a bit different. Both the girls he cheated on me with were MTF. Now, I already knew D liked MTF, he however would use words not so pleasant. I assume it was more a sexual thing at the time. he said he just liked the porn. I was never sure how to feel about this. I’m bisexual myself, I’ve watched girl on girl and guy on guy before so this was okay. I felt it was a little weird only because I felt he was sexualizing MTF but I don’t know enough to know if that’s wrong or okay. But seeking out two MTF and talking to them, sending them nudes and asking for them in return? I did know how I felt about that and that was cheating. I felt destroyed. We broke up. I refused to talk to him. 

Well, I tried to refuse to. But me, I have this bad habit of ignoring or muting him but waiting to see what he says and the second he replies I read it and reply anyways. D told me it was his twin brother pretending to be him. D did not cheat. His brother has all his passwords. His brother always does this stuff. I didn’t believe him at first but he would call, and plead. He even had his brother talk to me and say it was him. I was so heartbroken. I didn’t know what to believe. D was so angry that I would think he would do these things. It was all his brothers fault. And just like that it was easier to let D mend my broken heart then try and leave. So D would cheat and I would be paranoid. Then I would be put down for being jealous and having trust issues. 

One year later and we have good moments and bad. I still complain too much for him but I am trying so hard to be a good girlfriend. I tell D I am jealous because LDR is so hard, it’s different when he’s not here. I wouldn’t feel insecure if he was here about other girls because then I would have D in person and those other girls would just have words. But right now I just have words too so it’s hard. I gave D money - he was homeless after all and his talk about not eating and having no where to go made me cry endlessly. Through a few months time span I probably sent $400. This was 5 years into the relationship and I had never sent money before then. That was really stupid. 

I tried to motivate D. I started research on employment centers and services. I sent things to him and he got mad. He had a job now, didn’t I think that was enough? I said I was proud of him. I was happy for him. But I wanted more for him, I didn’t want there to ever be a potential of D going back to being jobless and homeless. He deserves better then that. 

Fast forward a few months and D dumps me (the beginning of this month) because he “is never going to move” I am broken. But if you love me D you will come. But that makes you a hypocrite D said. But I told you I couldn’t move when we started dating. You said you would. You said you wanted to. D says he loves me. But he dumps me. there’s nothing I can do about it. He doesn’t care that I was crying. He didn’t care when I got angry. But that’s because he never cared in the first place. I can’t talk to you anymore D, it hurts me too much. Okay he says and messages me 2 days later. D wants to be friends. I can’t be friends with you I’m in love with you. Please leave me alone. We fight more this time we talk. He loves me he says. 

I know I’m not completely innocent. I know I put my worth in D. His fake form of love and attention would make me feel good about myself. I felt safe but I wasn’t. I did put up a fight towards the end of our relationship. I kept calling him out on the bullshit hoping he would address it and stop. I always believed in love. Love fixes everything. If you love each other you will treat each other right. Right?

I wanted to go back, I wanted to keep talking. I looked at a lot of his social media... he happens to be talking to many of the girls his “brother” cheated on me with. As if I needed more proof it was him and not his twin. Which tbh I really did. 

I’m trying to be okay. I’m trying to let go completely. Look at how he hurt me, why wouldn’t I just leave? why do I still care? why do I keep him on ignore but still check to see if he’s messaged me? why do I still log into his accounts to see what he’s doing? Why am I scared of him coming back and apologizing? Why do I want him to? Why do I know he’s bad logically but still want him? 

Oh and I know hes now messaged every single girl he swore to me he wasn’t interested in. every. single. one. 6 so far. 

I think part of me wants him to come back and tell me I’m worth it. worth more than all the shit he did to me. I want him to tell me I didn’t deserve it.

The laundry machines are in the kitchen..

Which is something I find absolutely revolting I want to move the machines into the 3rd bedroom.

My in-laws are saying doing that is gonna devalue the house because it would be losing a bedroom but I think that because we are

1) making the bathroom bigger and making seperate tub/shower

2) adding a laundry room

That we would be even-ing it out and losing the bedroom won't matter.

It would be a normal 2 bed 1 bath house with a laundry room which to me is impressive.

269,"6 months ago I did something terrible, I was shown the severity of the actions I did and since then I feel like I really have been growing up/maturing. I read a book which firstly is something I never do, it was about someone who had the same experience as me. I also read personal accounts, I spent hours thinking about what I did and I wrote all my thoughts down on a paper, a mixture of poetry, rants, messages, testimonies all combined into a 50-page book,  I made my actions public to my close circle, family and friends and ever since they've been nothing but support, and I thank them for that. I guess to an extent it helped me find my true self and really realize my mistakes, it helped me realize what I was and helped me to see what I want to be (as someone better than my past self) with that being said I did lose the trust of some of my friends and I don't blame them, something I did is truly monstrous. On occasions, I would still have sleepless nights where I remember what I did, I've had anxiety throughout my adult life and sometimes it would be so bad I'd just break down, I was never really a person to act out on my emotions, and that night that I did what I did just can't be forgiven, at least by myself that easily, and I'm sure others will feel the same. I've been slowly trying to fix myself back up and trying to mend broken things, I picked up art again, and much more strongly, I started reading and doing poetry more too. But a question still remains, should I see a therapist? I guess I'm still worried about talking to someone who isn't closely related, before what I did, I just bottled things up but this event really changed that.

Since I didn’t know many people I wasn’t too worried when I didn’t make any friends the first few days. However, as the days passed, I began to get more and more worried. Almost every one of the new students had found a friend group already and I was still sitting alone at lunchtimes. I tried to hang out with people but over and over they rejected me or didnt make me feel welcome.

My school is known to have problems with students being racist. Reviews I’ve found everywhere stated that most of the students threw around racial slurs and rejected or bullied others because of their race. I am fully Korean and the school is predominantly white. I didn’t actually think this was going to be a problem until I actually came. Racist comments are the norm and I hear them almost daily. During dance, we were asked to vote on a name for the routine. In the back, I heard one girl say ‘lets name it coronavirus for all those ching chongs out there.’ Many of the students that arent partially white have been floating around still while everyone else gets invited into ten different groups without hesitation. A lot of the groups ive tried to join only gave me dirty looks before leaving after saying they were going to the toilet.  

It’s been a month and I still have noone to hang out with. I don’t know whether im just overthinking this or is this an actual problem about my race or is it just me not being likeable? And does anyone have advice on how I could actually join these friend groups without feeling left out?

I don't dislike my first name, but I have a few reasons that I would maybe want to change it:

1. I feel as though I've changed a lot the past few years of my life and feel the need to reflect that. I like the idea of creating who I am
2. I illustrate and write on the side. I hope to be published one day, so I'd like to have two different names - one for every day and an alias. (The obvious solution is to publish under a pen name but I like my original name for this)
3. I think these names would suit me better

My anxieties regarding a name change:

1. Everyone in my life trying to get used to calling me a different name (friends, coworkers, teachers, etc) I don't like to create awkward situations
2. Most of my family would not approve
3. The tedious tasks of getting a new license, birth certificate, passport , etc

But still i WANT to get back to work, but every time i think about it my thoughts circle and i spin into a panic, i constantly have a tight feeling in my chest and im getting easily overwhelmed by emotion, which is very odd for me.   
Im the senior at work during the fist half of my shift, i have Juniors (13-15yo) who WOULD have had been there had she not left 30mins earlier that day.(15mins later it happened)  
 I can't help thinking about what could have happened if they were there, or even just if he was a little more aggressive.   


I'm heavily debating going to the doctors to see what they say, perhaps get a referral to see someone else who could assist me in moving past this minor thing. Nothing happened yet i can't help but freak out.   


Basically, Any advice from those who have been in similar situations or anyone with Experience in this field or my situation would be helpful.  
any professionals in Australia who are reading this wanna chip in or direct me in the right direction would be much appreciated.

281,22(F) Married. I have no emotions whatsoever but I get a thrill in my heart when I talk to people who say they like me it can last for days or even a couple minutes then I feel nothing again. I've been recently talking on a very popular app and I joined a room and the person who made the room took a likeing to me. I'd post pictures of myself to show off outfits and hed always comment. After that we talked more and more and I found out hed madly in love with me. Says stuff about marriage and cant live without me. Then stuff about kidnapping me and taking me away. He doesnt know I'm married and I believe if he did hed snap. I think about deleting my entire account and never saying a word to him again. But I get a thrill with him talking to me this way that I've never felt before plus he looks exactly like my husband it confuses me sometimes. I know I have mental health issues with hallucinating and other things I've not seen therapist for yet. But nothing makes me happy anymore besides him and my husband. I'm addicted to talking to him and hearing him go crazy for me. Idk what to do,24Feb2020,1
282,"So I’m a 15F and met a girl on social media. We were talking and she told me she was 14. That made me uncomfortable for a second because like... teen year age gaps are very different than older age gaps in terms of maturity and development. (Im not saying I’m super mature but just... i was very different a year ago).  Also, i have a late birthday so I’m a sophomore. She’s in 8th grade.  (a friend of mine was 14 when he was in 8th grade so I didn’t think much of it.) 

Despite my initial creep out i was starting to like her and started to put effort into getting her to like me back (i think she already did, we both were flirting but kept on asking if it was fake). I realized we were 5months apart and was just getting used to that.Then she told me she was actually 13, and is turning 14 in like three weeks. 

I’m really confused about this and I think it’s kinda creepy to get In a relationship with her. Like, there would be a point where I’m 18 and shes 16.  What do you think? Is it as creepy as I’m thinking? What boundaries should I set if it is? We talked in a more mature way that I’m not sure is appropriate anymore.",24Feb2020,1
283,"On mobile so forgive any typos.

I've recently been feeling like my therapist isn't a super good fit and that we've kind of plateaued in terms of progress. The last session I had with my therapist, she touched on something I'm admittedly defensive about, which left me feeling uncomfortable and it just felt like to me, the session kind of ended on a bad note. Because of that, I've been thinking about the last couple of months in therapy and how there's been a few things that I don't like about working with her; namely I don't feel like her type of therapy (EMDR) has been effective for me, and there's just been a few times where I strongly disagreed with a specific observation or assessment of me.

Here's the hard part: I have a lot of anxiety and a codependent personality. The anxiety is telling me she's gonna think I wanna see someone else because of that one comment in the last session and that I'm overreacting. The codependent part of me is telling me that I need to just stick it out and that I can't say no because I don't know what's best for me.

Currently I'm planning on going to one more session and then trying to find a way to stop seeing her. how should I do this? I'm a little afraid to bring it up in session because I worry the people pleasing part of me will fold and be pulled back in to avoid conflict (something I have a history of doing with psychiatrists and in personal relationships). Should I send an email? What should I say?",24Feb2020,1

I met a girl recently, lets call her Eve. Eve is a very lovely, gorgeous girl and, naturally, her and I hit it off. We've been messaging back and forth for a while now over social media, and she's been rather hesistant to have me come over to her house.

As I recently found out, a few things happened recently and she became friends with her narcissistic  ex-partner, who has moved in, with her, at her mother house. She has reassured me that they are not dating. He is aggressive, nasty, and I have good reason to believe he may have actually raped her. 

I feel terrible for the whole situation but it also throws me into a huge doubt. If I start dating Eve, there is a chance that the N-ex will still exist in Eves life and make more trouble than the relationship is worth.

I really do like her but I don't want to be involved in this sort of trouble. Eve says she is sorting it out but I still see him being a problem.

Not once did she ask how the trip was, was it fun or what did we do? She only does that with my brother and tells him, go rest you're tired. 

For me, she HAS to start complaining about something, pretty much not even caring about me. Even when she comes home from work, immediately she'll tell me to go do something. No hi, no how are you?

So my best friend who I'll call Ashley and me have been friends for about 3 years. we got really close after around year one because I was there for her through a really hard time in her life and this carried on for 2 more years. she was like a sister to me who I could turn to with all my problems and same to her with me. we never had any fights and we were ( in my mind ) great friends who would be there for each other no matter what. come freshman year where she moves schools around half way through the semester. I was bummed sure, but I knew that it would be better for her. so one night, about 2 weeks after she moved schools we were texting and she didn't seem very energetic and I asked her whats up, she said ""nothing I'm just tired""  which I said was ok and she could go to bed. she says ok thanks and I text her saying "" I love you goodnight sleep well"" ( we've said we have loved each other before so it was not out of the blue) and she doesn't respond which is unusual but I chalk it up to her falling asleep. so I wake up and find out she's blocked my number, blocked all my social medias and her friends have blocked me too. I was so confused because I thought we were best friends and she was like a sister to me. she's the person I've known the longest so far and I thought we would be friends for a long time. its been about 2 weeks and still nothing. I'm not mad I'm just really sad that I lost one of my closest friends and I don't even have a reason, and not only that, I never got to say goodbye which hurts me even more. I just miss her ya know.anyway I digress. I don't want any advice on how to get revenge or how to get her back because to be honest, if her doing this makes her either happier or better mentally, than ill accept it and go on with my life because all I want is for her to be happy.

They have a ""floating profile""?


Do my clinical scales really indicate a personality disorder? It's something I've worried about in the back of my mind for a long time, but I don't really fit criteria for one based on my research. I do want to note I've been incredibly stressed and have been struggling with my mental health for months, which may have affected the results.

305,"So, two years ago my brother (16M) started to do poorly in school. His grades went down and my parents weren't happy at all. The first fights between them began since then and up until now they've been fighting once or twice a week. The thing is my brother is extremely sensitive but also very manipulative and a moderate liar. He will try to talk himself out of everything, making excuses over every little detail just to come out on top. Since my parents try to maintain the peace most of the time my brother always has it his way. But, now since about 6 months ago everything began to crumble. Fights have been more and more exhausting for everyone in the house. My mother and father struggle with him a lot and up until a few weeks ago they kind of relied on me to talk to my brother and sort things out. Of course that failed since I'm not exactly an emotional juggernaut with no problems of my own and it just overwhelmed me. I had to step out of it even if I hear them yelling.

My parents really do care a lot for us and it saddens me how much they have to go through just to come home and fight with my brother over grades or cellphone usage. However, they can also be VERY irrational, getting sentimental over little things, getting really anxious, getting mad for not believing in their religion, etc. 

All three of them struggle with anxiety issues which can lead to disastrous situations.

Fights usually end up in my brother thinking my parents don't care about him and my parents thinking he is ungrateful. My brother has been going to therapy to help him understand more about his situation but I don't see it working even if he has been going for quite some time. I root for everyone and want for them to be happy without having any more big fights but it just doesn't seem to stop. 

I'm 20, extremely tired of hearing them fight and just on the edge of giving up on them. This is basically my Hail Mary on my last attempt before just ignoring it completely and hoping for the day it goes away on its own. I don't hate my family, I love them, but I struggle a lot keeping up with all their fighting. Is the correct answer to just stay out of it and ignore the whole situation?",24Feb2020,1
306,"Hi ya’ll
So I (24, f) work in a retirement home sometimes with the PSA agency I work for (American equivalent is a CNA).
Now it’s been cool, I love it at the retirement home and often pick up double shifts there and enjoy the staff. I didn’t realize a guy(29/30ish) I briefly saw for a month (non serious obvs, approx 4yrs ago) worked as a Nurse there until it was too late. I wasn’t going to say a word to anyone but he recognized me after he introduced himself and the cat came out of the bag (he told another coworker who was in the office with us). 

Things have been relatively fine until I worked tonight and found out he had said some particularly scummy things.
He said that, “I met her on tinder, took her to a date and left her at the restaurant cause she was so unattractive”. Actually what happened was we hung out at his place and continued to do so for a month before he said he “needs to get married and have kids in the next 3 years”. To which we both agreed I wasn’t ready for. It’s been 3-4yrs and no he’s not married or had kids.
And he went on to say, “she looks good now, I’d date her” to which another staff member responded “she’d be an idiot after what you told me”. 

I don’t care to do this at my place of work. I’m serious about my job and I’d like to do my facility placement at this place. I’ve never been anything but kind and hard working. I’m baffled he said anything like this. For someone who is now 29/30ish it’s absolutely bizarre. I think he was trying to make himself look good in front of the mostly female staff (which has now backfired and made him look scummy). 

How do I deal with this? I haven’t had contact with him in years other than at work (last 3weeks or so), and I’m thinking it’s best not to even confront him??

I start playing video games with the girl and the whole time she just feels uninterested. Usually she’s bubbly and nice, this time it was short answers and not much talking from her. I asked if anything was wrong and she wouldn’t talk about it. Her friend joined us and then they talked and ignored me. Whatever, maybe she just isn’t in the mood for me today, hopefully it’s a one time thing

Then, I get off and get outside and wait for my friend and she picks me up, we’re excited to hang out. One of our other friends calls and says she can’t make it. Bummer, but it’s alright I guess. 

We pick up another friend and go back to the first friends house.

310,"So I know there’s some potential for me to come of as an asshole for what I’m about to say, but I feel that I have good reasons for feeling the way I do, which I’ll explain, so just bear with me. 

I like talking about very nerdy sorts of things . Math, physics, and philosophy are my go to’s. I’d like to have friends who really enjoy having in depth discussions about these things and who are as engaged as I am talking about them. Finding people like this that I can get along with has proven very difficult. Its not because there aren’t people who really dig this stuff as much as I do, it’s more that, when I come across people like that, they generally......weird me out. They typically act quite awkward and something about them makes me cringe a bit, the way they talk, just their general vibe. 

Callback to earlier when I said I’d sound like a dick. Thing is, I totally get why they act that way. I also have aspergers, something I was diagnosed with as a kid, very mild form of it. I’ve managed to work my way into not manifesting that way anymore. I don’t act noticeably awkward or “ autistic” for lack of a better word, anymore. Trust me on this, at least for the sake of argument. I think part of why these people make me so uncomfortable is that I’ve trained myself in overcoming my own behavioral quirks, to be hypersensitive to people acting strange or not “ normal”, this also extends to people who just act nerdy, if not actually on the spectrum.  It just sets of alarms in my head and I can’t deal with it. I recognize there’s nothing wrong with being that way, being a quirky person , but my circumstances just preconditioned me  to respond with feelings of discomfort in response to that kind of  behavior. 


So this is the dilemma. I’m always stuck between 2 far from ideal options. Friends  who don’t make me cringe because of how they act, but also don’t care about the things I care about, nearly to the extent I’d like. It’s hard to build a good relationship with a person when what they wanna talk about bores you and what you wanna talk about bores them. Or option 2, people who do care about that stuff like I do, but make me uncomfortable with their behavior. What’s the move here? How do I resolve this dilemma?",24Feb2020,1

I was given the advice from my parents to write a list of the things that make me happy and try to find something that aligns with that. But, I don't have a single thing to put on that list, I don't have anything that makes me happy. I have one hobby and that's digital art, it doesn't make me happy it's just the one thing I've come across so far that I'm not terrible at. I have fleeting moments of interest in things, nothing lasts long though. I never had a dream job or solid goal growing up either.

Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile.

I suppose I better jump right into it, I had a phone call about 3 weeks ago that basically told me  I had been made redundant starting from the 7th of Feb, there was zero consultation period I was made aware of which was shitty in its self, the bigger problem is they haven’t paid me for January still and I have no idea what to do any attempt to contact them about it is being completely ignored. I’ve tried phoning them 1/9 times a day just to see why I haven’t been paid yet but they always put the phone down on me soon as they know it’s me calling, all emails are getting ignored, the HR department doesn’t want to know anything about it because they say it’s a accounting problem. 

I’ve had to hold off paying rent this month and I just don’t know what to do about it anymore, I’ve tried fixing it everyday since I realised I haven’t been paid yet and still nothing is being solved, I have no idea what to do anymore. 

Any advice would be really appreciated",24Feb2020,1
316,"I don't know why, but whenever I witness something or experience something by myself I find myself wishing there was somebody else with me who I could share the experience with.

I'm 22 and have few friends. When I was in the city going to college I had a group of friends I was with all the time, but now I find myself alone. I do hang out with some friends here and there but most of the time I'm by myself. I feel like something is missing, whether it's belonging to a group or having a significant other.

Does anyone else relate?",24Feb2020,1
317,"Does this sound like a bad friend?

I have a friend that I have a lot in common with and when it’s just us we laugh a lot and have fun but as soon as we’re with 2 of our other friends he has complete ‘mood swings’ (I guess that’s the word, more of who he likes at the time). So here’s an example of a school day: we get to school, he talks to me before school and we mess around or whatever, first couple lessons he’s talking to me and sitting with me all good, next couple lessons I will go to sit at his table and he’ll say some bullshit like ‘oh no don’t sit here the tables full you’ll get told off’ and the only people at his table are the 2 other friends. Then he will start not talking to me and shutting me down every time I speak, sometimes when I go to speak to the other friends he will get aggressive. Then he’ll start something secretly like everyone ignoring me, moving my shit or staying away from me ‘as a joke’, 3rd grader shit (they never do it to anyone but me). It’s like he just tries to make it so I can’t be friends with the others and only he can. Then after lunch he will start off rough and then we’re fine again. 

Here are some other things that happens that makes me question him as a friend:

- Constantly dissing and gossiping about the other friends and saying they’re ‘sucking each other’s dick’ whenever they talk to each other and not him (he completely does this to one of them by laughing at EVERYTHING one of them does and they will always be getting in each other face like a fucking couple just trying to get attention). Although shortly after he will suddenly be fine with them and act like he didn’t say anything about them. This makes me think they do the same about me.

- When him and the other friends have a big argument or fight he will shit talk them so much to me about how bad they are and I will get 50+ messages in great detail about everything they’ve done wrong and that he hates them now and won’t talk to them, but then WHAM next day at school it’s like nothing ever happened and he never dissed tf out of them

- He constantly asks me for help and favours and I go out of my way to help him and make him happy. This is things from as little as helping him with school work and logging in on his Xbox account to do something for him while he can’t get on to buying him food, games and game sharing (he gets every game I buy for free) him on Xbox. He is only slightly thankful after and he doesn’t return the favour and if I insist he does he just goes ‘fineeee if you’re just gonna keep whining about it’.

- We have good times as well and I make him laugh a lot but as soon as it’s with the other friends he changes and I always leave school feeling like shit or sometimes happy depending on which ‘mood’ he’s in

- I also hold my tongue and feel like I can’t criticise him or call him out for being hypocritical (which he always is) by fearing he’ll get mad at me

TL;DR: I have a friend that can be a real dick but I don’t want to cut him off because the good times we have I really enjoy and I would lose my other friends because he’s friends with them. I’m also not really prepared to cut him off

320,"About six years ago, I worked at a pretty toxic company where everyone would jump at the chance to throw one another under the bus. Due to this, I only stayed there for a year. 

I worked with a small team of 3 people, including myself. The two ladies I worked with were particularly fickle and conniving, but we were on good terms when I left (or so I thought).

I keep the company on my CV because, despite the environment, it was suitable for my experience, and I was part of some impressive campaigns. 

Now I've sent in a university application but, for some reason, they want a recommendation from this company. I reached out to the two ladies I worked with, but to no avail. They firstly don't want anyone to know that they worked at this particular company, and secondly, they don't want to do me any favours. There's nobody else at the company who could assist me.

How do I get around this? If I'm honest with the university, it might look like my fault and that I was a shitty employee.",24Feb2020,1
321,"I had a major falling out with a co-worker who I really respected that ending up completely ending our relationship. We went from being good friends to completely avoiding each other whenever we see each other. This was good to me. The reason behind the falling out was both our faults and I was cool with it ending since I wasn't having to deal with the issues that started it anymore. Recently I've accepted a higher paying job and have handed in my two weeks notice. As I'm feeling sentimental about leaving I think of the 2+ years of good time with him and been thinking about messaging them to gauge their reaction/check if they've blocked me. For infos sake, it's been about 4/5 months since my last contact with them over text, and a good year since I've talked to them in person. The text contact was after I butt dialed them and they got mad that I called them, since they were very stressed at that moment and didn't want me bugging them. I realize that I should just message them and be honest, but I'm worried about them spreading rumors about me to my soon to be ex co-workers as it's a place I'll still frequent and has people I really like and respect, including a few friends. I'm also trying to keep my leave a secret from others, so am scared they'll tell everyone if I'm honest that I'm leaving, especially as one of my bosses don't know yet, and it's going to be a huge shock that will make my next few weeks difficult.

He also claims That my anxiety is just me being “nervous” as well and I’m making excuses for myself which isn’t the case.

339,"so my boyfriend(m22) and I(f19) have been dating for 7 and a half months. I have never been happier with anyone, he is the greatest thing that has happened to me. :) we had sex very early on into our relationship and honestly, i don’t regret it. my boyfriend was raised with a pretty laidback mom who was open with him regarding sex at an early age.  However, my mom was raised as a Jehovah witness and still has the mindset but isn’t an active member in the religion. My dad is a pretty strict guy and has told my boyfriend before that my dad can control me and that can make me do whatever he wants. This is also important to mention but we aren’t yet where we want to be financially. i’m in school and have a side business but i’m not making as much as i’d like to. i’m studying for my drivers license which is the only thing holding me back from getting a job in the field i’m studying which pays a pretty fat check. i am financially dependent on my parents right now. my boyfriend on the other hand has a job he hates but pays well and keeps promoting him. we both have goals and are ambitious to achieve them.
so anyways, my mom has always told me that if i’m honest with her about things, she won’t get upset about them. She already had an idea of what was going on and told me that she lost her virginity to someone who wasn’t my dad and had alot of premarital sex with my dad. My dad also grew up in cuba where teens had sex to pass the time because there wasn’t much for them to do but my dad was supposedly one of the “nicer guys” 

I felt like it was an appropriate time to tell my mom because of what she told me about her having premarital sex, and because i could tell she already had an idea of what was going on. I felt like It wouldn’t be a gigantic issue because my parents did similar things when they were younger, im on birth control, my boyfriend isn’t just dating me to fuck me and leave, we had also both been tested before having sex and we were clean. what else could they be worried about? it seemed like every parental concern was being addressed and i was tired of having to sneak around and lie to them. 
I told my mom first because i usually get an easier reaction from her. I told her that my boyfriend and i had been having sex for a while now and that we were being safe by using birth control. I told her that i didn’t want to go into details about things but she kept trying to get things out of me. she kept asking how far along we had gone and i only told her that i was on birth control for a reason. she asked me where and when we did things and i told her that i would sneak out to his house late at night or that i’d sneak him into our house. I feel like the sex stuff wasn’t as traumatic for her but she really upset at the fact that i was sneaking in my boyfriend late at night. (she has told me that she isn’t able to sleep at night anymore because she keeps an ear out trying to hear me sneak my boyfriend in.) she thinks it’s disrespectful that we have fucked in her house. she’s also upset with my bf and i for lying to their faces. she asked why couldn’t i have come to her and let her know that we wanted something serious with my boyfriend before anything happened. she told me that she can’t stand that he hung our with my family acting like we had “something pure” when in reality he was “fucking our daughter in my house”  she also doesn’t like the idea because i could potentially become a burden on them if i do end up becoming pregnant, but again i’m on birth control:/ but honestly what was she expecting? where else were we supposed to have sex? my parents freaked out when they found a hickey (4 months into our relationship) and told me that we were “moving too fast” and my dad even threatened to end our relationship.(over a fucking hickey!!!) how would i have been able to come to my mom and tell her that i was planning on having sex with someone she hadn’t even met yet? she told me that my boyfriend and i need to tell my dad and that i shouldn’t tell him about us having sex in their house because if he found out he would end our relationship. 
i’m really not sure what to do right now. my mom is mad with me and avoids talking to me, she’s been shaming me for having sex. i want to tell my dad but my mom and dad are mad at eachother and he’s been really stressed out lately. this will only add to the fire. 
my boyfriend has talked it over with his mom and they both think that my mom wants us to put on a show for her. she wants to watch my dad argue with my boyfriend and i. so my boyfriend thinks it would be best to talk to my dad while he is alone. no one present besides them two, he thinks my dad will react differently if it’s just them two. i do not think this is a good idea because my dad is a violent person and i wouldn’t want a fight to break out between the both of them, also because my dad might come for me telling me that i didn’t have the balls to tell him myself. 
part of me wants to talk to my dad 1 on 1 but i feel like this would more likely result in him ending our relationship and thinking my boyfriend is a coward because he isn’t present. 
another part of me wants to put it off and to my dad untill i get that career job and become a much more independent from my parents. but if i do that, my mom is going to be on my ass about telling my dad and i won’t be able to see him until then. 
my boyfriend is planning on visiting my dad tomorrow and talking to him about it. do you guys think this is a good idea? what should i do?  i would hate for my parents to end our relationship over something so common and natural. i appreciate any feedback :/ 

i apologize for the long rant but i just needed to get it out.",24Feb2020,1

Yesterday,after a misunderstanding when she thought I cracked a dirty joke on her Whatsapp status,she told me how judgemental and disgusting ive become and she didnt want to get down to my level.Some instances she brought forth yesterday:

-So,she had been skyping this friend of hers(M) and sent me a screenshot in which there was bad lighting in his.I told her it was extremely bad lighting and asked what he was doing.Was he....and I sent a laughing emoji followed by Jk jk and she said-if he was,i wouldnt have sent you a screenshot.She didnt tell me she was uncomfortable with the joke

-She said in another instance when she was talking to the  Same friend that he seems to grow on her better now(initially she had found him boring).I asked her if she was rubbing off on him.As soon as I sent the message,I kinda got the hidden innuendo and it seemed funny to me,so I said pun not intended.It is cringey,I agree, but funnt at that time.She didnt reply and I thought she got busy.

-Another time,she had sent a pic of her with a baby resting on her lap with its hand resting on her chest.after congratulating her on her pregnancy(joking ofcourse) I said that 'the baby is touching your boob! XD) She replied sayin it was resting its hand thats all.I then said i was jk.

All this happened months apart and today,when I commented something innocuous,not even an innunendo( she had posted something like she was gonna fall off the face of the earth and I teased her saying was she flat earthing it.There is no known innuendo in this as far as I know.She blasted on me saying how disgusting and flithy minded I had become over the years and am not the same innocent girl she knew in school.Also,I was very judgemental( I dont recall being at all).Also,that i was stubborn and dont accept criticism.I dont think im that way.I am stubborn but I do accept criticism.I dont know where she got that from coz she has never criticized me before.Seriously.Also she said she had talked to two of her friends about me and they had asked her why she was friends with me still.She said she hoped I would become a better person one day but she wont stay by my side.

We had a falling out 3 years back coz I didnt keep in contact much after joining med school.I had pleaded and apologized,and then kept in touch.She had built that up too,and had blasted on me after 1 years.She chose to wait to tell me after 1.5 years.

341,"Hi guys, I have a pretty unique problem, and I would appreciate some help figuring it out.

Here it is:

I’m a senior who is going to be leaving my school soon. About a month and a half ago, I met this sophomore teammate who got moved up to varsity, and it was one of those things where I felt an immediate connection between us.

As in, (for lack of better phrasing) I fell in love with him. Not romantic love, but the kind of love where I can’t imagine a world where I don’t get to hang out with him and laugh with him every day. 

Recently, as the season is coming to an end, I’ve been getting very sad that I may never see him again after I leave for college. I almost want to call him my best friend, problem is, we have only known each other for 2 months and, as a consequence of the age gap between us, there is some sort of inherent barrier blocking me from really getting to know him like I know my senior friends.

So my main problem is this: I want him to know for sure that he has made an impact on my life, but I don’t know how to do that. I was thinking of sending him a dm detailing my feelings, simply because it’s so much to get off my chest that I would miss something just telling him in person.

But now I’m thinking that would be kind of weird. I mean, getting a fairly long, emotional text from a varsity senior could be pretty out of the blue.

Should I just do it since it could be my only chance to tell him? And also, how do I cope with this feeling of profound sadness? I never really feel sad but the prospect of leaving my friend behind has put me to tears recently. 

Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated:)



ps: I’ve delved into super philosophical thoughts over this dilemma. As in, thoughts like, could this possibly be the only life I get to live? If it is, how can it be that I might not have my friend more involved with my life? Will I die having forgotten the feelings I felt because of my friend? Will I some day, 20 years from now, suddenly get super sad over his memory? If I look at the moon at night in 20 years, will I be seeing the same thing he’s seeing?",24Feb2020,1
342,"I was offered a full-time job at a new nail salon that opened only a month ago. The owner who I will be apprenticing under is young, fun, and is is extremely talented and artistic! I am so honored to be working under her and learning from the best (she has clients who do full sets that cost anywhere from $200-$700!). Both her and her husband are very sweet and genuinely are trying to mentor and teach their employees everything in order to succeed, which I appreciate.

I know a lot of apprenticeships are mostly about education and where two people can benefit from one other, and SOME apprenticeships out there are not even paid at all (piercers, tattoo artists). However, the pay structure I was offered is a little concerning and confusing? Minimum wage in MA is $12.75 as of 2020. I was offered either 2 weeks of training with NO PAY or a month of training getting $5/hr CASH and once I'm done with that month, it would be $10/hr CASH (I had told them I was being paid $14/hr before tax at my previous jobs so they tried to figure out the equivalence in cash). Tips would be all mine. Commission would be 50/50 once I am capable of doing all the services and learning everything perfectly, which I am totally fine with, and then at this point I could fill out a W2 with them. They said I could work 5-6 days a week. If I worked 6 days, I would be pulling around 55 hours (not including breaks - not sure if nail salons even include that). I don't know if I would be compensated for overtime so that would be something I need to discuss further with them. Does any of this make sense?

I'm not the smartest when it comes to taxes or paperwork like that as my parents have always taken care of it for me. Every job I've had before used a w2. However, one nail salon did tell me they used a 1099 and after doing some research, I guess this is fairly common in the nail industry. I'm not against being paid cash but I also don't want to be doing anything illegal? How does this work?",24Feb2020,1
343,"Hi Reddit, 
My grandmother has had the same carer for a few years now, and my family are almost sure that she's stealing from them, however we cannot prove it. We don't want to cause further stress and worries for my grandmother by confronting this carer without proof. We also can't just fire her as it's very difficult to find carers in the country she's in.  
While I was visiting there in December, a few things went missing, including small amounts of money, medication and gifts (food from Australia) that clearly wouldn't have been taken by other immediate family members living in the same household, as everyone received their own share. 
Just yesterday my cousin (who lives with my grandmother) messages me to tell me $50 worth of fish has gone missing. Might not seem like a lot, but where my family are from they're not wealthy and have to work hard for the most basic needs. My grandmother had specifically requested this fish for a meal she's been wanting and now it's gone only a day or two after purchasing. 
This carer has full access to her house while my grandmother takes her nap in the afternoon. We want to catch this woman in the act but the resources are limited on the island. 
Family have asked me to look into buying a hidden camera that we can install in plain sight to catch her in the act. We're totally fed up of my grandma being fucked over during her most vulnerable time. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? 
I'm located in Australia, and will be sending the camera off with a friend in March. 

We need a camera that can be accessed by phone

344,"Kind of a stupid question /issue. 

For various reasons I prefer not to poop at my job or in a public place.

If I don't poop in the morning my stomach makes those wierd noises that sounds like intra belly farts. 

It takes so much time for my body to be ready to poop in the morning.
I don't want to force it because it's bad for health. 

Any advice on how to make it easier and faster? 
Thanks in advance.",24Feb2020,1

346,"Hi there, I graduated at the end of last year from a local well-known trade college for IT System Administration, and I can't find a job to save my life. I've been applying for over a year now, and more seriously for several months and I haven't even landed so much as an interview. Frankly I'm beginning to think I'm just cursed.

I live in Alberta, Canada and it's no secret our economy sucks absolute ass, we're if I recall now the 2nd highest employment rate at a little over 8% in the nation. I currently work a part-time, slightly above minimum wage job, it's enough to get by.

I can not move, all my family and my long-term girlfriend live here, even if I wanted to I live paycheck to paycheck at the moment, and can't afford a car (the insurance payments would crush me) so I take transit. I want to get started in my career to improve my quality of life.

As such i can't just go get a temp internship either, as I can't guarantee I wouldn't be homeless at the end of the job and my family doesn't live in this city to help me.

I have been primarily applying for Tier-1 Helpdesk and Customer Support positions. For reference.

I've made these posts a few times now so I've come ready:

**Okay, so before i'm hit with the inevitable ""meme advice"":**
-

1.  ""Re-do your resume. / Your resume sucks.""

1. ""Your resume is too long / too short / too wordy / not wordy enough.""

1. ""Do you submit cover letters?""

1. ""Do you have references?""

1. ""Your attitude sucks.""

1. ""Do you have enough work experience?""

1. ""Do you have a LinkedIn and/or portfolio?""

1. ""Do you network?""

1. ""Have you asked why you're being rejected?""

-------
1. I have had my resume reviewed by well over a dozen people including my college professors, friends in HR, anonymous people in HR (lots of folks over at /r/resume), fellow students who have landed jobs, and nothing glaring has come up.

1. I have tried 8 versions of my current resume, currently it is two pages, the first page detailing the technologies I know from college, my recent work experience, my education and my extracurricular activities. The second goes over my relevant projects.

     I have tried 1-page resumes, I have tried two page resumes, I have tried probably just about every single variation one could think of. It hasn't made a difference.

     Currently I have two pages simple because I can not fit everything on one page, even with a nice crafty bit of formatting it is simply impossible. It is worth noting I do have considerably more work experience than your average college grad (I'm 23, been working since 14 years old). But regardless limiting it to one page (usually just linking to my portfolio for project details, or getting a bit more verbose and having it at two pages, doesn't make a difference.

1. Yes, for the most part I use a template greeting paragraph and brief conclusion blurb mostly just stating my contact info again, the rest of the cover letter is all tailored specifically to each listing. I consider myself an excellent writer, and thoroughly proofread my CLs with an almost mad paranoia (I've been burned before).

1. I have references from all my college professors (2 of which are my go to, I still ask them for help every now and then.), all of my bosses from the past 5 years, and I even have letters of reference from two of them I often send with my applications.

1. This is the one I hate the most, the hiring manager is not omnipotent, they can not sense my tone across the digital expanse, I'm not going into phone/in-person interviews acting like a child. I just let my frustrations loose a bit on the internet, and I feel justifiably frustrated because I'm doing everything I can possibly do and not seeing any results.

1. Tons of work experience, I've been working customer service jobs since I was 14. I've even had an office internship working as a communications assistant. Granted one thing that probably isn't working in my favor is that due to a rough local economy, most of my jobs in the past 5 years have been temp jobs of only a few months or two before being laid off. But I've held my current job for almost half a year now.

1. Yep, both fully updated, I even make a point to connect with company hiring managers when I can on LinkedIn. I actually see a lot of praise for my portfolio site.

1. I don't have a large contact group, mainly because IT in my area doesn't really network much, but I go to every open house I can, I'm actually going to one next week. Several of my friends are also in industry.

1. Yes, the only reason I've gotten is ""You don't have enough experience and we had too many applicants."" Which I can do exactly nothing about.

-------------

With that out of the way, can anybody give me any advice? Because frankly it's starting to seem impossible. I have an open house I'm attending next week for an employer who is known to hire from my college and frankly with all of the above in place, if I still don't get an interview, I may just have to give up for the time being because at that point, it's just playing the lottery.

347,"Hello, I’ve had state medical care for a majority of my life because my parents are unable to afford regular private insurance. Last year I was diagnosed as having a benign tumor in my chest. Unfortunately, around the time I was diagnosed, the state health insurance decided to kick me off as I was over 19 and my parents made “too much money” even though they can barely afford their bills. Since I still technically live with them, I am unable to qualify for my own insurance as my household makes too much money. I can’t afford to move out as I make under $10,000 a year and my parents are unable to afford the $250 a month health insurance for me. I really need surgery to get rid of the tumor but it would be impossible without medical insurance. Would there be a way to qualify for medical insurance even though I live with my parents? I pay for everything myself, including for my own college tuition so would my low income make a difference? Also I’ve already tried to see if my college offers health insurance and they do not. I live in NJ if that makes a difference. 

Note: even though I technically live with my parents I spend a majority of my time at my boyfriends house. I am there more often than I am at my own house. But, his household makes more than mine so I don’t think if I put on an application that I lived there, I would qualify.",24Feb2020,1

350,"Growing up, my older brother was kinda a bully. I was always pretty asocial, but especially with people our age who we’d both be around. Like the family friends who came over for holidays, cousins, etc. I never knew why I was so bad socially around these people until I put thought into it. Few years ago, my cousin passed. It was really hard to move past, especially since I hadn’t talked to her in so long for the above reasons. After that I tried to keep in touch better with my other cousin (her sister) and failed to. I haven’t talked to her since like, not long after the funeral.

When I realize it I just think like, did I learn nothing?? But, the one who passed was my age and the other is my brothers so I was closer w the one who passed. (When we were all younger and actually were around each other a lot).

Afterthought: I was thinking of how to form the question of how to reconnect with her, and then I thought for a second, why do I want to? Think some part of me feels like being closer with my living cousin will somehow make up for having not spoken to my cousin for a while before she died. Idk. I guess I still haven’t forgiven myself.",24Feb2020,1

353,"I am 30f, married for 10 years now with the most wonderful man in the world. The problem is the quality of our lives is ruined by my parents to a point which I think can't be solved anymore. My mom was always this narcissistic and selfish person who had a really really bad money management. She always tried to start all sorts of businesses that ended up badly because she didn't pay her employees, the distributors, the rent, sometimes gas or electricity. Often we had that at home as I grew up, no gas or electricity coz she absolutely despised paying bills. This woman was always in debt with anything and I remembered growing up seeing lots of people seeking her because she owed them money. She even convinced some folks to mortgage their homes so she can get some bank loans and those folks ended up paying themselves the monthly share to the bank because mom ghosted them. She even convinced some guy that worked at a car factory to give her a car and the man ended up paying the monthly installments from his own paycheck. Basically almost everything we had in our house was taken like that, with a promise of a later payment and those guys/stores never saw any money or heard of her. She did this to strangers, she did this to almost all family. She owed money to everyone including family and her only solution, always, was to ghost those folks. Even family members were convinced to mortgage their homes for her to get bank loans and also, like others, ended up paying themselves monthly so they don't lose their homes. And she always wanted to be a business owner, never liked to work as a regular employee anywhere. My childhood sucked, I had to lie for her all the time ""no, mom is not home, she's away"". She even loaned money from loan sharks, really dangerous folks, and she ghosted them also and threatened them with police if they don't leave her alone and forget about her debt. I mean, she so idiotically endangered the whole family with her shit and her shenanigans. My dad stood by her side but was so unhappy and quickly became a severe case of an alcoholic. She was, and is, also a really fat woman who is so lazy even her personal hygiene is that bad she is filled with pimples and blackheads all over her face and body and always smelled like pee because she waited until the last second to go to the bathroom that she peed herself a bit. And had all sorts of vaginal yeats and infections that smelled from a mile away because of bad hygene. Awful stuff, like I've said, dad was always drinking day in and day out. He was just a coward he was often beating me when he was drunk, out of the blue, or because he thought I said something, you know how drunk evil people are. I was always so ashamed, always dressed in the same clothes for days, neighbors were looking at me and I could had heard them wispering between them ""poor girl"". They knew we lived in a house that randomly had no gas, or no electricity. We had 3 dogs that my folks never fed, thinking back makes me so sad and angry. Those poor dogs looked so skinny you could had seen just skin and ribs....

When I turned 15 it was the most awful, as a young lady you become more self aware, more vanitous, you want to be noticed by boys and want to look nice just because it's normal and it's how it should be. I was always dressed from thrift stores and had really shitty shoes that smelled bad. I was so ashamed I wanted to die. She was scolding me my feet smelled bad because of the shoes she provided. I took so many baths with cold water, my hygene was never bad. She was scolding me all the time and comparing me to other, more successful children. At that time I wasn't wise enough to tell her other children don't go to bed on the dark, in cold. Personal computers became a thing and she didn't even provided me with tv cable coz she was seldomly paying it. I was so ashamed to go to school for so many reasons, and the fact that I didn't had a penny in my pocket was the least of it....
But during that same time, when I was 15-16 she sold the house we were living in, house provided by my grandparents when she got married to dad (otherwise they would had or have a square foot of anything on their name) . She rented an apartment and with the money god knows how she quickly lost on one of her businesses. The owner of the apartment was always angry about us not paying bills, not paying rent, ruining the apartment. My mom never cleaned and we were, because of them producing dirt and mess but never cleaning, the kind of family that gathered a lot of cockroaches. Anyways, the guy kicked us out, said like forget of the rent money you owe me, just get the fuck out of my house before you break everything like the faucets. They also, both mom and dad, treat objects like animals. Slam doors, push things too hard. I've always wondered why they never treated objects more gentle and with care and I think it's because they never really worked for what they had, it was mostly items obtained out of scams my mom pulled.
We've moved into a new apartment and the owner there was more gullible to mom's bullshit. Was about when I started high school (i lost 1 year because I got dropped disciplinary for skipping classes because I had to pay some money to school, some school maintenance fee and my mom kept on keeping me home and told me to lie I got the flu and all sorts of bullshits and also because a class mate's mom was working at a bank and my mom convinced that woman to trust her with a large loan and that lady ended up paying for her own self so she doesnt lose her job. and the kid was nagging me ""please tell your mom to pay back my mom""...)
Now, in high school things went ok, I was paying attention at classes, grades were ok and also my mom was ""really interested"" in my grades. Basically she was bullying me 24/7 with words like I'm gonna wind up a poor loser, no man will want me, I'm fat (which is so dumb for a parent to say as long as they are accountable for a kid's meals and health lol), no man will ever want me, i'm gonna wind up a lonely slut. Jesus, so much vile and crazy shit she was saying. And I was just a poor fat nerdy girl who never did anything wrong, I didn't understand where all that shit came from and why. I started to like metal music and she was so unhappy, saying I look like shit with all that black clothes, and other girls are so elegant, but i look like a fat sack of potatoes. Jesus, so many evil things, she seemed happy when she was doing her best to make me sad as hell. What a thing for a mom to do, so odd. She was calling teachers to ask about how I'm doing and teachers were telling me during classes, in front of everyone else to tell my mom to stop bothering them on the phone. So much cringe, oh lord... And I was doing great, I mean when she found out I had 5 missed classes (others had literally hundreds and it wasn't such a big deal really), she took this huge metal lock and hit me in the side of my head until I fainted. She freaked out and they rushed me to the hospital to get a brain scan and she was instructing me in the car to lie to the medics that I fell. I was so scared and sad, crying so bad I barely sat still in the MRI. I'm crying right now as I write this because remembering makes me so angry...
My dad was a shitty ass idle alcoholic, was always like whatever, going along with whatever shit mom pulled. Was always the loser kind, never liked school, barely finished high school, as long as he had money for alcohol things were perfect. My grandparents were concerned, were trying to help us by giving us food, paying for bills when they could, giving me some money to buy myself ""something nice"", you know how grandparents are. The money were always taken by my mom by default. They also, my grandparents got me some gold jewlery, some little items, during time. That my mom almost the next day took and pawned and instructed me to lie if my grandparents, from both sides, ask about why am I not wearing what they gifted me. She always pawned stuff and in 100% she lost the things because she never liked to pay for things. Even if it were her own things. Their, mom and dads, wedding rings were gone to hallelujah since ages. 
Anyways, at 18 I've met my husband and it was love at first sight. He was a bit older than me and was already working as a computer engineer, had his own place. Was such a nice feeling to get inside a house that didn't smell like mold and piss and dirty dishes and god knows what and sleep in a fresh bed. I instantly started to enjoy hanging around at his place even when he wasn't home. I had better peace of mind to learn for school and I was happy to be with him and be in the person you love's home and waiting for him to get home. For a brief moment there I had a glimpse of normality. I started learning how to cool, how to do a lot of things around the house and we were happy. My mom was so angry I've found this boy and was nagging me not to have sex, because he is gonna use me and dump me, I shall see, it's just a matter of time. I've told her, look here now, I don't things are like that. We were both nerdy as hell and he wasn't like that. We were both our first person and things were perfect. I've told my folks, screw you, I don't wanna live with you anymore. Woah, my mom went bananas, tried to threat me, she saw it doesn't work then just went with her mean words routine.
After one year with my husband, she started to nag me to get married, what will people say, like a slut you live with a man that is not your wedded husband, what will people say, they're gonna gossip about me (herself). Lots of nagging but no help. It's easy to force two kids to have a grown-up wedding but won't provide any help... 
Before all this she noticed that my husband had some money he was saving because he wasn't spending. And she started to ask him to loan her some money. I told him she never pays anyone back shit, but he was too ashamed to decline her requests. She, during that time, had all sorts of tiny general stored that she opened with money she loaned, never paid rent on time, or electric bills, or employees, never ever and she eventually got kicked. So many times and so many places she got kicked out.. So many.. And she loaned money from my cousin's husbands and boyfriends, and my cousins were coming at me and my boyfriend to pay them back their money. She loaned so much money from my husband he remained without any savings at all. 
Because I was 18 she tricked me into loaning money for a house on my name and on my-then-boyfriend husband's names. Was about the same time we were getting married and also renovating the apartment we live in. She quickly started not to pay the monthly money for the house and bank started to notify me and my husband and his family got notified also. My mother in law started to panic, normal people are not accustomed to owing money to the bank. By this point my husband was depleted of money, he was getting sadder by the day and stressed as hell. My mother in law had some money put aside for a leg surgery she wanted to get and the poor woman paid my mom's skipped months money at bank, she skipped 4 months and didn't tell us..
Somehow we pulled throw and managed to finish the apartment and pay for our wedding. They didn't do a single thing for that wedding except for gloating on our money. Now, in the country I live it is customary for people that attend a wedding to put some money in an envelope to help the young couple. Nice money can be made, but we had a small wedding and what we got didn't cover for anything. Because our apartment wasn't done, we lived with them in the house we ended up paying for and mom said not to be angry, it'll remain our house, regard it as an investment. We said we don't need no house and paying monthly interested fucks us bad financially. She was like yeah yeah, whatever. 
So we lived there and they found out where we kept the money we made from the wedding and slowly started to steal from them until nothing, zero, nada remained. We were so sad and angry, we had so many little plans with that money and it was ours and they took it. They just said sorry, look, I'll pay back. She always said ""relax, i'll pay back"" to everyone, even to us. I was so stressed and depressed at this point I couldn't sleep, I got panic attacks so bad I got diarrhea, slept 2 hours a night. Saw a shrink and the lady said it's bad and it's not ok..
We moved back into out apartment and I got more relaxed. But not for long, by this time she was at the gazzlionth store she opened and some stupid bank clerk trusted her with a blank check book she could had paid with for merchandise to the distributors, so she has stock to sell. Thing is, when you pay with a check, that person can go to a bank and collect the money, that are taken from the guy that gave the check's account. But my mom had no money in her account, and paying with checks like that can totally get you super in prison. So she called me and my husband ""I NEED X AMOUNT OF MONEY UNTIL 2 PM, RIGHT NOW OR ELSE I GET ARRESTED"". We started to loan money from friends ourselves to pay for my mom's shit. 
By this time already the quality of our lives became shittier and shittier, couldn't afford many things. To worsen things, because they didn't pay for their bills at the house, my credit card got locked, to this day I can't have a credit card on my name, coz the house is on my name... To even worsen things  they moved in with us coz they didn't have heat or electricity. For a short while they said. My grandparents don't want them, and they are old themselves, my dad is a noisy alcoholic and people are plain avoid them. With them in our apartment (2 room apartment) things got shitty. They broke so many things because they brutally handle them, like doors, wall outlets, wardrobes, faucets, in the room they sleep in the walls are dirty. It's  weird, the areas they touch on walls become dark and dirty, never knew why that is. No privacy, they infested us with cockroaches, hiding plates of food under the bed out of laziness to take it back to the kitchen after they're done, never cleaning, leaving dishes for us to do when we got home from work. So many cockroaches, we are so depressed because we have them, they climb on us sometimes when we sleep.. I told them, I can put poison and traps but if they keep on leaving dishes in the sink and food on the table the cockroaches will never go away. They're like neah, the building itself is infested. My dad got alcohol on the tap from all bars and stores in the neighborhood and merchants started to scold me for it coz he just vanished. He even stole my husband's wedding ring and he pawned it to buy alcohol. I cried so much over that wedding ring, it was such a holy thing for us, our wedding rings that we got with our little money... He pawned it and never paid back for it and lost it and didn't want to admit he did it so I never got to find out where he took it so I can buy it back. Broke my heart so much...
9 years later and they still live in our tiny apartment, by this point I can surely say that this apartment, if they ever move out, can be cleaned only with napalm lol... They don't provide all they do is eat and sleep and smoke. And we, we hadn't had a vacation since before we were married, can't afford a car, we can't get a bank loan ourselves for anything coz we already got that shitty house we don't want coz it's far and crappy made, they broke it, broke the heating system it needs a new one, broke the water pump new one needed also. Any normal person would ask as why don't we just kick them out.. I don't know, like where, in the streets?... 
They both got diabetes, mom on obesity and dad I believe because of drinking. For some years now I started drinking myself, I go to a bar and drink instead of going home, I hate to go home. Drinking got me fat and more depressed, it's a crazy loop and I don't know what to do. We both want a child so much. All our friends got cars and houses and kids and vacations and normal lives by our age.... 
My mom even dares to ask me if i'm infertile or why are we not having kids after 10+ years of marriage. I told her we are poor, I got no room for a child because of them and I don't wanna raise a baby in a cockroach infested home, so they crawl on the baby, jesus jesus no way. She scoffed and said that's lame excuses. 
They just sit in bed and eat, my dad had a brain stroke because of drinking he needs to be looked after, she can't move her legs because she sat that much in bed she became ankylosed. They will never move out and we will never escape this nightmare. It's a nightmare... Unless we win the lottery, I see no escape, I am so sad and depressed and so is my husband. We love each other so much and this is destroying our morale. Two lives that could had been so happy and fulfilled and normal sacrificed for one monster of a woman....

354,"So I've been with her for 3 years and for the most part everything is pretty great, it's just when it comes to sex I feel let down.
Like all couples sex at the start was great but over time it has just declined. Now we have sex at the most 2 times a week, usually just once and I am the only one who ever starts it and even then it is essentially just replaying the same old routine.
I have asked and tried to get her to do more, since I'm always the one doing all the work but she always shys away from it.
We have had a few discussions about this and for a very brief time after it may pick back up but then declines just as quick. She tells me she is self conscious about her taking control as she thinks she is no good at it and I always reassure her that it isn't the case in reality. Also I never shame her or force her or even get mad about it, I understand how she must feel when trying something new but she is basically unwilling to step out of her comfort zone.

Every day I do my best to make her feel beautiful and sexy by telling her that she is, and by making gestures like grabbing her ass, approaching and making out with her and so on, and she always positively responds to that but it never leads into anything else.
I'm clean, pretty fit, always upbeat and not at all worried about my size down there so I'm sure it couldn't be because of any of those few thing's.
We also live together.

Any advice?",24Feb2020,1
355,"I will not post my full story with this girl as it's really long and really confusing but me and this girl met 4 years ago we started dating almoust instantly because we just matched we fell in love fast like 4 months into the relationship and we fell hard. As we where 16 at that time it was our first ever encounter with love and we didn't know what to do as I had little to no experience in the dating life and she too didn't have experience so we did a lot of mistakes (no cheating) we broke up like a lot but ok the next day we got back together and that way we dated for 3 years and 10 months. But then we broke up badly cause I lied and that is the only red flag in her book even though she lies all the time. She got a new boyfriend while we where still having some kind of intimacy and seeing eachother and I took it really bad and could accept it a long time but after some tough few months I met a really charming girl and said ok let's try from scratch. We started dating with this girl and everything was going fine but then we my ex and me started communicating again as she was my first love I couldn't resist not seeing how she is (big mistake) and started to message her daily and we got close again. Then the bomb came she started talking about fixing things and making things better but I wasn't going to cheat cause that's really something I hate. So I broke up with the girl I was dating after a few months with communicating with my ex to get rejected by her with the words:"" I should have told you earlier that I really don't feel like it anymore.""

And so I broke the girl that loved me and got tricked by my ex.

And I'm in a hole at the moment cause I don't know what to do cause I really caught feelings for my ex again and now I'm feeling like an idiot for believing her.

So please somebody give me an idea on what to do.

Also sorry for my bad English.

356,"I only seem to get people telling me that I can still do X, Y, Z or people telling me how much they love being old, neither of which are particularly helpful to me. 

I can't go clubbing - sure I could physically go to a club but I don't have friends to go with any more and it's hard to make new friends in your thirties, plus being surrounded by kids is no fun. I'm not sure what people my age do for fun either...dinner parties, watching Netflix in a onesie, develop a socially acceptable addiction to alcohol, early nights?

I feel like I missed out on a lot of my youth just trying to survive, and because I have such a hard time making friends. I didn't get to be a student or do nearly enough fun things in my twenties - I think most people my age either got bored of clubbing or settled down with kids, whereas I've not transitioned. 

I don't have a career, I feel like I should have a career...plus marriage, kids, a mortgage, etc. that comes with a career. I feel like I can't really start working on a career, even if I knew what to do, so from now until 65+ I'll be lucky if I just get a job. 

I have a partner but it doesn't feel like he's The One - not that I really believe in such things and to be honest I don't believe in marriage either, but I can't help but feel a little bit left out when I see other people married. Hell even if their marriages don't work out at least they had someone who loved them enough to want to take that step, I can't even get to a point of living together with someone. 

Then there are children, at 36 I don't think it's going to happen - I don't even know if I want children, I think I've been in survival mode so long that it's just not been something I could realistically consider. I just dislike that the opportunity is passing me by, that the choice has been made for me. As a woman it is difficult, we're taught our worth is wrapped up in how we look, men's love for us, and motherhood takes over as how we show our worth when we're old - obviously this idea is patriarchal BS but it's still one that exists and thus contributes to how I feel. 

I'm supposed to have had all these experiences and have achieved/reached these milestones but I feel no different to teenage me, and in the meantime years have passed me by so I'm getting old.

I just hate that my youth has gone and this mundane life is going to be it for the next few decades, that I've missed out on finding love or having kids while I was still young enough, and that so many possibilities that existed as a young person with my life ahead of me are now completely gone.

358,"Throwaway account because this really isn’t something I want people in my everyday life to know I’m going through. 

I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused from the age of 6-14 by a family member. I didn’t tell anyone until I was 21 despite years of therapy off and on since it started. I always tried and it wouldn’t come out. Anyway, I only told my mom and she believed me and was immensely supportive. She cut my abuser out of her life immediately and told the rest of the family vaguely what he had done without mentioning me. I still haven’t told anyone else. 

Something else I haven’t told anyone is I don’t think I’m the only person he has done this to. Also he forced me to see horrible, illegal child pornography when I was very little. Or would “accidentally” leave it open and I’d see it. 

Now I am 23 and I’ve been coping much better. I’ve vaguely told my partner what happened which is huge for me. I’m looking for a new therapist in the town I moved to recently. I have bad days but I know my PTSD triggers and most days are good now. I work full time and am in school. I’ve felt more in control of my life than ever before recently. 

That is until last week. I just found out my abuser has a girlfriend who is pregnant. I haven’t spoken to him in years but I am horrified. I cannot let him hurt another child. Is it too late to report this to the police? I don’t really have evidence as this was so many years ago. I’ve been extremely depressed and struggling to function normally. I can’t stop thinking about another child going through this because I was too scared to speak up. Is there anything I can do?",24Feb2020,1
359,"So I believe my illness for the past 3 months ruined a great relationship for me. Some context here for you:
I was with this girl for the past 6 months. Perfect time and beautiful women. Everything was going swimmingly as planned, while she was at school I was working and continuing to work on my goals in life.  
BUT recently there has been some disagreements and she wanted to break things off with me. I’m a decently strong guy so I can handle this but I believe it’s been from my illnesses I’ve had the last 3 months. Starting in December I had to go to the hospital for issues with my stomach/abdomen which affected me for a while. Then recently I came down with mono which has put me out for the last month. This means I haven’t been able to be as affectionate as usual and I’ve been super stressed about money and my health. This in turn made her feel unloved and she fed off of the anxiety and stress I had.
She still says that she loves me and she continues to feel depressed when not being with me. I don’t necessarily understand what I did for her to not be into it anymore? Maybe she’s just confused? Maybe my sickness and stress was so bad she couldn’t handle it? Maybe I’m just a non compatible person? I don’t really know at this point and I need some advice on how to get over this and just let me know what you guys think about this situation. 
Sorry for the ramble but I feel like I needed to get this off my chest as we just had this conversation today, and I really want to make things work but I don’t want to force something that just won’t work.",24Feb2020,1
361,"this is a long story so please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years now. She is an amazing person and she's great. I have been so happy with her and she's amazing. My actions that I will explain does not reflect this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend that I will name Grace. She has been a good friend of mine for maybe a year or so now. We have always been very talkative with each other and the conversations have been very superficial. Only recently have we even mentioned any emotion. Ever since then though, she has confided in me about how she has been very unhappy for many years, and she's kept it all in for all of it. She has had issues with self worth and image and feels she cannot keep any (platonic) relationship for any period of time., so she constantly feels lonely. She hates herself. And this has manifested in some negative coping facets. Namely picking at her wrists and minor bulimia. 

Due to this, I spent a lot of time with her because I felt she needed support, so I offered mine. She has major trust issues and I promised my confidentiality. So I spent a lot of time with her when my girlfriend was not available, which was very often.  We got very touchy. I began to hug her and she began to lean on me. And I justified it to myself with her current condition and I know that that is not right. I began holding her hand to stop her from picking at her wrists when she was upset. Still. I know  what I did was wrong and she does too. I cheated on my girlfriend and I feel awful.

This eventually came out when my girlfriend talked to me about how she sees how touchy she is with me in front of everyone and I told her everything. She did not like that, obviously. And once again. I am so terribly sorry and I feel awful and I know I don't deserve any sympathy for that. She's extremely upset and rightfully so. Despite this she stayed with me.

I want to hammer home the fact that I do not and did not have any feelings for Grace. She was my best friend and I had no ill intentions in mind. This does not mean what I did was okay though, and I know this. 

So for about a month, my girlfriend tried to forgive us, and allow us to be friends because of the situation. The situation that I had to tell my girlfriend against Grace's wishes, which made her extremely upset with me. Once again. Rightfully so. But they tried to forgive and move on. And for about a month, although things were terse, it was kind of getting better. There obviously were limits put on my time with Grace. No touching, of course, and I would have to get my girlfriend's permission on anything I do with her. Okay. easy enough. I can do that. I broke her trust and I'm willing to do anything to mend it. And it's not like it's hard not to touch Grace. I am not attracted to her, so it's not like I have to resist any urges. 

And so time goes on and my girlfriend is unhappy and so is Grace. My girlfriend is unhappy that I cheated on her, and Grace is deathly afraid of losing her best friend and sole lifeline in helping her solve her issues. And it's all my fault and I know that and so I have also been unhappy. 

recently though, my girlfriend snapped. She decided that she just can't have that. She is telling me to stop being friends with her. She becomes extremely upset if I am even in the same location as her. Grace is very integrated in our group of friends, and so recently, I was invited out to dinner with some of us that attended a school competition and that included Grace. And I went. And my girlfriend was very unhappy.

She is telling me to abandon someone who needs help. And she's completely justified in it. But also. Grace needs support, and her issues with trust and isolation means she will be left completely alone. And so now I am stuck. Morally, my mind is telling me that I can't abandon Grace. But I need to keep my girlfriend because I just can't lose her. I have created an awful situation for myself and I know this but more importantly I have created an awful situation with the people I care about the most. I have done everything my girlfriend has told me to do and she is still upset with me consistently about the issue. Even if she sees me around Grace she will be upset. I have done everything she has asked of me short of completely stopping all communication with Grace. I know my girlfriend is justified in her anger. I just don't know how to fix this I honestly don't think there is a way out but I don't know what to do.

I'm so utterly lost. I'm so done with everything. I just don't know what to do.",24Feb2020,1

Tw for mental health and c*ncer mentions

I (f22) have been dating the most amazing woman (f25) since December now. Though we havent known each other that long, I feel complete around her, and from what I understand the feeling is mutual. We have something really special, and though its early still, I know I want to be with her for years and years to come and we're close as two people can be. 

But we're the sort of couple that is the other's complete polar opposite while also having a lot in common. Whereas she has a tendency to be very dry, a little hot headed and closed off/reserved, I am a lot softer natured and open about my feelings. If I had to fit us into stereotypes she'd be the tough girl and I would be the soft indie girl with too many emotions.

For a while now my gf has been going through a depression (she started seeing a therapist last week)(I think it's a burnout rather than depression), which is something I also struggle with but I've been medicated for for a while now. But it got really bad about 3 weeks ago, after a mental breakdown at work (which has been the main cause of all of this as the working conditions are terrible). Up until about a week ago however, she hasn't been different around me. It's just the last week that She's been... different. A lot less talkative on WhatsApp (which is our main form of communication as we live about 2 hours away from each other atm), where before she couldn't keep her hands off of me she's now almost allergic to the affection. And I can deal with that, because I know (after a lot of communication and reassurance from her) that this is how she is in a depression and she still loves me, even though I don't exactly relate to it as when I'm depressed I still want affection and love.

The problem lies in that I have no idea how to be there for her now. I have a tendency to want to fix everything, and mothergoose the people around me in need and while I want to take this away from her and fix it for her, I know I cant do that, but I'm wrecking my brain trying to find a way to make it at least a little better for her. Shes told me there's nothing I can really do but I feel like such a failure for it. I recently had a really terrible cancer scare (thank god I was given the all clear) and she was there for me in the most amazing and selfless, supportive way. She was amazing, and its killing me that I can't seem to be the same light in the dark for her as she was for me. 

I love her, and I don't want her to suffer anymore than she already has, but my type of care in these situations is overbearing to her. I dont really know what to do...  if anyone has any advice please do share, I'd be so grateful.",24Feb2020,1

we've had some good, personal conversations and she continues to show interest by always talking to me, and approaching me... even a bit flirty at times. i'm very acutely aware of the slightest change in peoples personality, especially someone I enjoy talking to like her... and she definitely has been subtly flirty at times with me. 

Anyways, last week I asked her to get coffee, and she told me she's pretty busy, and so I suggested some other time like during spring break or summer, and she said okay (could've just been trying to be nice though?)

Anyways, I was so confused because she showed so much interest, it was mutual and nothing was forced, it was all so natural the way we conversed... patient, natural, positive!

So here we are at day 2. He’s been a little distant. Wants to watch videos all day or play on his computer. Has really been up and down in mood. He’s been meaner than usual to the dogs, not like abuse mean but he’s just not being the same. He’s had a sullen look all day when he’s fallen out of a good normal mood. He assures time that he is fine, but obviously he’s acting atypical. 

Now I know this is all very normal considering his friend just passed, considering they messaged each other every day. So he’s probably experiencing the phone silence, and I’m sure the absence is bothering him. I’m sure he’s keeping his mind busy with endless videos and computer stuff. 

But he tried to make an excuse to sleep in a different bedroom. I made him foodies this evening and all that. I’m trying to be there for him but it almost seems he wants to be alone all the time now. Guys are weird and I don’t know what to do to or how to respond.

I was baffled. She wasn’t a person I’d expect to cut herself. She said she wanted to see how it felt and to try it, but I’m simply not convinced that was the reason. I asked her where else she cut and she told me her thighs. Then I asked her if this was her first time and she said no.

I was beyond furious. 

I asked her what she used and she said a razor, and I told her that if by accident the razor slips from her arm in the tub and nicks the wrong vein, she might bleed out with no one to stop the bleeding. I was trying to scare her.

Then I told her that if she cuts herself again, I will not talk to her until it heals, which is months.

She quited down and told me she won’t do it again, but I just don’t believe her.

Year after year after year I kept telling myself that this year is my year but it wasn't until 2018 where it started getting better. I lost weight, started working, got my drivers license and things were going up. My confidence came back slowly but surely, I became more social and had a great time. I finally felt like things were moving forward. I even got my olderst (younger) sibling back into school and was like a teacher at home.

 I have 2 siblings and one is very young while the other one is a couple of years younger. I was mentoring both of them with their school assignments and everything. The older sibling was very thankful and kept telling me how much they appreciate me and what I am doing. So December 2018 was one of the best times for me because I had nothing but progress to look back on. Now onto 2019 and I wasn't happy at all with my job. It stressed me to the very core. I started eating more and more, I quit the job and I managed to get back to where I was, undoing pretty much all my progress. Messed up sleeping schedule, you name it.

To make matters worse, the older sibling who I got back into school and mentored started acting weird in late november of 2019. It hurt me to see and I would always offer support and a shoulder to lean on as an older brother. I always got the same answer: School is keeping me busy. I didn't force anything but in hindsight maybe I should have pushed a bit harder. I should have seen the signs. Why? Because just a month ago they disappeared. It was a thing of nightmares. Didn't hear from them for 3-4 hours and parents didn't think anything was off, besides the fact that they wouldn't pick up the phone or answer any texts. It gets late and it turns into a shit show. It's been many hours and not a single response. No one has seen my sibling and I didn't even know about it until my mother and younger sibling woke me up crying and telling me the older sibling is nowhere to be found. This behavior was unheard of and extremely unlike normal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing because we discussed what dinner I was going to make before I went to bed. 

 My parents are freaking out and so am I. We spent 8 hours thinking about kidnapping, accidents, murder etc. We called the cops and got the answer that it was too early to do anything and it sounded normal for them. It was a nightmare. Fast forward 9 hours and we hear from the cops that they are okay but do not want to be found and has since not contacted me or parents. It feels like a death but not really at the same time. You can't just accept a family member being out of your life without a reason, a goodbye, anything. The fact that we had to go through so much agony thinking something bad had happened just makes it worse. I love my family so much and I was going crazy until I heard what they had actually done. 

I feel so betrayed and tired of life in general. It's one thing after another and it keeps knocking me down. I feel like a tiny spark of flame that is trying to grow but the stormy weather won't allow it.

I have thought about suicide many times. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm in a terrible place and I do not have access to therapy or anything here. My parents are in dire state (already sick and now that). I am holding up as much as I can for my younger sibling making sure he feels safe and happy. However, deep inside I am emotionally scarred because of what happened and where I am right now.

What am I supposed to do? I'm thinking of doing unhealthy things but my family is what's stopping me. I do not know how long I can hold on like this. My life is ruined and I do not see any hope.

I tell myself today that I'll stop eating unhealthy food and then tomorrow comes and I've already broken it. I've been paying hundreds of $ on a gym membership that I don't even go to. I just can't get up in the mornings. I just feel like nothing. I don't trust my own words or promises. It has gotten so bad that I don't  take showers for days or brush my teeth for days. I'm afraid of where I'm heading towards. 

Just how can I move forward? How can I become a better me? I used to have so many dreams and it hurts me because it feels like my chances are gone. Like i've wasted my prime years. I don't show these emotions in real life because I'm showing a facade. Everything is a huge mess.

Sorry for the wall of text but I am truly in a bad place and I just want to stop hating what I've become and to get better. I am so sad inside. I feel betrayed by my own family member because they made things so much worse for me, even after I sacrificed so much for them. That and just where I am.

Please help.",24Feb2020,1

I used to live with her for a year, my whole first year of college. I left her back in mid June and the breakup was messy because we were seeing each other for a bit later on, and when that ended a mutual friend of ours (We'll call her D) was telling me about how she had slept with ~5 other people, the number was increasing, and that she had slept with someone while we were still seeing each other. Like we had plans to hang out one night and she slept with someone the night before. We weren't necessarily exclusive during this time, but it bothered me BAD cause if I done the same thing then she would have a tantrum. She had no idea that I know about it either.

401,"
Sorry in advance for the long post and my grammar is not the best. ( my first ever post)

So some background info. I have a roommate (22F) and our first year we hit it off great(we are both in college). I consider her a good friend. So come the following year her younger cousin (21F) starts hanging around more and more. The cousin seems nice but I didnt get the best vibes off her. I still made an effort since she and my roommate are close.

(So this is some stuff that I noticed and my roommate is a normally anxious person)

It started out with something small, my roommate meeting up with the cousin for lunch. And she would say things like sorry I have to go I'm meeting up with cousin for lunch. If I'm late she'll be pissed. The few times I did join them, where my roommate and I were a little late(literally only a few minutes) she  would be annoyed/mad. 

Or my roommates would constantly go on and on about how smart her cousin was. Her cousin would also make subtle remarks to her that would make me pause( in a negative way). Cousin thought of herself as incredibly smart and likes to call others out when they were wrong but i noticed it was mostly in front of other people.

Or when we would hangout (with cousin included) and discuss different topics, my roommate ( the best way I can describe it) would lose her personality. She wasn't always the most vocal person but she still would always try to give her 2 cents. But when cousin is around she looks to cousin when she talks or would just not say anything. After a while cousin would always be around and when trying to hang out with just my roommate, it would be impossible. Roommate and I wouldn't be able to hangout with other friends because she ""didnt like them"" and the only friend she did like was the friend that was agreeable. 


I have been brushing these things off saying it's in my head but it keeps bugging me.

So to me she seems controlling or am I overthinking it?

405,"So, here's the story. I've been best friends with this dude for almost 7 years at this point. I was drawn to him since we first met. He knows I'm gay. I have never told him my feelings for him because I'm scared of losing him. And after years of spending time together and just hanging out a lot, my feelings have grown stronger. I know I will never be with him and I just can't get over it. He's 100% straight. I love him a lot. I started traveling to be away from him (and for the adventure, too.) but that is the hidden agenda. I left in September for 4 and a half months. I came back to visit him and we hung out every day. It made me miss him more and more. He was affectionate but as ""straight"" as it can be because we haven't seen each other in awhile and he knew I was planning on leaving again. I moved across the country and I don't want to go back and visit him again (I mean I do..but, I'm so in love with him) and it won't ever happen. I haven't spoken to him since I left because I want to get over him. I'm afraid of texting or calling him. He sent me one 'Miss you bud' text a month ago and that was the last time I really heard from him. So, here's the question: Do I write a letter to him explaining why I haven't been speaking to him and what the hidden agenda is basically and just spill my feelings out? Or avoid the feelings because I really don't want to lose him... and I really don't want any of my other friends to find out. We have so many mutual friends. He is my best friend. He also currently has a longterm girlfriend that I'm not a particular fan of and it's really hard seeing them together. I was really good friends with his last girlfriend, so that helped a lot.

406,"Hey so I’ve been single for like 3 years now and decided to get back out there. So I made an okcupid account and matched with a lot of girls but none of them really replied and if they did they would stop talking to me after a while. So I matched with this one girl last month and she seemed to be really into me, like really really into me. I’m not surprised because she’s a skinny, nerdy looking girl with glasses and not the prettiest face and people say I look like a young Denzel Washington. So anyways the convo is going good on okcupid the first day but when I get her snapchat a few days later she barely will even reply to anything I say. Like she’ll leave my shit on read and not reply at all so I just block her on OKC &amp; Snapchat about 3 weeks ago because I’m not really fucking with her( all I was getting was “hi” snaps with ugly pics with horrible lighting”. So I’m talking to other girls now and I go on Facebook and Instagram today and she’s somehow found my Instagram and followed me and she found my Facebook somehow too. 


She sent me a message and the convo went like this: 

Girl: “you blocked me? I really wanna talk to you”
Me:  “yes I did”. 
Girl: “I really like you. can I be your girlfriend?”
Me: “we literally talked for one day and when you gave me your Snapchat all you sent me was “hi” msgs and pics and whenever I replied you would read my msg and not reply” 
Girl: “sorry I don’t know what to say sometimes” 
Girl: “it would be easier if we talked on the snap baby”
Me: okay 

It’s kinda weird how she found my Facebook profile because I never told her my full name and it’s not on my snap or my OKC account, I have a random username and we literally talked for like 1 day for a few hours. She lives in Ohio and I live in Michigan. I kinda feel like I’m being stalked online. 

I did add her back on the snap to see what she had to say and all it’s been today is pics and the convo has been pretty consistent  but this girl is just kinda weird and sometimes she can barely write full sentences that actually make sense. She wears these ugly glasses in her pics that she sends me on the snap but on her Facebook she is barely wearing them at all and she actually looks amazing in most of her pics, like full face of makeup, lipstick, skimpy sexy clothes but she keeps sending me like her ugliest pics on snap and a lot look like she just woke up or something. 

I wish I was talking to the sexy looking popular girl on Facebook in pics with groups of people. Not this socially awkward girl sending me these pics on the snap in ugly sweaters and fucked up hair. It’s weird because it’s the same girl.

I am the kind of guy who makes friends much easier on the internet than i do IRL. One of my friends, let's call him Mike, is having a hard time as of right now. His parents are not treating him very well. 

They are very controlling, and come off through his messages describing them to me as extremely emotionally manipulative. They pressured him into dropping out of college despite him wanting to stay, eventually making him feel like that was the only option. He even once showed me a picture of a note they left, saying ""how they hoped he would drop out soon so he could start working and make money for them"".

He's the kind of guy who enjoys anime and pop culture, but that is apparently sinful to these two. They recently found one of his figures and went completely balistic, forcing him to show them his social media where he posts, comments on and generally views anime related content. Then they went even more balistic. Not only did they take away everything anime-related he has ever owned, but they also stole a PC that HE himself payed for, and cut him off from the internet entirely, forcing him to tell me all of this from his local library's computer.

He even told me he feared that they might force him into some sort of ""rehabilitation center"" (Like, what? For a hobby?) and his mom told him, quote from his message to me: ""that he is sinful and someone a person would never love.""

Before all this happened he was very secretive and nervous about being on his twitter profile, which is where we usually chatted, since he was afraid his parents was gonna catch him viewing something they might not enjoy.

WHAT THE HELL DO I DO TO HELP HIM!? I love him like my brother. He's one of the few people who ever gave me the time of day, and i can't help but feel completely helpless in this whole situation.

412,"About me: 

Hi, I'm 21 almost 22F and from FL, USA. I've been having health issues the majority of my life, and I'm trying hard to put the puzzle pieces together to find a diagnosis I'm comfortable with. I was told I had Fibromyalgia when I was 18 after having a Dystonia &amp; partial epilepsy label stripped due to normal test results. The doctor at the time told me it was the only thing he could think that would present as my disorder had. He was one primary care doctor seeing me after 10+ specialists told me to get mental health care instead of looking for a diagnosis. He believed in my pain, but even after trying so hard to agree with this diagnosis, I just don't see enough similarities between other people I meet with fibro, which led me to reading about EDS. 


Now, when I was younger my mom died of an aneurysm, after she passed it was suggested based on her physical features ( flat feet, long flexible fingers, nearsighted eyes,  tall body) that she might have had marphans syndrome, which pushed my grandmother to take me to a genetic specialist, who gave me the point test, and marked me down as borderline in terms of physical presentation; I was having my ankles roll painfully often at this time and was struggling to keep up with other kids. Quite a few nights were spent at the ER with a ' broken ankle' only for me to get up and be fine.  The doctor urged my family to ensure I was able to get an echocardiogram every 5 years to check for any issues along the aorta. We didn't know about EDS at the time. 

When my symptoms went from being an occasional thing and kicked into full gear I was 14. Within a year I had to drop out and get a GED. I couldn't walk to class regularly. I'd fall down. I stayed home often doing nothing but still in extreme pain. Started medical cannabis when I was 16 and got some of my freedom back.


Well, basically, I kept thinking about all of this and no matter how much I tried to rationalize it, I couldn't imagine why it made any sense that my mother and I both have heavy physical presentations of a connective tissue disorder, neurological issues, and severe joint pain,  and I couldn't wrap my head around the idea we'd both go on to have different neurological issues that weren't related. 

So then I came across EDS, and it all sorta makes sense? 
Are there any other suggestions or observations that might point me in the right directions?  I'm getting health insurance for the first time in four years next month, and I want to get as much done as I can in the right direction.




Symptoms: 


Migraines ( lasting 8-26 hours with nausea, based left to the base of the skull) 3x+ a month
Joint pain, grinding,      especially in hands, feet, and elbows.  ( off and on) 
Stiff muscles
Fatigue ( near daily )
Wide spread static pain ( off and on) daily
Legs falling out from under me, won't hold weight ( off and on) 4-6 days a week, usually my ankle, but can be localized in the knee or hip.
Lack of restful sleep, hard to get to sleep
Abnormal joint cracking 
Brain fog
Tinnitus
Muscle pulling &amp; trembling, small spasms
Muscle ache
Sensory overload in loud environments
Nonsensical stabbing &amp; pinching pains, anywhere, even my earlobes.
Sensitivity to cold



Family History: 

Mother died of aortic aneurysm &amp; presented symptoms for multi focal Dystonia

421,"I start loving people way too easily. I think it is because I was homeschooled and never used to get much of a chance to meet people so I've always been very lonely. It makes me miserable and I want to stop but I don't know how to not be affected.

Some examples:

- I had a roommate two years ago for 5 months. We barely knew each other before, but in the time we lived together we became very close and I started thinking of her as my best friend. She turned out to be a terrible and manipulative person, and we fell out, but part of me still misses her and wonders if what happened was my fault.

- I'm a DSP and two months ago I started working with a kid who I came to really care for. I originally had a really good relationship with him but we had a setback recently and he does not like or trust me anymore. It's affecting my opinion of myself and my general outlook more than it probably should.

- around Thanksgiving I took in my friend's cat on the condition that I would rehome her if she didn't get along with my current cat. She absolutely does not get along with my cat and I'm devastated over it. I've been crying for days and legitimately thinking of suicide because I can't bear the thought of never seeing her again.

Obviously this is not acceptable and I want to stop but I don't know how to not love people immediately.",24Feb2020,1

423,"So a bit of background, my gf is currently an honors college student and her sister is graduated with her own job, but still lives at home. 

Her older sister has really bad crippling anxiety and hypochondria and takes medication for it, but still uses my girlfriend as her “comfort” so that she doesn’t spiral out of control. 

This has been happening for years and my gf thinks it’s not a problem, and puts her sister’s happiness before her own and it’s starting to take a toll on her even tho she won’t admit it. 

Others have also commented on how toxic this is but she refuses to see it as any type of problem. She recognizes it as a long term problem but still thinks she should help her because they’re so close. 

But the problem lies in the fact that her sister guilt trips her into driving and hour home every weekend just so that she personally feels better, and no other reason. And constantly manipulated and berates her whenever my gf does anything wrong or upsets her at all. 

I’m currently studying abnormal criminal behavior and psychology but I don’t have the knowledge to help her, and I don’t know who to talk to or what I can do to help her while also doing what’s best for both of them.",24Feb2020,1

425,"I currently have very bad anxiety, to the point where studying or doing homework is so stressful that I simply can't do it. My grades have been suffering, and I have recently fallen into depression. Every day I feel like killing myself. I am currently enrolled in college, and I have two roommates that I don't particularly like, but they're almost never in the room because they're almost always at their girlfriends' places. This means I come home to an empty dorm with no one to talk to. This is when I start to think about my past, and I start to feel completely worthless due to various toxic relationships I've had throughout the years, my bad grades, and the fact that I may be unable to switch into my major of choice (computer science).

Three of my friends all live in a dorm a minute away from me, and I already told one of them that I'm depressed. Should I ask him if I could study in his room every day? Of course, I would be quiet and respectful of my friends' room, and it would be fine if at certain points of the day they had to kick me out, because it's their room after all. There is a lounge right next to their room where people study and do homework, so I guess I could study there too. But in order for me to study and be productive, I just feel that I have to be around at least one of my friends to get any work done, because when I'm in my dorm alone, all I could think about is how big of a failure I am, and I lay in my bed all day looking at my phone. I am trying my best to combat my depression. I go to the gym nearly every day, I'm eating well, and I'm getting therapy through my school, but they only have sessions once every five weeks, and I am just sick of going through this alone.",24Feb2020,1

428,"I have a friend who I was really close to in high school. She supported me through mental health issues, I did the same. We now go to separate colleges, so I only ever talk to her over text. I haven’t seen her in person in months, and whenever I’ve tried to make plans she has cancelled or just didn’t respond. Lately it feels like she doesn’t really care about me, I’m more of someone she can turn to as a last resort. 

She has some serious mental health issues, including addiction/substance abuse. She has overdosed before (obviously lived) and been hospitalized multiple times. She has trauma she is dealing with, and I have done my best to be supportive, but there’s not a ton I can do when I never see her. 

Tonight was the worst. She called me well after 1am, while she was about to be arrested for intoxication and public disturbance. I frankly am not even sure what she was expecting of me, since I live in a different city. I think she was pretending I was her mom, and at one point she put me on the phone with a cop. I just said I couldn’t pick her up. I really do not know what I was supposed to do. She eventually hung up, and I tried to text her but she hasn’t responded (I think she was arrested). Immediately after she hung up I had an anxiety attack. I really have no idea what I was supposed to do, but it left me feeling guilty and afraid (it’s not exactly legal to lie to a cop about your identity, but I didn’t want her to get caught and I had no idea what was happening so... I didn’t explicitly lie but sorta did??) and also afraid for her. I’m just confused and drained. 

She keeps saying she’s getting better, and I feel like she’s probably just saying that to not worry anyone. I don’t fault her at all for her addiction and struggles, bc she’s gone through a lot of touch shit. I love her and want her to get better. I want to help her, but at this point her behavior is taking a toll on me. I’m afraid if I tell her off or cut her off it will make her worse. I don’t know what to do.

432,"Sorry, first time poster. Hopefully I'm posting in the correct sub, and apologies for the long post.

A bit of a background:

I consider myself lucky to be raised in a semi-well off family with 2 other younger siblings (25 y.o. sis and 20 y.o. brother). Mom's the typical traditional strict parent who despite her frequent nagging, has a loving heart and is always concerned about all her kids. Sure, we have arguments sometimes, but her words have also come from a good place. 

All 3 kids have gone overseas to study with university completely paid for by parents. While both younger brother and I had to rent, my younger sister had the privilege of staying entirely rent-free in a property that my parents bought for essentially most of her university days since 2014 and even after graduating in 2017 while she was looking for a job. 

Sis appears to not be satisfied with her line of study and had been thinking of changing careers for a while, in fact, she has not actually worked in her field of study since graduating and has since been working part-time jobs until last year when she obtained a job in a different field requiring her to move to a different suburb, where parents bought yet another property for her to stay in RENT-free. She is quite keen to stay in the current country, however she is having issues with obtaining visa due to insufficient points (partly due to her chosen field of study/degree, and inability to achieve adequate points on the English tests). Her visa is expiring in March 2020.

Things came to a head late last year when we received complaints from the building manager regarding recurrent complaints of loud noises and cigarette ashes from the neighbours. It was then we realised that sis had been co-habitating with a partner (let's call him Joe) for more than a year now without telling anyone (which is fine). Joe's currently unemployed due to chronic back pain, and gets money from the government for this. Problem is, she had been lying to mom frequently by way of crying to garner sympathy and getting money from mom, up to $40-50k (this is on top of the paid off degree, life expenses and accommodation overseas for half a decade to boot!). Examples of lies include forging company expenses and claiming that this needs to be paid out of pocket before the company will compensate her during the next pay cycles

So parents ended up flying overseas to confront her last year, during which the aforementioned truth was uncovered. It appears she had sought Joe, who is a local resident, as a partner in hopes of pursuing a partner visa. Now, my parents disaprove of the relationship due to him being unemployed, and she being the sole breadwinner who is still requiring financial support from parents. They offered her to continue staying in the property provided she give up the relationship. She ultimately chose to move out with Joe, which is entirely in her right given she is an adult now. Mom &amp; Dad were understandbly tremendously heartbroken and took a toll on their health.

Despite her proclaimation to go her own way as an adult, she is still finding ways to garner sympathy and attempting to get money from my parents and I to fund her visa. I am in a position to do so, but felt that providing for her will only continue to condone her behaviour. Despite 4-months since the incident, she appears to be blaming everyone for her 'hardship' and does not appear to have an ounce of insight into her behaviour of lying to everyone and having no empathy for our parents whatsoever. As the visa expiry date is approaching, now she's resorted to posting on FB about suicidal intentions.

Mom and dad are in their 60s now. However, they are both still working away every single day for their own retirement, despite the impact on their health that sis put them through. I feel it is incredibly unfair for them to have to go through this. What's more, they are still funding my brother's degree currently (I've offered to look after my parents and brother, but parents declined at this stage, citing I should focus on investing for my own future first). Sure I can given sis the money she needs in the short term, but what's to stop her from recurrent antics like this in the future. I'm just at a lost right now...

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; Sis is being incredibly self-centered and threatening parents for money, despite already being a full-fledged adult. I'm caught in between and am reluctant to condone this behaviour by throwing money at her.",24Feb2020,1

435,"Hi, i'm 23m from Europe, I am finishing my masters degree in IT, been living in my small local town for my whole life.

But now I'm starting to realize I missed out on student life by not going to bigger universities, and feel left out. As I have spare money to live off for a while, I was wondering if I should start studies again in different field but in bigger city? On one hand taking up studies to get to know people and live the student life feels superficial, but on the other hand this feeling of being left out is starting to drag way too long. Of course there is the catch that I might not fit in with the younger students, but I could still try.

436,"So this is going to be a long post, but I honestly don’t have any one else to discuss this with because I don’t know who would understand. 

For as long as I can remember (I’m 26 F), my family has made comments about my weight. It started around 13-14, when I was hitting puberty and my boobs and hips grew when I first started being teased about being fat. What started with teasing started affecting me as they would poke my fat, jiggle it, slap my bum and tell me how “jiggly” I am everywhere. Tbh I look back and don’t even think I was unhealthy or fat back then. Highschool was tough for me. I never had the confidence to speak to boys - I was tall and awkward, “fat,” had PCOS so I had extra facial hair... I never considered myself pretty. I used to compare myself to all the thin girls and never feel good enough. I never dated, I was never asked out on any. I used to write in my journal about how I wish I fell sick so I could loose weight, or about how I tried to force myself to throw up after eating. My mom actually read my journal behind my back but that’s another thing. 

Anyway - me at college: 18 years old, never been kissed, not lacking much confidence either. I was average size then. Not skinny, but definitely not obese or unhealthy in any way. I moved away for college and had a few meaningless hookups. Honestly it felt good to receive attention (which I never had), and even though sometimes I didn’t want to hookup I did it because the validation that my body was desirable felt worth it. None of those hookups obviously turned into anything more. 

I started putting on weight in college (unhealthy food, drinking ... no working out.) Let’s say freshman 15 got the best of me. By this time i thought I’d developed a thick skin to my family and it didn’t bother me + I largely lived away. 

Post college I moved back to my hometown where I started dating this wonderful man. He always made me feel loved and appreciated and worshipped my body. It felt good because this was the first time in my life that someone had seen me for me, beyond my size and weight. He motivated me to eat healthier and start working out too. I was happy until we broke up for various other reasons. 

Since then, my parents never leave an opportunity to tell me how fat I am, and how I’m never going to find a man who finds me attractive or will want to be with me. Every time I go on a date but it doesn’t work out for some reason, they tell me it’s because I’m too fat. I might be bigger than what’s considered “normal” but I’m healthy - I eat well, I work out 4-5 times a week, my body is fit and capable of doing things. But they still can’t look beyond my weight. 

I’ve also tried extremes- I’ve tried forcing myself to throw up, I’ve starved myself, I’ve binged, I’ve pushed my body to the extremes. Ive also tried hurting myself because sometimes I truly believed that no one sees beyond my weight, and that I don’t deserve to take up the space that I do. I oscillate from being strong and balanced and healthy and happy to being so low, depressed, and binge eating because I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Every single conversation revolves around weight. I’ve been told I should stop eating while at dinner. I’ve been told I shouldn’t go out on a date with a man because he’s too thin for me and we’ll look odd as a couple. I’ve been denied dessert because “you don’t need it.” My mum has counted the number of times I ate dessert (and told me about it later). I’ve been compared endlessly to family friends, friends, other people we know and told how if they can be so skinny why can’t I. I’ve showed up at family events where they’ve remarked how my clothes would look nicer on me if I lost a little bit of weight. 

Idk man. I don’t know what to think or believe any more. I just got off the phone with my mom and it was another of those conversations that’s plunged me to feeling low again. I was so good the last 2 weeks but I can’t shake this off. Any advice would be good now tbh.",24Feb2020,1

My Mother is married to another guy for long now

I lived in another town and things started to went bad for me then my Step Father (nick) decided he will give me a chance and told my mom (judi) i can come and stay with them in graaff reinet

Currently i am living here 10 months

My step sister (shannon) she lived here in graff reinet for 8 years at her grand mother then when i arrived here she moved in to her fathers house

So basicly its me, my mom, step dad, and brother but my step sister decided last year december she is going to move to her mothers in brakpan but things is very bad there. Worst conditions

Her father told his daugter listen if you move to your mom you wont come back and step sis didn't listen to her father, every one told her its a mistake well now she is there for about two months. 

Conditions at my step sister:
Her mother chooses her own make up over her own daughter
Her mom doesn't really care
Her step dad there drinks he lost his job
Step dad sells everything to buy alchol
Her own brother left school and works
Her biological brother lives there in brakpan also
My sister school books and stuff is only bought halfway 
Meaning she only got half off everything school books etc
Sisters bedroom is in the living room no privacy
Well there is speech violence in the house between everyone
She cant study cause everyone bothers her
She cant do homework either
She going to fail and its already exsams
Her toiletries she dont have any
Food conditions there is no food
The house that they are living in they dont pay rent
House is not even on step dads name
Step dad stealing power at power box 
There is a lot of problems even that step dad try to hit his own step daugter
Mother and step dad is in room and wispering about how mush they hate shannon and grant
Well there are just the basics

Now to get bacl to the storyline

When shannon bin there a month she asked her father to return and her father nick told her no you dont want to listen now stay there and take responsibility. 

Shannon thought she will block all the family here in gaaff reinet cause they dont want to help her

Her grandmother she lived with have told her own grand daughter you are no part of my family any longer due to that you dont want to listen and stuff

Now my step sister wants to fix her relationship with her biological father nick but he doesn't want her back

And my mother Shannon's step mom judi dont want her here either

So now there is a lot going on

Shannon biological mother she is living with Shirline told her daughter she wont return to her father nick and to her step mom judi because the mother shirline hates nick and judi

So what do we do here?

My step sis shannon dont want to go to the social workers 

She only want to stay there and just finish school

She really changed and just want to make a success of her life but no one wants to give shannon a chance

I cant help my own sister cause even me i am living with my mom and her father nick

440,"someone from my school made a anonymous account for rumours and drama. Someone commented on it saying that my friend (16male) raped his ex girlfriend. Apparently it happen 3 years ago, both of them would of been 13. 
The “rapist” is a very skinny twig right now, just like hiccup in how to train your dragon (the first movie), I have only seen photos of him when he was 13 he was smaller then he is today. The girl that was “raped” she was at least twice his body weight at the time. 
So she posted that this person raped her and asked for her name to BE COVERED. Then the “rapist” best friend commented that it’s not true.  Then the girl commented saying that it was and what not. Then people started saying that “if u got raped, why don’t u go to the police about it. And not post about it” 
She replied with “I would of cried so much the police wouldn’t under stand me” 
That somewhat made me doubt it. Then I decided to message her. In the convo she was very rude but I asked her if she was ever sexually assaulted, she said yes it was on a bus she didn’t go to the police about it as well. IT WAS ON A BUS EVERY BUS IN THE STATE HAS CAMERAS ON IT. And the reason she didn’t go to the police about it because she knew she wouldn’t see him again. But apparently he was arrested for touching a toddler. 
At that point I did not care if I was being nice or not but I went off basically saying that that toddler WOULD OF NEVER BEEN TOUCH if she just went to the police about it. 
At this moment I didn’t believe her 100% and told her that she is a lying shit and if u ever get sexually assaulted or raped go to the police about it and not wait 3 years and then post it over a anonymous thing for strangers to see.

442,"My partner admitted recently when we discussed it that he has a low EQ. He struggles with empathy, constantly gets into arguments with people etc. But there’s more to it than that and I feel it is getting much worse over the years. 

To give some examples, he seems almost incapable of following instructions. If I tell him to turn left, he’ll stand and argue about why he needs to turn right. He will point blank refuse to follow advice (including regarding medicines) from doctor, vet etc). Also, as I’m high risk pregnancy and our baby has a high chance of inheriting my genetic condition, we’ve been having lots of hospital appointments and meetings with other professions. It seems like he doesn’t understand the context of the meeting or the roles of the staff, despite being told in advance, as he will try to dominate the conversation and bring up issues which are irrelevant. It is getting really awkward and embarrassing. He also has trouble expressing himself and gets very worked up. 

My partner is 38/Indian (moved here about 8 years ago) and I used to think it was a language barrier. But he is adamant he’s always spoken English and even in his own language with his friends he seems to have similar issues. 

He is incredibly messy and spontaneous, will not take responsibility for his actions. 

He wasn’t like this -or nowhere near as bad - in the first couple of years together, but he has gradually got much worse. He refuses to see a doctor or counsellor. I am at my wits end as he is making my life so much more difficult.

We had a big meal in the evening to tell parents, siblings and grandparents, everyone was happy apart from my (brides) parents.

The thing is I told my mum the week before to give her a little bit of time to process and she didn’t take it well, and told me a couple of days later she wished I’d never told her and that my Dad will not take this well. So I told my Dad a few days before the wedding and he was so angry he sent me out the room because he couldn’t look at me. 

The evening of the wedding my Dad was mostly ok and joking with my siblings, my Mum left the room to cry several times and barely spoke. 

I am of course heart broken, I didn’t mean to hurt them so badly, and I do plan on having a ceremony down the line where everyone can celebrate (which I made clear from the start when I told them)

But now my mum is messaging me some upsetting stuff, including saying my siblings are angry at me and think that I did it because I think they’re not good enough. I have spoken to my siblings and none of them feel this way. A little hurt and shocked but happy for us.

Sorry if there’s any formatting issues, this was written on mobile.

To preserve anonymity, we’ll call my course coordinator ‘Sam’, and for context, I attend a university and am doing a course that consists of three year groups, with only 9 people in each year. It’s an arts school and that, alongside the fact that the class sizes aren’t huge, means that we’re all relatively close to Sam and to each other. 

Pretty much every day, Sam will come into our office and have a chat with everyone and just catch up on how they’re going with their work and with life in general. Except, I’ve noticed that every time he does this, he never comes around to me. He rarely ever asks me how I’m going or wants to catch up on the progress I’m making with my work. The same thing happened last year, when I was in First Year, and I tried not to let it get to me too much. I talked to some of the Second and Third Years about it and they all said that sometimes forming a friendship with him when you’re in First Year can be a bit weird and difficult because he’s still scoping you out and getting to know you, but things change once you’re in Second Year. Even so, I noticed that he would talk to the other First Years but still wouldn’t really talk to me at all or take an interest in me.

I’m really not trying to brag, but I would consider myself a decent worker. I put my head down and do the work I need to do. I’m really dedicated to the course and want to make a good impression with everyone I meet. I get along really well with my peers.

But I’d be lying if I said that this whole thing didn’t really get to me. Why me? Why does Sam just ignore me every time he comes in? I thought we got along pretty well in the rare times that we have talked. The Second and Third Years had said good things about me to him so he knows I’m good. I don’t need constant attention and encouragement to get on with my work but I’ve found it’s really starting to affect my morale, how he never checks in on me. 

It bothers me even more that, when I’ve talked to other people about this, they say that he actually does like me and he has said good things about me and he apparently ‘thinks that I’m hilarious’. If he thinks all these things, why does he never pay me any attention? People have said that he never needs to worry about me because I just get on with it and do the work, but I still don’t really feel like that’s a good excuse. I have been feeling pretty stressed lately and there were definitely times last year when I felt really awful and definitely could have used some advice from him. 

I know all of this is sounding like I want his undivided attention and I need him to constantly check in on me and to tell me I’m doing a good job. But I swear, that is not what I want at all. I just really would appreciate it if, once in a while, he did ask how I’m doing and for it to actually seem like he cares about what I’m saying. 

It kind of seems like a problem with no solution to me. Some people have recommended I actually talk to him about it, but again, I don’t want to come across as an attention whore or anything. I just really wanted to get this off my chest and see if any of you guys had any thoughts on it or things you think I could do?",24Feb2020,1

459,"Hi reddit,

basically the title says it all.

Not looking for any excuses here - living near Cologne, Germany carnival was last weekend and it is kinda a big deal with everybody getting massively drunk and partying and I prolly fucked up.

After my girlfriend (relatively new, 1 month) made out with a girl in front of everyone - which was completely cool for me - drunk-me thought it would be okay to make out with same girl privately later that day. 

Now nothing more happened and we both went our ways and after some hours of making out, decided it was probably not a good idea pursuing anything further. We (gf and me) were invited to said girl's party 2 days after and she made the impression she does not want it to be a topic and decided to tell the girls that she barely remembers anything from that day. Probably dodged a bullet that night.

The thing is, the girl is moving 5 hours away on Wednesday for good and this was the farewell party. Apart from what happened, she is probably the best person in the world I've ever met, very caring, looking after her community, very active against racism and injustice publicly and on her way to becoming a lawyer for human rights.

Under normal circumstances I'd immediately take responsibility, tell my girlfriend and probably either break up or try to make things work. However, I am struggling because I feel coming clear would destroy the other girls entire relationship with her friends before moving away and she would lose her social circle emotionally in addition to physically losing touch. 

Is it really the right thing here to come clean or should I just break up using some excuse and let the other girl tell her, when she is ready? Should I do anything at all?",24Feb2020,1
460,"Basically title, but further details are required to better describe the situation.

My SO was assaulted by a person we trusted. My SO did not disclose this information with me immediately, which lead to a trauma in our relationship. My SO distanced themselves from me immediately after the assault, which is quite common for victims of assault. This lead to mistrust, to my SO feeling guilt over the whole incident, and to other issues I won't discuss here in details.

Thankfully, we are both at a much better state of mind now, but we need some time to rebuild and heal.

I won't go into details regarding the assault. I am not the victim here, and my SO has decided not to disclose much of that information with anybody.

I also don't want to mention this outright to my employer.

However, the past month I found it hard to concentrate at work, and now that I know the trauma that was caused to my SO, I also know they need me to spend some time together, healing. I, personally, have decided to see a therapist as well, at the very least to be in a state of mind in which I can focus on helping my SO heal instead of feeling confusion and anger and disgust (none at my SO).

For a variety of reasons I cannot take days off, not unless I make a very bad impression to my employers should I fail to provide an adequate reason. 

To make matters worse, just until recently my SO was also an employee at the same office, so the people here know her quite well.


Regardless of that, I would never want to mention that anything has happened to her. I don't want to use the traumatic experience of a person I love as an excuse for my absent-minded behavior or as a reason to take time off. At the same time, I do need to provide an adequate reason.

To put it shortly, I am stuck between a hammer and a hard place  really don't know how to handle that. 

**PS:**

• I, nor my SO, do not need advice on how to deal with such trauma. While I appreciate the effort, and I really do, I feel the only responsible course of action would be to seek the assistance of a specialist.

• We don't need legal advice. That includes employment law, as I do not live in the US (EU resident) and much of it would not he applicable. 

• My SO worked in the HR department, so that makes talking with HR that much more difficult. 

• I would sooner lose my job than mention anything has happened to my SO. They wish this whole assault remains private (no names mentioned here), and I will respect that wish to the end.",24Feb2020,1

462,"So I started college this year and unfortunately I am not doing well this semester. I think that I just haven't developed the maturity and self discipline to really succeed in college so I am trying to work a full time job for around a year before I go back to school. I haven't talked to my parents about anything yet because I am very anxious that they'll get super upset, so I want some outside perspective on my plan for the future just to make sure I am doing the right thing.

I am 19 right now and part of me worries that my parents will get so upset that they'll want me to move back in. My issue with that is I think living at home and having parents who basically do everything for me isn't healthy for my growth as an adult. I plan on going back to school in the future, but I think that I need to first get my own place and responsibilities so that I can force myself to mature. Do you guys think that would be fair?

I might take a gap year to gain some experience in volunteering and stuff but I’m really stuck at the moment.

464,"So I'll try my best to make this short, if you think I'm missing any details, just ask, I'll reply in the comments
#
Soo my family's in a bad condition, healthwise and all. I'm a 17 yo and my parents are Asians, the most stereotypical kind.
#
They get *REAALLLYYYY* stressed about my exams, specially the upcoming ones since these marks determine which University I get into
#
My parents are taking so much stress because of my exams, I feel guilty. And recently my dad, was told he'll be fired unless the company shows some better figures
#
And my dad has been working his ass off. I've never seen him this stressed about anything. He's lost 5kgs past 2-3weeks, and he is smoking a lottt more ciggs
#
My mom has been anxious this entire time about my studies and my dad's job. My mom was a little happy cause my sis got her first job in Singapore, like 2 months ago. 
#
And then there was coronavirus outbreak in Singapore. My sis has been showing symptoms, but nothing's been confirmed yet
#
When my mom heard this, it absolutely shattered her. Now, not only are my parents potentially losing a kid, stressing over exams I couldn't care less about and loosing a job. 
#
We also own 2 houses, but one of them was bought using a Home loan and the other was bought on EMI. If my dad loses his job, they'll lose both of the houses (eventually) 
#
And frankly all this doesn't put me in much danger, cause I can just jump off this sinking boat and start my own business (granted it's a little farfetched but I believe I can make it work) but it's killing me to see my parents like this
#
The psychological damage is affecting their physical health. My mom's backache has never been worse, her entire hand was so swollen that the upper part of her arm is entirelllyy purple. The docs have been prescribing her meds like crazy and she still isn't able to sleep at night cause of the pain
#
My dad is barely functional, he's not able to sleep for 4-5hrs, at night, his eyes have turned yellow and his diabetes symptoms have amplified (exactly what happened to 2 of my dad's brothers before they died, I'm guessing it's genetic)
#
And I'm just feeling so fucking helpless, I wanna help them however I can, but they're so fucking narrow-minded as well
#
Honestly, I've seen their decision making skills, an ape making random decisions would've been more successful. Whenever he was faced with a choice he chose whatever looked best in short term.
#
They've driven themselves to this point but I can't fucking bear to see them like this. I've tried to help them. I said I would get a part time job, if it would help, but they just don't see me as an individual. They think I'm not responsible enough to make decisions and maybe I'm not but they won't even let me try
#
I wanna explain to them that their narrow-minded was has driven them to this point and it'll only worsen unless they just open up their minds a little, but ofcourse, that might just hurt them even more.

So ive come here, to ask, what can I do, to help out my parents.

465,"So I’ve been friends with this specific person for over 3 years and she was my best friend. We did everything together and were basically joint to the hip for that period of time. I thought our friendship was very equal. Whenever I would pay for food, she had me the next time. If I drove her somewhere, she would do the same etc, etc. But recently we went out to the bar and I told her about this guy I was into for over 7 months. She knew how much I liked him (keep that in mind). And I’ve hung out with this guy several times and she knew him, so I thought she could help me out. She told me that he just broke up with girlfriend, so it was the perfect chance for me to shoot my shot. When we both get to the bar I saw him and gave him a hug, as I haven’t seen him in awhile and I back off as he had a girlfriend. Afterwards I was talking with some other friends I knew. And sooner than later, from about 10ft away I saw my best friend of 3 years making out with the guy I was absolutely obsessed over and wanted to date. He was everything I could ever want in a guy (keep in mind that I am extremely picky), and when I saw them together like that my heart shattered into a million pieces. I confronted her about it a few minutes later, and after making many excuses as to why she did it, she finally apologized. The next day I had to bring it up to her. She did not soberly apologize in the first place. At first I told her I needed space to think about what she did and to see where I wanted this friendship to go. I wanted to give her another chance, but I found out weeks later that she blocked me on Snapchat and removed me from a group chat. A few weeks after, I also find out she’s been telling people that we weren’t friends anymore. But she’s telling people it was mutual, when it clearly isn’t. And is probably telling people many other things that aren’t true.

I am a responsible person. I have a full time, well paying job, I am in school and I do my part around the house to keep things clean and nice. I have never been a trouble maker and I grew up being so afraid of punishment from my dad that I never had a social life growing up really. My curfew was 9pm until I was 18, and then changed to midnight. It still is midnight. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost 4 years and they don’t like him and are now threatening to make me pay rent if I “treat this house like a hotel” so much by spending time with him.

I also have wanted a small stud in my nose since I was 13 and have never been allowed to get it, I told them I was thinking about actually getting it done soon and they threatened to kick me out.

470,"This has been a consistent theme in my life. I grew up around, let's say the more shallow end of the gene pool, and was always treated like I'm mentally disabled, to the point of being enrolled in special ed for almost all of public school. I was the kid reading Caesar in Latin in special ed class. As an adult it's largely been the same. The more intelligent managers, coworkers, acquaintances, etc have been much more apt to treat me as a normal person while the lower the end of the scale someone is on the more likely they are to try to mooch from me and treat me as though I'm their inferior. I've especially seen this with beggars when I was homeless. They'll tell a sob story for a few dollars then openly brag to me that I'm a sucker and somehow just bought them their $20 baggy of meth with two dollar bills.

471,"I just started working in a group home for teen girls about a month ago, although it feels like 2 years already. The program they have here looks amazing on paper; a point based system in which they earn points for good behaviors and “stage up” once they reach their point goals. With each stage comes more freedom and privileges. If they engage in poor behavior (outlined in their manual) they lose points and stage down. 

Reading through old log books, I’ve noticed that this system used to work pretty well for most kids. It seems like the problems arose about 6 months ago when administration made the decision to give them their cell phones at stage 4 when it used to be stage 8 (which takes about 6 months to get to and by then, they have been proven responsible and it really seemed to work).

What I’ve gathered is that once they have a phone at stage 4, they think they’re good. The kids happy they have their phone because that’s all they’ve wanted all along and now they have nothing left to work towards (in their eyes). So, they abandon all efforts of staying in program, refuse to hand their phone in at night which they are supposed to do, use it to contact friends and people on the outside and AWOL for sometimes days at a time. This is a non-restraint facility so you cannot take it out of their hands. The only way you can take it is if they put it down and that rarely happens. They even sleep with it in their bed and since i work overnights by myself, I’ll be damned if I’m taking someone’s phone and opening myself up to possible violence. 

Basically by having their phone so early in program, the system has collapsed. Consequences don’t mean anything to them because they have all dropped down to stage one with zero points and have lost all privileges which means no visits, no rec, no tv. They sit in the house all day on their phones, refuse to go to school or learning center, refuse work crew and legally we can’t do ANYthing! Yes, their social workers are aware. All upper management is aware. 

This has created a chaotic spiral of non-compliance. They continually try and sleep in bed with each other which is so frustrating because i have to sit outside their room and monitor them the entire night and document everything. We can’t drag them out of the room, so there they stay. They are doing whatever they want whenever they want and it’s infuriating. I do not know what to do! I believe administration has made a mistake with this new phone policy and are trying to fix it. That is out of my hands. What can I do as a staff member? Any advice? Please keep in mind, I’ve only been here a month and work overnights so I do not have a firm relationship with these girls yet.

problem is it affected me in a way i was not expecting to. i started to miss her like hell, that morning message, that laugh in the middle of the day, etc. what before was a '' why are you laughing for your phone like you're in love? '' from my co-workers now its a '' where were you?? '' from my friends when i leave the dance floor in a club to go cry in the bathroom.

so, since my life it's pretty much a big hole of shit atm, what can i do to make it better?

being occupied is not the problem, i go to the gym, i went out with some friends last Friday, i play my guitar, i try a whole bunch of stuff to take my head off the situation, but when i'm distracted these thoughts come back and i start feeling like shit again.

479,"some quick background: i’m 18. i moved in with these people near the end of may 2019 right after i graduated highschool. prior to that i lived under my father and stepmother in a different side of the country. just for context the reason i moved out so soon is because both of them were hardly ever home and treated me like a ghost when they were. this affected me a lot and also rubbed salt in a wound my father had already created before that when he abandoned me and my sister for awhile not very long after my mother died. (this is relevant to the actual situation i promise.) i met these people online a few years ago when i was 15 and we've been close since then, although we've had quite a lot of falling outs for just the few years we've known each other and because of that i'm closer to who i'll call Lala (F22) and i'm not really as close to who i'll call Nina (F25) and we never have been all that close. Lala and Nina also met way before me, and they've been joined at the hip friends for almost 8 years now.

so anyway, when i first moved in with these people, there were always little spats here and there but this was happening even before i moved in and it was mostly smooth sailing living together. we were living in a small studio apartment for about a month or so before they could afford a two bedroom with my third income.

anyway, everything is mostly great in the new place. we still fight often of course but nothing we couldn't work out at some point. honestly, things didn't start REALLY hitting the shitter until Nina suddenly started treating me like utter garbage. (i later came to find out this all was because of some guy she was mad at who i’d dated about a year ago and took it out on me... but like i said... a year ago...) she was doing things like not talking to me and only snapping at me pretty harshly when she would, talking over me and not even really looking at me or acknowledging my existence, and only really talking to Lala. there was never any room for me anywhere during this time and i was always being excluded, always hearing them laughing in their room or hearing Nina go into the living room shortly after i leave to my room. the reason this was so hurtful to me personally is because that kind of thing was pretty much the same situation i had just recently tried escaping from. this entire thing has been the source of a lot of stress and arguments, and because it still happens quite often even though it’s mostly blown over, it’s still a really big issue. mostly for Lala and i because i only really open up to her about my feelings.

okay so let me rewind a little now, it's august 2019, so about a month after this whole Nina treating me like an insect thing started. two of my coworkers got in a motorcycle accident. one survived and one didn't. (this becomes relevant again later). something about my workplace is that we have an extremely tight knit culture. everyone knows everyone and we're very much involved in each other's lives, so this coworker's death hit all of us really really deeply. it was basically like losing a big brother for me. he'd offered to take me shopping for clothes because he felt bad that i came here with very little and he was always inviting me with his friends even though i was very shy. my coworker that survived was also close to me, so for her to escape death literally by the skin of her teeth shook me up pretty badly too. the day that we all found out, me, my coworker, and one of our managers went to visit our surviving friend in the hospital, which was really emotionally painful. after we left, the three of us organized a small get together for anyone that wanted to come so we could all be with each other that night and mourn together.

except... Lala was fighting with me the whole entire day.

the reason why is because at the time i didnt have cell service and could really only text or call when connected to wifi. but as i said, most of the day i was out and about. so Lala was incredibly upset with me that i kept going hours without replying, and it came to a head when i was at the gathering and went even longer without replying. when i got home that night, both my roommates were in the living room watching tv, and no one said hi or even looked my way. not even a flinch. i was upset but i just went to my room and locked the door. i can't remember how or why, but later that night Lala and i got into a fight in my room. she was mad at me for not communicating with her all day. she even said that Nina was mad at me for not replying to her text trying to be there for me, so i felt like i was just being bombarded. but at one point, Lala said to me ""he wasn't even your friend, HE WAS JUST A FUCKING COWORKER!!!"" i immediately dropped whatever it is we were fighting about and told her to get out of my room. she backtracked but i wasn't even hearing her anymore, i just wanted to be left alone. but she would not let up. she kept trying to backtrack, saying she didnt mean it in that way and this and that, so i eventually opened my door and loudly told her to get the fuck out. their room and mine is only separated by a wall, so it must have woken up Nina, who then opened her door and said ""whatever it is, it is NOT that serious."" i felt like slapping her, but whatever. at that point, Lala finally left (because of course she would if its bothering Nina. and yes this entire thing becomes relevant i promise.)

fast forward to the present. two nights ago, i came home late at night after having a really bad day at work. on top of this, i had a deep conversation on the train home with the coworker who survived the accident about Brandon, the one who died. she cried really hard and told me really graphic things i'd never heard before about what she saw and experienced that night, and about how much she misses him. this conversation most definitely had to happen for her sake, but it still left me in a dark place that night. and when i got home... my roommates were there, watching tv, no one looked up or said anything. i figured it was because Nina had gotten into a fight with us earlier that day, but her and Lala were totally fine, laughing and chatting and watching movies together. in that moment, being angry at me was so much more important to Nina than me as a person. she also never said a single thing to me the entire night, didn't look at me, nothing, even though i was in the living room with them for hours. and this is FAR from the first time this has happened.

after i went to my room, i opened up to Lala about how horrible i felt, but she for some reason kept making it sound like i was lashing out at her (?) and i was getting unreasonably mad at her, even though i thought i was pretty clear about being angry with Nina's actions, not hers. this somehow explodes into a fight about how i dont care about Lala, i dont care about how i treat her and talk to her, i take advantage of her, just all these horrible things that i apparently had no idea i was even doing. i started crying pretty loudly in my room and she told me i was making her feel like the villain and i would hate her for making it about herself. i just wanted to stop fighting, so i pretty much just went with everything she said and apologized as much as i could. she didnt let up until a few hours later, and then she went to sleep. i cut my arms and wrote on my wall with the blood and i was just sobbing quietly. after the meltdown passed i panicked and scrubbed my walls clean and afterwards i think i just passed out from exhaustion. so after that night ive been keeping my distance. 

so a few hours ago, i was taking a shower and playing music. Lala opens the door and asks me to turn it down, but the only reason i even took a shower right then was specifically because they had paused their movie to continue their laundry so i figured it was the best time. i didnt think theyd be done so soon, so i just got kind of upset and i impulsively set my phone down kind of curtly and when she said why im doing this to her and this and that, i just kept saying ""please close the door."" now shes saying shes never forgiving me for this and that im an absolutely horrible friend to her. the reason for this is because her family told her her grandfather passed away and she probably just didnt want to have anything else to deal with, which was reasonable, and i do feel bad for not being calmer. but to be completely honest, at the risk of sounding like the worst person alive, i really do feel like this is karma for her. its almost the exact same situation she put me through when Brandon died, except i didn't have anyone to go to, and i didn't have anyone's arms i could return to. all i had was my cold, lonely room, and absolutely no one who was on my side.

so... yeah. i really need advice. im on a lease with these people until january 2021 and i have no family to stay with, most of my friends are adults with spouses or kids who probably dont want some weird 18 year old girl sleeping on their couch, and i dont make anywhere near enough money to afford breaking the lease. i do have a therapist, but i'd have to uber to and from each time because Lala was the one who used to drive me there.

TLDR: i moved in with close friends, fighting has become a norm in our household. they exclude me often and don't acknowledge my existence which is something i just tried escaping from with my father and stepmother. but the fights have gotten so nasty and more frequent that i really don't know how much longer i can handle it. they don't seem to care about me at all, even when it comes to people in my life dying.

i'm lost. i really don't know what to do anymore. someone please help me.",24Feb2020,1
480,"Bit of context to start off with. I'm 21 and working part-time (25-30hours/week) at a coffee chain that's local to my state. I'm a front of house team member and am a competent and conscientious worker.  have been clinically diagnosed with PTSD and depression.  

The power hierarchy at my work goes supervisor, assistant manager, cafe manager then head office. The problem lies with my cafe manager. She abuses her power to bully employees and force people out. She is in cahoots with HR who always side with her as my regional HR person is her friend. Recently I have become a target of her bullying. 

She has been underhandedly been watching me too catch me making minor mistakes and then later levying disciplinaries at me. The disciplinary process goes verbal warning, written warning 1, written warning 2 and then fired. She is currently trying to give me a written warning for unsatisfactory performance based on lies and manipulated information. 

These false claims she's making involve slowness (I work my ass off), needing to be prompted and chatting too much. I have done none of these things except being prompted however her prompting was unnecessary as I was already on top of what she was prompting me to do (clear tables). 

I have the assistant manager and two supervisors as witness to my satisfactory performance. 

I now have to take the case to HR, I'm with the union so I'll be going through them and I've been documenting all events and meetings involving my cafe manager. The problem is, is that it is taking a toll on my mental health. 

I am not sleeping, having panic attacks, excessive anxiety and stress. It is making me depressed and I am relying heavily on my clonazepam script which in normal circumstances I barely use. I just need some advice/reassurance on what to do. I feel like I'm losing this battle and that my job and livelihood are in danger because of this vindictive manager. I never cry but have been in tears on 3 occasions in the past week. I'm second-guessing myself and struggling to understand the situation fully. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if I left important details out, I'm very drained.

TL:DR  
Cafe manager bullying me with false accusations of poor performance, it's making me miserable.",24Feb2020,1

482,"Hello, I’m trying to get as many opinions as possible on a concern of mine and I thought some internet advice could be somehow useful.
First of all, I’m not and was not a very well made individual to begin with. I stand at 1.85 and 65 kilos and I’ve been like this for the past ~5 years. 
I’m currently senior year at college and I’ve got a full time job since last summer. I had to accommodate with the working hours (9-5, usual corporate stuff) and since then people started to tell me I’ve gotten skinnier. At first I was concerned, but I asked people around and they didn’t notice any changes. I must say that my diet has not changed, I’m that type of guy that can eat anything and doesn’t gain weight. 

I really started to get concerned last week when I randomly decided to read my weight and indeed I saw that I lost 3 kilos. What is the cause of this problem? I must add a note that I’ve had some pretty stressful months at college and work at the same time but they passed. What could cause this change, is it a metabolism change, is it because I left my comfort zone ?

Thank you!",24Feb2020,1

Movies like Midsommar, Hereditary, The Babadook, ect. They don't bother me at all during the day but as soon as it starts getting dark they begin to bother me pretty badly. I guess you could say I'm pretty freaked out by the dark and always sleep with a light on unless I'm not alone (GF sleeping with me or at a sleepover with friends or something). Ever since I was young it's freaked me out but when I was younger I always figured it would be something that I grow out of but I never have. It's to the point that I don't really like to sleep so I'll usually be up all night and when I do sleep I have to have the blankets all the way up to my head and with one of my arms over my head kinda covering my eyes. Like I said I know that's not watching scary movies/playing scary games would probably help but they're my favorite kind and nothing else interests me like them. Hearing any kind of sound while trying to sleep that I can't immediately identify freaks me out pretty bad and it's to the point that it gets my heart beating if I'm in the house alone when it's dark. I don't know if it's a fear of the dark or something else, but if anybody could help me understand why I get scared of stuff so much easier than other people or if anyone has this sort of thing happen to and knows how to make it better would be greatly appreciated.

I hated myself a lot and when my ex and I broke up I went through a major depressive period where I didn’t eat for days at a time, I felt physically nauseous after two bites. Of course it got better and I’m now living in a wonderful house with my roommates (21F)(31M). 
During the time I wasn’t eating I noticed I started losing weight and actually looking better and healthier again.

I’ve been drinking lots of water and my skin has never looked healthier! I’m already down 61 pounds and I absolutely am falling in love with my body again!

She was talking about how she struggled with anorexia for a long time and it really messed her up and all of this stuff.

494,"I'm a 19 year old who recently finished highschool and do not really intend to go to college, I am working on a forklift in a warehouse but am planning to quit in few weeks. The story is that my parents had some debts they had to pay and I helped them out a lot . Since there are no more debts and we are moving to a new place with a nice yard and we are finally at peace, my father is not ill anymore and my mother found a good job. The thing is that I do not really care of having a lot of money or good career, I just want to be happy with what I have, And all I wanted is now released, I bought myself nice drums and a Double Bass pedal that I always wanted and I can finally focus more on music. All my life I have been focusing on music and just enjoying and playing all day long. I know that there are a lot of starving artists in the world, trying their best to live with what they love. I know a lot of difficulties that musicians face in their lives, I had a 1 year pause from playing music because I had to sell my instruments so that my family can pay out debts that back then were still not paid in full that's why I worked at a company.

My question to anyone that is reading this is... Am I able to live with only music, since that is the only thing I feel I can do. I love when people are enjoying music that me and my band play, just seeing the happiness in the crowd makes me happy to. We never really made much money from playing, I was in highschool still and a lot of people didn't even wanna add as to the list for playing on the weekend.

Like I said I am not trying to make a lot of money or anything I just wanna live happily and play music till I die. Since I was a little kid til now I had a really happy life, never really focused much on stuff that will bring me a lot of money. All I cared for to just be happy with what I have and to just do what I love. Every single day I talk to people that most of the time just talk about finding a better paying job or getting promoted, with current job that I have it paid a lot of bills and even got me new drums and there is a lot extra money to spend but now that everything is paid and there is nothing more to worry about (that is financial) I can finally focus only on music. When I stop working in a company I will invest even more time in playing music. But I think this is already long and you get the point.

Like I already asked, Is there any way that in this day and age I can live solely on music because a lot of people are discouraging me and they all want me or just tell me to do what they do and that is to pursue a career that will get me a lot of money.",24Feb2020,1

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a copy and paste from the post I put on Relationship Advice.. did not get any replies on there.

&amp;#x200B;

Will refer to friend 24F as ""K"".

A little back story: nearly a year ago, I had a crush on K after getting to know her a bit. I ended up telling her how I felt but was rejected. K told me that she didn't have the same feelings for me. So I thought, OK, i'll just try to move on the best I can. It was really difficult at first because the feelings I had for her were a lot stronger than I let on. But I got over it eventually. I told her we can still be friends. Everything seemed OK and we were cordial with each other whenever we saw one another (which was at least a couple of times a month because we are part of the same friends group with many mutual friends). Generally had small talk and some conversation. I kind of hoped for a long time that she would change her mind, but hey.. what to do. I got the impression at times that maybe she is interested, but did not bother to ask her out again because clearly i read all the ""signs"" wrong the first time. But anyway... I got over it and I consider K a friend now.

Now: I started dating another girl about a month ago and K found out about it quite early on because we are part of the same friends group (she is quite close to the girl I am seeing). But since I started seeing this oher girl, it seems like K is avoiding me and generally seems very distant. For example, I have not had a conversation with her for a month even though i've seen her a few times and I have to initiate any form of contact otherwise we may not speak at all when we see each other. In general, it just seems like she is avoiding me and it feels a bit off. To top it all off, I think she has blocked me on WhatsApp! (although I don't know if theres a surefire way to check).

So.. what I wanted to ask was: What the hell do I do? Do I just approach her directly and ask what the hell is up? How do I word it? It's awkward and I'm not good at these things. Do I just forget about her and forget the idea of remaining friends with her? I'm not sure I can do that. I just want to know what is up..",24Feb2020,1
498,"Buckle your seatbelt folks for this is a long one.

I’m a 17 year old female who wants to be a model. My mom was a model before and I want to follow her footsteps. But there are two big problems:

1. I’m not pretty and my body isn’t the best looking one
2. I don’t have experience and is very shy

So I’m trying/planning to solve number 2 by enrolling in a workshop this summer. The only problem is is that, as mentioned above, I’m very shy and honestly don’t have that much confidence and I got a peak of my future classmates and they are GORGEOUS and I feel VERY out of place. You have girls with boobs and a butt with thin noses walking around the place as if they own it. Like their confidence is something i definitely do not have. And since I’m pretty young and most of them are around there 20s, I’m not sure if I will get along well with them.

And that’s a bit of background so here’s the real question, should I still pursue being a model? If I get anxious already at just a workshop what more agency’s or runways? Will I really make it?
Should I still try?

I’m sort of aiming to become a TVC model first THEN a runaway one but man are my facial expressions horrible. Just to clarify, I genuinely do what to become a model in case any of you were wondering.

I just notice this Saturday night/Sunday morning, someone has been banging on my walls and windows, and I even saw a silhouette before. I originally thought it was just a animal but I live by broadway, and the only animals here are either bears or deers. Also bears are usually further up and don’t come down by these houses. Also I don’t think it’s my neighbor since most I know, and are either family or friends with. The house closest to the window is occupied by a old man, I doubt it’s him. But the silhouette I saw was at around 6 ft and had very broad shoulders. So it’s either a bear or a person. Also I have people try to break inside the house before, someone was trying to barge inside through the back door and was repeatedly hitting my sister windows.

507,"Hi reddit, first time posting on here (using an alt account for reasons that will later become obvious)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a high school junior and I joined school this year. I switched from another school in the same city, so naturally i'm still friends with most of my old school friends.

One of the members of my  friend group used to have some obsession with ""exposing"" me. He would, out of nowhere, spam our group chat with stuff that accused me of stuff I had never done. It was the same thing every time - he'd make baseless accusations on the group chat, we'd argue for about an hour, and he'd apologize. I'm not sure  where his obsession came from, but he just won't give up on trying to oust me, and he took it to a whole new level a few days ago.

He, as usual, posted some stuff on the group chat. Among the things he accused me of doing were  
 \- dating a girl I had never dated  
 \- cheating on the girl that I never dated  
 \- sexually assaulting a girl in my school  


and the list goes on. What's odd to me is a lot of the stuff he said had a certain amount of truth to it - for example, he accused me off hooking up with my ex on tuesday. Although we *didn't*, we did hang out on tuesday. It's weird, because we were on bad terms for a long time... for him to throw that at me out of the blue was really weird. Additionally, the girl he accused me of assaulting, we did actually get together, but it was purely consensual - we're still good friends.

He claims to have ""7 sources"" in my school that have all corroborated with the above but refuses to give me any names, to ""protect their privacy"". I believe that he has a source, because there's a smudge of truth to the things he says - they're just wildly exaggerated and twisted - I just think the source is a fucking liar. The issue is, my friends (although I love them) are fucking idiots when it comes to this stuff and believe him because he's got numbers. Even when I texted the girl i ""dated"" and got her to confirm that we never dated, he replied with ""you probably got her to lie for you"".

It seems like he refuses to take any proof I throw at him, and is hellbent on making me lose my friends.

Any advice? I'm not really sure how to go about any of this.

509,So I've considered getting a tattoo for years. My 22 year old roommate got one. I'm 27. I have thought hard about what I want and where. I want the eye of agamotto from doctor strange since he's my favorite hero and I think it would be a wicked awesome tattoo. I want it on my left forearm basically wrist. That's where my roommate got hers. I want it colored. My mom got one on her ankle and I'm sure it hurt. I've heard forearm is the least painful spot. I just wanna know how to get through it without having to stop or cry lol. I don't tolerate pain that well. What can i do prepare mentally and physically when i decide to get it?,24Feb2020,1

I am now 3rd year into the school and we're not talking because I really got fed up with her using me as a confidence boost so I cut her off, at 1st she thought it strange and was trying to talk to me. I would cut her off tell her get lost or smthin like that.
She was getting awfully close... Is still doing that crap getting too close in with the guys in my class. Would massage one on the back.

Dont get me wrong in my class I am probably the most dominant one.

So what do you  think I should do about this situation, i cant help it but sometimes look at her...
Should I do something or just do nothing and ignore her?

512,"So i had this friend-group, we would always go out together to new places and have fun. We were basically best friends and did pretty much everything together. Things between us all started getting shitty when one of them got a boyfriend and nobody liked him. 

Ever since then we have been on and off with this one girl. Her whole attitude changed and she would always find a reason to be pissed off at one of us. Before she use to be very laid-back and kind.  For almost the past year, we have been having fall-outs but it would be because of her. The other person broke up with their boyfriend and shes still been acting like this.

Last month she asked me if i wanted to go out clubbing with her and sleep round her house, i said i couldn’t sleep around her house but i can go out with her. She just said “whatever”. Later on that night i put an anonymous messaging thing on my snapchat story and went to sleep. I woke up in the morning snd i had received comments who was obviously from her saying “You’re fucking boring, like your skinny”, “were not in Africa, why you so skinny”, “your mother rules your life”. 

I messaged her asking why she had said those things and she ignored me so i just blocked her. I didn’t speak to her for over a month until she called me the other night saying how shes sorry and she was just disappointed. She kept on saying how much she missed me and tried to have a normal conversation with me afterwards. I just said okay but i didn’t exactly forgive after what she had said and body shamed me.

I think I was handling the break up pretty well up until this point because I had just been suppressing my thoughts but now it’s hitting me like a truck.

516,"I’ll tell you a little story. A week ago I was attending a class at uni, I study in London and I’m 23, and during the class I make a comment on what the lecturer had said quoting the tv show, black mirror. This girl sitting 3 seats from my right turns to me and says “talking about black mirror, did you know that the creator graduated from this uni?”. I didn’t know, and I said “wow that’s really cool”, and we talked a bit.


Everything normal right? 

Yeah.


She tells me that the school has organised a ‘retreat’ kind of thing up the valley and that she was going. I told her right away YES. Of course I’m going. 

You see, that, no joking, was my first social interaction during the whole 3rd year that I’m currently attending. 


I am incapable of talking to people, make friends, talk to a girl, anything.


You might be wondering why I told you about the trip story. Funny you should ask. 

See, in this exact moment I’m sitting outside in the cold, with a crappy coffee in my hands and my bag on my lap. I’m sitting here alone, about 50m from where the bus that was supposed to take us on the trip just left.

No, i didn’t miss it. I was here. I got here with my bag and all my good intentions and then I saw this giant group of people knowing each other, hugging when meeting in the morning, talking to each other, laughing. I couldn’t spot the girl, so I didn’t know any of them. I got scared, I got very scared. I couldn’t approach. 

I stayed away, hiding with my coffee behind a car with the excuse that I was deciding if I should go until they finally left.


And now I’m here. Another chance lost another day alone where I’m going to go home and watch tv shows. 

I want to meet people. But I can’t. 

I know for a fact that there must be a method. To increase my likelihood to make friends, I just can’t find it.


I’m not at all a boring guy. I’m not a sad little creep. Actually, quite the opposite. I thrive with people around me. I’m that guy. I’m the guy that makes a fool of himself and makes everybody laugh with sarcasm usually directed and someone in particular. In a group of people I know. I usually come out on top, as the best. 


I’ve had 2 long relationship in my life and that is exactly how they happened. I was out with a group of friends, plus people I didn’t know (but I was safe because I had people I knew with me), and I made myself memorable to the girl.


I don’t know how to defeat myself. It’s like there is this part of me, of my personality, that doesn’t want to meet anyone new and is the villain of this story. And then there is part, which is a lot bigger, that is longing for more human connection and wants to have many new friends. The villain is winning guys.


So now I’m going home, and I’ll probably find an excuse with my roommate on why I didn’t go on the trip. 

Yes, I have a room mate. No he can’t introduce me to new people. Why. I’m so glad you asked.

He’s been my long time friend from when we where in middle school. He came here to London with me, and he’s leaving in exactly 10 days. Going back. Done. Over. 

Great.

522,"I just got off from another fight with them and decided to block them online for a little bit to get some peace. For a little background, I've been friends with them for about 4 years now. It's only a year ago that we've gotten really close. I've known about them suffering from depression so I decided to help them. That's when we got close. They were super suicidal at the time and I decided that I would actually do something meaningful for once and help them. I guess it worked cuz they kept telling me I saved them. It seemed like happy times from there but it gradually turned for the worse. At some point, I became exhausted and they seemed to get even more depressed. I was getting busier at the time and they really wanted my time and attention. It got to a point where they told me they were gonna kill themselves if I kept ignoring them and not doing anything about what I've done to them. I guess I acted really apathetically and tired just until a few months ago. Along the way, I've definitely made my fair share of mistakes. I dunno when it happened but we started fighting more. They are sometimes physically violent.  We keep bringing each other down every time.  They keep trying to get all of my time and attention and get really upset when they don't get it. I won't lie and say I'm innocent in this one. I ghost them and ignore them and verbally and emotionally abuse them. I just can't seem to keep my cool and I keep acting selfishly when they actually need me. They say I'm their world and they only reason they're alive and I have no reason to believe otherwise. They say when I leave they might just kill themselves. Honestly, I don't wanna leave. I just want to fix it but sometimes it's just way too much. Over the past week, it seemed to get better and better. The days seemed to be becoming less hostile and happier. We both seemed to be improving. It was actually nice and fun but we just got into another fight. And of all things, it was about me buying water because I was thirsty instead of going home from school early. In this one, they became physically violent again and I just can't seem to make them happy sometimes.

524,"This is embarrassing, but here it goes. 

I have talked to this girl on a dating app for a whole week. Today we exchanged google hangout and she asks if I want to video chat. I said fine. The conversation was ok at the beginning, but then it gets sexual, and she started to play with herself in front of the camera.

At one point, the video dropped and she said the following

&gt;ok then I dont need any explanation. i have recorded our whole video call and gather all info about you, your friends and all people knows you. Do you want me to spread this video worldwide all over the internet ? want an example ?

Then she posted a list of names from my email contact and threaten me that she would post the video of me watching her play with herself to all of my contacts. (I have no idea how she got those names)

I blocked her immediately on google hangout and the dating app.

However, right before I blocked her. she said

&gt;Ok, you can block me on hangout, and on the dating app, but you can't stop me and my company. I am one click away from uploading your video. Talk to me if you want me to stop spreading the video

Now I can't hear anything from this person anymore since I blocked and reported her on everything. I am assuming If I didn't, she/he would just ask for money. Not gonna lie, I am a little scared.

526,"Just like the title says I (25m) met this really awesome woman (22f) a few months back and we really hit it off, there was an immediate connection and I was ecstatic. 

This would be my first real relationship since my ex whom i was almost married to about 2 years back. I spent most of those two years working on myself and figuring out who I am as a single and not part of a couple, and after the first few months of being depressed I was actually having some fun. Until the loneliness kicked in. 

I didn’t really go out looking for something to happen but I happened to meet my now girlfriend. We have a lot in common, we’re both secret nerds, have a love of architecture, same taste in music, sense of humour, going to fairs and can be our goofy selves around each other. 

I just don’t see a future with her. I came to this realization at the end of January. At first I just noticed she liked to argue a bit, not angry arguing more like she feels the need to play devils advocate on everything, and I do mean everything. Even when I agree with her she will argue. I’ve noticed that she is much more of a big city person where I’m a small town guy (I’ve been to Toronto once in the last year where she’s gone and invited me 5 or six times since we started dating) Don’t get me wrong, my friends are all bigger city people but I get the feeling that my girlfriend eventually wants to live in a Toronto or Vancouver or New York where I’d be happy living outside of a town on a larger lot where my nearest neighbours are a stones throw away. 

The issue is I’ve been getting ready to tell her I think we should either stop being a couple and as I was putting together in my head what I wanted to say I started tearing up. The thought of never seeing her is horrible, even though I know we aren’t right for each other. 

I guess I’m hoping for some advice on how to either tell her we’d be better as friends or if that can’t happen how to hold myself together long enough to go through with it",24Feb2020,1

I finally found out that I will need surgery on my foot and will be unable to put pressure on my foot for at least 8 weeks, then I will be moved to crutches and a boot for about 6 weeks and then going through an extensive rehab process that could take up to a year to get me to walk properly and possibly include another surgery somewhere in that timeline.

544,"Some context:
I’m good friends with 3 people on Discord. I live in the Philippines and they live in Australia. 

I’ll refer to them as Killer, Kermit, and Raven for reasons. Kermit and Raven are best friends and know each other in real life. Killer is a lighthearted type of guy, but he told me privately that he’s an alcoholic and suicidal.

Around a month ago, Raven and Killer started dating. The two of them were quite happy together. It was probably the only time I heard Killer be happy. They planned to meet up last week but they broke up on that day. Raven told me that it was because her mom wouldn’t allow her to date someone she didn’t know. Killer told me that he responded to that by getting drunk. Later, he became sober and told me that he planned never to date anyone again because no matter how much he loved someone, he felt that he wouldn’t be loved back the same way he does. He also said that even though he still loved her, he was better off alone because he would’ve just been a burden to her. 

A few days after they broke up (which is today), Raven confessed to having feelings for Kermit, and the two are probably gonna start dating tomorrow or some shit. I told Killer about via DMs and he told me about how he doesn’t care anymore. He said that there’s no one who cares about him anymore since his dog died and his best friend died on the way to pick him up after Killer told him that he was upset about the breakup. He said that Raven didn’t care about him anymore since she liked Kermit. Last thing he told me before going offline is that he was gonna commit suicide after his little sister graduates Grade 6, which is a few years from now.

I think I’m one of the very few people who can save him, but I don’t know what to do. I’m no therapist or psychologist. I don’t want him to die.

549,"What's up everyone? I'm Ben and I live in Germany. I have severe depression and other stuff like that among suicidal thoughts. I am 23 years old, never been to college but I am planning on starting to study math for economics this summer semester. I don't have too much money and my family is rather hurting financially, both of my parents are in pretty bad debt.

Currently I feel completely ruined mentally and physically as I have been for the past \~2 years. I tried medication and I've tried therapy and my condition is only getting worse. I don't think I could work currently or even study what I planned on studying, I think I am sort of intelligent and a good person so it feels like a shame to go down this path and end up giving up on life, I have been looking for solutions and reasons to live for the past many years and found pretty much nothing.

Pretty much every time I fight and manage to be vulnerable I end up hurt by it, can I do anything rather than just die? because I don't think I can last with my money that long, and even if I could, I can't study effectively like this. 

I appreciate whoever replies, though what I have learned in the past few years is that no one has any good solution for my situation, other than telling me not to give up and stay positive which is much easier said than done after so many failures and heartbreak in life.

Anyway I wish you all an amazing life and hopefully other people feel much better than me and actually enjoy themselves in this world.",24Feb2020,1

551,"I have weird feet and basically I get extreme pain after standing for more than like 10 minutes and when being on my feet for more than a couple hours.

My job requires both these things but I was allowed to sit down for work. Now, they've suddenly decided I can't anymore and I'm terrified. It's been one day and after being at work for 3 hours I am in so much pain and struggling to stand yet I have to. They won't take me seriously, in fact noone does.

I need some serious advice. I am going to try look at getting my feet seen too professionally but money and time are an issue at the moment. If I quit my job I am scared I won't find a new one where my feet aren't a problem.

Is there any sort of disability or anything where I could go part time maybe with a bit of help?

Thanks for any advice x",24Feb2020,1
552,"I feel as though almost all my interactions with people professionally &amp; in my personal life have some sort of want or need. I’m never asked how I’m doing &amp; I have no one to confine in with my issues. I’m always working. Literally. Always. I’m 26 and for the past 5 years it’s been none stop for me. I’ve become semi-successful in the process but I’m questioning if it’s even worth it.

It’s to the point that I don’t feel like my own needs are even met. I barely sleep anymore. 

I feel like I want to just take a two month break and do nothing and be around no one. 

I know this is probably stupid to be asking but..

Is this normal and what can I do about it?",24Feb2020,1
553,"I'm not scared to get a tattoo, I've had one before, I actually find it quite relaxing, the thing that is making me nervous is the design and how I can convey it to my artist.

A bit of background: I went in for a consult a month ago, I'm having a wave covered up, so we discussed it would need to be bigger etc, I asked for the specific flower I want, however, in the past week I've decided I want to add more flowers, different ones, and I have a design I like in mind, so I emailed the studio and was asked to come in for another consult - I couldn't due to work, however, so I couldn't, therefore I'm unable to discuss the changed and my idea. This artist, I LOVE her work and it takes months and months to get an appointment.

My tattoo is Wednesday morning, my artist is lovely but her demeanour is mellow, when she speaks it sounds like she doesn't give a hoot, which I know is just her, she does give a hoot, shes lovely it's just her voice etc.

I'm feeling anxious and scared that when she shows me what she already has I'm basically going to change the entire thing, since she doesn't know what flowers I want, how many, etc, she doesn't send designs out anyway before the actual day, so I'm already eating into time and I feel so so, bad. I'm scared I won't like it, it's more complex since it is a coverup, I know it's my tattoo and it's for like, but my personality is very reserved and I find it hard to speak up and stuff. idk.

Any advice, please?",24Feb2020,1
554,"to be brief, i need to move out of my mom’s house. if you want the details you can check my posts from yesterday, but I need to move out. my mom is completely against this and says I need to wait at least two months, but waiting that long is just going to effect me harder (I can’t get a job until I move out since thered he no reason to start one now, so i’d be losing money waiting, and a big perk of where i’m moving would be getting to see my friends since i never get to see them since i live so far away. where id be moving puts me 30 minutes from most friends/living with them, compared to 70 minutes). she wants me to stay because it’s what she wants, but I refuse to.

my plan is to hopefully move out this weekend. she’s not going to let me without a fight. what is the best way to get my things without her interfering? my grandparents and boyfriend will be helping me get my things, but my mom (and her bf) will be there too because I’ll have to wait for the weekend to be able to move. is there anything I can do to make sure she can’t force me to stay?",24Feb2020,1

556,"I have known my friend for the better part of 25 years. He was in a situation a few years ago that put him in a position where he had no home. I have offered my place for him till he can find some place better but he is not looking and has no motivation to. He is a slob, never showers, hardly changes cloths, and gives me all sort of attitude when ever I try and be an authoritative figure. At the end of the day, he makes it so I don't want to be in my own home anymore, he unnecessarily adds to my stress/anxieties/depression, and I need him out. No matter what I say to him, I know he will go completely defensive and won't accept any answer as to ""why"" short of me selling the house and even then he won't leave until the absolute last minute.

557,"Hey guys,
So I’m going to start with a little backstory here. I’ve known this guy for a long time, a few years. Recently, we’ve agreed to become friends with benefits after a breakup with my ex. After a few months we’ve became extremely close. I’ve tried breaking it off multiple times because I’ve become attached but always fall back into it. We’re good friends and hang out often. 
I’ve brought it up that I’m falling and I’m met with ‘I dont really want a relationship right now.’ And it’s tearing me apart inside. 
I’m not sure whether to bring it up, or distance myself, or drop him completely.
If I do try to talk to him about it I honestly have no idea what to even say without coming off crazy. I don’t want to lose him as we’re good friends along with the benefits. 
Help?",24Feb2020,1
558,"Firstly I’m on mobile so sorry for any mistakes in advance! So from the first day we moved in, I knew this guy was going to be a problem.  We share a parking lot that can fit about 5 cars comfortably max. We hadn’t even finished moving stuff in from my girlfriend’s pick-up truck (she has underground parking at university campus so doesn’t actually park at house), when he starts complaining and ordering us around about where to park. There were a couple other pointless times where he would order me or whoever to clean up things in the back lot (one morning literally blocked my car in).

So about a month ago he was doing work on his house and had another car parked in the lot. And he parked crooked into my roommates parking space (we’ve been parking in the same spots since day 1 of lease). So my roommate parked his car in his spot which ended up being VERY close to the landlord’s car. He went inside and got stoned (it’s legal here). About 15 minutes later this guy comes to the door and demanding my roommate move his car. Roommate said “no, sorry I’m high right now and I don’t want to be driving a vehicle.” To which the landlord’s son got aggressive with him, demanding he move his car (roommate is about 5’4 120lbs at best, Landlord’s son is about 6’2 ~190-200lbs). He was yelling at this point, so my roommate just said no again and started to close the door when this guy kicks the door in. So my roommate grabbed the bat in our living room telling the guy to get out. And after my gf, other roommate and I show up to the door seeing why people are yelling and what’s causing the slamming he leaves.

Fast forward to this weekend that just happened. We get an “Order to Remedy” from the city on our front steps about my roommates car (it’s an older civic, lowered, but the bumper fell off a month ago bc of ice on the ground).  We were referenced to the section in our city’s charter about “dangerous or unsightly”. Basically we have two notes about 1. Roommates car and 2. Garbage on the lot/property. We learned the car is only a problem because our city’s compliance is only called about abandoned vehicles (he has his car registered, insured and safety inspected). And he’s putting his bumper on at work today. The garbage is actually all of our landlord’s son’s, which is by a shed that’s technically on our lot. Going to figure out what to do later when I call compliance about it.

But the reason I’m here, I just want to inconvenience this guy because he’s a dick. He has a camera facing his cars that leads to his back door. Any advice is appreciated for how to deal with this situation!",24Feb2020,1
560,"So I have always been against gap years, but recently I have been thinking I want to take one. I am still in high school so I have some time to decide. I have a general idea of what I want to study, creative writing and foreign languages. My idea is that I apply for a study abroad program (Probably AFS) and go for a scholarship, preferably to a Spanish speaking country for a year, then return to the US and go to college, and possibly I can go study abroad again while in college. Luckily I am in a pretty stable family so I thought maybe I could go abroad during a gap year and again during college if I can raise enough money and get big enough of a scholarship. However my mom is against the gap year idea and wants me to go straight to college, but my dad is all for the gap year. Basically, should I take the gap year and go abroad or go straight to college?",24Feb2020,1
561,"Here  goes nothing..To be fair I cheated 4 years ago but owned it and became a  better partner but this is now her second offense you can say.

My  ""ex-girlfriend""?, lets call her K(29F) and I M(31M) were dating for 7  years officially September 2019. We have had some of the best times and  some of the worse but no doubt everyone thought we were the perfect  couple. In august of 2019 her 33 year old sister her kids 12boy and 9  girl. Were vising from another state 2000 miles away where Ks whole  family had moved about 1.5 years or so into us dating but K stayed and  moved in with my family until I bought a house, KISSED ME IN OUR KITCHEN  while playing with snap chat filters, while K slept up stairs and As  kids were sleeping the next room. The crazy thing is I some how recorded  it.

I only stayed up drinking  with her in an attempt to be friendly and get some brownie points since  her sister historically hated me because I had my shit together at one  point and hated anyone who was happy. I couldn't tell K for months  because my brother had lived with us for a year and hasn't spoken to me  in a year and half since I asked him to move out.. I didn't want the  same for her and her sister but it was eating me alive..I had to tell  her and when I did It was terrible timing but I never thought in a  million years she would cheat.

K was the kind of girl who used to get mad at the TV or movie characters for cheating on their co-star.

But  back to her sister lets call her A... Her and I have not necessarily  got along but never once was I rude to her, always bit my tongue when  she would drink and disrespect me(and constantly asked me to be a  business partner of hers). It's no secret I've never been a fan I am  very vocal in my talks with K about my feelings, maybe too much.. A,  drinks quite a bit and historically has slept with a different friend of  mine each time she came to visit. She is one of those girls who has a  new business Idea every 4 months that never works out. She constantly is  filling K's head with these negative images of what a man should be and  how females are all entitled to be taken care of without proving they  deserve it. Tries arguing about something she may not even necessarily  have a different view on but just wants to argue a different point. She  dates men 20 years older and as long as they have money, and is a gold  digger who has given up on love.

I  assume its because she she supposedly had bad break up with her 9 year  olds father(her fiance at the time) and proceeded to spend all of the  family's money they had saved, fighting him in court and in addition to a  failed attempt at a family restaurant business A ""headed up"". I mean  basically she has had their parents raised her kids for her and is so  irresponsible that she didn't come home some nights.

Since  their father had lost his job and A spent all the savings, they had to  move.  They cashed out of the house before it got foreclosed on, took  the equity moved to a state that was less expensive. As I mentioned  earlier K stated ""for me"" She reminded me that all of the time.

I  was 24 when we met, she was 22, and I totally underestimated how pretty  she was and honestly I was quite the man whore at the time and totally  was not looking. I had been the guy who had 4 or 5 relationships lasting  1-2 years at that point I had always known that each of them had an  expiration date on them. With K it was different. After the first time  we hung out and told each other we weren't the clingy types we spent  pretty much every day together ever since.

I  got into business with my dad at 19 work was good I was making money  and now I had a someone to work to build a future for. Man did I spoil  her.. not to impress her but just because I loved her. I would brag to  other people about how great my gf was and everyone loved her too. I  socially partied and smoked while doing so but I was into bodybuilding  and she was super supportive when I decided to do a competition. I won  the novice class and put my focus back on saving for a house. I had over  100k in the bank and I was 25, but my parents were getting divorced. So  after months of looking I closed on a 370,000 house and my mother moved  with us. It wasn't ever a problem, they loved each other and I have  cool mom plus she cooked dinner and only stayed there 2-3 nights a week  and went to her boyfriends the rest. A year and half later she moved  out. 8 Months later my brother found his way in.

I  started taking adderall for self confidence and social anxiety and  generally because I have some ADHD and the demands of running my own  business were too much. I was 26 with a mortgage filled a house with  furniture, paid every utility bill and even had an employee for 50k per  year. My monthly bills were 12k with the business and I was 100%  commission based.

I started  smoking cigarettes full time. K hated it... Friends would come over and  generally I would get frustrated with things because I was so stressed  and became resentful towards her. At this point we were dating for 3 1/2  years and she wanted to get married and I had no debt an 839 credit  score and she had 50k in student loans. We always talked about how she  was going to pay them off but she kept buying things for the house.  Stuff we didn't need, the best kitchen ware but didn't cook enough to  warrant it.. She started to become annoyed that I brought that up when  she brought marriage up but I didn't feel like she was following through  with anything. Still trying to figure out what she wanted to do she  picked up a loan opening position for 30k a year and worked her way up  to be one of the best..now, 3 promotions later makes almost triple that.  At the time she was young probably didn't see my side but I allowed it  to bother me. I communicated everything but communication was not her  strong suit. Granted I am not the easiest person and can be intimidating  sometimes I am approachable and always wanted to talk things out and  she always was annoyed and avoided conflict.

Eventually  one day I cheated on her. She caught me I denied it and then admitted  it and begged for her to stay. I even offered to move out of my own  home. We worked on things or so I thought but she never let it go. At  the same time I started escaping to the casino and blowing my money  because in my head why was I saving all this money if she didn't  appreciate the fact I spent it on her so she could live an easier life  and never paid the loans down. They actually went up because she  differed the interest.

Before I  knew it I was going broke and I was super depressed and she obviously  was still hurt and at my lowest, 5 years into our relationship I knew  something was up. I found out she had been ""friends"" with a guy who she  met through her friend that happened to be my best friends girlfriend.  They had hung out 3 times and been talking for a month without me  knowing. I freaked out and she left for a few days came back told me it  was nothing physical, and you know what I believe her. We'll after  promising never to speak to this guy again it was only 5 days later and I  knew something was up so I managed my way into her email and snapchat  while she was at work and sure enough she carried on this thing behind  my back. The guy even told her not to have sex with me because it was  bad juju spiritually.. Please he wanted to get in her pants and I guess  she was just venting. I think he was actually partially deaf. Regardless  I freaked out again while she was at work she denied it to the end of  the world. I had to send her the screen shots before she would admit. To  top it off she was talking to someone I consider one of my best friends  and he was helping her find a place to live behind my back.

We  had a 6 month old puppy that granted she did go out and pick up in  another state after I agreed and did put the 1000 bucks out but I mean  come on I paid for 100s of thousands of dollars worth of things over  that time. I was so hurt that I left the house with the dog and she came  home from work calling me freaking out. She got some of her things and  over the next 3 days the police came 3 times but told her it was a civil  matter. Her sister A, helped her draft a demand letter for the dog, an  iron, and other misc things that I had. Then I got summons for civil  court and I couldn't believe she cared about a dog so much that it would  get to all this.. the thing was she didn't speak to me once after that  day I took the dog. Wouldn't respond wouldn't take my call.. just  started demanding and making excuses for her lies and kept saying ""I  didn't cheat"". Then realizing she would only get monetary value for the  dog she withdrew her complaint but somehow convinced the township  prosecutor to charge me with theft by deception a potential 3rd degree  felony..  One night the phone rang out of the blue and it was her. She  said ""never mind this is a mistake"" and I wouldn't let her get off the  phone until she talked with me. Before you know it she finally told me  she was seeking attention I wasn't giving to her and we got back  together. 6 weeks after the initial break up. I had not received the  summons and actually had no idea that this was even possible. She went  in front of the judge and withdrew the complaint and apologized the  judge kind of tore into her

Life  moved on, my business was shit though I had let the gambling, drugs, and  her leaving completely distract me.. I finally quit smoking and had  been looking for employment for the first time in my life since I had  been self employed. I finally landed a job with a 6 figure base salary  later that year but it was too late. I filed for bankruptcy but my house  was going to be foreclosed on. She was making good money at this point  and did pay the utility bills to keep the power and everything else on,  but resented me for many things... surprisingly enough I didn't resent  her for what she did other then not paying those damn student loans off.  I started the job. We moved  and leased a place together, my father  helped me get a new car after I had my 65k Audi repossessed and really  lost everything I was working hard for the last 11 years. At 30 it was  terrible but it humbled me.

As  time went on I said ""we'"" and ""us"" more and she said ""I"" and ""me"" It  didn't feel like a team. I was super stressed and in an impossible  position at this new job with unrealistic expectations.. or maybe I just  couldn't cut it but either way I was fired about week before her sister  came to visit. I was depressed and K assumed I wasn't searching for a  job and started acting bitter but never told me why. We would bicker  sometimes but it wasn't terrible. Her sister kissed me and I asked A to  tell her but she refused. Then In the middle off a fight stemming of the  fact she was starting a side business with her sister I blurted it out.  I couldn't get her to believe me that she shouldn't trust her any other  way.

She didn't talk to me for 2  days yet I seen she was talking to her sister for 30 min at a time. I  found out she was basically more mad at me for not telling her. Family  always came first to K I have never been able to enter that circle. I  can count on one hand how many times I have met her family on one hand  before they moved. Every time she went to visit I never got an invite  because they were embarrassed about the floors or something that didn't  meet the standards of there old life. Ks mother always tied to tell her  what to do, was never proud, said she was disappointed she didn't finish  school even thought K was making 75k a year now. She was just as  negative as her sister and I assume that's where it came from.

I  took Ks phone one day and shared her location with me and she never  noticed. She was being weird so I wanted to know why. She had a work  even coming up and we argued that morning and I tried to break up with  her because I couldn't take the fact she had began to put no effort into  things. Everything I talked about was a problem but she never wanted to  finish the talk. I didn't talk to her all day and she comes and kisses  me and tells me how everything is going to be okay she promises were  going to work it out..

That night  she called me.. I could tell she was lying. She said she was in the room  with one friend and a gay kid. They gay kid even took the phone and  said ""man this guy is crazy"" made sure to let me know how he was gay  too. I asked her to step out and talk to me and she repeatedly said I  have to go. I knew it at that point. I said facetime me and she hung up.   Wouldn't take my calls the rest of the night and finally after seeing  she stayed in a room that wasn't hers and wasn't her friends because I  had her location I basically had to threaten her with ""you remember what  happened last time with the dog"" before she came clean and told me she  made out with some guy and spent the night in his bed but nothing else  happened. I was crushed.. I told her to come home we were going to split  custody of the dog and she would move out. I was an asshole for kicking  her out apparently since her family wasn't close by as if I should have  left. She claimed she had no where to go and over the course of 2 days  more and more of the lies reveled themselves and before I knew it she  told me his dick had been in her hand. For only 2 seconds though. The  lies resembled those of 2 years earlier but she claimed I'm hard to talk  to and she was afraid to be honest.

Many  other things happen but She left the dog with me for 6 weeks and  expected me to watch him until she was ready yet made no attempt at  getting a place. I said take him today or I am keeping him and she  didn't take me serious so went another week without speaking to me at  all. No replies no phone calls. Finally I hear from her and decide to be  the bigger person and let her have the dog. We had tried to work it out  and then didn't a bunch of times. After 30 days of her not even letting  me see the dog I refused to keep trying to work it out with her if I  couldn't know where she lived and see the dog. I've spent the last week  or so at her place or shes been here but she's hesitant because I need  to change things and her parents who don't even know me don't approve  anymore. Yet I took care of their daughter when they had nothing. I've  never laid a hand on her and lost everything while providing for her.

Am  I an idiot for still wanting to work things out with someone who is  unsure after 7+ years because she's afraid of letting her mother and  sister down? When she admits shes messed up from her mothers mental  abuse and come on her sister did kiss her boyfriend of 7 years... But  they all hate me because of not marrying her when she wasn't deserving  of it and holding the dog at some point... What do I even do? She won't  let me go and she won't commit. Shes going to see a therapist and  expects me to put everything on hold because she needs to talk to  someone. Which I get but she always reminds me I can do whatever I want  even though gets an attitude if I mention another girl. Does she just  want her cake and eat it too? Before she got her place I asked her to  move back in and fix things then but she said no multiple times. she  insisted on getting her own place.. Something her mom and sister told  her she needed to do like most things in life. The mom with two masters  degrees who shames her for not finishing school yet has never worked a  day in her own life, and the sister the one who blamed the alcohol for  sticking her tongue down my throat. The worst part is K is more mad at  me than anything and I don't know why?

Do  I wait for her to come around or do I run? I'm stupid in love with this  girl and I have so much anxiety over this. She does gas light me but I  haven't always been perfect and still have my own issues to work on till  this day and I can admit that. I have been asking her to go to therapy  for 2 years and she just kind of avoided it. She says shes willing to go  now but is it too late?",24Feb2020,1
562,"My bf (22m) is doing a Masters and has a part-time job, I (21f) work from home. We live in a shared student house, we have an en-suite bedroom and a shared kitchen.

I would like one because I miss my family pets and honestly I’m hella broody. My bf is worried about noise and smell but we could keep the cage in the bathroom at night.

563,"To sum up my life, I grew up poor, and in a large family. My parents couldn't afford to send me to college, or have a high enough credit score to sign my loans.

I'm current working 2 jobs. One as a delivery driver, and the other stocking groceries. I so badly want to go to college, and get a career. It keeps me up at night.

Its becoming a problem becuase it seems like EVERY person my age is in college. Why am I so different? Why do I have to work harder than everyone else, for very little reward? What makes me SO different that I cant attend a 4-year college? It just doesn't make any sense.

I wish I had the problems of a normal 20 year old. I wanna live in a dorm, take classes, go to parties, study what I love, etc. But instead I have to work 2 jobs.

565,"I had created a joke a long time ago and posted it here on reddit. For some odd reason I can't find my post anywhere. Anyway, how does this joke feel Is it relatable? How can I improve the sense of humor?

Here's the joke:

A Bar Named Reddit..

A man walks into a bar named reddit. The sign says ""moderated, any offense will not be tolerated"" along with a list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.

As he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.

So he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.

He starts, ""I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-""

""I fucking LOVE bacon!"" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly.

At this the woman in the next table shouts ""You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)"".

Her husband immediately shouts ""oh I love your baking, Frankenswine"".

A guy from the opposite corner chimes-in ""This is why I bring home the bacon!"". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.

""I love you too HAMLET""

""Watch out she's a PIGpocket""

""Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!""

Silence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.

“I was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don’t think that-” Interrupted.

Slow clap

“Am I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?” shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.

“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a troll”

“Dad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.”

“Break off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances”

“This sounds so fake you karma whore”

“Grow up you fucking piece of shit”

“Yo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.”

And this starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.

Now our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, “FUCK! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!”

She said something that I didn't know how to respond to; I wanted to neither start an argument nor validate a worldview that I disagreed with. I messaged her the next morning, but I don't think she ever saw it.

This is the one thing that gets me the most. Maybe if I had responded quicker and shown her that I was on her side, even if I didn't fully agree, maybe she would have stuck around longer.

573,"Lately i’ve been wanting to move in with my boyfriend because of my very emotionally unstable family. Staying at home always relapses me back into depression and panic attacks. Everyday I hear something terrible about myself or my lifestyle and for years and years. Both my dad and mom have tantrums and often have emotional lashes (especially towards me when I’m doing nothing like sitting doing school work or my hobbies). They tend to neglect a lot of things around them (i.e dog pee stained walls, food left out for days/weeks, flooded basement rain water stains, molded and expired foods left in the kitchen for months, and generally a lot of housing issues like plumbing snd whatnot unfixed for years). They live in this cluttered, closed in basement with a single lightbulb while upstairs we have 3 international students living there and everything seems clean and normal. It’s very depressing living with them in the basement and watching their lives go in a down spiral especially with the students rebelling once in a while making things unnecessarily difficult for them. 

There’s a lot of guilt that goes into wanting more of a solo career lol. I’m out during most days but whenever I do stay home it’s a nightmare. I love my parents dearly. They mean so much to me. They used to be good, productive, happy people but every day they grow bitter and hateful. I can’t help but feel more sad than ever watching them suffer. 

I partially confronted them about moving out sometime soon when I get a job to support myself. I also mentioned trying to support them financially too. My dad didn’t like the idea and disagreed. I’m worried that If i go ahead with my own plan anyways, they would somewhat get worse and treat each other more like shit (Can I just mention that they both work from 7-3 and as soon as my mom comes home she does the laundry and dishes of 5-6 people on her own? And I have schooling and lots of work that prevents me from helping often. My dad lashes out at me for that when he is in bed most of the time). I’m worried that when I move out I also won’t be able to help around the house as often as I used to. In a way it feels like things would get worse but it’s almost a hopeless scenario for me. I stay, they spiral downwards and I slip back into depression. I go, they spiral even more downwards with the addition of worrying and stressing about me.  I don’t know what to fully prioritizing or even think about in this situation. My bf says to put myself first but theres too much worry and anxiety. I don’t want to carry that when we live together. I don’t want my worries to negatively affect those around me. What do I do?

TLDR; Family depressed and neglectful. Very self destructive and negative. Im also depressed at home and Im always on the verge of relapsing when dealing with them.

I’m not sure if I’ll get it, but I still wanted to ask what reddit thought about those cities and see if there’s a specific city I should really gear towards (and if was asked, I could request).  

I’m in my early 20’s and really enjoy scenery. I like hiking and I’m not *super* into beaches. The lower the cost of living the better! I’m not big on partying but more than likely would enjoy some nightlife after coming out of my shell from moving to a new city. I love good food (who doesn’t though?). 

I feel like I’m leaning towards Memphis because it’s got that scenery, seems like rent is pretty okay (would be looking on the outside of city limits for apartments, not in the city probably- they look kinda sketch), and it’s decently close to places like Nashville and New Orleans. A lot of people I’ve talked to keep saying it’s not a safe city, that it’s not friendly, etc etc and I’m wondering if that’s true or if there’s a northern bias or something. 

On the other hand, people say Savannah is absolutely beautiful and it seems to be pretty similar in pricing. Not many knew about Columbia but I know it’s the capital and it sounds like it’s a bit of a college town.

587,"I’m 15. I’m currently with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother, nana, and papa in florida for break. Last night her and my stepdad had very loud sex for the second night in a row, I was incredibly uncomfortable and this had been going on for years. I know couples having sex isn’t a big deal but all the nights of hearing them, rushing to put on my headphones and blast music over it, and sobbing myself to sleep was such a draining process and my mental state is already awful. What I sent her was honestly a little much, but here’s my attempt at trying to set a boundary

“i deserve respect.
there’s been so many fucking times you and [stepdad’s name] have had sex when i’m in the other room and i’m done with it, for once in my god damn life i’m actually standing up for myself.
i hope you understand how much you are hurting your child.
i am typing this message out at 10:36pm on sunday night through tears.
you have to stop doing this to me.
i can’t take it anymore.”

I’m really ashamed of sending that. I was overcome by emotions and it showed, and i could’ve said how I was feeling in a much more down to earth manner.
But here was her response 

“I’m “hurting my child”? By having a loving relationship with my partner? Nope. Wrong!

You know literally nothing. How DARE YOU attempt to shame me. 
You’re embarrassing in the level of judgmental ignorance you reside in.

You think I don’t respect you? I gave up an entire summer of my life to protect you from an abusive environment. AND so did [stepdad. Without hesitation, out of LOVE and RESPECT.
You’re welcome. 

I found you a trans positive therapist to support and guide you in your choice. Because I RESPECT you. You’re welcome.

YOU have some FUCKING RESPECT for the PARENT that supports you as a trans youth in literally every way.

This is the LAST TIME I will bring you ANYWHERE.
You think you’re coming to Europe? Hahahahahaha

Go live with your shitty prejudiced redneck rage-aholic bigot of a father who does literally nothing for you, will never accept or respect your life and gender choices, takes you nowhere, and beats his girlfriend.

590,"This weekend I was at a party and had a little too much to drink. Many of the people there I had never met before, the rest I had known for a few days (except a close friend of mine). I had been flirting with this guy the whole night and was sitting in his lap when suddenly I had to go throw up. 

  
Afterwards, this other guy (who had just served me a few shots after introducing himself for the first time), started talking about how I could sleep in his bed to sober up while he stayed on the couch. I wasn't really in a state to have an opinion about this, so I was led to his bed. I don't quite remember what happened/ what I said, but I think I might have asked him to cuddle me because I was cold. He did so and eventually started kissing me. We fooled around for a little bit. From what I remember, I was on and off about whether or not we should go further. 

The guy kept touching me, and suddenly he started to choke me really hard. Just when it felt like I was about to faint, the guy let go. I remember starting to panic a little bit. I suddenly realised this was not the guy I had been flirting with all night - this was someone else. I just wanted to get away from there, so I said I had to go to the toilet. He refused to let me go by myself and instead picked me up -and accidentally dropped me on the floor, and I sobered up even more from the pain. Now I felt I just had to get away from there. 

I said I had to go find my friend, who I knew was still in the house since here boyfriend lived there. The guy said he thought she wasn't there, that she had left, even though it was obvious she had stayed. I went to find her and immediately had an anxiety attack and started crying. 

  
The guy was really nice to me afterwards, apologizing for what had happened and was very touchy. Since I felt I had partly initiated the sexual contact, I felt I had no right to blame him and told him my anxiety attack was due to old memories. 

  
Today my throat hurts pretty bad, both on the inside and the outside, and I feel a lot of anxiety over what happened. My friend kind of blames me for the incident. I don't know what to think.

591,"## Why

*Note: this section is more about ""why"" and giving some background. Skip to the
break below for the specifics of ""how"" and what exactly I need help with in this
question.*

Our relationship has been toxic for much of that time, at least the last four
years. In large part because of my own anti-social behavior, which has caused
significant grief for her as she wants to travel, and spend time together. In my
heart of hearts I want these things too but have been unable or unwilling to
satisfy those needs.

I won't pretend to be the victim, she's been hurt by my not spending enough time
with her. I've been open with her about my efforts to change, my feelings about
when we're apart vs when we're together, and my thoughts that we should
separate. I want to stress that this has been a central topic of conversation
for the last few years, and that talking about these issues hasn't seemed to
improve them.

But in this time she's grown more and more (verbally) abusive, or perhaps I
should just say mean and combative, which hasn't helped my interest in spending
time with her. I believe things have now become unrecoverable, as my desire to
spend time with her is thwarted by her day-to-day treatment of me. She regularly
berates me, shouts at me, compares me to her exes and the boyfriends her friends
have, likely due to her broader frustration with our relationship. I want to
make it clear I totally understand why she's been unhappy with me.

At the same time I feel her treatment of me has been getting progressively
worse. She picks fights daily, goes behind my back to spend massive amounts of
money, she's left me solely with our financial burden, she openly mocks me to
her friends (when she doesn't lie to them and say I'm her ""room mate"" and not
her fucking partner of seven years). She's often openly hostile when she doesn't
get her way, and has recently taken to throwing things around our apartment and
having child-like tantrums. It's unbelievable reading that back as I've just
typed it, but I experience at least one of these things every single day,
usually multiple.

A couple years ago we split up briefly because she'd cheated on me with a
friend of friend. I've since found it was multiple friends of a friend. This
split was the happiest I've been in the last seven years.

I've spent the last two years trying in earnest to change, but no matter what
we do or how I try to change my mindset I'm just miserable when I'm around her.
Worse, she's recently taken several week long trips (without me) and I've found
that I'm much happier when she's gone and I'm dreadful of when she comes back.

We've been unable to improve our relationship for the last few years and I've
decided to leave. I think we're both deeply unhappy and could find more
satisfying relationships once everything settles.

&lt;hr&gt;

## How

Here are the facts:
 * We're not married, and our state does not recognize ""common law"" marriage
 * We're both signed on a month-to-month lease
 * We're both signed on a new car loan (and both on the title)
 * We have a dog that I love with my entire heart as I've raised him since he was a puppy
 * She's unemployed and has been for over two years (except briefly working part time as a customer service rep)
 * She's been pursuing a music a career which hasn't panned out financially
 * She's gone to school but not successfully completed a single semester
 * She's taken online coding courses but failed to follow through on them
 * All of this has left me the sole bread winner and her financially dependent on me, despite my constant efforts and encouragement for her to find some source of income
 * Last time I spoke to her she demanded to keep the car. This is unacceptable to me as I have paid every single payment, including the down payment, for the last four years totaling some $20,000. I have bank statements to demonstrate this.
 * It seems unlikely she would sign the paperwork to take me off of the apartment
 * I'm not sure our landlord would even approve that change as she has no ability to pay the rent ($1600/mo)
 * I plan to pay all of the bills 30 days in advance, and leave her with some money to start over (thinking $2000 in addition to the month of paid bills)

And here are my questions:
 * Can she effectively keep me hostage on the apartment lease by refusing to sign me off of it?
 * If I told my landlord about the situation is there any way he could intervene (ignoring that it would be against his own interests to do so)?
 * What if she trashes the apartment after I leave?
 * If I leave with the car would she have a viable court case to gain possession of it?
 * Do you think it's moral to leave her when she has no income (entirely by her own choice and against my expressed wishes) but with the payments mentioned above?

Separately, I'm interested on opinions about whether I am the asshole in this
situation. I don't have anyone to talk to about it so I'm wondering what
outsiders think (of my biased telling) of the story.",24Feb2020,1
592,"Hello! I am feeling a little down in the dumps lately and am looking for a little advice/support on how to proceed.  

I am a mom of four, with my SO for five years, and our two youngest boys were diagnosed with autism about one year ago.  They are 3 now.  I have been struggling hard to be able to maintain working a full-time (from home) position as the struggles of having two special needs children has been overwhelming, not to mention the needs of my other children.  My boys receive all the necessary therapies, attend a special needs school M-F, and require full assistance with everything as they are nonverbal, do not eat solid foods, cannot follow simple age-appropriate commands, etc.  I have joined a local support group and have found a little comfort there, but not as much as I thought I would.  My main struggle is being able to balance full time employment and their care.  Sleep difficulties, meltdowns and self-injurious (as well as minor injuries to myself) behaviors are an every day and night event, if not by one then sometimes both.  

Now within the past year, I find myself making dumb mistakes at work, not able to be as detail oriented as I used to be, missing things that I definitely should have noticed, just being so spacey all the time that now my employer is starting to notice.  It takes me probably twice as long to do things bc I have to double and triple check my work.  I have worked for this employer for almost 15 years (July).  I have been getting a couple complaints, recently realized I had neglected a vital component to my responsibilities, which I don’t even know how I did this.  I have no reasoning.  I just don’t remember or think the same way as I used to.  I took responsibility for my error, took corrective actions, but understandably now my employer is monitoring my every move.  

I feel like I am burnt out on both ends, like I am not giving either aspect of my life the full attention it needs...I don’t know how to move forward.  I feel like my employer is now looking for anything I do wrong.  I am pretty sure I am on the verge of being fired.  I have never been fired from anything in my life.  I am scared if I get fired that I won’t be able to find employment that will fit with the schedule that I need, because finding a sitter for two special needs kids (especially with feeding difficulties, one chokes easily, etc.) has been very difficult, understandably.  

I feel defeated and like I should just quit my job and focus on my boys until they are school aged.  This is the most vital time for them to learn skills.  But I don’t know how we could make it financially if I quit.  My SO is very supportive and says we will figure it out, etc., but I am scared.  I am not someone who takes chances or likes change.  I am a worrier by nature (yay), and I have been unable to eat a full meal or sleep well since this latest mistake of mine.  I keep going over and over in my mind what will, night, or could happen and stressing over every thing I do workwise.   I have been working through tears this morning and took my break to write this.  

I don’t know what I should or could do...has anyone been in a similar situation?",24Feb2020,1

594,"Throwaway because I have friends on reddit and friends that use reddit, some minor details will be different to try to hide identity. Also please forgive me if I don't make much sense in this post, I'll try to articulate myself as best as I can. Final apologies for formatting because I'm on mobile and this is my first actual post on here.

I don't even know where to properly start with this, so I may as well provide some backstory and set the scene. I'm a 22M in Australia and I've had to leave a controlling, abusive and manipulative home. To put things somewhat into perspective, I've never held a proper job or had any sort of actual work experience due to the fact that my father never let me have one so that I could care for my disabled family member (cousin that my father has taken in when my cousin was less than a year old, now 11, because my cousin's parents were horrible and could barely look after themselves, the cousin is pretty much considered a sibling), whenever I would try to get a job or attempt to further myself or my skills, I'd always be guilt-tripped by my father and older sister because ""I'm putting myself first before my family"". I managed to get out of home early-January but rendered myself homeless for around 2-3 weeks but I did manage to catch a break where I found somewhere to live while on goverment benefits, which I couldn't get before I had turned 22 because in my state, if you're under 22, you need your parent/guardian to sign off on a few things to be able to get the benefits, which my father would never agree to do (living with/getting help from my mother wasn't a choice either, deadbeat who was just as abusive and manipulative, If not, more, I managed to cut contact with her in 2018). 

So onto the current situation, I'm now living out of home, on benefits with no other forms of financial support. I'm borderline unemployable because I don't have anything to put on my resume, I never finished high school (for the same reason that I couldn't get a job, forced to drop out in year 11), no work experience, no qualifications or certificates (such as an RSA), however, I am linked with services that can help with getting those which should help me out with becoming employable but the service is not very good at helping me out with that. I do have my driver's licence but it's since been suspended because my dad was caught speeding on several occasions on camera but he put the offences in my name so he didn't lose his and my suspension ends in late-April. I've also got about $2,500 worth of debt to my name which happened because while I was living at home, my dad forced me to put all of the services in my name (Electricity, Gas, Internet etc.) and once I left, he refused to pay the bills or transfer the accounts into his name (the property had an in-ground pool, explaining the hefty electricity bill) and he took the car that I was using off of me, which he said he ""bought for me"" but kept it in his name and once I had left, threatened to call the police and report it as stolen if I didn't return it within 24 hours. My dad and my sister had also sent numerous degrading and abusive messages to me once I did leave, messages along the lines of ""You're never going to be able to live life on your own, you need us"", ""See? Putting yourself first like I've always said, you're extremely selfish and always have been, just like your mother"" and ""You're dead to me and my family now, don't ever try to contact us again"". I've been trying to apply for jobs that have no experience required but every single one that I come across says that I must have my licence and my own vehicle/form of transportation, I don't mind walking or getting public transport, but the area that I'm in is somewhat of a rural one, where a 10 minute drive is over an hour's walk and the public transport around here is beyond shocking but barely managable.

I don't really know what to do right now, I'm constantly depressed about this entire situation and not really sure how to proceed. 

I'll respond to comments when I can, I'm hoping that I can manage to fall asleep somewhat soon.",24Feb2020,1
595,"3 weeks ago I had two family friends be kicked out so I took them under my wing and let them move into my rental, which is a two bedroom one bathroom unit. So it’s super claustrophobic right now. I also have my brother in the second bedroom, he moved in six Lo this ago. I understand that it’s not an ideal situation for any of us but I’m starting to feel really unappreciated and disrespected by them all. I not once have been thanked for taking them in and they’re all starting to behave like they’re the ones in charge, like it’s their rental and I’m the boarder. They are also starting to treat me like I’m the bad guy for standing up for myself and enforce a few rules on them all. 
I exploded over the weekend and said how I’m feeling but they seem to have only took it on board for one day and then went back to treating me the same. So I guess I just need some advice/someone to talk to or any tips on how to get them to fully understand how they’re making me feel.",24Feb2020,1

597,"So I am a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with what is now know as Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 3. I have received various occupational, speech, and psychological talk therapies in order to make my condition manageable and to avoid being mistreated by society through my ""quirks"". Throughout middle school, I had issues making friendships and even maintaining conversations due to you know what. In high school particularly, I had people call me terms such as ""mentally ill"", ""psycho"", ""retard"", ""lame"", ""no girl would ever want to be with a mentally challenged dummy like you"", etc. In high school, this blatant and explicit form of mistreatment changed to more subtle, implicit, and low-key forms of exclusion. People ignored me, not invited me to events, said bad things about me behind my back, etc.

I tried suppressing or blocking out these traits in order to ""pass off"" as a neurotypical individual out of fear of being treated poorly. While it worked well and I experienced no dissonance due to this  change, whenever I visited this online forum about individuals living on the Autism Spectrum, I got harsh criticism for attempting to ""pass as neurotypical"" or ""appease to the able-normative demands of respectability politics"". Basically, they accused me of rejecting my identity by attempting to ""pass"" as someone I am not. That said, I don't want to be treated like crap nor want my mom and other family members being worried that others may treat me poorly or take advantage of me due to a disability.

I need help. Should I drop the concerns raised by these people on that online forum? What about the concerns of my mom?",24Feb2020,1
598,"I  am 19M and just started learning about dating and body language. I am trying to familiarise with everything before trying out irl. I have never held a girl's hand  before let alone dating anyone which is why I am working on 'self  improvement' and have started working out too.

599,"Hello everyone. I'm crapping my pants about planning my future because I can't figure out what course of action I should take in my education. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently studying PPE (philosophy, politics and economy) as my bachelor's. I do enjoy it, and philosophy and politics have always been one of my strengths. I'm decent at economical theory, but I suck at anything related to mathematics. Despite this, I'm considering switching schools to pursue a bachelor in business administration and sociology - a program with a much greater emphasis on economics (which I frankly don't quite enjoy studying that much). 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm considering switching is because of the following reasons:

A) The school I want to switch to is in another country, and I'm growing extremely tired of living in the city I grew up in. Coupled with the fact that my current uni is infamous for its lack of social life, and that my friends will leave to study abroad soon, I'm afraid I'll have a terrible time at my current uni for the rest of my time there.

B) I'm afraid that my current degree won't be of much value in applying to the jobs I want to work with (my current degree primarily gives me an edge in politics, which I have little interest in working with).

C) The school I want to switch to is one of the best business schools in Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents think I should stay because, well, to be frank, I come from a well-connected family working in creative industries, and they think that for me to pursue a degree in business administration and sociology would only make me *less* attractive because it would make me look less well-rounded. They argue that there's a thousands of young people with degrees in business and that this would make me disposable and uninteresting to employers, while my current degree would indicate interest in things beyond getting a nice salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current degree is most likely only better if I decide to rely on my family connections in applying to work, which is something I don't want to do nor is something I think they have reflected over. If I apply for a random job without connections I don't really think PPE is going to sound as interesting. 

  
Besides, my parents have all become successful without any good degrees, so I think there's a survivorship bias at play. That is, they don't think a good degree is valuable just because they managed to get by without one. The job market is significantly different nowadays than it was 30 years ago. I'm not sure if I'm ready to risk getting a crappy degree just because everything worked out for them. 

Furthermore, I absolutely loathe the idea of staying in my home city to study when I could go somewhere new and make new friends and connections. Isn't this alone a good reason to switch? I know uni/college is primarily for preparing yourself for the future but it's also going to be my last few years before I truly become an adult. Not sure if I wanna waste that time being somewhere I hate.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: My wealthy parents think my current degree, PPE, is better for my future (despite this meaning I stay at a lower ranked uni) than to study business and sociology at one of Europe's top business schools. The reason being that PPE makes me look more ""interesting"" to employers. However, I don't want to rely on my parents for jobs in the future so I'm unsure if my current degree would make me look ""interesting"" to employers who aren't family connections.**",24Feb2020,1

602,"Alright, I work as a car sales person, I just started. Of course in this profession you get paid based on the cars you sell. I have been there for like 3 weeks and went through the 2 week training and learned the process. 

So Saturday I had 5 appointments, out of which 3 showed up. 

Appointments 

1. This gal was looking for a Honda highlander. (We are used car dealership and I convinced her she would save money to buy a used one and I could show her the car facts and stuff, and I sent her a vin brochure for a nice one that had 20,000 miles and was a 2017) so I did that and she was literally only looking for Highlander’s, we had one at another lot an hour away, so the day before I told my bosses it was up there and asked them to check on it. A little while later I asked about it, it was available which was great so I offered to go get it it the lot techs were busy. The boss said it was fine and he would send them, I told him my appointment was for 1:15 tomorrow (Saturday) he said he got it and I went on my way and made some more calls and such, later that night I noticed the car had not got there yet, it’s about 5 now and slowing down so I offer again to go, he says we can just get it tomorrow. The next day comes and he gives me the run around until she gets there and then tells me to just go show her another Highlander. I showed her the other one and she was annoyed and asked if this was the one I showed her. I told her I’m sorry but it’s not, then I went to talk with my boss and tell him she wanted to see the other one, the dingus said “just grab some keys and drive her up there”. I suggested that’s a bad idea and he told me to just go try. Surprise surprise, she didn’t want to drive an hour  when I told her it would be here, so she left. They then proceeded to blame me for losing that sale. 

2. My guy showed up and was looking for trucks, he was telling me his needs. (If you don’t know in the car selling industry you have to introduce people to a manager pretty much every time (EMI)) so I did my EMI and was chatting with the guy, talking about a truck my managers really want gone and then another manager for no reason came out and started talking with the guy and put another salesperson on him, so he had to rush through the process. That manager told me that I did nothing wrong he just really wants the truck gone BUT the guy ended up leaving and they blamed me and that other salesperson. 

3. The guy showed up and we were just building rapport and talking about his wife’s car vehicle needs and I did the Early manager meeting and then  was still chatting and stuff and about 5 minutes into it they sent another salesperson out there to “help” me, which I did not need. And that one was sold but because they had the salesperson “help” I only got half a sale on that one.

Best,


I’m not sure if anyone has had any success. I had some friends get contacted by JukinMedia for a video they made and they actually made a good chunk of money off it. I believe that BuzzVideos might be real but I’d hate to sign rights to them if they aren’t a very effective platform when there could be actual effective platforms out there.

We have been dating for around 6 months. I come from a somewhat wealthy family who have given me the best support in terms of how to manage my life amongst studies and work, so I’m not sure if I have an abnormally supportive family or if my girlfriends parents are actually this bad. 

So I think her parents are by far the laziest people I have come across. They don’t work, stay home all day, the father doesn’t even have a drivers license, they live off of his retirement funds (family of 4) which is not what thats for. 
They don’t pay for her uni studies and forced her to apply for a bursary/sponsorship which is very difficult to come by in my country. They don’t want to help pay for her to get a driver’s license. in my mind surely as parents you don’t want your child to be useless and actually help pay for her driving lessons? Second of all the money she got from her sponsor was for her living expenses, her parents requested her to pay them all of that money and they bought a car with it rather ! Even tho they had one. They decided to get an upgrade.... like surely I’m not being to bias towards her ?  They could of easily given the old car to her and got a cheaper car for them selves ? 
Look if they worked very hard and still could not afford this I totally understand, they are trying. But if you sitting on your ass all day doing nothing then I don’t get it. 

My girlfriend works multiple jobs to give her some sort of wage for her own life, and does the most in this family. 
She completed a year of her studies and found that it’s really not for her (as most young adults do) however her family shutdown any ideas or dreams she has and forces her to stay in this degree that they don’t even pay for... 

My question at the end is am I being ridiculous? Or how can I help her ? I have offered for her to live with me and she is dying to move in and I also offered her a job which can even pay off her studies in a year if she decides to dropout and take something else.",24Feb2020,1

Since the she’s made a deal with her parents for us to move in with them for very cheap to get started in this other city. I’ve started getting anxious about it all I’ll have to find a new job and new friends etc and it will be far from everything I’ve ever known but the other part of me feels ill forever think I’ll regret not going and loosing her.

So basically, another friend (Bob) and I had a big fight about two weeks ago. This fight was caused more than anything by some MAJOR misunderstandings on both sides. While I have apologized for my errors and tried to resolve things, Bob still thinks he's done nothing wrong and that I was being unreasonably mad about something that was in fact very minor. Bob is by no means a bad person and from his perspective he wasn't being unreasonable, but I would argue it was him leaping to several untrue assumptions about me that primarily caused our fight to escalate to the point it did.

I really want to resolve things with Bob, but he's been very difficult to talk to about this. He won't listen to me about what my side of the story was because his opinion of me has basically hit rock bottom.

Our mutual friend Dave has been watching from the sidelines for most of this, but seeing how I am having a lot of trouble getting through to Bob on my own, he has told me he's going to approach Bob for me and help me get him to listen. Dave is still good friends with Bob and understands the situation very well, so I think if anyone could convince Bob to understand my perspective, it'd be him.

However, it's been a week since Bob and I have had our last conversation, and Dave still doesn't know when he'll approach him. Bob is already moving on because he really dislikes me over his misunderstanding of me, and I'm afraid if we wait too long to do anything the chance to make amends will slip through our fingers.

I know Dave has no obligation to help me with my own problems with Bob, but his help would be my greatest chance of success. I don't want to put pressure on him or act entitled to his help, but I really need it before it's too late to unbury the conflict.

The Knighthood of Ustex and the Dimension Defenders recruit Caden and his loyal friends. The only discussions they face are all about the Ovius Runestone.

It turns out, after a bit of  research in the library, that the Ovius Runestone is a magical prison for the goddess of chaos, Dara, and her followers and can be opened with a magic ritual in the Kurwiti. After a devastating murder and suspicious behavior from people Caden knows, he discovers that the queen of Wilex is after the Ovius Runestone and that she wishes to kill Caden.

Regardless, Caden is ready to take responsibility into his own hands and do whatever it takes to stop the summoning of Dara and her demons.

 Caden Winters and the Ovius Runestone is 120,000-word fantasy novel; it is the first book of a pentalogy that I plan to write.

628,"I work at a marketing agency, where I must provide analysis of data to clients. I just started this job 2 months ago as an intern. This is my only job. My second-from-boss was going to present to the client a PowerPoint that wasn’t even started yesterday. I got an email 2 hours before the presentation to make the ppt without the attachments. I didn’t know there were meant to be attachments because the email didn’t indicate anything. So I tried my best to make it from scratch. I sent it back and she used it. 

She came back and told THE boss I messed it up. That I didn’t use the attachments I was given. I overheard all of this, and just pretended not to hear because I was on the verge of crying. Now the boss thinks I’m useless. What do I do?",24Feb2020,1
630,"I once loved the girl I am currently in a relationship with. I twice caught messages on her phone from/to the same guy, to which she had an explanation for. Since then, I have been insecure and have put less effort towards our relationship, even though nothing might have happened between them. I am not sure if I trust her, but she is a very good person in general and to me. I have spoken about it with her multiple times about ending it all, but she never agreed saying “If I wanted to do/be anything for someone else I would trust me. Nothing would stop me and I am not that kind of person”. Likewise, she often asks me: “so because of this or that, you want to end it all? What if we were married? Would you end it all because of this or that?” Which leads to me thinking that even though we argue often and I mistrust her, she still sees a future for us together. I am not perfect either, so I’m willing to give it a try. However, I know for sure I don’t love her the same way like in the beginning. My question is: is it possible to love her as I did in the beginning, again?",24Feb2020,1

It happened abut 2 years ago and I'm over her and the whole situation in every aspect. But obviously I recently found out this pretty ruining thing.

But I just strangely don't care as much as I know I should... It was so long ago, and i can't be bothered to hate him like everyone says I should.

Of course I can't trust him anymore. But I really can't be bothered to ""cut him out my life"" or any of this. I've literally had some of the best times with him, before and during those 2 years.

Basically, I finished graduate school in an industry that I have wanted to work in since i started going to college. I've found that I get really drained by the 40 hour work week. Started working in May immediately after graduating.

I've since really missed being in college and the lifestyle that come with being a grad student with a 20 hour/week graduate assistantship (GA). Is it normal to have this feeling?

I have even come to the point where I would definetly consider applying for another graduate program and work another GA positon. I really like what I do but I do feel disconnected from my workplace/colleagues since I'm definetly the youngest on staff by 10 years. I would consider applying elsewhere but I'm afraid I'd look like I'm job hopping and not sure I can come up with enough references to vouch for me.

636,"So I work at a hospital. This summer I started dating another nurse that works on the same ward as I do. We are so fond of each other and spend so much time together, we already moved in together actually. 

None of our co-workers know about this, because I feel like it’s too early to tell and there will be a lot of judgement. 

We try our best at hiding our relationship at work (we actually don’t work together that much because we both work in shifts) but somehow people “see” it and they sense a vibe between the two of us. I recently have been confronted by a few co-workers and my boss about this. They asked me if we are dating and I straight up lied to their face, I feel so bad about this! But I’m so afraid to lose my job. I know it is not illegal to date a co-worker but it’s not an ideal situation, so if it comes out one of us has to be transferred to another ward.

Now I feel like I am in this position where anything I do isn’t or doesn’t feel right.

What do we have to do? Like, do we come out and risk to ""lose"" our job (as in needing to be transferred)? And if we do come out, how to handle the people we have been lying to…?

Or do we try to keep this a secret for as long as possible and keep lying to people? It feels so wrong but I feel like we have no choice…",24Feb2020,1
637,"My best friend just told me she likes me, she knows I'm gay but she says she loves me that much that she's willing to accept me into her life despite the fact.

I made her understand that I can't be in a relationship with a woman because it's selfish to be with someone if you're not attracted to them emotionally or physically. She understands that I can't change who I am.

She says the only solution is for her to leave my life and stop talking to me, because she tried to stop loving me before but couldn't and she thinks if I remain in her life her love for me will remain and it will stop her from meeting someone else and having the future she wants.

She means a lot to me and I don't want to lose her, she is genuinely one of the best people I've met and losing her would be one of my greatest losses.

639,"So, I've got a friend of the opposite sex that I reached out to about 6 months ago coz she was posting very depressing stuff to her social media. We talked a little and I finally found out she is going through a divorce so I told her if she needed to talk I'd be there, nothing more nothing less. Slowly we began texting almost constantly and after about a month of that I told her I had began to develop feelings for her even though I hadn't wanted to but understood that nothing was going to happen. She said we'd just be friends and I was ok with that but the constant texting continued including good morning and good night texts and we actually started meeting up. The texting and in person interactions became very flirty and physical(no sex, just alot of cuddling and touching) so I thought she was beginning to reciprocate. We spoke very openly about our feelings and I felt like I'd put my foot in my mouth some with her but when I asked her she assured me that we were fine. After one particular get together, she began to distance herself and told me she needed a break. I said that was fine and told her I'd be there when she was ready to talk again. So we stopped texting and a few days later she texted me back saying ""thank you for giving me space."" We began talking again some but not as much and sometimes she actually seemed like she was annoyed by me even though I'd just be simply answering her texts. I told her around Christmas that I missed interacting with her and she proceeded to tell me I was being clingy even though I'd hadn't texted her in weeks at that point and the few times we had talked, SHE was the one that would text me. I understand that she's going through a really tough time right now, but I just don't know what to do. I honestly feel like a clown for wanting to continue speaking with and seeing her.

640,"I am a 21 year old female and I’m currently enrolled at a university. Let me give you some background information about my life. So high school was the worst time of my life. I had noting, but bad luck. My grades were horrible in high school and I felt so depressed during those 4 years. I was in a toxic relationship with a guy during the last two years of high school. I left that relationship after high school and we got into a pretty messy fight. He spread a bunch of rumors about me saying I was threatening to kill myself if he left me. Which never happened and it led to a lot of people not liking me. This was really hard for me to deal with and it made me really depressed for awhile. It still bothers me till this day and it’s been 2 years since it happened. 

I was in community college for two years and I did really well. I made some friends though it and my grades were great. I had a 3.5 gpa when I left the community college then. I transferred to a university this year. First semester I did alright. I made descent grades. Made no Ds or Fs. Then this semester I have a one F and a D. This is the first time in my college career we’re I’m really struggling. Also, since I’ve been at this university I had a friend group at the beginning of the school year. I had a failing out with one of the girls, because she kept dragging me into all her problems and I told her multiple times I didn’t want to be apart of that. She got really upset that I didn’t want to be her friend then turned the whole group against me. Now I don’t have any friends and I’m constantly lonely. I don’t know what to do.

There was a girl whom I really liked, she was very sweet and very kind with me. But anytime she wanted something from me, I became very distant from her. Because I didn't want to mess up. And ended up almost forcing the most things. Like I couldn't shut down from all the stress. I felt really vulnerable besides her and I felt that she want to help me. But I constantly kept pushing her away.

What do I do now? I didn't really said no to anything for a long time before. But thankfully we ended up going apart in calmness. And I didn't feel more things to be forced. Now she's probably isn't interested. Since I ""left her hanging"". :( I mean I did but it wasn't because I didn't wanted her. Ever since then I'm having a bit other mentality.

I'm young (20M) in collage and its not too hard to find someone else but I'm not sure if I should. Maybe I should heal first and overcome the damage done to me so I can give my all to a relationship. Like I can't even look people in the eye, that's how scared of intimacy and I'm also scared of commitment now.

The thing is, I'm starting to fall for this girl who's a close friend and she kinda likes me too. We have a physical attraction at least because we joked around about being FWB once, but she's really amazing and sweet and totally my type in every way and I could go on forever in a dream state about her.

I know we'd make a good couple and she'd be an amazing girl to marry but I don't want to jump in too soon and ruin it and lose her. I think both of us need to mature or sort out some of our own issues first (she struggles to handle emotions sometimes and tends to lash out and doesn't communicate how she feels)

652,"Hello All,

I have a girlfriend that I love and care for dearly, but there are times where we talk about our future and I find myself worrying because everything involves money. I grew up being thrifty, and trying to save money at every chance I get. My gf on the other hand likes to spend money. 

When we talk about what we want in life, it always goes along the route of me saying something like ""yea, that would be awesome! We can save a lot of money if we do X ourselves!!!"" (I love working with my hands and learning new skills). She always responds with ""Or we can just pay someone to do the work for us"". As much as I understand wanting things to be done ""correctly"" the first time, I want the opportunity to save us money as much as possible, and I also believe the phrase ""if you want things done correctly you do it yourself"".  But I'm starting to get the feeling that these opportunities are never going to happen and that she will only want something done if we're paying someone else for it, and there's no point to doing it ourselves when we can pay someone else to do the task. 

I'm starting to get to a point where it makes me nervous, and I know we need to have a conversation but I don't know how to start the conversation or how to lead it through a helpful path so we are both happy. Any advice or tips on how to go about this?

I also want to note that I'm asking for advice on how to ""win the conversation"", just how to open the dialog.

659,"Hi.
I find myself in a very confusing and complicated situation and need advice on how to proceed. 
I’m currently not speaking to my best friend of a decade and I’m unsure of how I can repair things
We first met at eighteen. Dated for a few months. But we were both in a pretty weird place emotionally. 
her mum had just gone to rehab after being an alcoholic her whole life and I’d grown up around some very dangerous people, had recently gotten out of a very serious abusive relationship with someone ten years older than me, and had basically left my entire life behind and was adopted by her friendship group of queer mentally ill artists. I still see it as that she rescued me. 
We were both mad and it lead to a very toxic intense relationship where we’d both get black out drunk, she’d cheat on me, I’d flirt with people infront of her to try get her attention, sometimes we’d actually physically fight then laugh about it. 
It didn’t last we broke up then both near immediately got into abusive relationships with different people. We remained close and when we broke up with our partners we went on a trip to a city together. Argued, fucked, listened to life changing music and cried.  After that we decided to give things another go, she said she wasn’t ready to settle down. So I agreed to an open relationship while secretly resenting her for it. 
I know this all sound unbelievably toxic but we were both young and messed up and underneath it all really really loved each other like family at this point.
I gave her some ground rules being “don’t take anyone home if we are out at the club together, it makes me look like an idiot. Don’t date anyone.
The next time we went to the club she brought a dude she used to have a crush on back to her place shut herself in her bedroom him for a “chat” and left me sat at the kitchen table with our friends. I threw all the windows wide open because she has ocd and I knew it would annoy her, and smoked all the dudes weed. Then at some point I was like fuck it if you can’t beat them join them and we had a weird threesome. 
At some point I stopped taking my meds suddenly, because my abusive ex made me feel like I was a looser and was poisoning myself with fluoride by taking them or some shit. 
Sooo I had a psychotic break. Totally shut myself away from people. Well and truly lost my mind, paranoid delusions bouts of rage and constant mood swings. Don’t see the point of going into it but I wasn’t well, was hard to be around and she didn’t handle it fantastically. Towards the end I messaged her hysterical saying I was suicidal and she was basically sick of my crazy abusive shit at that point, it was her mothers birthday and she said something along the lines of “Im not dealing with this right now, Im watching a film with my mum, bye bye” The next day I saw her and said I felt like she wouldn’t be there for me if I was in crisis. When she could call me at any time and I’d do anything for her. She said she was upset I thought she wouldn’t be there for me. I said I think we should end this, she said there’s nothing to end, we are just friends. Which I was pretty hurt by because in my mind we’d been in an open relationship for a year. 
I felt entirely alone after that, went back to my abusive ex, which diddn’t last very long. 
After that we were like...  friends, but we’d spend Valentines together. Give each other gifts, give each other massages, we kissed a lot, had sex sometimes. Used to go out partying and had a lot of threesomes and the occasional orgy, acted like a couple everyone knew us as joined at the hip.
At this point I had feelings for her, tbh I never didn’t have feelings for her. The line between friends and lovers was too blurred. She was everything to me and she was incredibly independent and a complete socialite, where as I was more of a loner who found it hard to connect to people and make friends, so a lot of the time when I was meeting her it felt like I was booking a slot in her Calendar.
All through out our relationship/friendship she’d go through phases of saying she loved me back then pretend she’d never said that. For a while she fell in love with someone else, and she told me “I don’t love you, I’m In love with him” and I was pretty shocked and heartbroken, she was surprised I was surprised.
We were still sleeping together.
She never seemed to realise her words had an Affect on me. When she got into a relationship with a new girl I told her I was in love with her.
Thinking back I probably told her I was In love with her, asked her to be with me a bunch of times throughout the years, and depending on where we were at she was either in love with me too but diddn’t think we’d work as a couple, wasn’t ready, or diddn’t feel the same. Our relationships probably sounds entirely toxic and ridiculous to others but we were both just very messed up people who cared about each other very much. She was my other half. She has a physically disability and I have a neurological disability, we used to call each other Jenny and forest, or Lenny and George. We’d talk about one day getting married, or having a baby together. 
So, she told me she was moving to Brighton for work a for year. And I was unhappy, but fine, before she left she told me that she did love me back, she said She was just in denial before, of corse Shes in love with me and has been all along. It’s like nothing She’s ever felt before but it’s love. she told me again and again nothing would change, that we’d see each other twice a month. As soon as she moved she seemed to regret it and talked all the time about coming home as soon as her lease was up. We argued sometimes, because when I went up to visit I’d stay a week and spend the whole time with her, but when she’d come to visit she’d make time for all her Norfolk friends and fit in an afternoon with me. 
It wasn’t entirely fair of me to be upset by it because she has family here, and obviously wanted to spend time with them, and her other friend I’m just clingy, I have serious abandonment issues and can get really depressed over small stuff because of my past trauma. I felt frustrated I’d spent 100’s of pounds I couldn’t afford visiting her when it was the first time In my life I’d taken the train long distance on my own and it was incredibly difficult for me. It just diddn’t feel like she was prioritising me in the same way. So I’d get needy, and entitled. Then apologise. 
I asked her to be in a long distance relationship with me while she was there, she said she couldn’t because she’s addicted to the honeymoon period and it would be like jumping straight in to being an old married couple. Right after that she got into a new relationship with a guy, let’s call him chad. I asked her to come visit me in my new house, it was massive deal for me because of my neurological issues, I was 26 and had always lived with my mother who was quite emotionally abusive, but was desperate to be independent. The first time she came to visit she brought her new boyfriend. We had a small argument over this but In the end I decided it didn’t matter, I’d like to meet her new boyfriend and played host to both of them. While they were there she said to me infront of chad “I’ve told him, about us, that we are In love” which I found pretty awkward. 
Her boyfriend was never particularly bothered by our complicated relationship because homophobia. 
She later came to visit again on her own for my house warming party and we had a very sexually charged conversation and exchanged a horny look. 
I ended up getting with a girl over the summer and she said she was heartbroken and jealous 
Then maybe a couple of weeks later she got pregnant. 
I was obviously a little heartbroken but I was a teenage mother myself so the most important thing to me at that time was putting my own feelings aside and supporting her. Pregnancy is such a huge life changing thing my feelings were very petty in comparison. 
Just after she had the baby she was having problems with her boyfriend, he was being emotionally unsupportive and using the fact that she had a Caesarean and couldn’t get out of bed to take control. She was very depressed, in a bad place and was terrified he was trying to take the baby away from her. 
She came to visit with the baby. While she was here and I was helping her she said “If me and chad broke up would you raise the baby as your own?” 
I’m sure she wasn’t serious but obviously I was like 😍😍😍😍😍
The next day she went home because chad diddn’t want to spend too much time apart from the baby but when she got back she found He had been drinking heavily the night before and went straight to bed. 
She messaged me saying that she wished she could have spent an extra night with me where she’d feel 100 times more loved and a hundred times more supported. 
She kept talking about how much she missed our home county and how she was desperate to move back. She sent me links to houses for sale half an hour from where I live and told me that was her dream, that she was excited. Maybe a month later she tells me she’s buying a house. In Brighton. 
I was absolutely heartbroken. She kept saying that it wasn’t a big deal, that it was no more of a commitment than renting, that I don’t understand how buying a house works, which was frustrating to me because it felt like she was using my disability to lie to me. 
I flipped my lid and basically said You need to be careful about what you say, your words affect people and it sets me up for disappointment when you tell people something then do something else.
She basically said she hasn’t lead me on, that things change and life is unpredictable that I need to let go on expectation and free myself.
I said I diddn’t sign up for long distance, that I can’t handle it, that I didn’t want a relationship like she and Bethany has (Bethany is a very close childhood friend of hers she sees maybe a couple of times a year) 
And she said she loves Bethany so what’s the difference 
I said I was in love with her so obviously it’s different I’m absolutely heartbroken having to sit here and watch her move on with someone else.
She said she had no idea I felt like that, we decided on having some time apart but it never happened because we speak every day and find it hard to be apart. 
I apologised for blowing up at her. I just repress everything and act like I’m fine for so long I end up exploding. Things went back to normal for a couple of months, she sent me an Audi car advert where two teenage lesbian best friends who are separated by adversity, one of them gets married to a man while the lesbians sadly gaze at each other, then she leaves the man and they run off into the sunset to raise a child together, the add ends with “Audi, years in the making”
She sends me this along with a bunch of broken hearts and crying faces and says “it’s us” I feel frustrated by this as I’ve literally just had a conversation with her like a week ago saying she needs to be careful with how she speaks to me because I’m in love with her. But still love it. 
She sends me the video for my girl by the National where a couple romantically slow dances and says it reminds her of me. 
She talks often about how she couldn’t marry Chad. Because she’s always going to be polyamorous at heart, and he isn’t, so something would have to change. I doubt Chad knows this. 
At this point I’m suffering from quite severe mental health problems, mainly agoraphobia so we see less of each other. I try talk to her about my depression but it feels like when I do her responses are like “everyone is depressed, you aren’t that special, you might think all these people have these shiny glowing lives but everyone Is mad underneath it all.”
I’m not saying “your so lucky your life is perfect and mine is a piece of shit” I just want her to acknowledge that I’m going through a really difficult time. 
I find it really hard to open up about stuff and when I go to someone in desperation because my mental health is out of control hearing “everyone has problems, you need to stop comparing yourself to others” just feels gutting tbh. 
Though out the years I send countless love songs written for her, I ask her if it’s inappropriate and should I stop, she says nah she loves it. 
Things go along as usual until she starts renovating the house. She’s posting these pictures on insta of her house being totally gutted and new floors and kitchen being put in and it just stings because I keep thinking of her lying to me saying it isn’t a big deal and it’s no more commitment than renting when I was begging her to just be honest with me. One day it just hits me she’s actually gone, she isn’t coming back. I’m with my son at the time. And keep going to the bathroom and silently sobbing. The next day I ask my mum to have him and stay in bed all day crying like a teenager who’s been dumped. I don’t want to talk to her about it because I know it’ll just end up in a blow up, but I do, and it does. She acted totally shocked that I was in love with her, said she had no idea. That she was in denial because she wanted us to be best friends so badly. And when she sent that stuff it was just a “queer best friend thing” It ends me with saying I love her but need some time to move on from this because as things are not right between us. She agrees. We talk about two day’s later and she sends me a very frustrating patronising message that puts all of the responsibility on me. Says she’s angry at me for making her feel guilty for moving when she’s already finding it difficult away from her friends and family. 
Basically says things are toxic, I’ve been abusive. 
I blow up on her again, basically saying waaah waah you told me we were going to be together forever then left, I thought you wanted to spend your life with me even if we diddn’t work as a couple. I was naive to ever believe you, then I blocked her, then messaged her on WhatsApp telling her to message me when she’s ready to talk. And we haven’t spoken since. 

I don’t know what to do because she is an amazing person, she is generous and loving and kind and goes above and beyond for everyone. 
I want to be her friend but I feel so messed up over this gaslighting and mixed signals. I feel like her self esteem is so wobbly she can’t handle any criticism without immediately hearing “you are a terrible person” so she just Denys any wrong doing. 
She has two levels “I will never forgive myself” or “that never happened, I diddn’t say that” I’m so confused and messed up over it at this point I don’t even know what i want from her, or what I want for myself.
Honestly I just want some time apart so we can move on and be friends without any weirdness. I don’t want her to accept all the responsibility. I know I’m a nightmare sometimes. I just want her to accept her part in this and stop lying to me and herself.",24Feb2020,1

He eventually opened up about his ex and told me she was pretty immature and that things didn't work out between them because of how manipulative and emotionally damaged and unstable she was. I honestly never had a problem with her or being ""jealous"" as I usually am, until a few months ago. My boyfriend's dad and his girlfriend invited my boyfriend's ex over for dinner while we were together. What the heck!!! I have never felt so uncomfortable before. So my boyfriend told his dad that he wasn't comfortable with it but his dad did it anyways, they just went out to a restaurant instead of eating in. After the dinner, she texted him and talked about how ""special"" it was to be reunited with his family and catch up on everything. I asked him to show me the message, and she called him ""ducky"" which I'm assuming was a nickname. Then she texted him again and wished him a happy birthday, and he answered and said thanks (being polite) and said he hoped she was well. So she of course goes on to talk about what university she's in and what she's taking blah blah blah. Anyway I just recently asked if he could delete her as a contact because I felt weird that he still had her. And he said sure and he did it right there. 

My problem is not being jealous of her or anything. I also trust my boyfriend with my whole heart and know he loves me. but I mostly feeling really insecure around my boyfriend's dad and his girlfriend. It is worrisome to me that they will never like me as much as her because they were together for so long and his dad even felt the need to have dinner with her privately while his son and I were in a relationship.

669," 

I've got a problem and I was wondering if any of you had any thoughts on whether I'm being totally unreasonable.

I  share a car with someone, and though we use the car separately most of  the time, once a week we have about a 100 mile trip to do together. This  other person does not particularly enjoy driving, and has poor eyesight,  and I just feel anxious whenever I have to be a passenger when they are  driving on the highway. It has gotten to the point where I'm already  stressing out about having to do the trip the night before, fearing that  I might not end up being the driver.

So  the other day I mentioned this to them and asked them if they would  mind letting me drive the shared weekly journey we have. I realized I  was asking a 'favor' of sorts, given that it is me who has this fear of  being a passenger when they're driving. But I didn't think it was a  crazy thing to ask given that it's been stressing me out so much.

But  their reaction was extremely negative, and ended up with them shouting  at me. Basically they think it is totally unacceptable to ask this, and  are really angry about it. At this point I said I'd just take the train, and asked them to get their own insurance policy since I'm the policy holder currently. When they saw that they would be paying significantly more if they were the primary driver, they asked me if we could keep the current policy and they could just reimburse me every month. I guess I'm just wondering what people think of all this:  Is it really that big of a deal letting  someone else drive once a week, when they do plenty of other driving on  the other days? To me it seems like on the one side there's me, who is anxious about a weekly trip and is asking for some minor accommodation, on the other there's someone who doesn't really care either way but it taking some stance out of 'principle' or something, feeling wronged in some way. This doesn't make sense to me, as I'd obviously prefer to not have this disagreement at all, it's not like I'm asking them just to annoy them. Also, do you think I should I keep my insurance policy even if not using the car, or ask them to get their own even though it's a lot more expensive for them? 

Anyway thanks for any advice.",24Feb2020,1

671,"This problem comes mainly from my overthinking and low self esteem but I've got a very good long time friend that I'm really afraid of losing, she's been my helpful hand through some bad times and I've been her's, from time to time when she's in a bad mood she'd completly cut off, we've had some arguments over this in the past but it's all settled now.

We talk on a daily basis and recently she will barely talk to me at all, usually at least at the end of the day she'd start up a conversation or me or in other case we'd just talk all day every day. As I wrote earlier she barely talks to me now, I figured out she just has a bad mood but she reassured me it wa not the case. Her responses are very vague as if they were written out of neccesity so I'm not mad or something. It's been like that only for a few days so I'm sure it's nothing and it will be back as it was in a matter of a few days but I'm very affraid of us growing apart.

This raises my question should I just give her time?

672," I'll start with this for no reason other than these things I need help with all seem to form a circle with each other:  The only thing I feel constant passion for is lifting and physical self-improvement. My rest days are excruciating, all I do is sit around and refresh youtube/ reddit for several hours straight. When I try to do other things (that I'd like to believe I'm fond of) such as drawing or playing video games I instantly get bored after a few minutes and stop. My college program (comp science) is very easy and while I enjoy the topic, I don't really care about getting better at it during my free time.

The problem is that I am not sleeping well, and it's heavily impacting my gym performance, which heavily impacts my mindset. I get 6hours of sleep on average despite going to bed early, eating the right things, not taking caffeine after noon, you name it. Every weekend, it happens that I let the boredom get to me or have an extremely bad gym day, making me resort to eating stupid amounts of whatever the fuck my eyes spot in the kitchen. I eat until I'm on the verge of puking, then eat more when I feel like I can handle it again, and repeat.

This reoccurring pattern has been happening since I lost 45kg about 2 years ago. When I try to lose fat I seem to be more disciplined with binging and I never do it, but essentially this going back and forth from cutting and lean bulking has caused my muscle growth to stagnate for the past year, which has completely fucked over my mental state.

673,"I'm asking advice for 2 reasons.

1, my girlfriend means everything to me, but she has a lot of struggles and I wanna help her.

2, it's putting a strain on me and my stress levels.


So a little background. My girlfriend moved over from America to live with me. She was setting up her visa and her job over here. Everything was going well. She had a bit of anxiety in general and had gone through a horrible past (her mother passing when she was younger and her father recently passing). But I loved her for who she was. No one is perfect.

When she first moved every was going well, she had meet with her new job. Was sorting out her visa through her job and was enjoying being around me. I did too. Having her close by was fantastic!

After 3 months things started to drain on me. Sometimes she would wake up and be happy. The. Next she would wake up and something would be upsetting her. She wouldn't really talk much, she would stay silent and wouldn't engage in anyway. I would often ask her and she would either stare at me blankly or just say nothing.

However, she would eventually tell me the problem and they seem so small. I know it's different for everyone when they are dealing with their own demons, but it just seem such small problems and petty issues. For example, when our friends would ask her about America she wouldnt like it. She didn't want to be associated with America cause it brought up bad memories. Which is fair enough. But should would be upset about it weeks after it happened.

Another example is, she got really intense and emotional about the news when it was talking about the issues between Iraq and America at the beginning of this year. She was saying, ""Why does the country have to be so fucked up. Can't one good thing just happen in my life."" 

I would try to tell her that she need to focus on her life and fuck what is going on. She needs to worry about her. But she would say her past was making it hard for her to stay positive. Which I get. But she needs to move on. Easy said than done, but I feel like she hasn't even tried.

Her negative has continued and gone on for so long.... I worry sometimes cause I don't wanna wake up to another negative day! I've had depression in the past and I'm over that now, I wanna move forward. Just feel she wants to stay in the past.

674,"(I’m German, I’ll try to be comprehensible)
So my partner and I want to start a family and because he has started a new job recently and will be out of probation end of May, we will start trying then. In Germany everybody has a 6 month period of probation when starting a new job, in which the employer and employees can end the contract from one day to the other.

Now I have searched for a new better job for nearly a year now, without success. Currently I have a very stressful job to the point where it takes its toll on my health. The positive thing about this job: I’m hired for an unlimited period of time. So I can’t get fired very easy and will have no worries for the time I need to take care for a newborn baby. I tried to don’t let the stress of work get to me, but I’m just the type that wants to do a good job, so I rarely say no to tasks given and try to do them perfectly/as good as I can.

I need advice whether I should keep searching for a new job (risking that I’ll find one, but get pregnant during probation and then get fired as soon as they can (as far as I know employers can’t fire pregnant women and parents who take time off to care for a newborn), therefore having no job if everything goes wrong) or staying at my current job (risking getting deeper into my depressive moods)

Finances are not an issue at all, as I completed 2 years of college in high school and am set with a statewide pre-paid program along with other scholarships. 

She keeps telling me I need to start clepping exams so I can get through college faster, she’s gone as far as to order some books from amazon regarding the exams. Everyday she asks  how far along in the books I am, and I usually just make up a number to please her.

She tells me I need to make up an exam I missed in high school  twice a day, I tell her I already have a date set up with my teacher to complete the exams, to which she responds with I need to be studying for it. 

For the past few days she’s told me I need to fix a side panel on my car that’s a little wonky, I’ve gone to a few stores to find the right piece but I haven’t had any luck, I told her I’m going to order it, and just now she called me to see if I had placed the order yet (I have). 

These are just this weekends events, and once they get resolved there will be another set for the week, as this pattern has been persistent since I picked out the school I’m going to.

We had already tried oral sex, but when he tried to have intercourse, I would stop him and tell him I wasn't quite ready. He would be loving, kind, understanding and we would start doing something else.
One night, I stayed at his place. We ended up in the same predicament. He asked me if he should go look for a condom or not. I remember him being very kind and sweet about it. But I still wasn't ready. I was horny af, but not ready for sex. So I just looked at him, quietly, not knowing what to think. Should I just try it? Maybe you're never ever ready, I thought. I was thinking all those things and he took out a condom from his drawer and we had sex. It was awkward, a little painful and not as romantic or at least emotional as I thought. I expected we would hug after, but he just patted my shoulder and got up. We had sex for a year after that and we would cuddle afterwards, but we didn't that first time.

Because hes struggled with GPA in the past he needs to get at least a C+ in both to pass. Hes in a really hard science and tech degree program, and I know hes super smart but he is afraid that he wont make it. Despite the college being great, the professors dont really care about their students in his program. He asks for help and they just... don't. They're vague, misunderstanding the struggles of their students, and/or make no effort to meet with students after office hours. Most of them are researchers first and teachers regrettably second. And the deans dont care cause a teacher can teach however they see fit, as hes been told.

It's like the odds are stacked against him, harshly.

He knows he has my support and I'm with him with or without a degree. With or without a job. I'm here for him. That's not his concern. His biggest concern and stress his is family. 

His mom is a helicopter parent and his dad... well his dad is distant now but was very... aggressive when they were young. His parents are split and because of life his dad is the only one that can cosign for loans and lords that over my bf. Bf has already needed to extend his college years by 1 year and his dad as said that if he doesn't graduate this semester he isnt helping anymore. 

Hes an out of state student so his tuition is huge. Staying one semester for just one or two classes isnt ideal. His debt is massive. We're both terrified!


What I'm really wondering, now that you know the background, how do I help my bf if he doesn't graduate? How to I help with the pressure from the family? How to I help him with the shame and guilt from his family? How to I help him find purpose in a job that wasn't he was planning for? I want so desperately to help with his classes but I was an animal nerd. Hes doing hardcore science! I want so desperately to help...

TLDR: my boyfriend is super stressed from his wreck of a family and might not graduate with 2 classes left. How do i help him in the event of the worse case scenario?",24Feb2020,1
684,"We broke up in the beginning of December, about 2 weeks before that he said I had 40 days to get better (not having depression any longer and lose weight). I'm the one that decided to cut things short because I knew I wouldn't be at his expectations by that time. It's probably worth mentioning that we were together for a bit over 2 years and that I was miserable most of the time.

I had blocked his number, but recently unblocked it because he would anyways use a friend's phone to send me messages. A few days ago I agreed to meet him and I told him that I didn't want him in my life and to stop contacting me. It seemed like he understood, but apparently not as he continues to send messages.

Now his saying that he misses me, when we were still together and I'd say that after he'd been upset at me over something, he'd laugh.

691,"Hey Reddit,  


Today I enrolled in a real estate course at a local college. I don't really want to pursue a career in real estate but I do want to learn the ins and outs of the real estate industry so I can be a better investor in real estate.  


I've sat through many college classes before and usually the format goes like this:  


* You attend the scheduled class dates
* Listen to a lecture which is basically a carbon copy of the material in the book only vocal
* Receive tests to score you on your retention.  


It pondered to me that I can teach myself all of this material as I've become a self-learner over the years. I find I can learn at my own pace and actually learn more by studying the subject with the intent to learn rather than store the information temporarily to pass exams.  


Do you think I should stick it out and attend the classes or just buy the books and teach myself the content?

703,"First of all I wanna give some context to the situation I am currently in. In where I live currently school is suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak. In April I am going to have a public exam that will basically determine what universities/subjects I can go to/take. Because of this I will not be going to school anymore as a ‘study break’ to prepare for the said exam. (Based on this you probably already know where I’m from haha)

Here I’m not trying to brag or anything (I’d like to apologise in advance if it appears so) but as context I am the ‘good’ students in my class. In terms of results/scores/performance I usually am the top-scorer. This is because I used to be really motivated, self-disciplined and enjoyed learning about the subjects. 

The problem is, now that I no longer have to go to school, I have lost all motivation and energy to study or even do anything. Back when I was going to school daily I had the motivation to study because I knew everyone had high hopes and expectations on me and I used to have really high expectations on myself as well. But now all I do is stay at home all day (because of the virus outbreak many places are closed so there really isn’t much to do outside) and just do nothing except browsing the internet. I can no longer feel that drive and passion to study anymore. I feel like this has become worse lately since I start to lose motivation to do other stuff as well (like playing music, reading...) 

I don’t wanna sound too negative but this really makes me hate myself. The public exam coming up is really important to me and I know for sure that I need to study to get into the university that I had always wanted to go to, and also I don’t want to disappoint my parents/friends/teachers. I had set plans for myself. I wrote them all out, like what to do for each day, which subjects to revise, etc. But now I have messed up all my plans. 

This all started one day when I decided to watch some tv drama after studying (I never watched any tv drama before. I used to think that tv drama is a waste of time) and I just couldn’t stop after that. I kept finding more and more to watch and for almost a month I did nothing but just watching more and more of them. This messed up my whole schedule. I ditched all my plans for studying. I stayed up until morning and slept during the day, ate fast food, didn’t exercise. I felt like I completely changed. 

A few days ago I decided that this all was enough. I need to get myself back on track. But I just couldn’t. I tried all the ways that I used to do in the past to get myself motivated. I tried playing some music while studying. I tried to move to a different room to study. I tried to reward myself with snacks. I just couldn’t do it. My brain is completely blank and I don’t even have the strength to write with a pen. I feel devastated. I feel very guilty for completely giving up on all my plans. I know I need to change but I don’t have the drive to do it. 

I tried talking to my friends about this and asked for their advice but since all of them are also really busy preparing for the exam as well there really wasn’t much that they could do to help me (Don’t get me wrong they are really trying to help me too). So here I am trying to ask for advice on reddit. Does anyone here know what to do, or just any general advice on what I can try to work on first? 

Also I think part of the reason I am being so lazy and so ‘not me’ is because I feel really lonely from not being able to go outside much? I feel like I have so much emotions and thoughts inside me that I just want to let out but don’t know who I could share with (I don’t really have much friends apart from two or three close ones because I am quite introverted and not really comfortable with talking to people irl), so another reason of me posting here is to find some people to talk to...

Thank you for reading this and sorry if you couldn’t understand what I say since English isn’t my first language and it’s my very first time posting on reddit (I’m kinda scared and nervous!!)",24Feb2020,1
704,"Hospital negligence (spine) - WA State

I had an emergency c-section in January after I had been induced for labor a few days prior. Before the c-section I had an epidural placed for pain management. The c-section occurred due to “failure to progress” and was successful. Baby was born healthy and is doing great.

However, after the c-section surgery we were taken to a recovery room. A nurse told me she would take out the epidural catheter from my spine, but when she pulled it out part of the catheter was lodged in my spine. A doctor came by and told the nurse that she should have called for assistance if she felt resistance when pulling it out.

Long story short - I had a CT scan later that day showing that part of the epidural catheter was still in my spine. The next morning I had a laminectomy (spinal surgery) to have it removed. I was unable to pick up my baby for weeks due to back pain and weakness. I needed help getting on/off the toilet, etc. after the spinal surgery. I do not know the lasting effects this could have on me as I get older.

The hospital has written off any charges related to the spinal surgery. But I still think they should be held liable for the unnecessary back surgery I had. It took me away from my newborn baby /‘s set us back in breastfeeding (she had to be given a bottle at 1 day old while I was out of the room for surgery and I was on pain meds).

The nurse who pulled out the epidural catheter had been telling my husband and I about her 5 month old grandson who has in the ICU for RSV. She was very worried about him and was checking her phone and leaving the room to take calls. She was distracted when she was pulling out the catheter. 

The consent form for the epidural placement did not state anything about the potential of it being stuck/lodged in the spine during removal or that it could lead to spinal surgery for removal.

I have called a few attorneys in my area and all have referred me to other attorneys or said they aren’t taking cases like mine at this time. So I’m going at this alone. I sent a letter to the leaders of the hospital/organization outlining my grievance and have received a call from their Risk Management office. I spoke with someone there who apologized that this happened to me and said I could file a claim with the hospital for compensation. I received a letter from the hospital with additional information they want in order to submit a claim and determine compensation, if any.

They are asking for the amount I believe I should be compensated, how I determined this amount, and why I believe the the hospital is liable.

I do not know how to write up the amount I should be compensated. I’d like it to include the fact that I had spinal surgery with a lasting scar, the spinal surgery could affect my back as I age, I required physical assistance and care by family members at home, I was unable to care for my newborn for weeks. It was a humiliating and horrifying experience. 

Thank you for any advice!",24Feb2020,1
705,"I'm not sure how people will respond to this one but this is a pretty big issue for us right now and need some perspective. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. Things have generally been great, and we love and care for one another very much. However, one issue has been affecting us more than anything else and we are at a crossroads on how to resolve it.

We became boyfriend and girlfriend out of weird circumstances; we met in college in a large friend group, then became close personal friends, but I was trapped in a long distance relationship (which was incredibly toxic) with someone who was making plans to move to my state (VA) but not following through. Even though we had developed feelings for one another, my status as taken obviously prevented us from getting together. We lived in a strange ""will they or won't they/Pam and Jim"" realm for a few months. 

Between October 2018 and February 2019 our friendship got closer and our feelings were stirring, but he didn't dare make a move because of my situation. During this time, he opened up to me about his personal life, including how most of his friends are online, including the girl who has been the controversial subject of our entire relationship: I'll call her Suzy.

Suzy and my bf ""Jim"" met on Tumblr about 5 years prior to our friendship really blossoming (they met in 2014, we became close at the end of 2018). Because of my status as taken (but very unhappy), we opened up to each other in a raw, authentic way that we would not have done otherwise if we had been romantically interested. He told me details about how Suzy and him shared an incredibly close bond through skyping, gaming, and talking over the past 5 years. They had helped each other through depression, and they did have a romantic relationship for 4 months towards the beginning, which ended due to the distance (opposite ends on the United States) her liking someone from her hometown. At the time (and still) Jim told me about Suzy, she had been in a relationship with someone from her state for 3 years, so time had passed since their romantic involvement, but they still remained incredibly close (and I think, too close) for being online opposite gender friends.

While I started to develop feelings for Jim, he opened up to me and told me how wonderful she is, complete with descriptions about all their wonderful talks, skypes, gaming, etc. He described her as ""the one 10 out of 10"" he had ever dated, ""because even though we didnt work out romantically I still really care for her and we're always there for each other"". He reiterated that she had since found someone else, but frequently expressed bitterness towards this person. At the time, Jim and Suzy still talked and gamed regularly and a few times he admitted to me that he wished she was closer so that he could've had a better shot. 

This was incredibly hard for me to hear at the time. I was mustering up the courage to leave my  relationship at the time while harboring feelings for Jim, who seemed to have mixed feelings of acceptance and bitterness about his relationship with Suzy. By the time February rolled around we got closer, and I had done some curious online sleuthing about her; he had liked every single profile picture or instagram picture of hers (except the ones that contained her boyfriend) for the past 5 years, and had commented many sweet things on the older ones before she had a boyfriend. My heart sank, knowing that if we were to be together, I'd have to compete with not only an ex, but one with which he still had had a strong emotional connection to, forged only between the two of them over Tumblr, in their own little world. 

Jim actually tried to facilitate a friendship between Suzy and I in February (I think, perhaps, knowing we would get together and testing the waters to see how we would interact). He added us both to a discord group (with one other friend) and tried to get us to like each other. The result was a mess. I was polite and civil, but she immediately became distant and messaged him saying she ""doesn't really like girls"" and told him she was uncomfortable. She and I actually later talked once in May, after we got together, and I confronted her saying I apologize if I had done something wrong. She responded apologetically, saying that she's protective of Jim because he's her best friend. Although I'm glad she apologized, I thought to myself ""politely fuck off. You have a boyfriend and you've never met Jim in person. You don't have a right to be acting like you're  the one who needs to be protecting him."" 

Fast forward to March of 2019, and Jim and I finally admitted our feelings to one another and began dating. It had been a long time coming, but I finally left my toxic relationship and we fell into each other and it felt right. Everything about us has been wonderful, except for my feelings toward him and Suzy.

Jim reiterated at the start of our relationship that he had no romantic feelings for Suzy, which I 100% believe. Jim is a loyal person. We share a common friend group, and they agreed too. But Jim is also fiercely loyal to his friends and sometimes doesn't see when friendships can be inappropriate boundary-wise. Jim and Suzy continued to talk very regularly, which really, really made me insecure.  Jim never lied about talking or gaming with her when he did, and it was his openness about it that hurt me even more. I was filled with jealousy a few times when I saw them talking on a discord channel I had been added to (with his other gaming friends). One day as I was having dinner with my friend he told me he'd use the time to have a phone call with Suzy, 2ho apparently was having a bad day and needed a shoulder to cry on. This made me incredibly upset; why does she need to be calling up my new boyfriend, who she's never met in person when she has a boyfriend of her own, to talk about her problems? I understand and believe that nothing fishy was going on, but the sheer fact that they continued to be close considering what I had heard and had to hear before Jim and I were romantically involved, made me incredibly uncomfortable. 

I began to become more vocal about my discomfort. One day at dinner in the early stages of our relationship he showed me an art piece that she had created and sent to him, and I later mentioned how I really didn't like him bringing her up on our dates. He soon began to realize the extent of my discomfort, and he began to stop talking about her. However, I still saw evidence of her wanting to talk to him, especially in ways that I didn't find appropriate. A few times over his shoulder I saw her sending him photos of new haircuts or outfits, asking his opinion on them. One particular time I saw that he had responded ""10/10"" to a picture of her new bangs; a style that Ive always had, and which also upset me because of the comment he once made about her being ""the one 10 out of 10"".

I, admittedly, spiraled out of control. To my own discredit, he caught me snooping on his messages a few times, and laid down the boundary that snooping is absolutely not okay and he'd be more than happy to show me his messages if I'm concerned. I absolutely agree with this boundary, and I'm sorry I did it. 

Things have been difficult for the past few months. I'll get upset over a message that pops up on his phone from her. I constantly worry that they're going to phone call or skype call when I'm away or unavailable. I know he doesn't love her anymore, but I view her as emptionally codependent on him and him as too kind to hurt her. I harbor fears that, given the choice if we both lived in the same state, he would have picked her over me. 

Jim's made an active effort to decrease communication dramatically. They don't skype anymore, or game, and they didnt talk for a few weeks in January. Their communication really did decrease, but in January they had a conversation (which popped up on his laptop that I briefly saw) about how they haven't talked in a while and had made plans to discord call, and when she called him out for not talking as much he said ""I don't want to be complacent with this friendship, im sorry I've just been busy"". He hasn't told her the real reason for him backing off because he doesn't want to put me in a bad light or hurt her feelings. Most recently, he pulled open his phone and I saw him message her the words ""Talk to me."", which is something he commonly says when I'm having a bad day and wants me to process it. Maybe I'm crazy for being jealous of him saying it to her, but him saying that most likely means that she was coming to him about a personal issue, and I am absolutely not comfortable with my boyfriend being her personal therapist. I understand friends talk to each other, but with all the other info involved in this scenario, I don't like this. I've blocked her from social media so I dont see her, but I'm still constantly worried about them.

We are at a crossroads now. Although Jim has tried to decrease communication and hide his entire friendship so that I don't get upset, it keeps happening. I am constantly nervous, anxious, and upset, wondering how often and when they talk. I've tried to be understanding, but it's at the point where I'm so done thinking about this girl and her involvement in his life, even if it wasn't what it used to be. I believe she is codependent, clingy, and too attached to Jim. I believe Jim is well-meaning and trying to keep both of us happy, but not ballsy enough to completely detatch from her.

We've gone back and forth enough to the point where I'm done with this. Every single thing that comes up results in a long talk, and although he does validate my feelings and says its a sucky position for me to be in and that he's more than happy to help me through this, he maintains that he does not want to end the friendship: ""I have already decreased communication. That should be enough."" And he says that ""this isn't affecting us whatsoever--she isn't trying to date me and I don't have feelings for her"", he doesn't seem to understand that with this entire context, this friendship IS affecting us. He thinks that just because nothing inappropriate is currently happening, that that doesn't mean that boundaries can still be broken and the friendship can be toxic to our relationship. I'm not asking him not to have girl friends. I'm not asking him to isolate himself from a large friend group to avoid a girl he used to have a crush on. I want to finally, once and for all. 

The final straw was when I opened his sketchbook of drawings (last weekend, with his permission) just for fun and came across the spitting image of her, from a year ago. I had a panic and anger attack, asking myself why the HELL does this girl keep popping up everywhere in my life?

I consulted my therapist and even his best friend. I want to lay the hammer down and tell him that if we are to continue this relationship, he needs to choose between ending his friendship with Tumblr girl who he never met, or consider losing the girl who wants to spend her life with him. I know I'm not perfect in the way I've handled this; having anxiety and a trauma disorder and abandoment issues absolutely affect this. However, I am planning on sitting him down on Friday and telling him that he needs to end this friendship entirely. His best friend (also my friend) agrees that this would be beneficial for us. My therapist and i have been talking about it.

So Reddit....am I the asshole for this? I seriously don't want to be controlling, and i know in relationships sometimes you need to tolerate and deal with feelings of jealousy, but I really don't trust or like this girl and I can't imagine going through this otherwise wonderful relationship constantly dealing with this. 

Tldr; thinking of asking/telling my boyfriend he needs to end his friendship with a girl who has made me uncomfortable since the beginning of our relationship. Is this too much of a reach, or is appropriate to ask?",24Feb2020,1
706,"Summary: My cat is missing and I need more ways I can help find him.

My cat, Zorro, was a very young stray cat (he's a domestic cat now) when we adopted him and got him sterilised along with his sister and her child. They're outdoor cats so we just feed them and we get to pet them and we have a good bond with them. They usually hang around outside the house on the porch which is where they sleep and get fed and they play with each other around the garden. But last Friday (It's Monday now) Zorro didn't show up for any of the meal times and we haven't seen him since Thursday evening. The cats are always here and the longest one has been missing was a day and a half. My family and I have the strongest bond with Zorro so it's strange that he would just not show up for multiple days as he loves us and his food.

I have walked round the garden rattling food in a container, we've alerted our neighbourhood but there's not much we can do as there are too many places he could go (we live in Spain and the houses are really spaced out) and there is simply no reason as to why he would leave. He's not been chipped yet so we can't find him like that. I don't know what else I can do. Does anyone have any ideas? 

More Details:

Fast forward to present day, Ive recently taken up darts and I’m quickly becoming a great player. So much so that I’ve become friends with many of the top local players, and I regularly practice at their houses (seeing as they’re all in their 50’s and have their own places). 

This is where it gets complicated. My good friend’s daughter is regularly hanging around when I come over to throw darts and she is exactly my type. We instantly hit it off and I haven’t felt like that while talking to someone in a long time. We constantly talk and she never hangs around until I show up.. 

My buddy’s a carpenter hobbyist and I am a carpenter by trade, so we have begun doing these fun little projects together too. I don’t want to make things awkward if I asked him for permission to ask his daughter out for dinner or something. What if he says yes then she rejects me.. or he says gtfo my house and never come back fool. 

I am aiming to be the best dart player in my country, and my buddy is easily top 10. If this backfired on me I’ll never forgive myself and it’ll tarnish my darting career forever. In a pure mental game I’d stand no chance playing against him if it went south. Do I just ask and suck up the punishment if any?",24Feb2020,1
708,"Long story short, I was put on some medicine for my anxiety. It’s worked for the most part. I had very little anxiety attacks, and I feel like it’s helping me mellow out. However one of the side effects is it makes me gain weight much easier. 

However I should admit, I’m not eating well. Like fast food every other day. It’s hard to work out because of where I live. I like to go for walks or runs, but the weather has gone bad. 

I don’t think going off the meds is a good idea because I’ve felt good about many things in my life for such a long time. 

My main thing is, how would lose weight fast and safely, and how can I stick to it?",24Feb2020,1

When this happens I uncontrollably try to remove every bit of sebum and oil from pores in easily accessible places on my face. It really embarrasses me, and although it has become less and less of a symptom over the last year and a half, I still have it. How do you talk your way out of an episode? I talk to myself inside and outside of my head, trying to convince myself there are better and less destructive things that I can do but I still havent ever been successful in stopping unless I begin to have panic about how long I've been at the mirror.

I have been living with my grandmother for a while (sadly) and my cousin also lives there. So she would come to the house without me knowing to go see him. She wouldn’t even speak to me she would just go to the basement where his room is. Since she’s around my family so much, I feel like shes way too much involved in my family. She knows about family secrets and information thats wayy too much. I use to have boundaries when it comes to family/ home life and my friends. But there seems not to be any at all anymore. And it’s out of my control. It doesn’t even feel like were friends anymore. Am i wrong for telling her i just want space away from her? I feel like she doesn’t understand and doesn’t see anything wrong with her actions. All her and my cousin do is talk about each other. And my cousin always try’s to make it as if it’s a competition about who knows her best. Then on top of that, whenever i go out with my friends. He knows exactly what im doing 24/7, because she (my bestfriend) would tell him, its like i have no privacy or boundaries or a life that’s my own if it’s involving her because word gets back to him and my family.",24Feb2020,1

She is studying abroad in Rome (I’m from the states) and we already have some challenges facing the time differences and the distance itself, but today she told me some news. When she first left she found herself in a new friend group, which included both guys and girls and I wasn’t upset, I had no reason to be. However, the news was: one of those guy friends told her she had a crush on him. She claimed to have enforced our relationship on him and told him to leave after he said what he did, but I don’t like it one bit. I feel as if I could yack and or punch an immovable object. Maybe I have underlying trust issues, but more so I feel disrespected by him and I’m scared he’s going to push to make something happen with her. I do trust that she will prevent him from making a move, but I know how a guy’s brain works (unfortunately). I’m still not sure how to react, she asked me not to reach out to him and I asked her to stop the, very few, one on one hangouts they’ve had. I also had a weird feeling about this guy from the start, but I couldn’t pin point why. I feel powerless and don’t know how to diminish that. Do I let it go? Do I confront him? Do I make her cut him off? I’m lost and upset. Please let me know what you think, thank you.

But she mentioned that she’s a mandatory reporter or something because of her on-campus job, so she said if she has any concerns about someone she has to report them.

It has been a really great experience however I have had some bad experiences and all involved black people, for example I was in the bus and this fat guy walks towards me with a creepy looking and sits aside me, while all the fucking bus was empty, then he starts looking my phone, I realised and I blocked it, then he fucking stands up and farts then walks away (yes this happened). Today I was in the metro and it was a bit crowded, we were arriving to the station, the I felt a fucking hand in my back, and then this guy starts pushing me, but in a really violent way that all the wagon was looking at us, of course I demanded him to stop and wait a sec, he made his face like he was about to spit, and then he started laughing, that fricked me out, I’m almost sure he was high as fuck (all of this while the doors were still closed). Other time I was walking with a french friend (a girl) and all this fucking tall guys in a corner started yelling things in french this happened at 9:00-9:30pm nothing happened but still, also there was this guys fucking screaming and fighting (I mean a real fight with the fists and in the floor) in the entrance of the biggest metro station. Other time there was this guy who yelled to a grandma in the metro after she asked for his place. Have you have heard about the bad fame of the french client attention? Fuck it all my bad experiences with client service in france were with black people, and I don’t mean only being rude, example, there was this girl fucking ignored me for a wile, and the she l didn’t “understand” what I ordered so she didn’t write down what I ordered, I mean, really?  

I know not all the black people all like these assholes however today when all the metro thing happened and finally I got out the train I thought “fucking blacks” then Realised what I just thought and freaked out and now I’m writing this, how can I convince myself that not all black people is Like those dicks, this is the fists time in my life that I have had thoughts like those.

721,"I apologize in advance for any grammatical/related errors. English is not my first language, and I'm a little rattled so may not be thinking too clearly. 

24 F. 
I was abused as a child by both parents both verbally and physically from as early as I can remember up 18 y/o right before going off to college. 
Getting beat up like a piñata just because my dad did not have someone to vent out to for being unemployed, or being called horrenduous names by mom when she had a difficult day for a WHOLE night (mind you, a school night) became a very traumatic experience for me. 
I still cannot relate whenever friends talk fondly of their childhood. Mine was an absolute hell and I would die, without moment of hesitation, if I were to go back. 

Fast forward to 2020. I'd gone to college far away from them and upon graduation, went to work at a place even further away. 

But a recent new job opportunity swinged by right near my parents, so I came home a month ago to their home with plans to stay couple of months before the new job. Of course I agreed to their condition in paying my share of rent, food, any incurred expenses for those months.

They were never on good terms with each other, so it was not a surprise that I came home to find them living almost like strangers. Pans went flyin', words were called out, doors were closed, and lots of pointless blames were put on me (quiet as a mouse, btw). 
It was finally announced that they would go through a divorce and that I'd be taking care of mom, while dad will live alone. I do have an older sibling but he has broken off all ties a year ago. Now that I look back, I regret I had not done the same. 

Tbh, I do not want to be stuck taking care of eldery mom. It's not because of financial reasons. I sincerely believe if she was a good mom to me, I'd be more than happy to live with her and take care of her, even if it meant me working two full time jobs. 

But she wasn't. Nowhere close. It still makes me shudder to think how any decent humans can hurt a young child like that, to the point the child is made to blame herself for geting multiple concussions from a beatup. 

Even after all that, I'd be willing to look past and forgive. But she has never said sorry, and made it quite clear that it's my obligation to look after her until death and that she would not tolerate anything like marriage or even dating. Even now, I am about to go crazy dealing with all the whining. 

Last week, I'd arranged to move out of the house to spend the rest of few resting months, at a small but quiet studio. Plans were foiled due to the fact that my mom threatened to crash into another car. Say what you will, but I could not let that happen to not just her, but another innocent stranger. 

I just don't know how to deal. My logics are all jumbled up because this is brutally personal and I am not able to look at this objectively at all.

722," Hello, I am a (44m) 5'10 160lbs Caucasian, I don't have any existing medical issues that I know of, I am not taking any medications never have, I do smoke some pot, I do not drink.

After a rather stupid fight, where I was refusing to go to the Dr because I feel fine, I agreed that I will go and get a yearly to set her mind at ease.

My question is when I go, what should a request to have done? I do have very very basic insurance, but I have never used it so I am not sure what all it covers. What screenings should I ask for?

My crush was surprised and laughed and then he gave me a hug out of the blue (He drank quite a bit as well so I know he was slightly drunk).

724,"My fiance (28M), we'll call him L, and I (29F) have been together for 4 years and plan to get married next year. L told me 3 years ago what happened and what the cousin, we'll call him B, did to him. From what I understand, the abuse happened multiple times when B, \~10 years older than L, was babysitting L as a child.

As for L, he has dealt with. He talked to a counselor and has said he no longer wishes to dwell on it. B has little to do with the family anymore, so L has not had to face his abuser for 12+ years. But L has not told anyone in his family what happened and he doesn't want to. I asked him if he ever would and he said he didn't want to cause any rifts in the family. I do not want to tell his story for him because it is not my place. He and I both assumed the problem would not need to be addressed again in any significant way.

But then FMIL gave me the list of people she wishes to invite to our wedding two days ago and B's name is on it. I do not know if he will come or not, but that isn't the point. I don't want him to even have the opportunity to show up. But, if I say he isn't allowed, questions will be asked, and I don't know how to answer them. I want to avoid telling L about this because I don't want to upset him, but I am at the end of my rope for what to do.

Another aspect that's concerning: B recently had a child with his girlfriend. Aside from knowing he is a child abuser, I don't know him well enough to say he wouldn't do anything to his child. But I feel that makes the situation even more dire.

What should I do? Do I make up a lie about B as an excuse to exclude him? Do I tell L?

725,"Kind of fucked up that I have to turn to random strangers on the internet, but I have no one else I can reliably ask. To clear up any confusion this is in Canada

So I have been at University for what is now my second year and fourth semester. I have a genuine love for what I am studying, but I have been falling behind due to not fully grasping it. I used to get mid to high 80's in my assignments and mid-terms/tests but I have been slipping lately, and I have been having trouble keeping up with and understanding the readings for my class. Also as you can probably tell from this post, my grammar is atrocious and I struggle with essays.

Today I failed a mid-term for the first time because I did not understand the readings. I do not think it will get any better from here, as I will just slip further and further, which seems to be the trend. I have tried going to office hours for my classes, but only 2/3 of the profs are willing to see me and actually give me some help, but even with this, I am struggling.

My parents have been proud of me since high-school due to my grades, and they told me that I was the first member of the family to go to University. I feel like they were trying to encourage me, but all they did when they told me that was making me very anxious. I remember it every time I do poorly or below my expectations, and my dad told me that two years ago. My parents have also helped me with paying off my courses greatly, and I would not have been able to attend without them, especially with my provinces' Student Assistance Program being cut. If I were to drop out all the money they and myself put into my education is just gone, it was useless and for nothing. I am not sure if I am cut out to be in university anymore, but if I drop my parents will be incredibly dissapointed in me, some people might say what they think doesn't matter, but it does, they did a good job in raising me, and I still turned out poorly despite their best efforts. I know that my efforts in university are the only thing keeping them tolerant with me as I have not done much else beyond my studies, they always encourage me to go out with friends, but I have lost contact with all of them about a year ago.

I have a backup plan for if I would drop out. I would want to take a training program to become a plumber, and then an apprenticeship. There are however some issues. I am slow, I mean this in the sense that someone has to tell me something multiple times in order for me to understand it properly, Even when I focus I sometimes can't get it. I am also terrible at doing most non-literary things. drawing designs, placing fixtures, taking measurements and cutting. I believe i could do all these tasks, but I do them sloppily given past experiences working in an auto-shop. 

I really do not know what to do here. If I stay, then I fail and myself and my parents are all disappointed, and I lose out on thousands of dollars. Even if I pass and get my teaching license like the plan was, I doubt I could be an effective teacher. If I drop out now then I still lose thousands of dollars, disappoint my parents and myself, and possibly put myself down another rabbit hole of failure. I know it may sound like I do not have confidence, but I assure you I am merely just aware of my faults.

Thank you to anyone who read this and I appreciate the responses.

Me and Jay have been friends since kindergarten. Recently the class behavior spiked up and Jay was at the front of all this. People started getting annoyed by me even though I'm defending the teachers inappropriate yet reasonable behavior. They were punishing students and screaming at them. Some used mild language. Nothing much though. I've seen worse. Anyways. People became envious because I have a good reputation with the teachers. I'm no suxk up though. Example what might happen:
Teacher tells us to memorize 3 points of x. 
I memorise five of the total six.
T:very good!
Jay:he didn't say the last one!
T:well can you tell me what are the whole six points?
Jay sits down quietly

This is why they hate me.
Anyways. Saturday after I tell Jay the thing that infuriates me the most. People saying I get good marks by luck. I fucking hate this. Jay then procedes to say I get good marks by luck and that I talk too much and ruin the class etc even though I've never disturbed the class but I do talk sometimes. This ends in me blocking him. (all after school) 
Sunday: nothing happens.
Monday (today)  I see him at school and he's laughing and grinning about the whole situation. He says it's a joke. I don't take it as a joke and procede to scold him. Nothing serious. I try to avoid him rest of the day until lunch. I see all my class siting at the same table including Jay. With most of the class being immature, they start talking about who they ship with who. They ship me with a girl I'm not exactly friends with but hey no biggie. It's for fun after all right? Well no.  Jay keeps insisting and eventually I have to shut him up. I tell him the only person I have a relationship with is your mother. Now in my country this is normal between friends to say as a joking manner. Jay doesn't have a good sense of humor. He takes it seriously even thought it isn't. I tell him it's not in reality and I don't really mean it. I tell him I take it back. (keep in mind this isn't the first time this is said in class and nobody takes it serious)
Monday after school(right now) : he says I have to apologize because I took it too far. He also said If i don't apologise hell tell his mom and my mom. He also said that he'll expose that I masturbate. I've gone through puberty what do you exactly expect? He also says that I should tell me mom to raise me again well. This I fucking hate him for now. After back and forth fighting, he finally shuts up and leaves. We haven't gotten to an agreement even though I said if he apologized first I will after. He said I should first be use my mistake is larger. Larger than what? A 9 year friendship? No. I close my phone and go study.
P.S we are with another group of people in a competition and we have a good idea and team and everything planned. He made it impossible to work with him.
Am I in the wrong?
Would I apologise first? No. Justice is more important than my secrets. Secondly who would it affect? All my friends know this and I'm not the only person to masturbate. And also my mom probably knows. But she hasn't said anything about it. I wouldn't want to risk it though. Even still I have a mind of an adult-ish person.

Im a 16 year old male and my girlfriend is the same age as me and we have been dating for about 4 months. About 5 weeks ago I was over her house and we didn't do anything major but there is a slim possibility she could have got pregnant from it. 

Fast forward to now and she is a week late on her period and is freaking out. She feels a bit sick sometimes but im guessing that is do to the stressful situation since she gets paranoid very easily. I keep suggesting to her to take an over the counter pregnancy test but she is heavily against it and wants to wait it out.

Anytime I bring up the idea of taking the test she gets very emotional and just says no. Ive told her many times that I would stay with her no matter what the outcome is but she is still paranoid I will leave her if its positive and is worried how her family would react so she doesn't want to risk it. The problem is she is taking the possibility of being pregnant very hard to the point she is crying herself to sleep even though I don't think she is pregnant and its tearing me up seeing her freak out this bad. 

So do you guys have any ideas on how I can convince her to take the test? Because I feel like knowing will calm her down",24Feb2020,1

733,"It's several different apartment buildings owned by different people all in close proximity. Just moved here not too long ago. The thing charged at me enraged for no reason at all just a couple of weeks back, by pure luck alone it seemed to break off the chase.

Have seen it around consistently both before and after the incident, no one is ever with it. Recently found out it attacked and bit someone in the building before it came at me that day. Apparently the cops were called for that one, but they refused to find the dog or check any records on it.

I've called animal control, who claim they picked up a dog-- but they gave the wrong description and it's still around. Nobody in my building knows who the owner is, but we all know the general area it keeps coming from. 

My friend was driving here the other day, saw a dog fitting it's description-- says it charged out into the road apparently intent on attacking her car, only stopping when some guy clear half a block back yelled at it-- but even though it seemed to listen, the guy didn't seem to be connected with it at all.


As for size it's on the larger size of medium, as for description it RESEMBLES an oddly colored Doberman-- mostly. The color is a deep gray/brown with darker ripples/splotches-- really short hair.

I have several health issues that render me too weak and slow to fight it off if I had to-- and it's REAL fast. Plus I have no car, do not drive-- and the main reason I moved here was very close proximity to stores-- which I now cannot make use of.

735,"Hi everyone,

This is my situation: 

I met a girl online (through Facebook) and we exchanged cams, later she revealed herself to be a guy and demanded money or else he will post the entire video to every single one of my friends (he has access to my friend list on Facebook). I went into shock immediately because this is the first time that anything like this has happened to me ( I know I'm dumb and naive). I fell for his request and sent him 900 cad (still so naive) thinking that he will delete it and leave me alone. Later he came back with another bigger request, then I realized this was not going to stop and decided I won't have it anymore. I was devastated to be honest but I tried to keep calm was able to convince him that I needed to go to sleep and would pay him in the morning. 

Immediately after that, I consulted with my friends and we all agreed that the best way to deal with this situation is to own up to it and notify everyone in my friend list that I was in a blackmail situation and they might receive sensitive content from any clone account. My problem with this was that this was an extremely stressful process. To do something so humiliating and then admitting that to your entire friend list, even if the blackmailer might not even public the video, it's not easy. 

After I sent out the warnings( to almost 300 people in my list) I then proceeded to block all of the blackmailer's clone account, deactivated my FB account, and when go to what must be the worst sleep I've had in years. Right now in the morning, it's past the due time for me to send the blackmailer the money, he bombarded me with messages but I ignored them all (he even messaged a few of my friends and sent them pictures of my head asking if they recognize me but I won't give in), I'm starting to think that this is it but I can't know for sure.

I'm planning to wait another 24 hours to see if something comes up but right now I'm dealing with a lot of stress, anxiety, and shame. Even though the video might never get public, I basically sent a message to all the people I know admitting I did such a thing, I know a lot of these people won't care and they don't matter anyway but I just can't stop feeling being judged and frowned upon (a lot of them might even be surprised because I'm normally a very reserved and mature person). I have a quiz this afternoon, a midterm tomorrow and a job interview on Wednesday and I can't bring myself to work on any of those things under this circumstance. 

I guess what I need is advice going forward on how to deal with all these emotions and how to get my life back on track as soon as possible, and maybe how to deal with the blackmailer if he decides to come back.

Sorry I won't have a TL:DR because I really don't know how to summarize all this (this post is about as summarized as I could get)",24Feb2020,1
736,"So this story starts months ago. A few months ago my neighbour put up a dartboard on our shared wall. I live in a bachelor unit and he is in a one bedroom. When he put it up a few months ago there was no sound reducing stuff he put up so it was quite loud, would vibrate the walls and depending how hard the dart was thrown would vibrate the kitchen cabinets causing additional noise. It was really annoying, especially considering I could hear every single dart being thrown in to the board. Imagine hearing THUD, THUD, THUD, 10 seconds go by, THUD, THUD, THUD, and so on. It is the most annoying sound in the entire world, the repetitiveness of it and the vibration is just very irritating. A few months ago from the point he first put it up, I thought I'd let him have his fun, and I thought maybe he'd get bored of playing or something like that (I was patient). Well mid-January comes by and I just can't stand the noise anymore, and I want to make it clear its the specific kind of noise, its repetitive and really annoys you in a way that is hard to explain (I find it is similar to your faucet slowly dripping while trying to sleep). On top of this, he will play at all different times of the day and almost every single day. Again, Mid-January comes by and I finally build up the courage to go and talk to him about it. I tell him I can hear every single dart that goes in the board and ask if he could move it, he apologies and I tell him its fine (how could he have known) but I would appreciate it very much if he moved it. The next day he's playing again, day after that same thing. I go and talk to him again and explain how annoying and irritating it is, saying I will have to go talk to management about it if I hear it again. He moves the dart board but to a wall that is right next to the wall that it was on, however, I could still hear every single dart going in to that board, it made it maybe 20% quieter but still just as annoying/irritating, as it is the TYPE OF NOISE. So I go downstairs to talk to the building manager about it, and she reassures me that anything your neighbours do that irritates you we can try to fix for you. So, what we do is, she stood in my unit while he played, and she goes ok ya I can definitely hear it, she walks out and goes to talk to him. She comes back and starts saying how ""I get some people are sensitive to noise"" and that he is complaining that I listen to music loudly. First of all, I am not sensitive to noise, I am sensitive to THE TYPE OF NOISE THE DART BOARD MAKES. To further explain this, there is noise almost every morning that wakes me up which comes from the parking garage cause there are construction workers drilling and stuff (I am fine with this noise, I get they have to do work, it DOES NOT annoy me), also, I hear music coming through the wall from his unit sometimes playing music (I am fine with this noise because it is not irritating like a dart board and does not happen everyday), also, I sometimes hear running and things dropping on the floor from the apartment above me (again, I'm fine with this, it is not repetitive and not irritating). Second, I NEVER listen to music in my apartment, I don't have a speaker and I do not ever have any friends over to drink or anything like that (I am in this city by myself), my TV is on the opposite side of my apartment to the shared wall so there is just no way he ever hears anything from my apartment, I also am very respectful about my surroundings, almost every action I take in my place is to also make sure I am not bothering anyone else. So, the fact she (building manager) told me I am sensitive to noise kinda pissed me off because clearly she is not putting herself in my shoes and I would love to see her reaction if her neighbour had a dart board annoying her. She also said that she told him to either move it or get some sort of sound reducing things to help reduce the noise. So, the guy stops playing for about a week (which I was so happy about cause either he fixed it or moved it), however, Sunday morning I hear him banging on the wall, likely hammering stuff in to the wall or something like that. Then once he's done he starts playing darts again, same thing THUD THUD THUD, over and over again. I can still hear every dart that is thrown, it is about 50% quieter than it was originally, but it's not about how loud it is, IT IS THE TYPE OF NOISE, it is repetitive and it is just really really irritating. I respect the guy a little bit more cause at least he finally tried but I am mind blown that he cannot just respect my feelings and he fails to understand that it is a shared, very thin wall that does not reduce sounds very well. When I asked my building manager why he can't just move it to a different wall, her response was that he has stuff hanging up on the walls...... again, mind blown about how ridiculous this situation has become and how it is so hard for these people to understand what I am going through. What I have now decided to do, is bang on the shared wall every single time he plays to show him that I indeed can hear exactly when he IS playing and when he is NOT playing. Hopefully this will get him to finally realize I can hear EVERYTHING. 

TLDR: I live in an apartment, my neighbour, who I share a wall with has had a dart board hung up for months, have talked to him several times and talked to management several times, basically nothing is being done to stop the noise. The noise is a very specific type of noise (similar type of irritation a faucet slowly dripping water would cause) that annoys/irritates me very very much. What should I do?

**Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I have thought about talking to the people above the building manager but I also though this my have some consequences as well. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, as I just want this noise to stop completely. Thank you so much to anyone who actually reads this whole thing.**",24Feb2020,1

It should’ve been with all the kissing and body contact but it was not. It was just semi hard and I wasn’t able to penetrate.

She consoled me that you have satisfied me orally and that’s all that matters but I’ve been feeling like a loser ever since. I want to try once more but I don’t want to fail.

The neighbor who lives above me comes down from time to time or texts my wife complains our daughter is playing too loud, that she can hear the front door (of the building) slam and how she can hear the mail boxes being open all the time. She then passive aggressively says she would rather come talk to us than have to call the cops. We have been here for going on 3 years and have never had an issue with anyone else in the bulding till she moved in with the guy that originally was renting the appartment above us alone six months ago. It's not like we let our daughter run around the building or scream at the top of her lungs and we make sure that the door to our appartment doesn't slam, but she still complains and threatens to call the cops every couple of weeks. To make things worse, they stomp around on the floors, are loud all hours of the night and a few times a week we can hear them hammering on stuff as early as 5am and it goes on for hours.

I like to draw. Like a lot. But sometimes I feel the urge to draw without even knowing what I want to create... That's why I would like to make my own random generator that can come up with funny and original ideas of stuff to draw. I think that's a good challenge and a great way to get out of my comfort zone. I think there are some of them out there but I'd like to make my own

It must be separated in three different parts that can be mixed to end up with results like :

A very edgy          beaver          who can stand for themselves

A silly looking      seaman         with a sassy attitude

The ghost of a     neckbeard    never giving up

744,"As the title says.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner is convinced I have some mental health issues like depression, anxiety etc. I used to be depressed when I was at uni many years ago - I stopped seeing friends, drank a lot of alcohol, used to self harm, and eventually dropped out and never finished the degree. I tried a couple counselling sessions but they did nothing for me. Things just kind of resolved on their own. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner has had a lot of mental issues themselves, like autism, BPD, depression. They're on medication for it, and have attempted suicide and self harmed before. They are certain I still have mental problems because ""I never got them sorted the last time"" and they constantly say my reactions to things are very unhealthy, saying I lose my temper a lot and lash out. Just to be clear, I have never hurt them or hit them. They have also in the past had a go at me for making jokes about wanting to commit suicide because they said it upset them. I try not to make those kind of comments any more, but it's just my humor - I'm having a bad time, and telling myself I should just kill myself and then refusing to do so makes me feel like I have some power over the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that I can be self-deprecating but I'm also honestly just not happy with myself and that's never going to change. I don't think I'm smart enough to be doing the new degree I am doing now. I keep failing my exams and failing to submit coursework on time, but they insist that I am smart enough and it's just mental problems keeping me back. I keep trying because they make me want to be the best version of myself I can be, but no matter how hard I work I just don't seem to be able to do well in the exams.

&amp;#x200B;

I told them ages ago I thought I had ADHD and that I wanted meds for it just to get them to shut up about it for a while, but they just took it even further and started looking into psychiatrists I could meet with to get a diagnosis and maybe treatment, putting money aside so we could afford to go etc. They even spoke to my parents asking for advice and support. I eventually told them that I made it all up to get them to drop the subject and they got angry with me, but I genuinely don't see the point in us wasting money on seeing a psych just for them to find nothing? This ended up with them basically giving me two options:

\- I either have a mental illness I'm refusing to treat or

\- I'm just an asshole

And saying both of those things meant they weren't sure if they wanted to be in a relationship with me any more. That really hurt, if I'm being honest. I don't want to lose them, and we talked things through and it seemed to get better for a while, but I can feel it starting up again. 

This is a really big sticking point in the relationship. I love my partner and I don't know where I'd be without them, but I feel like they're pathologising my personality. I went to see the doctor and they just prescribed me anti-anxiety medication which to be honest I don't think has worked at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to do. My partner is relentless and every time something bad happens or I mess up I feel like I'm waiting for them to say ""I told you so, it's a mental illness!"" rather than just accepting that I'm just useless. I get they're coming from a place of wanting to help but I don't think there's anything wrong.",24Feb2020,1

746,"I have always realized I was kinda of a selfish guy and realized I am pretty cheap. Maybe because I grew up kind of poor. I feel tho that this hurts my relationships with people especially people that I am pretty close to. This brought to light after having a conversation with a friend he has helped me out a lot with various things and is a pretty smart guy so I value his opinion. He was saying how I never want to drive or use my car, I never splurge on things of comfort for my own apartment (buy a couch or tv) my apartment is literally bare bones with an air mattress, cheap walmart table and chair. Dating life is non-existent. I don't like feeling used or feel taken advantage of which my friend pointed out and it is true. I see some guys who have gfs and they give her so much like money, material stuff and they break up. This would leave a very sour taste in my mouth.

Another interesting topic that was discussed is what we look for in a relationship. For me I usually date girls that is my equal per se and independent, but I am always one foot in one foot out never fully committing. However if you don't do much for her its easier for them to leave you. While my other friend says he likes to do a lot for his gf which makes them think twice if they decide to leave you or makes it much harder. I believe that is true.

I see these qualities in certain people of selfishness and being cheap and it makes me not want to hang out with them. No one wants to hang out with someone where it seem like they are being used or that its always tit for tat. I believe I project this image to other people as well. My mentality is like I want to save a lot of money so that I don't have to work all of my life, but my friend tells me that sometimes you have to enjoy your life. No point in trying to save all this money and then die. I find it difficult to not think this way, but I think he is right. Obviously its not one extreme or the other should be a middle ground. Feel like splurging a little like decking out my apartment and being more generous will improve my social life and relationships.

747,"[22 F] I went into college thinking I had to because my parents pushed me even though I had no idea what I wanted to do. They didn't believe in taking gap years and quickly discouraged the only two fields I had thought about at the time, Marine biology or becoming a doctor.  I thought anything was possible, while they wanted me to do something more practical like Nursing. I didn't listen to them and went straight into pre-med biology. 

My senior year of highschool into freshman year, i was battling suicide and depression due to my brother passing away, family drama, and trying to encourage my boyfriend when I felt like no one was there for me. I separated from friends and my anxiety has basically destroyed me as a person. I lost all of my friendships and good GPA. I was failing school, and couldn't keep up with paying for my classes. I decided to switch over to a community college and go into nursing my parents wanted. I thought it wouldn't be so bad since I was still interested in healthcare. I brought my GPA up, got on the Dean's list, and enjoyed my pre-reqs. I still had this underlying disinterest in Nursing and my shadowing/ CNA experience confirmed that. It was such a high stress environment for me. I was taking all of my work drama home. It really hurt my physical and mental health with everything going on in my own personal life. I didn't take the TEAS exam and didn't apply to the program. I'm now taking that gap year.

I've spent a lot of time researching jobs and evaluating what I WANT in my life. I see now how oversaturated and underpaid biology grads are unless they get a master's or PhD. Along with what becoming a doctor entails. I've looked into many other degrees and my own personal interests. I'm still evaluating everything, but I have made a plan. I stopped worrying about what my parents think. It's been 5 years, and I want to change. I want my old self back. I want to go back to school and make something of myself for my own sake. Most importantly to get out of my parents house and move on with my life. 

I still have anxiety over regretting my decision of turning away from nursing. Like I would've graduated by now if I stuck with it. I'm scared of losing my financial aid because I'm trying to change my major again this late. I feel like deep down I needed this break. I really just don't want to mess it all up again.",24Feb2020,1

749,"Hello all. 

So I have been having trouble with a professor of mine. The first time I took the class I ended up failing (45), I had a few bad interactions with the professor but was never disrespectful, more or less just confused about what to do and too shy to ask for any help. 

I am currently taking the class again, and she has been grading me very harshly, I am currently sitting at a 63 in the class which is much better than the 21 I had at this point the first semester. It's a digitally oriented class (intro to GIS for those who want to know), so the class requires we submit our written portions of our labs online and then leave the stuff we did in the program in our folders so the professor can see them and grade accordingly. 

I feel as though my grading has been judged very harshly. She told us at the beginning of the semester that lab 4 was the only lab where she would be looking at our data to see if it was all there, so until that point it would all be up to our written portions of the labs for the grade. She socked me 40 points on lab 3 for not having the data available. But aside from the bad grades, she ended up speaking very harshly to me when I had a simple question, and was quite rude about it, she did this twice in one lab period.

A little background on myself; I am an older college student, I am quiet, and I tend to keep to myself a lot. Many of my professors seem to really enjoy me, several of them stop to have actual conversations with me when I see them on campus, but this professor has shown me nothing but hostility and I don't know what to do. 

I fear that if i talk to someone about it, it will seem like a ""he said, she said"" scenario, and obviously ignoring things isnt going to solve anything. What should I do? She is the only one who teaches the class, and I think my college only let's us take a course twice.",24Feb2020,1
751,"Hello All,

Looking for advice basically for my whole program.

After two weeks of class, our professor had a heart attack. Obviously he can't work so the college had to find a replacement. We missed two weeks of class waiting for a new professor to be assigned to the course. Here's the tricky part. The college hired him on a contract that expires right before our reading week. Now, based on his contract situation, he booked vacation assuming he wasn't under contract anymore. So now at the end of our reading week we will have no professor again for at least two weeks since the college says their plan is to keep him on after he gets back.

Based on our course outline and our marking scheme, a portion of our project worth 30% of our final grade is due on the day he gets back from vacation. The week after we have our first midterm, two weeks after that another midterm, and the week after that another portion of our project. Then less than a week after that an exam. I'm just looking at what is a fair thing to do here considering we will be missing out on a full 4 weeks of lecture for a total of 12 weeks and are still expected to complete everything that we would normally be assigned over a 16 week period. This isn't really a course you can just do things on your own and hand them in and hope for the best. It's a 4th year Engineering Schematics course and we all are a little lost on what the right thing to think in the situation is.

752,"So basically from my freshman year of high school I have been in a variety of relationships. I got into what I thought was a pretty serious one that lasted about a year and lost my virginity to the guy in the middle of my sophomore year. We broke up on good terms and I went away traveling for a few months and of course... met a new guy. I got into a relationship with him but part of why we got together was because there were very few guys/girls on our travels. After the trip We were obsessed with each other but we agreed not to do long distance because he lives far across the country from me. I was obviously really into him but being so far from each other with no plans to see each other next, I started to seek out other guys to distract me. I got with a diff guy and we started being a thing while I continued to talk with the other guy over the phone every day. The diff guy caught feelings for me but I was too into the other guy so I turned him down but didn’t stop seeing him. I finally got to see the other guy again and fell in love with him over the course of the week we had together. The relationship we had been building over the phone becoming an in person thing felt so surreal and amazing I couldn’t think about anything else. I stopped seeing that diff guy and talked to the other guy on the phone even more than before. He came to visit me and it was amazing but when he was leaving we agreed that we needed to talk less so we could move on. We did not talk less at all but I started talking to other guys again. I got with that diff guy a few more times and then told the other guy and he told me he hadn’t been gw anyone else Bc he was too into me. I just planned a trip to go visit him soon but I’m starting to feel like I need to just let what we have go because there is no chance for us to keep visiting each other and doing this fake long distance thing where I get with other people and he doesn’t and we talk every day but don’t talk about how stupid this relationship is.

SECONDS LATER, a random account that was something named with random letters had requested to message me. i felt dread as i tapped on it. it was just a period. so i blocked that account and just deleted my account permanently. i just had an awful feeling overall. i remember his main accounts user. anyway, what should i do? am i overreacting? i could be. i’m over paranoid. any advice?",24Feb2020,1

759,"So I've been pursuing a biology degree for 3 and a half years now, and am in my last semester. In the past year or so, I've realized that I genuinely don't like biology nor do I want a career in the field. I am actively trying to get accepted to a school for computer science. In the meantime though, I have to finish out this semester and graduate - my problem is that I can't stand what I do. Almost everyday I wake up and have to pretend I care about something that I deeply do not care about. It gives me great displeasure to go to all of the classes about something I do not enjoy. I do not have a lot of friends in real life. I am on antidepressants and have been for years. I see a therapist. It still all feels like I can't handle it. Everyday I am clumsily completing some assignments, missing class sometimes. I am ALWAYS thinking about school though. There is no escape and it just makes me feel so sad, defeated, and small. I hate it so much and I don't know how to cope with it - quitting is literally not an option because I have less than 3 months to GRADUATE with a degree. Everytime tests roll around all I want to do is curl up and hide because I just get so stressed. I have never felt this stressed in my life, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I just don't know what to do, I feel so trapped. Please offer any advice.",24Feb2020,1
760,"Hi, so it's my first time posting here. I'm desperate and scared and don't know what to do. Any advice would be great...

So, I'm 18 (F) and my ex (M) is 23. We met on Instagram about three years ago and we instantly clicked. I started liking him from the start and hoped that he'd like me back, but he told me he had serious relationship trauma and that he'd never get in one again. That bummed me but i was down to be his friend until one day he confessed that he liked me back and we started dating soon after. Things were great! He was a sweetheart. We had a LDR a  so it was a bit difficult to see eachother  but we managed. The only problem was that he had depression. It wasn't that severe and it definitely didn't put me off but he quite often had his ""moments"". At the time I paid no mind to it and tried to help him overcome it but he never managed to. He was happy when i was there so i felt like i did my job, but it never was enough to me. I knew that he was struggling but nothing i did helped him get through it. 

Fast forward to a year ago. My best friend (M) of 5 years who is my age came to visit me ( he lives in a different city too and we rarely ever saw eachother). It was his first time visiting me and I was really happy since we hadn't seen eachother in about a year. Our history is quite complicated, to be fair, and this is the part where I'll start looking like an asshole. Ever since we met, my best friend and I had a crush on eachother. Like, a 3-4 year old crush. And we never even considered dating. But when he came to visit, something in us clicked and that crush ""revived"" itself, so to speak. I didn't pay attention to my feelings for a long time since i didn't think it'd work out, and so did he. Nevertheless, we had a great time that day and he invited me to his birthday party which was in about two weeks after his visit. So i went.

Long story short...We got drunk and confessed our feelings to eachother. He told me things he never dared to tell me online and i did too. We kissed and hugged and at that moment I completely forgot i was in a relationship and i still hate myself for doing it. I knew my ex had mental problems, yet i let myself go to the point where i cheated on him. The weeks after that night were pure hell. I didn't know what to do - i was conflicted whether i should stay with my ex or start a relationship with my best friend. I really loved both of them. I didn't know if i should've told my ex the truth. I was scared he'd freak out and hurt himself, but he eventually found out on his own. So we broke up and decided to stay friends, until i started dating my best friend. That's when shit started going down.

A year has passed since i started dating my best friend and my ex hasn't stopped trying to contact me since. He insulted me, threatened me, he threatened my boyfriend as well. He says he'll commit suicide soon and then apologises and decides he wants to stay friends again. He belittled my own mental problems, claiming that I'm an attention whore and a liar. It came to the point where i had to block about 7-8 of his accounts on Instagram. He told me he had come to my house a few weeks ago to ""talk"" (he lives in a different city), but decided to just leave. The thing that made me turn to Reddit is that yesterday he contacted my boyfriend too and threatened him as well. He told him that he'd kill him if he could.  I don't know if i should take legal action at this point.
So, I know what i did was wrong. I didn't think straight at the time and really tried to redeem myself and apologized numerous times. I know that an apology means nothing considering the circumstances, but i really  regret hurting my ex this way... I'm happy with my boyfriend but this constant fear that my ex might hurt us is getting to me. I have anxiety now and get panic attacks quite frequently. Please, I need advice. I know I deserve what's coming to me but I just don't want my boyfriend to get hurt.

761,"just to start off with, sorry for the length of this post but i just felt i had a lot to say

Ok so, quick backstory, me and this girl (I'll just call her H) have been friends for over a year now a lil while back i started to get feelings for her. she eventually found out through one of my friends and when she asked me about it i confessed but didn't want it to ruin the relationship we already had so we just stayed friends.

a few weeks ago she confessed to me that she had feelings for me as well. this kinda fucked me cause i had been trying to convince myself ever since that she didn't feel the same way and i just needed to get over it. we had a long talk and cause she broke up with her bf of about 2 months a month before hand, she didn't feel like she was ready to get into another relationship. i gave her some time to think about it and then the Saturday after valentines, she sorta asked me out but not really by changing my name on discord. she just put like, ""H's bf?"" and i said ""if you feel like you're ready then yeah"". 

on Sunday, she invited me over for Tuesday and specifically asked if we could cuddle. i said yeah cause i thought it would be nice and i had never really done it before, and when i went over, we eventually got into bed with each other (not sexually or anything just laid there, we're both still virgins) and watched a horror movie. i was laying slightly up from her and she was just resting her head on my shoulder. after the movie we were just watching YouTube and i kinda snuggled up to her with my am around her chest. she hugged my arm cause that was really the only thing she could really do and she also still wanted to type. but yeah it was really nice and i enjoyed just being together.

ok now, today, when we were both walking to school, out conversation somehow got into kinks. she told me that shes into all that daddy shit and soft-dom. just a preface i'm not really familiar with all of the terminology and shit so bare with me. she told me that i'm not really a soft-dom and more of just  a soft. i don't think she meant it in an insult sort of way just saying what she thought. she said i seriously don't have it in me and said she wanted someone who would treat her well but also dominate her. she likes being the little one in the relationship. she told me i have cute but not daddy after almost calling me daddy but then saying it'll never happen again.

idk why but this started to really get to me. like i feel like its the main reason keeping us apart and like, i don't know cause like, i wanna be the bigger one in the relationship, and i wanna dominate the other one but apparently i just don't show it. i really just wanna know how i can show her that i can be and am more dominant than she thinks cause like, i wanna be with her but this just really got to me.

any help is appreciated, thanks

&amp;#x200B;

edit: also we both go to different schools, both same sex, and the guy that comes out with us is bi and has no interest in H, they've known each other for years and i don't think anything has ever happened so yeah, just felt like that might be important",24Feb2020,1
762,"My best friend and I been close friends for almost 4 years now, since freshman year (now seniors in HS). Unfortunately, this year we don’t have any classes together and our schedules are completely different and stressful. We no longer have the excuse of studying together to hang out, or even just sitting together in classes. On top of that we have a ton of tests and projects to do, which we can’t do together since the material is different. As a result we’ve seen a lot less of each other this year, we hang out every so often but much much less than previous years. This means we heavily rely on texting to stay in touch.
I consider myself a good texter, i like to text my friends a lot, maybe even too much sometimes. Usually funny stories that happen throughout the day, things that remind me of the friend, basically stuff I’d mention to them if we were hanging out.  Sometimes these texts can be long, so obviously I don’t expect an instant reply to a super long message for example, but my friend has started to.... really hurt my feelings. 
She never really replies to any of my messages, even the short ones, the hi-how-was-your-test. This has been happening for a while, so i brought it up to her a couple of times. The only explanation was “your texts are weird, i don’t know how to reply to that”. I’m having trouble accepting this as an excuse. 
She’s never been the most exciting person to text, i know that about her. Usually texting her was just to send her funny messages, and if she didn’t respond, and it was really important to me, I’d ask her about the message the next time I saw her. However now that we don’t see each other it’s an important mode of communication for us, and i wish she’d put in more of an effort. She seems to be getting annoyed that i keep asking why she’s leaving me on read, just using the not having a reply as an excuse. Am i being annoying? What do i do?
Would greatly appreciate any advice :)

TLDR: my friend kind of stopped replying to my texts, when asked why she keeps saying she doesn’t know what to reply. It’s making me sad.",24Feb2020,1

You would love to go the cops but the murder was accidental and you believe that your friend deserves a second chance. Additionally keeping in mind that cops make the situation worse. They would go to every possibility and extend to link your friend with it and get him even linked. They would want to know about the possible suspects’ whereabouts during the murder. They would look for the murder weapon. The motive gives them your friend. Your guilt consumed you ultimately making you his accomplice. What would you do to have yourself and your friend come out clean? (Be detailed and realistic)

• Your friend’s condo is CCTV controlled. The whole thing is in the footage. 
• Murder weapon is a solid iron bar.

Before anyone gets mad for invasion of privacy on my part, she asked me to help ckear out her emails. She hadnt erased in way to long and she needed someone to help find important emails and erase the rest. 

For some background my EX and I were together for almost 9 years, highschool sweethearts.  We broke up due to long distance. Still we talk everyday and well i have to say, i still love her. My EX comes from a Very religous background. Her father was the pastor of his church and her mother well, was THAT mother.  My Ex and i are both female.  It didnt go to well when they found out. But we made it work for a while. I mean we stayed together 4 years after they found out! 

To get on with it. She asked if i could help so i did. She wanted me to help find important emails.  i saw one she sent to herself. I opened it to see if it was a note she made or something to see she had written in her ""diary"" of some sort. 
These are just some things i found. 

""I dont like to hear I'm betraying him cuz it's not natural..I'm a disgrace.. I'm going to hell""

""I know. I know she Isnt for me. I asked God years ago To show me.Prove to me that she is wrong for me""

There is so much more. I have always known she felt conflicted with her religous background. But i did my best to tell her it was going to be alright. I even learned about god and read the bible, so i can also find proof that his love was more important than all. Im not the most religous person i know. I just wanted her to know that i was on her side. 

This are recently written, she is wishing she didnt love me. And she and i are abominations. Im so hurt to read this because i love her with all my heart. I didnt realize how bad it was. She is writing how she will be with the right man god chooses. And for strength to stay away from me. It so hard to read.

I didn’t even have a running bathroom and there was literally a porta let that we used. We had a big black tub that would fill up with water for baths.

I've been having a lot of trouble lately with being able to put aside feelings of anger towards my current partner's ex bf. I've been seeing my partner for almost two years now, and up until now I had been able to just calm her down when it came to these things and be there for her. 

Lately though, as in the past month or so, it's been very hard for me to NOT be angry when she talks to me about him. They dated for about 4 years, he was mentally/ physically abusive and manipulative towards her. He kept trying to weasel his way back into her life for almost a year after she was finally able to leave him. She took a break to be able to heal for about a year after that, and then we met and started dating.  She has been telling me about him since we started dating, I know how he used to treat her and its always made me angry, but more so in the sense of empathizing with her and wanting to further help her heal. 

Lately though, she has been a little bit more distraught than usual and told me that some friends have told her that he started mentioning her again. This has sort of triggered her and shes been opening up more about things he has done to her. It's hard to hear it, but lately instead of being helpful I sort of freeze up with anger. Not towards her, never towards her, but just at how he has taken a toll on her despite all the efforts she has made to get better. 

I get angry thinking about the things he has done, and how he has not had any consequences or probably feels any remorse (he has a personality disorder).

1st one:
I have really small room but don't want to have 90 cm wide bed. So I have choice between standard 120x200 bed with mattress, or small sleeping sofa that's also going to be around 120 cm wide, but I could fold it and have 2 people sit on it.

I'm going to just sleep on it 90% on the time, but I want to be able to fold it down on rare occasions when I have friends visiting.

The only issue I have here is that sofa might be bad to sleep on because of being hard on joints and overall uncomfortable, and I couldn't change mattress. Also my Mom is telling me all the time that it will hurt me every morning and I will not sleep well on it. I don't have anyone else to ask for opinion.
I feel that both are fine but feel stuck between those 2 choices, so I'm asking here for advice.

2nd issue.
I'm pretty heavy (100kg and 170 cm tall) and again: space in my room is an issue, so I wanted to have loft bed and my desk bellow.(Also, it's been my stupid dream to have loft bed)
Room height is 240 cm, and I wanted to have it on height 150 cm.
Now my issues are:
- loft bed with mattress would be ~160/170 cm tall. Is 70/80 cm between bed and celling enough?
- My Mom is literally laughing at me in the face whenever I mention it, because loft beds are for small kids and I'm basically adult(23 yo living with mom. Man it's so hard to afford a place to live.)

789,"I (24M) used to imagine living in a fantasy world where I could escape into whenever I was not able to fall asleep. This resulted in many brainstorm sessions and a plot outline of a fantasy series. I started to write it all down when I was in a better headspace. After going to therapy and meditating for a couple of years I saw most of my mental issues disappear, or at least largely reduced. So that's great. 

What's not so great is that I lost my drive to write it all down. It doesn't come as natural to me anymore. The world that I once created doesn't make me enthusiastic in the same way as it did before. I don't regard it as 'necessary', or as a purpose, for me to write this story because in a way it doesn't feel familiar any longer. When I read over the story, I still believe that it's a very good story and I think if it was worked out with enough time and effort, it truly could become something worthwhile. But I just don't feel like doing that because it doesn't spark the same need in my as before. Writing about this world suddenly seems very tedious.

To come full circle, I start to feel depressed again because I start to doubt all what I thought I wanted to do in life and it makes me feel very empty and worthless. So maybe I should just embrace my depression again so that I can escape again in my fantasy world... lol, no.

There are a lot of questions on my mind, but this is a selection:

* should I just stick with writing, become better at it, and hope that the spark returns?
* how can I find out what I really like to do?
* how can I come to terms with that I might not be able to create what I formerly regarded as 'my life's work'?

Some more context: 

1. I have a research master's degree in Media Studies and I have seen over 1000 films. I started my studies because I love watching and thinking about films and I still do. I know a lot about them and I think I have a bit of expertise to offer to that side on the field of screenwriting. 
2. I currently have a full-time job in customer support at a very nice workplace with friendly and smart colleagues, but that does not make the job itself interesting or fulfilling. It does limit my time and thus freedom to dive into things to try out.
3. I have previously thought of pursuing other creative careers, such as game design, or retrain as programmer, but not knowing that this is something I really want to do makes it seem too big of a decision right now.
4. I am sober for half a year now, but before that I used to drink alcohol at every possible occasion, which was a lot because I was in my teenage and college years. It made me an outgoing person and at ease with other people, while I am really much more of an introvert. Being sober, my life has definitely become more of a routine, which in many ways I like, but it also makes things less 'exciting' or boring in that sense.

790,"So as the title suggests over the past 3-4 days I had a small pimple form on the inside of my right nostril, just inside at the entrance and on the top. I tried to ignore it but it got inflamed and very sore, I tried to pop it when it got big hoping to relieve some of the pressure but I only scraped the head off and caused more inflammation. Now it's starting to dissipate On its own but now a second one has formed in my left nostril in essentially the same place and it's all the same pain again and it sucks.

Last year I met a guy who I felt I had a great connection with and I became really attracted to him. We were both living in the same city at the time so it was easy to see him. Unfortunately after a few dates I had to move home for unforeseen reasons and we decided that we could not do a long distance relationship. 6 months passed before I contacted him again to stay in touch as I was moving back to the city. I asked if he wanted to meet for a drink thinking that if he had a girlfriend he would say no and that it was inappropriate. He did respond and said that he was with someone now but would still like to meet me as long as his girlfriend was ok with it but he did sound very enthusiastic! What shall I make of his intentions? Does he just want to be friends or does he still like me? We weren't really friends before, we were dating, so his wanting to meet up has confused me! I don't want to get involved with a love triangle! Please can you give me your opinion on how he feels? I would really appreciate it!",24Feb2020,1

799,"Perhaps NEET is the wrong word, I am just tired of dealing with life and would like to become a hermit somewhere in solitude. What am I tired of? People, mostly. Recently I've been spending my weekends as to myself as I possibly can. 

I work full time during the week and work part time two nights of the week. Working extra now is part of my plan to escape my current situation.

I would need to do this on my own, I don't have a family to support my NEET dreams. In other words I don't have a place to go live in for free lol.

In an ideal world, I would be out on a little plot of land and grow my own food. Perhaps working part time to help with some expenses. I'd like a connection to the internet, as well as enough space to live in. There I can be free to grow as a person and heal, since I have mental health issues. Well, ideally my medical expenses would be covered too. Then again this is kind of contradictory, because if I live in solitude then how will I grow in social aspects? The internet may be the solution to that. Anyway, with nothing to worry about besides for my own well-being, I'm pretty sure I could reclaim my mental health on my own.

In a more realistic approach, I would live in a quiet studio apartment. Large enough to support indoor body weight exercises, a desk for my computer/journaling, a place for a digital piano, and a place to cook. We're almost there in real life now - where I live is very expensive with a high demand for places to live, so I've been searching for months. Right now my soon-to-be ex-wife and I still share an apartment. I may have a place lined up, and I'm looking at another place soon. Perhaps it was just the Fall/Winter preventing me from finding a place since there is generally less availability during this time (afaik).

Anyway! Now that you have a better understanding of what I'm looking for, what are my options? I am 25. I have no debt and about 12k in savings. I also have a car that I own. I've discarded/donated many belongings so I could pick up and move easily by using just my car. I'm just a guy that wants to be alone and not homeless. Having access to my medication and talk therapy would be nice... a luxury, really. They will have to go away eventually.

I don't really know what to do besides for quitting my full time job. If I kept my part time job, I'd be bringing in about $300/month, which basically equates to food, gas, phone bill, and some misc. expenses. In other words not enough to live on! In any case I'll have nowhere to live. Well, I guess I can sleep in my car lol. I could get a gym membership to use their showers and, well, work out.

I guess if someone knew how to survive without working much or dealing with people then we'd all be doing that, huh?",24Feb2020,1

801,"Good morning, so this may be a confusing situation. I have a dog named Millie, she's a hound ( i believe a mix between a beagle and a dachshund, i dunno, i got her from a friend and he didn't know either. But she's clearly a hound, just smaller and with a longer body like a dachsund.). I also have a cat, she's a tabby. Her name is Princess.

Now, Millie has a really bad habit of chasing Princess. She always just dashes into the back bedroom and leaps on top of the dresser. She doesn't hurt Princess, i think she just likes to play with her.

Now, Millie is also scared of Princess i believe. Sometimes when she chases her, she'll be cornered and can't get to the dresser. All Princess has to do is just turn and stare at him and Millie will just whimper away, slowly. Not rnning scared, just walking.

Whenever Princess get's cornered, sometimes she'll growl at Millie or paw her. But never savagely attack, more of a warning strike.

I mean, Milie is almost 3 times bigger then the cat, but she's actually scared of her as well. Like, if Princess is on my lap, millie won't get close to me. Or if i'm petting Millie, Princess will shove her way between us and Millie will sulk away. I remember one time, Millie was laying in Princess' spot on my bed during the day. Princess went to her spot and growled at her and Millie just walked off.

So i guess my question is, how do i stop her from running after Princess and why does she do it? ANd is it normal for a big dog to be scared of a smaller cat?",24Feb2020,1

803,"Background: I am a professional personal assistant who owns my own LLC and works for mostly duel income families who don't have enough time in their day to do the things they need to do. I essentially run these families households when I work for them long term. Other times I help families or individuals short term with paperwork, budgeting, or scheduling. So, now I am at a weird point and need some help deciding how to tell a family we need to go to the hours they discussed. I know it sounds weird but here is my situation:

I started working with Family A about a month ago and at the time I had availability to work one full day Tuesday (T) (9am-5pm) and a half day on Thursday (Th) (8am-1pm), and sometimes Fridays (8am-1pm) depending on Family C's schedule, whom I no longer work for. They originally wanted someone to just come for 3-4 hours a week. I told them that because I had the availability, I would start by coming for the hours I had available and then we could dwindle it down if needed. On days I finish my work before the end of the ""work day,"" I just leave early and get paid for the hours I was there. 

Fast forward a month, Family B wants to hire me and has a larger schedule need. I had opening availability as Family C no longer required my services.  Family B wants me to come M, W, F and their old assistant who retired came on Tuesdays as well. I told them Family A has me on T, and Th for what has mostly been half days, and that I could split the time on T's and Th's with them as well. I've done this in the past for other families who already had set half days, and the schedule worked well for me. 

I'm not making more money with one family, I have a flat rate for what I charge based on their needs which are very similar. I told Family A I was interviewing with Family B and that I would no longer be doing Fridays with them as it wasn't part of the original agreement anyway, and I always just had them text me the night before if they wanted me to come that Friday. 

Clearly I am a people pleaser, which makes me good at my job. So, if you were this family, what's the best way to share that it's going to be down to the half days that they originally wanted from their assistant? It will still be more than the hours they wanted originally but I feel like I am still not approaching this situation correctly.  I know I need more of a back bone in this situation and how could I not have one when this is MY livelihood but I'm just nervous about upsetting them and want to do right by everyone in the situation.",24Feb2020,1
806,"I’m (21M) healthy and active and have never used substances of any kind besides casual (and once in a while, heavy) drinking.

I’ve had two grandfathers die prematurely from lifelong smoking-caused lung illnesses so I’ve never even dreamt of smoking cigarettes. I’ve also never had weed even once. Never vaped, nothing.

So clearly, smoking of any kind is very foreign to me, but I have to admit that cigars seem a bit appealing. I don’t know if it’s just an aesthetic thing or what but I imagine just kicking back and relaxing with some whiskey on the rocks and a fat cigar sounds chill as hell.

I wouldn’t want to smoke every day, just maybe every other weekend or so. Would that still be bad for me? I’m very anxious about lung health and inhaling carcinogens and forming addictions so I can’t decide if it’s something I would really want to try or not.",24Feb2020,1
807,"Long story short, I’m a software engineer for a company with 3 engineers, A CTO and 2 more of us.  We maintain a large internal tool used by our traders and risk managers exclusively.  Our work load is minimal with a feature or bug fix needed once a week sometimes even once every 2 weeks.  Therefore a majority of my time at work is spent on personal projects and studying for a couple certs they want me to get.  
    I’m struggle to get up in the morning so a lot of times I roll in around 8:05 - 8:15 which seems fine to me as I never have meetings and I have never physically been needed for anything right at 8.  More so, in the 3 months I’ve worked here I’ve never actually been needed before 2pm.  
   However on this particular day, I rolled in at 8:20 and received this slack message from the CTO:

Manager: and please, the basic starting time is 8am and an 8 hour working time

Me: I'm just really not a morning person, so it can be tough for me to hit 8 right on the dot.  It doesn't seem like an issue that if I come in late, to stay a little later to make up for it.  Especially seeing as I don't have meetings at 8 or anything.

Manager: I would like you to be here for 8. It isn't really a morning person thing

So obviously the main concern here is he never addressed my concern about why I, an engineer who mainly works by himself, on his own projects, which can be done at my house, needs to be in the office exactly at 8.  
And more so, I’m a little up in arms that him being a my boss, would totally disregard any concern of mine and glance over it like I never brought it up.  

He is very much the “my way or the highway” type and therefore I didn’t question his motives any more as I still don’t know how far I can push him before him getting completely fed up and firing me.

810,"Context: We met over this past summer. We had been friendly beforehand, but nothing close to what I would call a close friend. Out of the blue, she invited me to talk about something, and from that moment on, something grew between us. Within a month, we were dating, and spending so much of our time together. She was everything that I wanted, and I felt things that I never had in past relationships. She was happy too then, I knew that for a fact, and yet, things changed and I couldn't realize it.

A few weeks ago, after a rough fight, she asked to break up. This caught me off guard, as it had not been something that was ever discussed before. We got emotional, talked it out, and promised to work on things that we thought were wrong. And we did. We promised to be better, but something just felt a little different.

Tuesday, she broke up with me for good. She said that she had emotionally distanced herself from me already, and that she had problems that she didn't communicate. She felt that she couldn't talk to me, and so these problems were ever communicated. I was devastated, and the next few days were hell. A few days later, we talked, and she gave me her explanation. Her problems with me were valid, and they are things that I'm taking to improve.

My issue is that we met up to talk a few days ago/had a retreat together (part of same org). When we talked, I felt closer than I had to her in a while. The way we talked made me realize we hadn't been like that in a while. At retreat, when we worked together, things didn't have to be spoken. We just clicked. And this is where I don't know what to do.

We mutually agreed to not talk for a few weeks because we are both a little confused right now. Between the both us, its clear that at minimum, we are bound to be close friends. And with that, one of us is going to get feelings again. Despite the fact that she said she didn't want to put the effort into our relationship to fix our problems, I can't help but think that if we fixed our problems individually, we will inevitably find each other again. Yet, we aren't taking space, we're broken up, and she wanted me to know that.

I'm trying my best to move on. I've downloaded apps to just try and go on things, just to see whats even out there. When we talk in a few weeks, I don't know what to expect. We didn't break up because we hated each other, or we weren't deeply compatible. We broke up because we had problems that we felt like couldn't be fixed together. And so right now, I'm just taking the time to fix those problems and work on myself. In time, however, I can't help but to feel like I want to get back with her, because what we had was truly special to me.

817," 

So just a bit of information about me. I'm a 21-year-old male and starting my first year in college studying to become a teacher. Admittedly I'm quite an introvert and not all that social. Let's just say that if I had to pick between being with a group of people or just being on my own, I'd pick being on my own about 60 percent of the time. So there's this girl, Catherine (Not her real name), who has the same majors as mine so we attend the same classes every day. I noticed that Catherine never really talks to anyone or hang out with other people. Instead, she either spends her free in the computer room or library. Which are the same places I go to since like I said, not very social. The first and only genuine conversation we had was during a class two weeks ago. We introduced ourselves and talked about which high schools we attended, why we wanted to become teachers, that sort of thing.

Now here's my major issue: I DO NOT know how to have a conversion with her. After our first meeting, the furthest I ever get is talking about all the work and assignments we have to do and the conversation pretty much ends after that. And it's so frustrating because I genuinely do wanna get to know her better. But every time I even so much as attempt to try, I immediately stop myself because I'm scared she'll think annoying, or worse, a creep.

The problem is I feel like I am not capable of learning new skills, and I feel like I will never be great at any of them since I would be starting now.

Some things I am interested in is learning an instrument, learning how to use adobe premier pro to a higher degree than I currently do (id like to be able to add animations and more creatively edit things for videos besides just basic editing), or maybe even just doing things like streaming on twitch for fun or making YouTube videos for fun. Also things like learning Jiu Jistu would be fun, but I am pretty timid and I’m not sure if I’m cut out for that sort of thing.

At the moment, as I mentioned, he's down in the dumps. He's always been a very strong person mentally and for the first time in his life, he's on anti depressants, receiving counselling and struggling with his mental health.

They can’t workout an arrangement/ child support system, since they won’t even talk to each other.

She never visits my parents unless I am there despite their frequent pleas for her to do so (she is still in school so she’s free to visit them much more often than I am). When they ask if she’ll be coming home soon, she usually tells them that she has obligations in her college town that weekend and doesn’t want to have to get up early to drive back there from our hometown.

Well. My mom just called me crying because my sister was in our hometown this weekend and didn’t make any effort to see them. She even lied to my mom about it when asked. The only reason my mom found out was because she saw a credit card transaction from our hometown on my sister’s account when my mom logged in to transfer money to my sister to pay for her rent and brand new car my parents just bought her. Worst of all, my sister did exactly what she told my parents she never wants to do: she got up early to drive back to her college town in time for her work there. 

Usually, I always defend my sister when my parents come to me about her. I tell them she’s just different than me and family isn’t as much of a priority for her. I tell them she just wants to do her own thing and find her own path. She and I have always been incredibly close and I consider her one of my best friends. However, lately she’s been distancing herself from me as well as our parents. I can hardly get a text back from her now.

Like I said above, we have all always been very close. My parents are somewhat clingy but always very loving, and not abrasive or abusive. We have our own issues, but nothing that I can think that warrants completely ignoring her family. There is only one legitimate reason that I can think of why she would be keeping me and my parents at arms length: she lives a double life. I know about it, but my parents do not. What I mean by “double life” is that she has been in a relationship with another woman for years, and has kept it a secret from the family. I found out from a few mutual friends in the LGBT community, and she doesn’t know that I know. The only reason I haven’t told her that I know is because I would never, ever want to put her in a situation where she feels forced to come out to me or to anyone. I just really don’t want to do that to her. She also has an entire group of friends built around this relationship that she purposefully keeps from us as well. I'd imagine she was with her girlfriend and/or these secret friends when she was in our hometown this weekend. Who knows what else she has going on that I don’t know about. This could just be the tip of the iceberg.

At this point, I’m feeling like telling her that I know may be my best option here. I’m not talking about some big dramatic, “I KNOW ABOUT YOUR DOUBLE LIFE!” speech. But I feel like I’m losing her, and maybe if she knows that I know about that part of her life, it could bridge that gap. I’d never put her in a situation where she feels she has to tell my parents if she isn’t ready, and I’d gladly take this secret to my grave. But I just don’t want to lose her as my friend and sister. 

What do you think, Reddit? Should I let her know that I know about her secret life and that it’s okay to be her authentic self? Or should I leave well-enough alone and let her work it out with my parents? Or do you see a third option for me here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",24Feb2020,1
830,"I won't get into the details of exactly what they did, but long story short is that my very close friend who I've known for a few years now did something despicable which caused a rift in my immediate friend group and support system. Almost everyone in their life has cut them out in one way or another and my friend is now dealing with the harsh repercussions of their actions.

831,"UGHHHHH 

I’m (F17) am very conflicted right now because I’ve decided to stop all communication with this dude (M17) I really liked (also a coworker). 

Maybe it’s because he’s the first dude that has ever showed interest in me? That I’ve also liked, it’s just very confusing. He would constantly make me feel special and at times I felt comfortable with him but other times he’d make me mad uncomfortable. Like he’d constantly “joke” about us having “sex” when I was clear towards him that I didn’t want that stuff to happen between us because we didn’t know each other like that.He also said and I quote “I’ll pay you for sex no one has to know” and idk it just stuck with me. I didn’t want to make a big deal out of “joke” so I would just ignore it and would change the conversation. 

We also made multiple plans to which he would cancel last minute ex: yesterday night 

He was suppose to come chill at my house and ended texting me TWO HOURS after the set time we were suppose to meet that he was gonna be “late” and idk I got fed up at that point because he already cancelled on me 3 times in the past and I took the initiative to cancel. This is how the conversation goes:

Me: Idk since you’re gonna be mad late I don’t see the point of you coming to hang for like an hour lmao.
Him: oh ok. Next time hopefully 😂😂
Me: I don’t think there’s gonna be a next time :)
Him: wyd? And damn 

At this point I’m crying out of frustration and sadness because fuck I’m an idiot, I gave him sooo many chances and he still fucks up. I end up blocking him. 

But now I don’t know anymore, I miss talking to him but I also despise the fact that he acts like this. Did I do the right thing? Should I express to him how I feel? (since we work together and I have to see him every Saturday) or should I just act like nothing happened between us?",24Feb2020,1

838,I (F 22) feel like I don’t get angry and I’ve realized it’s causing an issue in my relationships. I’ve read about repressed anger and how it could come from trauma as a child but I can’t really remember my childhood. I just don’t know the steps to take or how to unlock “anger”. I know I get angry about extreme things in the world but with my everyday life I don’t. Even if I’m in a fight my mind just shuts down and I don’t say anything which is never good for conflict resolution. I don’t know if it’s because I just don’t expect much from people because of how many times I’ve been disappointed so there’s no room there for anger. I used to think I’m just an easy going person but I’ve realized that’s it’s unhealthy not to feel this emotion. I just feel really lost and I don’t know what to do but I know I need to do something.

839,"At the end of last year, my younger sister moved to the other side of the country with one of out cousins. At the time we all just felt it was good for her to gain more independence and life experience living away from home for the first time. She didn’t keep in contact much, and I didn’t think much of it.

Around the end of January she called for the first time where she talked about being caught in financial struggles. Her housemates would eat all her food and leave her and our cousin to go hungry. They do have an income but not really enough to get their own place to live.

So she had moved from there into a different house with new her boyfriend and his family. Keep in mind she’s barely lived in that city for a month and now they’re living together. I didn’t particularly like him when she introduced me over the phone but I just shrugged it off because I never like people who date my siblings anyway.

Then, about a week ago, after a period of no contact, she called bawling her eyes out, which is extremely out of character for her, she barely ever cries. She said that she was miserable. Her boyfriend keeps accusing her of cheating and going through her phone and invading her privacy. He won’t let her make phone calls without staying in the room with her. He won’t let her leave the house, even to walk the dog, unless she’s accompanied by someone so she doesn’t go out and cheat on her. She feels isolated because she doesn’t know anyone there and he won’t let her go out and socialise. 

She said he shows off in front of his friends by being sexual with her when she’s not comfortable or in the mood and he tries to pressure her into having sex. He dumped her on Valentine’s Day just to later say “it didn’t count”. She tried to leave the room, and he grabbed her arm so hard it left a red mark.

She was meant to come visit me at the end of February, but she cancelled last minute. She just said it was to save money but I’m worried that her boyfriend did something to her to make her say that. I mean, he’s always in the background when I call her and whatever I text her, he reads it and he won’t let her use snapchat.

When she called me last week she was so adamant about leaving him and coming home. And then her pitch changed so suddenly and she told me not to worry about it. 

I said i’d pay for her bus fare but she said not to.

I’m so worried. I really want to get her away from there. I can’t talk to her without him somehow listening in either. I can’t stop thinking about it and it makes me so sad and angry that someone would do that to her.",24Feb2020,1

842,"I (f20) have been so out of touch with the dating world. My last relationship (as well as all my past relationships) was not a healthy one, especially in the field of intimacy. We’ll call him G, and G was a pushy guy and didn’t respect when I said no. “No” was “maybe” to him if he pressured me enough to give in (and I did, too much).
That being said, I’ve been away from G for a year and have totally cut him out of my life but the fear of dating again plagues me still. I’m terrified of intimacy and I have bad social anxiety to boot. I’ve been on a few dates here and there but anytime something seemed promising I freaked myself out at the idea of being stuck with another guy like G and cut it off quickly. I don’t give myself chances to find a good relationship because of that fear they’re all going to be like G once I get comfortable with them and just like G did they’ll drop the nice guy act once they have my heart and use it to hurt me.

now onto the story: i found out today that my teacher has sent it to every year group to play in assembly, which none of my class agree on. it's supposed to play tomorrow in my year groups assembly and i hate it. i expressed distaste to the whole thing as i am extremely self conscious about my looks (i have been bullied for my weight, smile/teeth and just anything you could imagine) and being filmed is my worst nightmare but my teacher insisted that it would be ok. just thinking of everyone seeing my face makes me super anxious and i don't want to have a panic attack in school when it plays.

a) not telling us earlier

b) why can't she just accept that we all agreed to play it at the beginning of the show? we don't even get marked on it. i get it as a goof at the start of the play but it doesn't need to be shown to everyone.

854,"Guys I know this post is long but I’m scared.. I’m so scared my brother might kill himself or get many years in jail because of his mental illness and I just need some advice or words of comfort. 

A little background,  he’s been suffering from bipolar 1 for about 3 years now, starting at age 17. It started when a friend of his got him to take a handful of DXM pills which put him in a drug induced psychosis for weeks. Then his first manic episode started.  He was staying up for days, doing irrational dangerous things (like cooking a can of beans on top of 6 butter knives on top of the stove burner, and countless other things.) when he was at home, and I’d try to be with him, he would spend hours rambling on about incoherent and grandiose stuff, and then stop for a few minutes to say he’s scared, and all he can hear are voices, and he wants it to stop. 

He went to a care facility hours away in Florida, got better, was in medicine for a little, then stopped taking the meds or going to therapy. 

Since then, he’s been in and out of manic state every couple of months, sometimes getting help, sometimes not. 

My family has recently moved out of the house, my sister and I getting married and engaged moving on with life, my parents have split up after 30 years of marriage, and he is currently staying with different family members until he can get a job He can keep and get a place of his own.  I know stress can cause mania (I’ve taken multiple courses in psychology in college) and it’s caused it to start again. 

The past few weeks he’s been in a state of mania, but it’s different this time.  He reluctantly (only because I sat down and asked him to in between his insane antics and nonstop taking) went to a care facility here close to home to try to get signed in, and they made us sit there for 8 hours and then said there’s currently no room for a new patients. 

A few more days passed, and it got to the point where my mom, who was staying with me and my fiancé at the time, was crying because she was scared of him (they’ve had issues in the past because she was scared he was going to hurt her and she had to cal the police who took him to a care facility, and her and my dad have also given the okay for him to be given sedatives at the hospital without him knowing) and she called the police to get him, and the police came and said they couldn’t do anything because he wasn’t going to hurt someone or himself. 

So he left my place, and stayed with my sister. My sister talked him into going back to the care facility, and then said he could stay with her and her husband as long as he took his meds and went to therapy and came home at 10, etc. and he was doing really good for a couple of days at the care facility. Then one of the nurses gave him a dose of sedatives that was WAY too high, and it caused him to pass out and hit his head. He went to the hospital and got stitches, then back to the care facility for a couple days, then left to stay with my sister.  He now has a complete distrust for doctors due to his past experiences combined with his mania and paranoia. 

Those couple days after he left were amazing. Everyone of his family members was so proud of him because he was doing so good. Still manic, but he was back to his old sweet, loving, creative self.  Then a few days pass and he quit taking his meds. He stated that they were the government trying to control him, and he could be okay without them. He asked us to just accept him as he is, but we found it hard because we’ve all been put through the unachievable task of trying to do that in the past when he is manic. 

The past few days have been particularly bad. He’s completely lost his mind and is constantly talking about conspiracy theories, like his brain is completely open to anything he reads or someone tells him.  He’s completely lost his cool out of frustration multiple times.  He’s called everyone of his family members horrible names and said he hates us.  He’s completely unwilling to get help or take medication.  He’s constantly driving around or staying with friends for as long as they’ll put up with him.  He’s currently trying to get a ride to A city 6 hours away to talk to a lawyer about suing the care facility that gave him to much medicine.  My parents have given up and are staying out of it because they’ve given everything they can, emotionally, physically, and financially. They’re in a lot of debt from hospital and mental facility bills.  

My sister and I are the last ones still trying to help, but he’s pushing us further and further away, currently saying he hates both of us and delusionally saying we’re trying to control him.  

I know there’s nothing else I can do. There’s nothing any of us can do. Were not talking to him per his request. We’re all so scared any minute we’re going to get a phone call saying he’s dead in a ditch. We would all be devastated.  When he’s stable, he is one of the sweetest and creative person you’ll ever meet.  But when he’s manic, you would pass him off as some crazy rude disrespectful asshole.  

My anxiety is at an all time high.  Me and my fiancé have done everything we can.  Please, I just need a word of advice or comfort.. to anyone who has taken the time to read all of this, thank you.  I hope it sheds some light on how serious mental disorders can be.  And maybe let you think twice when you run into a crazy homeless person on the street.  They just need help because they are ill.",24Feb2020,1

I say this because as the title suggests, I stumbled upon so much child porn also on their account. Now usually if I see an account like this I just report them as I know I can’t do much else. However since this person obviously knew me I thought it was worth trying to do more. I spent all night trying to figure out who they are and I did because they posted a photo of another girl leaving her Instagram handle and when I searched it up we only had one mutual, this guy who I didn’t recognize because they had no photos. When I clicked on his page however I saw we had over 15 mutual so obviously he’s from my city and people must know who he is . Lucky he was following my best friend and I asked her and she said she knew who the Instagram account was,some kid from a film class we had together, but that he’s still in high school, likely a senior by now. that wasn’t hard proof though. Lucky for me(or maybe not) he posted a video this morning with his face on the twitter account (porn account) and I showed my friend and she immediately identified the face on twitter as the guy behind the instagram account as well. I didn’t recognize them but my friend did. So now I’m stuck, I only have their first name what can I do now? Their are videos he’s posting of girls who are obviously under the age of 13. He’s also a proud self proclaimed map. what can I do? Is this enough evidence to go to the police with? (LA California)",24Feb2020,1
863,"I’m 17, I’ve been questioning whether I have OCD since I was 14. One time I broke down when I was talking to my parents and told them I think I have it and they just said I was tired and emotional and that I didn’t have OCD. I get focused on things for long periods of time and hate myself for it, I go through phases that last quite a long time and some of them come back. Some examples are hating myself because of my weird kinks (light bdsm stuff) but I’m over that now. I also went through a phase of thinking I was a homosexual for a long time and my intrusive thoughts kept telling me I was. I was obsessed with how I look and I constantly hated my face and compared myself to other people I walk past. My brain will make a point if they’re good looking or not. Well my brain has started doing that with young kids in my school. Like if I walk past an objectively good looking child my brain will say ‘they’re good looking’. This has resulted in me getting intrusive thoughts telling me I’m a pedophile. Of course I’m not attracted to these kids and none of the thoughts are sexual, but I keep hating myself and I have trouble sleeping at night because my brain keeps telling me I’m a pedo.

These are the worst intrusive thoughts I’ve ever had, I just want them to go away. I sleep until the afternoon on weekends because when I’m asleep I don’t get these thoughts. I’m scared

What if I am a pedo? I don’t know what to do Please someone help, can anyone offer some solutions? I’m scared that these thoughts will get worse

Is meditating a good idea? Psychedelics? Thank you",24Feb2020,1
864,"Hi! so i really need help.
i recently came to the conclusion that my brother's girlfriend is toxic, at least to me. 
Since she came along, about a year ago, my brother and i have been fighting a lot more, and it's hurts cuz my brother is so important to me. I think she might be telling him stuff to make me look like an asshole! 
i know i make mistakes, but im not a bad person and they are treating me like im the worst scum on earth.
 
They are so passive aggressive and the moment i try to say something to her, she cries and makes drama, and my brother gets so mad. So he say stuff that hurt me, like, in a critical way (i have depression and hearing hurting stuff coming from one of the people that i love the most is really really bad for my mental health) 

I been so lonely because of that. We used to be friends, now he practically hates me, and i think a lot of it is because of her.

I remember being with my uncle when i saw it. And that we had watched a movie. I think he might have thought i had fallen asleep, or maybe it was an R rated film with a sex scene in it, or maybe it was just a fucked up advert before a movie. Im fairly sure he didnt touch me. But i also have dissociative memory problems when im stressed. Im fairly sure its innocent but ive always been super uncomfortable with physical contact from him and im worried that is why. I want to not be uncomfortable around him anymore since hes so close to me and has always been a great uncle and is one of the most important male figures in my life.

866,"Pretty much I wanna kill myself  because I am severely depressed and suicidal due to Racist reasons, I  guess you could say. I literally wanna die whenever I see a white  girl/""man of color"" couple, usually the guy is black. I'm not sure why  it affects me so much but it does. I feel horrible, inadequate, inferior  and depressed.

If I see one these  couples I literally wanna die I just can't take it. I guess I also  wanna die at the fact that like immigrant dudes from like the Middle  East just come to the Western World and screw a bunch of hot white  chicks from here. It makes me wanna die. \*This is the main reason I am  suicidal\*

I've attempted suicide  twice. I feel like the World is ending, for at least white people.  Because I've been to London and France (near Paris), both places were  literally like 8/10 people on the street were either black or Muslim -  and I know that being racist is horrible but like it literally just  looks like these people took over those countries.

Here  in America, Latinos and stuff have taken over completely, and Asians  too... but I don't mind as such because America belongs to no one so I'm  not really upset by this. Canada also has huge Muslim populations...  and it just seems like (a) white people are dying off and being replaced  and (b) Christianity is dying and being replaced with Islam in this  part of the World.

And for someone  like me, a white Christian... well, this isn't good. I have absolutely  no will to live. I don't see a future for me here. I wish I didn't care  but I just do. And it just depresses me all day everyday.

I'm  probably gonna get heavily attacked after what I just said. I deserve  it. Well, if I offended you, please assure yourself that I'll probably  be killing myself very soon, so you can all be happy knowing that. 

P.S I'd also like to mention one of  my parents is Latino, so I have heard Spanish in my family my whole  life. I still consider myself white though. I also had a Muslim friend  who was my best friend for around 5 years, and I was also best friends  with a black guy for around three years. I've also seen my parent that  is Latino be racially abused and got very upset as a result, and I  supported them. I'm also third generation American.

I didn't even used to feel like this, It started a few years ago though. I wish I wasn't like this. But nowadays in America the amount of white girls who go for black guys is absolutely insane. It’s 100% noticeable and is a phenomenon. There’s no way it isn’t true the sheer amount of these couples is crazy. There no escape for me. I feel like suicide is my only option. But people have told me it’s stupid but it still affects me! I don’t know what to do.",24Feb2020,1
868," 

Thanks in advance for your time. I'll try to make this as swift as possible. I desperately need some input.

I moved to the US in early 2019. \[32M\] Single, without kids, not many ties to my hometown besides core family. Few months later, amidst Dorian and while working on restoration jobs, I met an older woman \[45F\]. She was trying to make a fresh start, get rid of debt and provide for her daughters (15yo and 21yo) who live abroad with their father, all while leaving behind a 10 year relationship that ended badly (cheating and a couple slaps).

Somehow and someway we hit it off even though we were worlds apart. We found out we lived like 10 mins away from each other and we started hanging out, hooking up and things moved really quickly. We were both very upfront about everything (past and present) and had (still have) a lot of trust into each other. To the point where I (still) have access to her bank account and help her move some money and stuff. We talked about being a rebound to each other but as months passed by we ended up talking about love and a relationship despite our age difference and I knew her children would always be her priority N°1. She took a risk as well because she was moving on ""in front of"" family and friends (in quotes cause they live abroad) and she had doubts about me being younger and not wanting children in the future (she is not able to have children anymore, she took care of that).

We did talk more seriously as time went by and at some point she said it was about time we moved in together after she finally paid her ex off by New Year's. By then I realized I was already in love and I told her that, she told me the same, that she was already in love and that she felt confident because her daughters would love me if they found out the way I treated her and the way she felt about me. We spent a sweet Christmas together with all our friends and all. Note that this was never about money or anything, it's not that I was a sugarboy (lol), just regular relationship progression.

Holidays hit her really hard for it was the first time she spent Xmas and NYs away from her daughters. She finally got rid of her highest debt, spend hours crying and all that. And right after she said she couldn’t go through with our plans and that we had to slow things down cause she still had feelings for her ex and stuff, that she felt really confused and all that and that it was a mistake trying to forget a guy with another guy. That was a bit of a shock but at the same time didn't hit that hard cause it was always one subject I kept my guard up about.

So I realized she wasn't as upfront as before which made me realize she got back in touch with her ex and I figured she was either embarrassed, confused or conflicted. I couldn't do much so I didn’t really did much. It's something you have to come out on your own, right?

2020 hit me really hard, got laid off and stuff, practically ended my relationship and had a hard time getting back on my feet. She was very supportive. Now February comes, we spent together Valentine's, had sex one last time a few days later and talked about it, she pointed out we needed to stop that. I agreed.

She then reaches out to me telling me there was a job opportunity for the both of us to work together in a wonderful schedule. (11pm to 5am LOL). I mentioned our history together and she said she was ok with that, that we both knew each other very well and that she felt confident it wouldn't be a bad thing. I agreed. She then told me she had a rough time as well at her place. The couple in charge of the overnight shift was her landlady and her husband. Turns out she accidentally reported something and management found out the couple was scamming the company in certain ways. Management decided to fire the couple and reward HER with both the morning and overnight shift. Since the overnight shift needs a couple, she immediately took me in with her. Landlady is suspicious and vocal about this, arguing this was all ill intended. My partner feels the burn, is not comfortable with it and wants to move out.

It's been a week, we had our first inspection and we did great. But then she sat down with me and asked me if I met someone or if I was talking with someone, all because she noticed me on my cellphone laughing and smiling. I answered the truth (No, I was just joking around with a male friend) and then I was still puzzled so I asked why she asked me that, if she maybe met someone. She said no, but ""a guy would never tell a woman that he HAS somebody else"". That comment raised my flags, she knows me too much to tell me something like that. Everyday we share Uber, that night she was punching us out, she gave me her mobile. I got in her msngr, put the locking pattern and found out a secret conversation with a guy on February. Good looking and all. And while I was all surprised reading about kisses and stuff, I was shocked by another thing. I read what looked like an script. Same thing I heard from her back when I met her. ""I want to know where do I stand and if the risk is worth it for me, I'm being honest about what I have back home so I need to know if you are as well, you seem too perfect to be alone"" besides some other things like ""you are successful yet you cant hang out on weekends, ask me out on work hours, you never call at night, I overheard ""honey"" before you hang up"", etc.

I didn't mention all that at first, cause I was kinda embarrassed and my hands were shaking but still I asked her about her comment and if she was talking about somebody else. She denied that, just said she is still in talk with her ex and that there is nobody else in her life.

So now I'm connecting the dots and I feel as if I fell in love with a completely different person, I feel like it was all a performance. I'm thinking about hyper-gamy and she following the ""money"" and ""good looks"", which is something she always condemned while she was with me (i was starting from scratch so she was consistent about it, at least with me). Now I'm even considering the whole reward double shift was intended and that perhaps she did ditch her landlady purposely and without any warning. I would say I'm more conflicted about this than being actually heartbroken, or that's what I like to think, at least. I don't feel like she has taken advantage of me (at least not money-wise) and I still trust her with my stuff (we are each other's emergency contacts), and so does she apparently.

While we don't share too much time together at work, and when we do we do GREAT, I feel the need to tell her that I know for a fact she is lying, but at the same time I'm embarrassed I checked her messages, specially since the last series we watched was YOU (lol) and we used to joke about it , I do need the job and I don't want our friendship or cooperation to feel uncomfortable. I don't really know what to do or how to feel about the whole situation. I'm a bit of an introvert and I'm between crying, anger, sadness and motivation to overcome the whole subject, don't really have anyone to talk about this cause I don't want to talk behind her back nor bad-mouth her. Even if my fears were true I don't want to damage her nor make her/our situation worse. We both need the job.

TL, DR.

My ex just took me in on a great job opportunity together. She makes an odd comment so I grabbed her cell and found out iffy stuff that now makes me think she is a completely different person, feel uncomfortable but at the same time I don't want to leave the job or complicate matters.",24Feb2020,1

Anyway, I wanna preface this by saying that I come from a middle-class family that has access to clean water and can afford many wants and needs.

I found a dealership outside of my state that said they found a bank that would finance me at a high interest rate, which is fine I figured that would happen.

879,"We live below two sisters...

I currently live in a ground floor level apartment suite with my boyfriend.  Above us, lives two older sisters.  

We use our patio door as our main door majority of the time as it’s next to the main building door. So instead of using two keys to enter and go through all the hallways, we go through one.  Because of this, and because they are chain smokers and always on their balcony directly above us, we see them almost daily and talk to them almost daily as well.  

When we first moved in, they were both extremely kind and a general joy to talk to. After getting to know them better, we came to learn that one of the sisters, we’ll call her T, was very sick.  She was constantly in and out of the hospital and at one point her sister, M, was afraid she might not be coming home.  T made a miraculous turn and came home, however she’s still quite sick.  She often walks around with an iv bag and must use a walker to get around.  She is such a sweet kind lady and it always hurt my heart seeing her struggle and be so frail. 

It’s now coming up to 2 years we’ve been living here and my how things changed.  Almost a few months after moving in, we came to realize the dynamic between these two sisters.  T was consistently sweet. Always asked us how our day was when we came home from work, and wished us a good day when we left in the mornings.  Every once in awhile she’d knock on our door and ask if she could borrow money for smokes. We don’t mind as she’s clearly living off of her pension (I should state we live in an apartment similar to low income housing) and she always pays us back.  She’s so nice and sweet about it that we’ve never minded.  M on the other hand. We finally started to see her true colours. 

M is mean.  And T is the closest one she can lash out on.  M likes to get drunk with the ground level apartment across from us.  Usually she forgets stuff from their suite but is too lazy to go up one flight of stairs and retrieve it.  So what does she do instead? Yells at T to throw down whatever she needs and then proceeds to berate her for not doing it quick enough - her sick sister who needs assistance to walk.  Countless times we’ve heard M yelling, insulting and calling T names such as stupid and an idiot.  We also often see T taking their garbage or recycling out.  This might not seem bad however it’s hard to watch a very sick person, balancing a bag of garbage on their walker, slowing making their way across the parking lot (it’s huge) to throw it out, when her healthy, able bodied sister sits on her ass. Whenever we see this, one of us will run out to her and finish the task for her.  

I’m writing this to get it off my chest because I need somewhere to vent about it.  Currently it’s 3:50am and I’ve been listening to M screaming at her sister “fuck you, you piece of shit” over and over.  Meanwhile I can hear T sobbing, telling her she’s being mean and to please stop.  This has been going on for almost an hour.  Clearly someone else in one of the surrounding suites has also been awoken by this as the police have just rolled up when I was half way through writing all of this.  It’s incredibly distressing and I find myself struggling to not intervene.  Although I’m not sure what I’d even do if I did. It weighs on me a lot hearing such distressing emotional abuse. I worry there’s more than just emotional, although that’s merely speculation. I posted this in another sub and was advised to wait till M was gone and give T a note of some sort.  Not entirely sure what I would write in it. I’m also afraid M would somehow come across it and lash out.",24Feb2020,1

And now they’re putting the blame on me and picking at me for it and it’s making me feel really really fucking sad;one friend even posted something about him “as a joke” even though they’ve never spoken to him once in their life,so obviously he found at and started arguing with my friend,because of this,a lot of her friends are starting to say stuff to both me and my bf for it and I just don’t know what to do.i tell them who I like and who I want to be with has nothing to do with them...but they don’t listen.My bf keeps saying if I really need to I can leave him so I’m not in all this trouble,but I love him.

886," Met a guy (mutual friend of my friends)

Didn't think much of him but he kept texting me / wanted to take me out

We ended up going out to a nice restaurant and hooked up

Saw him every weekend since then (slept over, he keeps my toothbrush at his house)

Problem is he doesn't really text me anymore (pretty dry questions / answers) lacks conversation.

In general he's super quiet, we do talk when we see each other but it's usually me talking.

887,"So the story is my sister is getting married this April (yay!) and asked for us sisters to be in the bridal party. Thing is, I’m suffering from extreme anxiety disorder and only started treatment. So while I’m VERY honored and happy to have been asked, I am also terrified at the idea of walking down the aisle and being in front of everyone, along with some other things. 

While I know everyone is gonna be paying attention to the bride and not myself, I’m still really stressing over the few minutes it’ll take to walk down and celebrate my sister’s big day. 

Not to mention my boyfriend and I are talking about marriage as well and well...that would have the spotlight on me, haha.

Anyone else experienced going through this? Whether it was your big day or in the wedding party, how did you overcome your anxiety over it all? How can I get a better handling over my anxiety in general?

888,"TL;DR: I think I lost my friend because I'm basically an asshole who can't tell the difference between imagination and reality

Hi guys, so I have or had (i'm not really sure at this point) this friend.. when we met (at school) I felt like we immediately clicked. I am a very shy person and this doesn't happent to me often. We talked almost every day and it was amazing. But then semester ended so we didn't see or texted each other that much. And me being the anxious asshole that I am came up with many scenarios why she doesn't want to talk to me. (I have anxiety disorder so making up scenarios is pretty much something I do every day)

Then school started and it got worse, because I actually started believing that se doesn't want to talk to me ... so I did the mistake not talking to her that much because I felt like it would just bother her. After 2 weeks I made the mistake of TEXTING her asking what's going on because I was too scared. She got mad because 1) I texted her instead of talking to her in person and 2) that I was the one who didn't talk to her. When I told her that I thought she didn't want to talk to me she said that that's my issue and to stop projecting it on her (she was right). When I asked her if we could talk at school she said ""no"" that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore (which I understand). So I decided that I'm going to just apologize when I see her. 

Fast forward to today, I went to her and said if I could talk to her and she said ""no"" that she is stressed about something at school. So I said that I just wanted to apologize to which she again said ""no"". We talked a little afterwards but it was about school and still very awkward. 

I'm really desperate..I don't want to lose her just because I couldn't tell the difference between my imagination and reality. What do you guys think I should do?",24Feb2020,1
889,"Hey reddit,

So I'm held at a high standard by my family and when I don't meet that expectation I'm compared to my straight A cousins and put down. Recently I've been threatened that if I don't hit straight As, I'll lose my job and everything that brings me entertainment outside of family. I've lost almost all motivation, and only have enough in me to stay above Bs and a few As at an A-. I've tried to tell my parents that I'm simply not a school person and they always call it me being lazy when I seriously find unhappiness with school. My GPA is a 3.5 on a 5.0 scale which has brought me down into a sort of depression. At this point I believe everything short of the best is a disappointment because of how I've been raised. I don't get to choose classes I'm interested in (culinary and engineering courses.

I'm instead thrown into science which I could care less about, anatomy, which I also don't care about, History, which is kind of cool, but I still don't feel invested enough to stay on top of it. Only 2 of my teachers really try to stay on the cool activities and cool stories and ways of keeping us interested. The rest read a fucking powerpoint and make us watch a 5 minute video and expect us to excel. I'm so tired of the same shit and just want to be better for my parents. Deep down I know I can do culinary and engineering with my current GPA, but im led to believe that I can't get anything without a 5.0. I'm so tired.

I learned to speak English when I was a little kid as my dad comes from the US, I have never lived there myself but I have a lot of family there who we often visit. So I speak American English as I was taught by my family. But the teacher at my school forces us to learn British English, in spite of the fact that she doesn’t even have a British accent herself. It wouldn’t be that big of a problem but the other day we were writing an essay and I mistakenly wrote ‘movie’ instead of ‘film’ and she marked it as wrong. I mean the meaning is the same, right? And this wasn’t even the first time that something like this happened, sometimes I say a sentence that is completely common in spoken language and she says that it’s not correct, when I’m pretty sure it is. I don’t want to disregard her or anything but to me it seems like she learnt the language from a book or something and never actually uses it in real life. She also gives me bad grades because I sometimes use American vocabulary, since that comes to me naturally but I mean it’s still English, right?

I’m interested in switching into computer science after my first semester or two, but I’m intimidated because even though I have interest and I think I’d be a good fit I have no engineering or programming experience and I feel like all the other students will and I will be expected to have prior experience.

896,"Dear fellow redditers,
please excuse any mistakes as English is not my first language.

My (W23) father (M51) has some sort of life crisis, although he does not openly show it. I love him more than anything, he is such a lovely and smart human being and I really want to help him, but I do not know how. Here is the problem:

We are from another country, my parents studied economics at a very good university in that country and had good and well paying jobs (for that country). 
Shortly after my birth, we moved to the country we currently live in. Unfortunately, their degrees are not as noble here as they were in our home country. Plus, they had to learn the language, which made the search for a job even harder. 

My mother works in a good position now while my father seems so struggle the last 15 years. He always tried to do some freelance stuff but most of the time it went bad, every time for different reasons. 
Currently, he works as a freelancer for a rich guy he knows for some years. Like, the guy has the money and my father runs all his businesses because rich guy is not very good at it. Hmmm 
My father told me that rich guy starts to show behaviour that affects the businesses in a negative way even more than he did before. For example, he takes risks like investing without thinking, my father has to make up his mistakes etc. 

This is the reason why my father wants to leave. He knows that it will all come down soon. Problem is: He does not know what to do instead. No company will hire him, as he is already 51 years old and worked as a freelancer most of the time. Around 5-10 years ago he applied to a lot of jobs and got denied every single time. And now, he is even older.

How can I help him? What are his perspectives? 

This hurts me so much because he is actually SO smart, he is my role model, I look up to him.. but his work life is terrible.

899,"It's going to be a long story, and I know I'm an asshole for what happened. But here it goes. TL;DR at the end.

I have been friends with this girl for 6 years now. She's been my best friend since we met. At some point we had a relationship together, which ended because it began to feel more like best friends for her again. 

Before she broke up she had been talking to this guy which I wasn't very fond of and told her about. She said I didn't have to worry about it. A little less than a month after we broke up she was in a relationship with that same guy. Of course it hurt, but not a real problem right?

After we had our time apart we started to meet up again. We had some fun, but her new boyfriend didn't like it. We tried a bunch of times and it didn't seem to change much. At some point she had her birthday party. He would be there, I would be there. Of course I was nervous at the time because I didn't want to give him the wrong impressions. So I got closer to her other friends which I already kind of knew. It seemed to click really well, and it was a fun time.

After her birthday one of her friends started asking me to chill togerher more and more. Eventually asking her, her boyfriend and her other friends aswell. All good. But as time passed she and her boyfriend got invited less and less. Eventually she told me how she felt about it, and I agreed that it was weird and wanted to do something about it. At the time I was not really in a clear mindset but that should not be an excuse for what happened. 

Instead of helping and telling her friends about it, I didn't do anything. For some reason I got too scared to tell them what was going on. If only it had ended there. But it didn't. This went on for almost a year, and either her friends replaced her in her with me in her own friendgroup, or stole her friends. Depends on how you want to look at it. 

At some point I had hung out with those people and she messaged me how my weekend had been. I said it had been fun and had been drinking with my family that I hadn't seen in a long time. Which in itself was true, but I left out the fact that I had hung out with her old friends too that weekend. Which she already knew. Obviously she was not too pleased that I lied to her like that. And at that time I thought it would be the end of our friendship, or what was left of it. 

She doesn't want anything to do with the friends I kind of took from her anymore, but she keeps coming back to me. She never had a lot of friends, and I have been her friend longer than anyone else in her life. We went through a lot together and I want to fix things with her but don't know how. She wants me to change, but I don't know what I should change. 

Of course I want to stay friends with her, she's very important to me. I just don't know how to show her I'm fighting for her as hard as she has fought for me. I hurt her so much, yet she wants to stay friends. I feel extremely guilty about all of this, because I made her life a living hell for over a year. Could anyone please give me advice what to do?

Kinda replaced my best friends place in her own friendgroup/stole her friends, lied to her, but she still wants to remain friends. I however need to change for the better for her.",24Feb2020,1

908,"Now, before I start, I know i wouldn't be an asshole for doing so, if I would be considering it for the right reasons. Even trough my seething anger, I can see that I am not, but then again, there are valid reasons for seeking legal actions so here I am. 

There are two storylines (relevant ones) leading up to the situation i find myself in, both have to be explained to see the full picture and give an as accurate  advice as possible. It's going to be a long read.

1) I stupidly got myself pregnant with an exes child, he did the whole denial-thing for the longest time, treated me like shit in the process. Granted, I did deserve to be doubted so I gave him some credit, time and space. A few days ago I ended up in the hospital and lost my daughter. I reached out to him, got not a cold shoulder but a freezing one and was left to watch my daughters heartbeat slowly die off alone, because he was ""unavailable"". When I sat on the phone sobbing about doing it alone he coldly pointed out i chose to have her alone, so I should manage losing her alone. Fair point, I guess? She ended up dying the next day. As I was going trough labour he found it appropriate to call me a ""vicious bitch"" and a ""cruel cunt"" for pointing out that my daughter was NOT a guinea pig (he inquired about testing for genetic ""wrongs"" he might be carrier of) for his future endeavors. We weren't sure about the extent of his involvement in her life yet so his decisionmaking after her passing was limited to picking a name.

Picking a first name went smooth, probably because he didn't give a flying fuck and was too busy being relieved, but when it came to picking a last name he just casually said she should take mine.
This, this pissed me off. It's one thing to not want to recognise her when it comes with actual responsibility, it's another when it's just a symbol of ""I helped make you, you're my daughter"". That's all it would have been. A symbol to my little girl that she was real, that she mattered, even to him. He didn't.

2) A while back i sent him a package of stuff i've gathered during our relationship, when he notified le of it never arriving and I started inquiring about who signed for it with the deliveryservice, it took a while to all come trough but it did, (more info on this can be found in another post). I have since learned who signed for it, where it was delivered to and when it was signed for, I also have the paperwork to back all of that up. When inquiring with police I was informed that since it never actually got to him it was still my property, so someone stole from me) 

Now, on to the advice part of this story. 
I planned on just emailing him the paperwork and letting him know, leaving i'm to sort it himself.
But now... Now I find myself wanting to be the ""vicious bitch"" he gladly called me as I was losing my baby and just take what's mine in stead of just trying to keep everyone happy all of the time.
The person who signed for it, technically has nothing to do with this particular situation but never backed down from ripping in to me and actively manipulated and sabotaged the ""relationship"". This person also down right stole from me.

Now, i don't care about the stuff. I care about how I was treated troughout this whole thing, but even that I might have seen beyond and just moved on. I do care about how my daughter was done wrong. It would have cost him nothing to acknowledge her, she deserved it. She deserves more than to be a secretw to be stashed away like she never excisted.

(Insert: had she not passed away I wouldn't have expected him to acknowledge her since it comes with a bunch of responsibilities i would never force on to anyone, but since she's gone he could have just been a man and at least not pretend like she never excisted.) 

I feel irked this person stole from me, but had it not been for him not only not acknowledging her, but also keeping her a secret would not consider pressing charges.

I am in immense amounts of pain and reached new levels of anger so I know i'm not thinking straight. Also, the amount i wouls be pressing charges for is quite big and might get these people in trouble.

I lost my relationship, my daughter and everything i knew over the last year. Troughout all of this I have tried to be patient, understanding, reasonable. Now, i'm done and I want to start biting back. I also don't want to act out of anger and do things i'll regret.",24Feb2020,1

Background: Met a guy over tinder a year ago, went on a date, went well but nothing further really happened. Fast forward to a few months ago, we've stayed in touch but haven't really hung out. We went camping together last month and went to a concert this last weekend. I've always got along with this guy and found him really nice and funny but there wasn't a ton of sexual attraction so we've been more like friends. At the concert this last weekend he got really messed up/ super high to the point where it was a HUGE turn off. We weren't vibing because we were just on different levels and I was mostly sober. It really turned me off from him and reminded me that he kinda abuses substances and its not something want to be around.

There are two storylines (relevant ones) leading up to the situation i find myself in, both have to be explained to see the full picture and give an as accurate  advice as possible. It's going to be a long read.

1) I stupidly got myself pregnant with an exes child, he did the whole denial-thing for the longest time, treated me like shit in the process. Granted, I did deserve to be doubted so I gave him some credit, time and space. A few days ago I ended up in the hospital and lost my daughter. I reached out to him, got not a cold shoulder but a freezing one and was left to watch my daughters heartbeat slowly die off alone, because he was ""unavailable"". When I sat on the phone sobbing about doing it alone he coldly pointed out i chose to have her alone, so I should manage losing her alone. Fair point, I guess? She ended up dying the next day. As I was going trough labour he found it appropriate to call me a ""vicious bitch"" and a ""cruel cunt"" for pointing out that my daughter was NOT a guinea pig (he inquired about testing for genetic ""wrongs"" he might be carrier of) for his future endeavors. We weren't sure about the extent of his involvement in her life yet so his decisionmaking after her passing was limited to picking a name.

Picking a first name went smooth, probably because he didn't give a flying fuck and was too busy being relieved, but when it came to picking a last name he just casually said she should take mine.
This, this pissed me off. It's one thing to not want to recognise her when it comes with actual responsibility, it's another when it's just a symbol of ""I helped make you, you're my daughter"". That's all it would have been. A symbol to my little girl that she was real, that she mattered, even to him. He didn't.

2) A while back i sent him a package of stuff i've gathered during our relationship, when he notified le of it never arriving and I started inquiring about who signed for it with the deliveryservice, it took a while to all come trough but it did, (more info on this can be found in another post). I have since learned who signed for it, where it was delivered to and when it was signed for, I also have the paperwork to back all of that up. When inquiring with police I was informed that since it never actually got to him it was still my property, so someone stole from me) 

Now, on to the advice part of this story. 
I planned on just emailing him the paperwork and letting him know, leaving i'm to sort it himself.
But now... Now I find myself wanting to be the ""vicious bitch"" he gladly called me as I was losing my baby and just take what's mine in stead of just trying to keep everyone happy all of the time.
The person who signed for it, technically has nothing to do with this particular situation but never backed down from ripping in to me and actively manipulated and sabotaged the ""relationship"". This person also down right stole from me.

Now, i don't care about the stuff. I care about how I was treated troughout this whole thing, but even that I might have seen beyond and just moved on. I do care about how my daughter was done wrong. It would have cost him nothing to acknowledge her, she deserved it. She deserves more than to be a secretw to be stashed away like she never excisted.

(Insert: had she not passed away I wouldn't have expected him to acknowledge her since it comes with a bunch of responsibilities i would never force on to anyone, but since she's gone he could have just been a man and at least not pretend like she never excisted.) 

I feel irked this person stole from me, but had it not been for him not only not acknowledging her, but also keeping her a secret would not consider pressing charges.

I am in immense amounts of pain and reached new levels of anger so I know i'm not thinking straight. Also, the amount i wouls be pressing charges for is quite big and might get these people in trouble.

I lost my relationship, my daughter and everything i knew over the last year. Troughout all of this I have tried to be patient, understanding, reasonable. Now, i'm done and I want to start biting back. I also don't want to act out of anger and do things i'll regret.",24Feb2020,1
914,"I'm 24f and have 3 younger brothers (20,16 and 15 years old).
My father died when I was 12. Mom started drinking. 
I went to local facilities, made them take her to rehab and all of my brothers stayed with me and sort of nurse-babysitters sponsored by the government.

Long story less long: I started heavy drug abuse at 14. I'm good now. 2 of my brothers are perfectly fine. They're both having jobs and driving license, didn't do much shit. Now, the youngest one.. hes 14 and just like me at that age, he already had sex, took ecstasy, snorted speed and smokes weed (I didn't smoke until 17)..
I sort of raised my brothers until my mom and her new boyfriend threw me out. The oldest boy moved out at  18, the middle one is planning the same.
And the youngest steals, lies, dies what he wants and doesn't have any respect for authority. We have a deep relationship and I know a lot, cause I never judge him and try to be as good of a sister as i could be.

But it breaks my heart. I was so miserable when I was a drug addict. It took me 8 years to be clean. Now I can see my lovely sweet brother doing the same stupid shit. But nothing ever stopped me. My mom is well, trying. But she made a lot of mistakes. I'm sorry for the length of this, my heart bleeds a lot right now.

916,"I consider myself to be a well-rounded, productive, and somewhat moral individual.

What's advice would you give to someone that you wished you knew earlier on that is about to turn 30 years old??? It can be professional, financial, personal advice. Good or bad, I want to know to learn from it. I currently don't have any mentors to learn from for personal and professional development. I had a lot of great and poor explains to learn from when I was in the military. Sadly now, since I moved on I don't have that same luxury. I just want to continue to grow and not have a stagnant mindset. I wish I asked this question to my grandparents when they were still around.

Over the years i have kept in contact with him mainly now i am realizing through guilt. We both have had failed suicide attempts in the past. Lately he calls and text me non stop. I've tried to set up limits and boundaries but he will ""forget "" about them. A couple years ago he died and was without brain activity for almost 20 minutes. He isn't the same friend i once knew. A example is i take Sundays off in 12 hours he called over 8 times and texted me about 20. I did not respond to any of them.

 I'm now a stay at home mom and wife. Most days i am pretty busy.i take care of a medically complex child. That includes dr appts and therapies  He is single disabled and i just feel like we are in way different places in our lives. I've questioned him about why does he call so often. His response is he is bored. He has no hobbies and lives a very isolated life his choice. He tried to work last year and didn't last 2 hours at Walmart.

she usually approaches me and starts up conversation, has shown interest consistently for months.

things were going so well and we've had gradually more personal conversations, that always get cut short because we're at work,

so I asked her last week to get coffee and she said that she's been pretty busy, i suggested some other time in the next few weeks or months whenever she's less busy and she casually agreed.

she actually has been quite busy, has told me this recently a few times, busy with school work and even is taking off this next week because she's so busy.

I also found out from her that she has a girlfriend, so that explains her reservations about meeting up as well... she may be gay or bi.

I am freaking out. I'm 38 and I've been delivering pizzas for almost 15 years and finally had enough. Things have been going downhill for the company for a while now. About halfway through my employment we switched from franchise to corporate, which came with a pay cut while on the road (down to $4.25 instead of minimum wage or whatever wage you may have earned from raises) and a lot of cutting down on labor. 


Nowadays 2 people are expected to do what 5 previously handled. My coworkers suck. A majority of them are late for most of their shifts. Because they show up late, they don't have time to really do any of the in-store work like box folding, putting away trucks that we receive, and some cleaning tasks. This leaves it to me (or other day driver) to try to make up after opening, doing prep, and my normal other daily duties, if we are slow enough during lunch. 


One person who is supposed to be the assistant manager is constantly late by an average of about 40 minutes, drinks on the job, or is vomiting from withdrawals from something. The driver who is responsible for closing most nights it's also generally 40 minutes to an hour late, putting us further into the weeds for dinner rush, also seems to have drug/substance-abuse problems, and does a generally poor job. They gave her a raise, so she makes the same as me while she basically stands around in the evening.that actually really bothered me and let me see how much my punctuality and extra work is valued.


All of my complaints to the general manager, or store manager whatever you want to call it, were met with excuses for why these people are good employees and indispensable. My store is the only one of this chain in my town where managers are above doing prep. So on busy days I stay later to finish what I couldn't do between deliveries.


 So after nearly 15 years of work I'm only making $9 an hour inside and $4.50 on the road, and basically doing not only my own job, but also always playing catch up on boxes and cleaning for the evening crew, and doing things that managers in other stores are doing. By the end of every day I was burned out and stressed out. Sitting in traffic having imaginary arguments with my coworkers, or whining about them to my girlfriend had become a regular part of my day. Working in an environment where no employees have any accountability had become very toxic and was making me toxic.


 I had asked several times to be scheduled only part-time so that I could try to figure out a side hustle or have time to search for a better job, but we never had enough staff for me to have the time off that I desire. Being able to get only one week-day off, I didn't really have time to even begin job-hunting. I did start writing two blogs, but they really only average cents per day. 


Thanks to frugal living and a bit of inheritance gift, I am situated with savings equivalent to about 4 or 5 months income. Even if I don't earn a dime I can get away with maybe 6 months of paying my portion of the bills at home. Working an average of 35 hours a week my annual income is less than $25,000 with a large part of it being tips. Should be able to find SOMETHING to do to make such a small amount.


 Well, I decided to throw caution to the wind and start from scratch. I don't really have a plan, but I know that I should be able to do better, and don't want to still be just a pizza delivery guy when I'm 40.


I gave two weeks notice and I'm leaving on good terms, so if I choose to, or need to, I can go back to the same company, although I know I wouldn't want to be back in the same store. I mentioned my blogs, which I really have only miniscule hopes of turning into passive income, they are a hobby and so far ad revenue has made them basically break even on hosting costs.  I'm already signed up as a driver on three of the third-party delivery apps like GrubHub and ubereats, and have a few other small gig opportunities. I'm hoping to put in some work as a film extra, which I used to do when I was younger and really enjoyed even though it is not a great paying job. I'm also thinking about visiting some career placement service centers to see if I have any skills that translate to a better job somewhere. I know I'm employable.


TL/DR: quit my dead end 15-year job with just a little savings and without a real plan.

1.) They smoke weed in the house and have people over drinking, smoking, doing other drugs all the time (I am trying to live a sober lifestyle)

2.) They are filthy (dishes, trash around the house, bathroom's disgusting, overall cleanliness is terrible - I end up doing most all the work)

943,"So before I launch into this, because it is a lot, I will preface it with a few things. First, our dog (female GSD) came into the relationship with my bf and is always going to be his dog first and foremost and my dog second, as well as our other dog who may be briefly mentioned and is the father of our puppies (male Siberian Husky). Second, I will explain the situation and then list the advice requests separately at the end of the post. Third, I will try to be vague on some details because of personal reasons, but will not intentionally omit info to skew things in my favor. I want the most honest, best intentioned advice possible, as it is for the lives of 9 young puppies, not my own.

So to start, our babies were born on February 14, and are currently 10 days old as I write this. We started with 10, 6 boys and 4 girls, but lost one of our boys less than 24 hours after his birth. It was not due to any neglegence, it was an honest accident, and no one is to blame. My boyfriend and I are 19 and 21 respectively, and we both still live at our parents' houses due to financial situations and us still just starting out. Now, my parents keep their house neat and tidy, they are obsessively clean and are very thorough about big decisions, such as taking on a new pet. My boyfriend's parents? Not so much... in the most simple, vague wording possible, their house is virtually unfit to live in.

My boyfriend has already promised a puppy to his mother, and we are also giving one to my parents as well. His mom has willfully neglected our two dogs for as long as I have been dating him, and I can only guess longer than that. His whole family ignores them at all times, either locking them in a 10 by 10 laundry room, or leaving them on leashes in the back yard until we return to the house, regardless of weather. Because of this pattern, I said that I didn't want her to have one of the puppies, but my boyfriend insisted. He says that he believes if the dog actually belongs to her and not her son, then she will actually take on the responsibility for caring for it. I'm not convinced, I believe that how someone treats an animal living in their home is an indicator of how they view any animal in their home, and she does not see dogs as something she should have to be responsible for. Nevertheless, I've given up the fight to stop her from getting one of them, because nothing I say will change his mind. I just hope he's right that she will suddenly treat this dog better, but based on the condition of her house and her treatment of our dogs, I highly doubt it.

My boyfriend and I both love these dogs with all our hearts, but I do not want to keep any of them. We already have two dogs and a cat, and one of our dogs (the father) had to have his kidney removed a week ago, and in another week, we will be rehoming him to a beautiful family who can actually afford the expensive food he needs to be on for the rest of his life, and also can provide him with a safe and clean environment to live in where he won't get ahold of something that could kill him. I think that keeping momma dog and my cat is enough pets for us, especially for when we move out, because most apartment complexes have a 2 pet limit, and two big dogs and a cat is not going to fly. My boyfriend's solution for this is that we save up extra money and seek out a condo. We both are in minimum wage jobs and are struggling to build our savings back up so that we can move our lives forward. I am trying to figure out what I'm going to do career wise, be it school or a trade, and my boyfriend is in desperate need of a new car. I do not see a feasible option for keeping one of these puppies and making all of those things happen. My parents will be keeping a puppy anyway, and his mother will also be keeping one, so that is two puppies from the litter that we would be able to have regular contact with after the other puppies are rehomed. 

On the subject of rehoming the puppies, I have been very diligent in securing homes for each pup. At 8 days old, 4 of the 9 puppies have secured, guaranteed homes. My boyfriend and I have an agreement that for the remaining 5, we will have to personally interview everyone who is interested, and then make a selection from those people. The problem is that my boyfriend is refusing anyone he doesn't directly know. It a friend of a friend expresses interest, he gets angry. My sister found a friend who was interested, and asked him about it, and while he was very polite to her about how we were working this process, he expressed anger to me, saying that the next person who texts him asking if they can have a puppy, he is going to not be so nice.

We are not giving these puppies away for free. We are charging 300 USD each, to cover the vet costs and recoup some of our losses. Which is barely a fraction of their actual worth. Both of their parents are AKC registered purebred dogs, and their mother is from the direct bloodline of a tactical police dog. So their total worth as a popular designer breed with pedigree parents makes them worth almost 3k.

My view on the homing process is that we need to round up a decent pool of people who are financially stable, experienced dog owners, preferably husky or GSD owners, to handle any trademark behaviors of the breeds. My boyfriend so far has shot down several people I've suggested, because he doesn't know them directly, and he refuses to even consider them. He says ""the right people will come along."" Meanwhile, I say that these ARE the right people. I just don't understand his thought process there. 

So now I think that I've given as much info as I can without rambling, and I'm going to ask some questions.

1) how can I broach the subject with my boyfriend about homing the rest of the puppies? My current method isnt working, and my mom suggested taking a step back and letting him home the other 5 puppies (4 if we keep one), but I worry that if I do that, then we will wind up with 5 unclaimed puppies living with us for longer than they need to and we CANNOT afford that!

2) what can I do to convince him that we can't keep a puppy? He has his heart set on it, and I just don't see it being a good idea! We both work so much, so we wouldn't be around to provide enough attention to train the puppy properly, and we can't count on his family to help, because they neglect our dogs anyway.

3) does anyone have any general advice for me about raising puppies in general? It's our first litter and even though I've researched a ton, I'd welcome any tips or tricks experienced breeders might have if they stumble across this.

Thanks, sorry for the length, there was a lot to unpack.",24Feb2020,1

945,"So I’m a gay guy 18, and my first real relationship is over. We dated for 2 weeks and moved very quickly (in my eyes at least) he was my first kiss. Well on Saturday (our 4th date) went amazing! He met some of my friends, I destroyed him in bowling, and we cuddled for hours. He even met my parents and told me that he loved me. Sunday morning I get a text telling me that he’s still in love with his ex and can’t be with me. I spent all of Sunday in shock and have now moved onto sadness. I’m so sad, like I know I only dated him for 2 weeks but I think I loved him. I want him to give me a hug, he knew exactly what to say to get me smile and I miss him. He also blocked me on all social media (I promise you I did not do anything to warrant this). We were going to go to my school dance the following Saturday and he even talked about how excited he was to go.

946,"Sorry for my bad sense of grammar.

Hey, right now i'm 22 years old.

I'm going to give you a little backstory of me, maybe it makes a difference on your help.

I've been a school dropout for 5 years. I was lastly learning about electronics and the experience with my some of my classmates completely blew the fun out of it. I didn't go to school anymore and just stayed home, playing video games and watching cartoons and what not.

By the way, i'm going back to school since January.

I've looked at quite a few jobs and the most interesting to me were involved in 'medicine / helping people', working with animals and working with wood. I tried to sign up for an internship in 5 or so hospitals in the care section and wasn't able to get in any of them. Then i recently was able to get one in woodworking. I had 3 bosses and all 3 said that i do seem to have a talent for woodworking.

Then i most recently was able to get an internship in a senior home as a caregiver. I do have to say that those two weeks were the best thing i ever had in my life.

The norovirus was going around, 16 staff members were ill and i followed an amazing trainee.

She was so fast, taught me a lot, she worked like she was in charge of the whole building.

I didn't get disgusted with anything, which was surprising to me. I got to see up close, what happens when you don't properly take care of the elderly. For example, there was an old lady who caught a painful genital infection, because some of the staff members didn't bother about changing her diaper. I even still went Saturday and Sunday to help out. I was able to make a 97 year old lady laugh and one to call me her guardian angel. I felt amazing and then caught the virus, because i took off my mouth cover for the last few minutes of my 7 hour shift. I felt absolutely horrible the next 24h but still felt amazing at the same time.

The boss said that i'm always welcome to visit and can apply for a voluntary social year anytime, don't think i can handle that and school at the same time though.

Then i once visited and ended up staying 8 hours, as if i worked there. The nun i helped out said that i worked exactly like the night duty.

I can't get my head around what i really want to do for the rest of my life. I've always been a crafty person and found meaning in helping people.

What are you guy's ideas? maybe you have a different career idea that seems interesting to me.",24Feb2020,1

949,"This only happened about an hour ago.

I wish I hadn’t said anything. It all started with a conversation about how much my parents were giving my sister whilst she’s at university. From what my mum was saying it seemed like my sister was getting significantly more than I had got when I was at uni (only a year ago).

This then led onto me expressing (and here’s where I wish I had shut up) that there are often times where I feel my sister gets special treatment. For example, when she went on holiday after her exams my mum paid for it but when I went I had to pay for myself, any travel to and from uni for Xmas etc my mum will pay for her but not for me, plus my dad and my sister always “joke” to me that she’s the favourite and mum misses her but not me. 

It’s true that sometimes I feel that my sister is the favourite, but 99% of the time this really doesn’t bother me because my mum and my sister are very similar and so it makes sense that they would get along better.

Anyways, my mum has been in the bathroom for about 20 minutes and I think she’s pretty upset. She worries a lot anyway and me saying this has probably made it worse. I know she tries very hard to treat us equally and what I was trying to express was that I wasn’t at all blaming anyone I just wanted to make her aware that sometimes these jokes and special treatment can make me feel a little pushed out at times.

Any advice on how I can comfort her? If you’re a mum, what would be the best thing your daughter could do in this situation?",24Feb2020,1
951,"Hey guys. I appreciate all of you guys that take the time and energy to offer advice to people who need it. Y’all are heroes for it. 

I’m 30 years old. I’m a first generation American. My parents are not well off and are older (mother 63, father in mid 70s), they are divorced. 

My father lives with my brother &amp; his fiancé. He’s a pain in their ass but he pays his portion of the rent.

I live with my mother, in a foreclosed home. We are able to stay in the home while we fight the situation in court. Monthly lawyer fees are not cheap, and I pay most of the bills.

My mother has a mental/emotional condition and refuses to get help. Living with a person like this is wearing on the mind, body and emotions. I don’t think it’s necessary to get into detail but her behavior has been negatively affecting my performance in career for quite some time. 

Much of my energy at this point is delegated towards keeping peace and stability in the home when it should be used to better our financial situation before our living situation takes a dive. 

I’m getting to a point where I feel that if I don’t boost my performance at work, the future will be grim. The only option I’m seeing at the moment, is leaving the house and finding a new place to live in peace as to be able to recover some sharpness and motivation. 

However this will leave my brother mostly responsible for her, as I will be taking on new financial burdens. And I’m sure that the situation will turn into an explosive/ relationship severing drama. 

I really have no clue where to go from here.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",24Feb2020,1
952,"I am traveling from Chicago to Hanoi Vietnam to visit a friend in less than a week, I have a 10 hour layover at Incheon airport, Seoul South Korea. I understand that Seoul has recently had a massive increase in reported cases of coronavirus, but Vietnam is still relatively safe. I booked my flight with Delta, but the last leg of the trip is through delta/korean air. Korean Air has canceled flights to and from china, my flight has not been canceled but I am eligible for a refund should I choose to cancel due to health concerns. It is my understanding that the current threat level in Seoul allows officials to quarantine anyone who is showing symptoms and they are encouraging people not to travel unless absolutely necessary.

I will be staying in Vietnam for a total of 11 days, purely for tourism/vacation. I have been researching the outbreak for the past few days and am having trouble coming to a conclusion as to whether or not I should cancel my trip.

953,"Hi, all. I’m posting this out of desperation because I’m just curious to see what, if any, responses my post will receive. 

After a medical emergency in December, I made the difficult decision to drop out of my PhD program because I can no longer keep up with the intellectual and mental/emotional challenges. I’m really devastated by this decision because I have wanted a PhD since I was 18. I have worked towards this for 11 years of my life. In about 5 weeks, I am relocating back to California to live with my parents to put my life back together... only I don’t know what that process will look like. I have a Master’s in English, but am going to take whatever job I can find so that I can begin saving up to move back to the PNW. 

Another big complication here is that I have a boyfriend I’m terribly in love with, and I’m going to have to leave him behind when I relocate back home. We’ve cried about it a ton but are committed to doing the whole long distance thing. I just don’t know how long it will take me to be able to move back up here, because I can barely see past the next week let alone the next few months. My life is completely upheaved and I’m just looking for advice on how I should proceed from here. How do I go about rebuilding my life when everything is so uncertain? How do I realistically plan to move back up here again, and hold myself to a manageable timeline? How do I get out of the headspace that my entire life has fallen apart beyond repair? How can I work towards my gay love story having a happy ending? 

I don’t know what advice y’all might have but I’d be grateful for any.

The night before I was supposed to go back home, I woke up very sick and wasn’t able to travel on my original flight (Thursday), so I messaged my boss to let him know I couldn’t make my shift on Friday.

My manager spoke to me today about this, expressing that it looked a little bad on me, as I had been on vacation (which I understand).

964,"We currently have nine cats. *Nine*. I cannot take it anymore. We burn through cat food, which has to be an expensive brand because of my roommate's cat and its bowel problems. The house and my clothes are constantly covered in hair. It always smells in here. My furniture is forever ruined. One of the little buggers always has diarrhea and goes outside of the box. Another one likes to spray on everything even though he is fixed.

I am sick of it. When we moved into this house, a little less than two years ago, we had three cats, one of which came along with the property. That's a lot, but manageable. We then asked a friend to move in and he brought along his two cats. Five. Okay, that's a little too many, but I wasn't being driven insane, yet. 

Then we bring in two stray kittens that are now adults. Then a cat shows up and my girlfriend mistakenly brings it in, but instead of putting it back out immediately she puts up a fight about how the cat belongs to *someone* and we need to shelter it from the incoming severe weather. I went to sleep pissed, but I actually expected her and my roommate to make an effort of finding that cat's home, instead of going to two houses and calling it quits. Then, another cat. 

Here I am. Overwhelmed by cats. I am tired of it. I'm ready to find five cats good homes. I do not want to take them to a shelter, but I am not opposed to it.

At the 20 weeks ultrasound we found out our little girl was not growing as she should be and that there were other complications. 
We had to go to a hospital (a 2 hour drive there and back) every week, and every time we were told to wait it out another week to see if her situation improved. 
At 27 weeks we found out there was no heartbeat anymore, and 2 days later I had to give birth to our daughter, knowing I would never hear her cry.

967,"I am so upset and i don't know what to do..  My ""bf"" currently wants me to leave immediately with my pet and find somewhere else to live. It started this last night when i spoke with him about doing dishes. I asked him how he would like it to be because I was confused about who did them in the past. I always end up being the one who has to do the dishes somehow. So i asked him what his opinion was so we could come to an agreement. We agreed on if you make the dish, then you must clean it yourself by that night, or first thing the next morning to assure all the dishes were clean. He seemed to be fine with this THIS TIME. He then later agree to clean all his dishes by last night. he did not and ended up going to sleep. I went to sleep a bit later assuming he would do the dishes the next morning as it is what we agreed to.. (he always agrees to things and then changes the agreement when the payment comes up)  I woke up this morning and he was already awake for abt 5 minutes prior and we chilled for a bit. I got hungry so i went to clean the dishes i had made (within 5 mins of waking myself) to cook breakfast. After i finished cleaning my dishes i noticed a ton of his dishes (5) weren't clean still so i went in our room and asked him to clean it pls due to our agreement and he glanced up at me while on his phone and said ""i will get them done"" I asked when he about hed do them and he repeated his last statement with irritation. I left the room slightly irritated thinking he might do what he usually does and not do them. I went back to the room 10 minutes later after making my food and said ""Hey, can you please do your dishes now, i feel like its unfair and you arent going to keep your word again. you have already been up for while. and you said you would do them last night anyway"" He then answered with "" Get the fuck out my face"" "" Kiss my ass"".  I obviously got mad and restated what i already said and he says i am being dramatic and why does it matter when they get done if im not the one who has to clean them. Saying if they get done it doesnt matter if its soon or later. He then continues to be a complete ass in my opinion and says i am being ""stupid"". UH I get mad because WHEN i leave them to be done and dont ask you they never get done and i always end up having to do them. SO this all escalated to me saying he always does things like this and i want him to be more mature and just do what needs to be done and help out. he tends to not be the nicest at all and is usually immature about everything. He always states that I start all these issues and its ME who has problems and i am always wrong. When i am just trying ti solve issues in my opinion and be an adult about things? but when i tell him this he turns it around and says i am the one who is all of these things. Hence being another thing i am wrong about ?

&amp;#x200B;

He thinks in a very immature way due to his family bringing him up. they are all like this for the most part give or take. (again i might be wrong, this is all my opinion. stating this cause ik he will see this and get angry at me)

I just dont know what to do. He only does what he wants to do(which is nothing ever). He is very selfish and never takes what i say into acct at all. He has gotten better at that but still is bad. When he gets mad and cant convey his words properly he will throw things or punch walls. Or if there are books between us he will push them hard the the side and put his face in mine. I state these things are abusive and he says i am stupid for thinking that cause he never actually touches me so its not physical abuse. IT SCARES ME so yeah? it is. He says he does it cause it makes me be quiet and listen to him for once.  Theres so much i could say about things he does in which i feel are manipulative and abusive. After saying all this to him and him now saying he wont do the dishes and the more i talk the longer it will be before he does them. he says ""WEll if im so bad why dont you leave?? HUH tell me that. why dont you leave me if i actually AM abusive"" I sat in silence. what am i supposed to say to this? 

I feel it is even a more asshole move of him because he knows i have zero family. they are extremely abusive and i cut them off to save myself. He knows he is the only thing/person i have besides my pet. I live with him. in the middle of nowhere and there is no way to work at all. I dont know how to drive because ive never had anybody to teach me. I have no car, all i have are the clothes that fit in a garbage bag,  a few items, my pet and my phone which he always has to remind me HE bought and he can take whenver he wants. (when he gets mad at me he snatches it away so that my focus can be on him) 

I don't know what to do. I have nobody. Nowhere to go. I have so much potential and it is all being completely wasted right now... I love him and i want him to get better so we can grow a future together after we move soon.... But he has so many issues and he denies everything. I am not perfect at allllll. But I dont subject him to my issues 24/7 knowing its hurting him. At least knowingly.. Idk. What is everyones opinion on this? 

He now has said that he doesnt care about me. He truly does have a good heart but he has been badly abused and cant see certain things properly. please give all your opinions. I need help. We do.

It wasnt that great because I didn't come.
We then stopped then she kissed me a goodbye

981,"I'm a 23-year-old woman in a dead-end job after getting a useless (music) degree in college. I have so much shit to get together honestly that I don't even know where to begin.

My first, and probably largest issue, is my drinking. I've always liked drinking a little too much, but in college it really ramped up and I'm having a hard time bringing it back down. When I'm doing ""well"" I stick to about twice a week, but I get pretty drunk each session. When it's getting bad, that's more like 4 nights a week of getting drunk. At its peak I was drinking 5-6 nights a week. I have a love-hate relationship with drinking. I *am* in therapy, I've gone to meetings, but I just can't see myself living life completely sober and even thinking about it is too daunting. I lurk on sobriety-centered subreddits, I listen to podcasts, but idk. Anyway, next issue.

I'm obese. I have a wonderful boyfriend of about 5.5 years, and honestly I'm sure we will get married in the future, but I can't help feeling like a total piece of shit because of my body. It has ruined any shred of confidence I might have had before, and it has seeped its way into negatively affecting our sex life. I could stand to lose about 100 lbs, possibly a bit more. I have never been skinny, even as a kid/teen, but my weight gain spiraled during college. I can't seem to stick with a diet/exercise routine for more than a week or so, and that just fuels my ""what's the fucking point"" attitude as soon as I don't see results. I've been dieting on and off since I was probably 11 years old and I just feel completely defeated in this regard.

I have no idea what I'm doing career wise. Although I love music and don't regret my degree, I've found I don't enjoy teaching, and besides being in a few local orchestras, I cannot go for a performance career (nor would I want to), so I've been stuck applying for shitty  entry-level jobs. I live with my boyfriends parents and don't have rent thank god, but I hate that we are still dependent on them for financial support and I want to find a way to move out soon. Boyfriend is still in school. I'm working a temporary receptionist job and while I don't mind it, this isn't sustainable. I have no idea where to go from here. I feel like a failure.

I have diagnosed depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I take medication and go to therapy as often as I can. It helps, but I still feel like this failure of a person. I don't make good money. I'm fat. I'm miserable a lot of the time. I don't have any hobbies I really love besides video games. My family is chaotic at best, and emotionally abusive at worst, and this always has me down. I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything, and I'm terrified I'll always be this lazy piece of shit who never does anything worthwhile.

I do have brief moments of ""clarity"" where all of a sudden I'm more positive, I work out, I am good about hygiene and chores, and I feel like ""hey, things are gonna be okay"". But they are breif and infrequent. Most of the time basic every day tasks feel too difficult, and so how am I supposed to address my sobriety and obesity if I can't motivate myself to take a fucking shower? It's atrocious and I hate myself. I tried following the ""body positive"" movement so I'd hate myself less, but it hasn't really helped. All I see are fat girls who are still prettier than me. I don't even wear makeup much anymore, and I used to spend at least an hour doing my makeup and hair in high school.

Now normally if I were reading a post like this, I'd say, ""get into therapy! Take meds! Etc"" but I'm already doing that. Idk how to get my shit together still. I feel like a ghost, like a shell of a person, but not a whole person. I'm constantly thinking about how everyone around me probably judges me for my appearance. I hate being in public at all now. Every interaction I have ramps my anxiety up. I've switched meds multiple times. Idk what to do. I feel like I need to ""fix"" so many things about myself that it feels impossible, and what's worse, sometimes pointless? I feel like I'm too far gone.

984,"Hello All,

As of late (I’d say the last month or so) I’ve been in a depressive state, not enjoying things I once did like caring for my farm animals, playing bass, or playing video games. The only thing (or person) that keeps any joy in my life at the moment is my fiancé. 

I work Monday through Friday from 6:30 AM to 5 PM at a grain mill (pretty tough/rugged work, mostly an outdoorsy environment). I do farm chores before and after work, and usually average 6-7 hours of sleep a night. I have weekends off and usually take them to relax and recoup for the upcoming week. I’m am the sole worker of the grain mill and must do all grain mixing/bagging, ordering, walk in customers, phone calls, customer support, plan and place deliveries, and occasionally make the deliveries when the driver is out. It’s been a slow transition into all that, so it’s very natural now, but can be a lot at times.

Home life is okay. I’m currently living with my fiancé at her and her parent’s house. Her older sister and friend of said sister, as well as my fiancé’s grandmother, also live there as well for a total of 7 people under one roof. Here’s how everyone’s personality is:

Fiancé- caring, super sweet, loving, would go out of her way for anyone, extremely thoughtful, works full time, early 20’s

Her mom- controlling, naggy, jealous, self-centered, nosey, whiney, works full time, early 50’s

Her dad- well, he deals with all the crap and keeps on grinding... not to mention taking care of his and fiancé’s sister’s horses on a regular basis... works part time, smart, great guy, early 60’s

Her sister- lazy, rude, obnoxious, also self-centered, basically her mom in a younger body, kisses mother’s ass, no plan to leave home, never had boyfriend, works part time, late 20s

Her sister’s friend- slave to fiancé’s sister, so book smart that she’s dumb in common sense, no manners, works part time, mid 50’s

Her gram- sweet, but can have a nasty side, me-first attitude, late 80’s

Me- usually tired, gets an attitude when tired, usually keeps mouth shut except to fiancé and her dad, hard working, currently depressed, works overtime every week, 20

Also worth noting that my mom and dad are split and have been since I was very young. Mom moved a couple hours away with a boyfriend, while my dad lives about half an hour away with my younger sister. Mom never gave a damn about me as long as she was on my favorite side, and Dad REALLY never cared about anything besides himself and hunting/fishing. I hardly ever see them, not that it really bothers me. 

Also worth noting that we’re getting married this fall and I couldn’t be more excited for that. I’m ready to tie the note, get a house, and start a family... so ready, that I wish it was now... we applied for a home loan and got denied. Apparently our credit wasn’t good enough even though we’ve never missed a payment on our small personal loan or charge card. I’m more of a personal, quiet life, type of guy... a no BS type if you would, and fiancé is for the most part as well. I’ve been living with her for nearly 4 years (as long as we’ve been together) but lately, it’s all getting too much and I’ve been quite sad/upset for the last month. I can’t pinpoint why or how to change that. 

Any pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you, R",24Feb2020,1

My sister and I both live upstairs and there's only two rooms and a bathroom. My sister's cat lives comfortably in my sister's room and is okay with it.

989,"TLDR: I don't like big ceremonies and my parents, who disrespected previous wishes to not go to high school grad, will probably make me go to university grad. I still don't want this, don't know how to make them listen.

Full explanation- I don't have to put up with this for a couple years, but my older sister is graduating college this spring. I'm going to hers because I care, even if grad ceremonies are the bane of my existence, but probably bringing a lot of book entertainment and my wireless earbuds that day. I was reminded of this when she tried to make a joke where she got on her knee and asked me to be her escort to the banquet. And while she was trying to be funny, it just put me in a bad mood. 

My grad is another story. I hid earbuds under my hair at the 3.5 hour long (I had a stopwatch going, so I'm not exaggerating) snore fest that was my high school grad. I was talking to a friend bckstage and we were genuinely considering sneaking out after we walked the stage because it was so hot, so tedious, and so not worth it.

My parents are going to INSIST I go when I graduate university, but I don't give two craps about it! In my opinion, if this is supposed to be my celebration, make sure it's something I can very behind/enjoy.  In high school, I suggested a road trip to celebrate. Shot down because ""it's grad, we have to ceremony"". My mom tried to get pictures of me in my seat, and I just look PISSED. I threw away the headache inducing souvenir that was my grad cap before we even left the building, and after all that and wanting to do nothing else, I was dragged to a steak house because yay me(?). I just want to celebrate in a way I would actually enjoy the occasion- and fancy, ceremonial crap with twenty of the most boring people in existence speaking for twenty minutes each is not what I enjoy. Also, steak house was below par on the food.

Also, had my school kept doing grad banquets (family allowed event), I would have been forced to do that too. I had like two friends in my class (who wouldn't have gone), so I would have hated it! Stuck with my bullies and people who didn't give a flip about my existence, in a dress I would not have wanted to wear, I hated makeup and doing my hair (still hate doing things to my hair besides straightening it, and makeup for me is mascara, eye liner, and if I'm feeling fancy, at most eye shadow), and the whole evening would have made me miserable. Only reason that didn't happen was because banquets were too expensive, so they just made it a prom (parents could go for a short period of time for pictures or whatever, buy I very intentionally didn't tell them that).

I just want my wishes to be respected. I'm tempted to either peace out of the city for a day or force myself to get sick day of. And if not, I am genuinely going to be tempted to walk across the stage flipping people off the entire time so my mom won't get nice pictures as payback. Probably won't have the balls to do it, but I will not be happy.

I've got several friends (and family friends that are the same age as my parents) who all say they hate grad and would/did skip. My parents very clearly heard me talking about it with them one day, and didn't say anything. Wasn't intentional, but they walked over as we were talking.

I want to be respectful, but we disagree on how important this ceremony is. I have vowed to not go since high school grad ended, and I want it to happen peacefully. What do I say to my parents about this?",24Feb2020,1

991,"I’m starting to like him... fuck. 

So I just met this guy a couple of days ago. We hit it off and ended up having sex the first night. 

The next day he invites me to hang out with his buddies to watch this sporting match. I do not know any of these people, nor do I know anything about the sport or the players, but I’m up for anything and thought it was super nice he would include me. I’m kind of a logos girl” but also open minded. I was a little surprised he wanted to introduce me to his friends but he’s a social guy so I didn’t think much of it. 

We get there and he introduces me, blah blah blah and the first thing they do is role a joint. Now, I don’t smoke a lot, have smoked weed maybe a couple of times total, so I plan on only smoking a little bit. But I don’t want to be totally lame and not smoke since it’s clearly a big part of his life, and I’m already feeling so out of place (I’m the only girl there, kinda shy, know nothing about the sport, 10 years younger than most of them, etc.) I don’t want to make a big deal. 

Anyway, I take ONE HIT from the joint. Well, it must have been really concentrated because immediately I get super super stoned and paranoid and anxious. I soon cannot understand anything that is happening and it’s like I’m in a dream. I’m trying to act as normal as possible but I’m so baked. I am already an anxious and somewhat socially awkward/nervous person and this just made it worse. I was super quiet most of the night and my date could tell I was stoned because he asked me about it. I then tried to just relax and talk a little but I said the weirdest stupidest shit. My date ended up saying to his friends “she’s stoned” and they all laughed. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed the whole time. I feel like he expected me to fit in and be cool like the last time we met but I just couldn’t. 

The worst part was that everyone else seems totally normal and not high at all. All his friends mostly just ignoring me which made sense, since they were watching the game and didn’t know me or have any common interests that I could tell. I just get so out of place and boring. I could barely string together a sentence and just keep apologizing to my boyfriend. I also apologized to everyone else about being high and it just seemed to make it more awkward. It was obvious that I should not have been there. I felt so stupid, like a dumb young blonde bimbo with no brains or personality. 

He seemed fine with it, and when we were alone and I had sobered up a bit we bantered and giggled like normal. But I still know he was a little embarrassed. I just hope he was disappointed that I’m not a stoner. I also hope he’s not annoyed that I embarrassed him in front of his friends because I think he was trying to show me off. 

He told me twice that he felt bad that I was the only girl there (he said he thought there would be other girls there) and also that I got so high. 

We had good sex afterward and talked for a bit. But after sex, he couldn’t go to sleep and asked if I wanted to go get something to eat. So we went somewhere to eat and just took the food to go. Then he dropped me off at my place. Is this a bad sign? I know it’s only a second date, it just seemed like he wanted me gone. But he didn’t seem sleepy which was the weird part. 

Anyway, he kissed me on the lips when he dropped me off and said, “I have to remember you can’t smoke that much” and “we’ll have to do this again soon.” Unlike last time, he didn’t actually make any plans or suggest anything.

I immediately felt so stupid and started crying. I was starting to like him and like I blew it. However, in the morning I got a text from him asking how I was, and if I slept well. The conversation died after that but I’m not sure if that’s a good sign. 

I feel like I might not hear from him again, or it will only be for a booty call from now on, which is fine I guess. How would you feel if you were in his shoes? Do you think he still likes me? What should I do? 

TL;DR: I got too stoned in front of my new guy’s stoner friends and embarrassed myself and probably him. This was only our second time hanging out and I’m worried he will not ask me to hang out again. Is there anything I can do?",24Feb2020,1

I got mad, which is just an attitude so sour it's contagious(I think that's my super power) and then she gets mad because I'm mad and, you get the picture. And also my girlfriend, bless her heart, is also a trigger to the anger. She just doesn't think about what she says, some days ago I was boiling in anger about something and I was talking with her on the phone and she said ""I know you're angry let's talk later"" and hung up which didn't help and I just bottled it up and went to sleep, which helped temporarily but I knew that bottling it up would just cause another episode later on, which is the problem.

(I am coming from OC) she moved to Fresno with her boyfriend right after high school (about 4 years ago) I’ve made this trip up to see her 15+ times and 9/10 it is me spending money and taking time off work to go out there to see her. She never comes down here to see me unless it’s a holiday where her family would be buying her ticket down to see them. I want to keep this as short and sweet a possible so with out further a-due... my favorite rap artist is playing a show during the dates I will be there. He does not tour in my town anymore and only stays up in the Fresno/bay area. My best friend refuses to go wirh me because she “hates the fans of this music” and “thinks the music is trash” I offered to pay for the tickets and ubers there, if she would only come with me. She told me that “she has done a lot for me in the past and does not want to do it again” also Said that I need to respect her boundaries and she does not want to come. I don’t want to get into what I have done for her, because it is a lot and I don’t think turning a friendship into a game of “who does more?” Is a healthy option. 
Overall, I told her I don’t mind if she doesn’t come but I will be going alone or with one of my other friends in Fresno because It would be absolutely tragic if I missed this show. She is now getting upset that I am ditching her and said “don’t do me like that”. So I came up with a few compromises that get me to see the show and her to have a good time at a place she likes near by with her bf (I would be paying for their night) and she is not taking any compromises for an answer and still believes that I would be ditching her for the show.

We know he doesn't intend it–it's clear that he cares about the material we learn and present on. He's just old and tired. 

So, he was drifting off a bit today while one of my classmates was presenting, and two other people in my class were laughing and taking pictures of my professor to send off to others.

1003,"I'm at a loss here for what happened and hope someone has some advice. I am 35f and my best friend is 36m. We have been friends for over 25 years and had a mutual friends group growing up. We never slept together. We just got on very well and were roommates for a while in college. We helped each other a lot through some tough relationships and breakups and always remained close even when he moved to another state. He didn't have a girlfriend for quite a while and when his company downsized, he decided to move back home. By this time, I was engaged to my now husband and everyone was looking forward to a Mexico wedding. BF ended up inviting a girl he had known as his date, we'll call her Jess, but as ""friends."" Jess was great. They stayed the entire trip with us and we traveled around having a super fun time. We had a very small wedding, and BF was in our wedding party, ceremony, photos, everything. BF mentioned there was a girl he had just met back home that he really liked. He tells me how much our friendship means to him.

One month later, BF calls and wants to introduce me to this girl, we'll call her Emily. He's known her for 2-3 months. We meet, have lunch, Emily seems nice, BF is the happiest I've seen him in a while, which is great 1 month later, BF calls to say he's getting married. He seemed happy, and I wanted to support him. Wedding is in 4 months. BF's friends are part of that circle that have known each other for over 25 years. One friend, Jim, was a very on and off (and often abusive) friendship. They had been slowly reconnecting since BF got back, and he asked me if Jim should be invited to the wedding, and I told him that was very kind and that Jim would probably appreciate that. Next thing I know, Jim is now IN the wedding party.  I am not asked, but all his other male friends are included. I figure for some reason because I'm not a guy it doesn't work with this wedding so I don't say anything. Day of the wedding is super weird. Husband and I go, and meet up with Jess who was also invited. BF seems really happy we are there. Shit gets weird. He's not religious, and the ceremony is some weird Tibetan bowl/strange poetry/Buddhist/Lutheran hybrid affair. We only know the group of friends that have been together forever (about 6 people) and his family. I know these friends but I'm not close with them. Of the brand new people, we find out some of them don't use their real names, but use names like Vesta and Minerva. Turns out ""Emily"" renamed herself too and it wasn't her real name. Best man is Bf's other BF. He's freaking out because he has no idea who these people are. BF is moving into the ""compound"" after the wedding, and his father expresses concern about it but says ""well, I'm not ok with it but it's his life."" Bridesmaids are super bitchy and aggressive, especially to Jess. She is point blank ignored or glared at by both bridesmaids and bride. Bride doesn't acknowledge me or husband until we are leaving (and she never met husband before the wedding.) I'm not asked to be in any photos with BF. Night comes to a close, BF wants to have one fun dance with me before we go, seems really happy we're there (me, husband, and Jess,) and then we go home while the party continues.  

My wedding gift arrives late, but BF texts they absolutely loved it. I speak to him a few days after the wedding and even his speech patterns have changed which gives me the creeps. A month later, we get a link to the wedding photos which include formal/ceremony/reception standard. There are over 1,000 photos, and neither myself, my husband, or Jess are in a single photo that was captured from the entire wedding. I now haven't heard from him for over 8 months, and have no idea what the fuck happened. Afraid to say anything or even reach out because I don't want to alienate him. Husband thinks eventually he'll come around and to just sit tight. This is some weird shit, especially coming from a guy that is very science oriented, non religious, intelligent, and pragmatic. I miss my friend. Advice is appreciated.

1005,"Title. Currently 22, at my 3rd year in university, also working part time at the local museum, and taking piano lessons since I was 7. It was always difficult more than anything, my teacher used to put pressure on me, so I could deliver. I was always extremely anxious during exams/lessons, and school/university/work has never ever come close to making me feel like that. I was always delivering though.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm about to get my piano degree, I have to take exams once more in September and it's done. Unfortunately, I have had regular anger explosions since this year started, and they are starting to take over in every part of my life, whereas I have never been in an argument, a fight, or lost my temper ever before, also affecting my performance in studies and piano. Incidents include: 

&amp;#x200B;

Breaking my own foot in rage after failing to complete a proper repetition in the gym

&amp;#x200B;

Slapping my teacher's hand when she tried to help me turn the page and the sheet fell on my feet while I was playing

&amp;#x200B;

Broke my metronome during studying

&amp;#x200B;

Yelled ""shut up already you retard"" on a colleague in the lab after he didn't lower the volume of his voice, as I asked him to do

&amp;#x200B;

Kicked a hole through my wall in my kitchen after losing a match on my favourite video game

&amp;#x200B;

I believe all these incidents are a direct cause of pressure from that, and I am starting to wonder if it is worth it. I am by no means trying to become a musician/professional pianist, it has become more of a hobby. However, if I quit now, there will be a plethora of people (my parents included, who have paid an immense amount of money for my lessons and my piano) that will just keep hammering the fact that I quit and wasted 15 years of my life for nothing. I have never quitted anything before, I always have viewed that as a sign of weakness/laziness.   


What should I do? I have a few weeks to think about it. My teacher suggested me to rethink my ways after slapping her hand, and that evening I cried for literally hours. Will quitting now make me get back into a more ""calm"" state? Or should I consult a psychiatrist to prescribe some antianxiety drugs, just to get through this year?",24Feb2020,1

we've gotten along real well, have similar interests etc.

we work at the same store, but only twice/week and are also in different departments... yet we always find ways to talk and have good conversation.

she usually approaches me and has shown some level of interest consistently for months.

things were going so well and we've had gradually more personal conversations, that always get cut short because we're at work,

so I asked her last week to get coffee and she said that she's been pretty busy, i suggested some other time in the next few weeks or months whenever she's less busy and she casually said ""okay"".

she actually has been quite busy, has told me this recently a few times, busy with school work and even is taking off this next week because she's so busy.

I also found out from her that she has a girlfriend, so that explains her reservations about meeting up as well... she may be gay or bi.

I've seen her at work since this happened, and were still cool and talk like normal.

1015,"So I was at my grandmas house and she has a really good guitar that she wanted to sell to someone random. I’ve been wanting to learn guitar, so I asked my dad if I’d be allowed to learn it. He said no because I already play piano and saxophone and I never practice them anyway. I barely practice piano because my lesson teacher never really shows up at all. Saxophone I don’t need to practice because I’m not bragging I am the most skilled player in the band. Just playing in class is enough for me. And the songs I play on piano in my lessons are these boring ditties from the 1600’s that make me want to fall asleep. After 8 years on it, I think I should be allowed to choose what I want to play on it. The guitar my grandma has is 300$, and if we could just ask and get it for free, it’s a great deal. They’re considering selling it to a four year old that probably won’t even know what’s she’s doing. And yea, my parents say I don’t practice. I do when it’s a song I actually want to learn and play. That barely ever happens. If I learn guitar I’ll practice as long as I’m not just playing these old boring songs that are several centuries old, instead I would like learning how to play easier songs from bands I like or just learning actual techniques instead of just these things like 1667 symphony or something. If we can’t get this guitar, I at least want to ask for one to buy, which they’ll also probably say no to. From my birthday I got like 200$ and I already had another 200$ saved which I can EASILY just buy my own with. If they wouldn’t give me lessons, I’d probably self teach myself or something.

1022,"I'd really appreciate your guys' wisdom, thank you.

I've gotten myself into a predicament, and I'm really unsure on how I should proceed. 

Before my school had a break, I wrote a note to a guy. The note was basically a confession, and it said that I think he's really nice and helpful, and would like to talk more and get to know each other. I left my phone number, and had been hoping to hear from him over the vacation. However, I didn't get shit. I just thought that he wasn't interested, and that sucked, but today I learned what happened. 

This is so embarrasing, but today, my teacher called me over to talk. He told me that he had found something personal of mine. Me being a dumbass asked him what it was (I should've known!). The teacher awkwardly said he had read my letter, and threw it away to keep my privacy. I don't know if he thought it was for him or something, but either way, it was painful to hear. 

So it turns out, my crush never got it. He must of not seen it or something. But now I'm scared to try again, because I don't want anything like that to happen again. I also am worried that it turned out that way because it isn't meant to be.

Back to the advice, would it be a bad idea to try again? If I did, should I just tell him in person? I'm almost always too shy and or nervous to ever actually do it though. How could I overcome the anxiety from it?

1026,"I was never one to be peer pressured and I was the kind of kid who followed the rules (most of the time). But yesterday, I threw away my own morals and the teachings of my parents for one night because I let myself get curious about sexting. I found a forum that should’ve rang bells in my head but my brain was shut off at that point, found a post that also should’ve rang more red flags but like what I said... I was so stupid at the time. I gave the person my ASL along with name, foolishly took a full frontal image at the catfisher’s request, and then... They sent images of my mom and dad’s social media accounts with a threat saying they’ll send it to my parents if I don’t give them money within 5 minutes. 

Rather than give in, I mustered up the courage to tell my parents about what happened. Their reactions were obviously filled with disappointment, but also relieved that I told them about it right away. I already blocked, reported with chat history (thanks Kik), and deleted all the images of me right after. But I regret not saving the chat... I hate how impulsive I was for panic deleting... No less than 20 minutes, my mother got an email titled “[my name] Scandal” which was most likely the embarrassing images. Thankfully they didn’t open the email and finally called the police. I was able to tell the cop everything however I might have accidentally forgotten to tell more details. At least they have the blackmailer’s email address. Since the person is not within the country and I didn’t give them any financial info, the cop assured me I’m safe since there’s no other way to gain anything from those images. Hopefully... 

I talked a lot to my therapist today. Coming up with ideas to cope.. I’ve also talked to my most trusted friends about the issue and they also helped me get through the first few hours. But here I am now, wondering what am I supposed to do? I know I have to live with this mistake. I’m glad my parents are at least understanding and willing to defend me. I just...

I don’t know if I can go to high school now without feeling judged despite students and teachers obviously not knowing about it. The only person there who knows it is the school councilor.  Violated, exposed (literally and metaphorically), and most of all... Traumatized. I even victim blamed myself, knowing how stupid I was, and how I added more to my family’s stress.

Over the course of the year we’ve had many break ins, girls have had their bedsheets ruffled, snacks stolen, drawers opened, medications stolen, and items moved. We have reported it to the school police on many occasions but because there are no cameras and we don’t know who is doing it there’s really not much they can do. I can’t afford a camera, and the other girls in my suite just won’t keep the suite door locked, regardless of these occurrences. So I’m reaching out to you guys to ask if you have any pranks I can leave unsuspecting burglars? I need it to be cheep, safe, legal and not destructive.

1032,"Not so long ago I met someone I got along with pretty well. Sadly they had to go back home across the pond and that's why I kept my distance initially. After they left we kept in touch and eventually we started really opening to up to each other. And with really, I mean really. I haven't had any close friends in my life before and this was about as close as you can get with anyone. Of course that's intense in itself, but it doesn't stop there.

The thing is that this person is in an unhappy relationship and I have been part of the journey to figuring that out. I know for a fact that they had a crush on me and I also know that the feeling was mutual on my part. I've been told every detail about the relationship by now and I couldn't help myself to give my thoughts on it. I felt very bad about doing that, because it almost feels manipulative. It's been hard giving advice because of this, and just hearing out is not enough anymore.

Apart from that, we're just talking a lot. And I mean it when I say a lot. I've never talked to anyone more than to this person in all of my 23 years. It's been amazing but it's actually been so good that the crush I had on them while they were here actually got stronger instead of weaker. I want to keep talking but it's been consuming me. I can't get them off my mind anymore even when I need to. That last part might not even have anything to do with having a crush on them, it's probably just how people affect me. And a close friend affects you a lot. 

I can't say I never expected having a very close friend would be hard but man it's really affecting me. Especially when you're also crushing on them and you know the feeling is (still) mutual. I don't want to cut her off because it's for one also really having a positive impact on my life, but also because it's simply unfair to them. We both care a lot for each other. But we know we have feelings we are simply unable to act upon. I don't want to have romantic feelings for this person but unfortunately that's just not something you can simply turn on or off.

I still find it really hard to talk about stuff like this with anyone. Honestly I am comfortable enough in this friendship to make a change in that, but I still need some outside opinion as well. My gut is starting to tell me that it's better if I cut this person from my life, but that would be wrong in just too many ways.

1036,"To start, I am using the term “friend” a bit loosely. We are both 18 years old, and we are seniors in high school.

This friend, who I will call L, and I have known each other for about four years now. We connected because of mutual interests. As time has gone on though, I started to notice some of her habits that bothered me at varying degrees. I know that sounds really judgmental. Please allow me to give some examples:

- L consistently breaks the things she owns, refuses to take responsibility, and expects her parents to replace them. She broke her phone (which she has done about 4 times total) because she chose not to use her phone case. Our mutual friend, N, was getting his dog out of his car when it ran towards L and she dropped her phone out of surprise. The phone broke, and she yelled at N and blamed the dog. 

- L does not really listen to others’ complaints and instead tries to “one-up” the other person/people. For example, I told her that I was worried after my grandmother had been diagnosed with cancer. Instead of saying “I’m sorry to hear that” or anything of the sort, she immediately said something about how she needed a new phone case, since hers was starting to crack in the corner. I can’t help but feel like she doesn’t care when she ignores me like that, which happens a lot. 

- L quite literally choked N once. L was driving N to L’s house after our classes one day. N put his feet on the dashboard when the car was already parked. L yelled at him to take his feet off the dashboard, which he did immediately. L then told N that he had left dirt on the dashboard and he needed to clean it up. N said he didn’t see any dirt. L proceeded to grab him by the throat and choke him, which she claimed was a joke. It was strong enough to hurt him for hours afterwards and strain his voice, which he complained about to me. I can’t really think of L the same way knowing that she considers it to be a “joke” to choke her friend.

Anyways, I hope this isn’t confusing. I’m just really tired of L’s attitude towards herself, her own belongings, and others. I kind of want to cut her off. I know N would never do that due to his dependency on her for rides home from class as well as his close relationship with her parents. But I feel like she doesn’t respect either of us (which he agrees with to an extent), especially not after that last incident that I mentioned. I am planning on moving out of state for college/university, so I probably won’t see her again after this school year, but I find myself getting frustrated with her almost every time she does these sorts of things nowadays.

1040,"I am 15. I am in school. I have been bullied since the age of 4. 3 years ago I entered high school. I was ignored as if I never existed and everyone was disgusted of me. The following 2 years, I suddenly was noticed and had 50+ people greeting me per day, they would say weird things to me and would always laugh at everything I do. It was if people admired me so much it was an obsession but I knew it was all a joke to them. I had an incident where I had a dead leg during an award, someone filmed this as 500 people were watching me drag my leg and dying inside. I was called deadleg by teachers and students for a whole year. People would randomly say to me hey daddy boo or have sex with me or be my daddy. They would make memes about me and relate me to Jesus and God. Throughout my years I have experienced racism, physical and metal abuse. Now on the current year, people are still weird to me but it is less obsessive. I got rid of this by creating a whole new personality at school, no one actually knows who I am, and it gets harder and harder to keep this up. I am on the verge of another mental break down.

1045,"*(should preface this by saying I'm not from the US. I'm from Lithuania if that changes anything. Just putting it out there before I get linked to US resources and the like, which are useless to me for the most part)*

So, I woke up today and after my mom hands me a small birthday gift, not even 20 minutes later she calls me over and asks me to call for an ambulance. Half an hour later, the ambulance arrives, does a very brief overview like a cardio scan, checked her blood pressure and the like and finds nothing wrong with her. Yet she's adamant she feels pain from the chest up to her face. After the ambulance worker did the brief overview and found nothing wrong, he suggested that she should go with them for a further analysis to determine what could be wrong. To my (and the ambulance worker's) utter dismay - *she stubbornly refused.* Like, outright *refused* to step outside of the apartment. Because the ambulance worker has no right to remove her from the premises without her own explicit consent, they had her sign stuff that no action will be taken on their part and left. I genuinely wish that weren't the case but...oh well.

After that, I could hear my mom be in pain all day, sometimes even utterly screaming out of frustration, yelling things like ""what did I do to deserve this?!"" before asking me to rub lotion on her back, make her medicinal tea, bring medicine, etc. I've been doing that all day and seeing as it has had minimal to no effect on her well-being, I'm at a complete loss for words.

I have no idea who to turn to or what to do. My mom is stubbornly and adamantly refusing to go to the hospital for a definitive check-up and because of that, I feel like I can't do anything about it. I've been doing my best all day to provide for her with water, tea, food and medicine, yet I genuinely feel like the next time I call the ambulance, it'll be because she faints or has a heart attack or something. And I honestly don't want to think about that, even in the slightest.

Is there anything I can do to help my mom? Is there any way I can convince her to go for a check-up? I really need answers here because I'm genuinely scared for her life.",24Feb2020,1

1047,"I working as a teachers aide in a special ed class. All the students have aides so when the teacher is out sick, we can keep the routine going pretty well. The sub is mostly there to fulfill the requirement of a teacher being in the room.

One aide is the sub when the teacher is out, she keeps policing my breaks. Like paging me the moment my break is over to report back to the classroom, I walked into the class as the page went through.

Today was weird, she told me that I was suppose to go to lunch earlier then I normally go. I switch off with another aide so the students always have someone with them. The aide I switch off with was out of the room so when she came back I asked if the change was okay with her. 

The sub was pissed. She yelled at me in front of the  classroom of students and aides. The I need to give her respect. She told me when to go to lunch and that's when I go to lunch. That I need to respect her just like the normal teacher (though the teacher is okay with aides coordinating with the other aides and adjust breaks as needed) it ended with her telling me that if I have a problem with her then take it up with the principal. 

I didn't say anything, the aide I was talking to whispered ""that was intense"". 

I am new to this job, I have been working at this school for less than 2 months. She has snapped at me for sitting in her chair, all the chairs are the same.

They are 19, and we were a couple for 2 years now, until recently where I broke it off for reasons, but we are cool with each other and are friends.
The thing is, during my time with them, they kept mentioning forgetting their family sometimes, that they even had siblings. They told me that they tend to just forget things that are consistent throughout their lives and that they began to forget me too as after the split up, I have become a less consistent part of their life.

They said that they are forgetting my face and the time we spent together.

Im genuinely worried about them, that perhaps one day they will wake up without a memory of their name or their life...

2 months ago I almost committed suicide, my father is terminally ill and I basically flunked half my classes because of all the family and financial stress. I was put into a psych hospital for seven days against my will after that happened. Then a month ago I was skating around my campus and this cop approaches me again. Stops me I ask why he is stopping me, he says criminal mischief and I ask him how could he possibly prove that. He demands ID, I refuse because I don't want to deal with this officer. he then immediately calls for back up. this other officer rolls up aggressively demands ID or he will arrest me. I begin having a full-on panic attack, I began having flashbacks to being put in a mental hospital against my will and next thing I know the officer starts grabbing my arms I told him I would ID myself and he just responded ""Too Late"" and handcuffed me and threw me in jail.

(Let’s call him E) He came up to me, made a few jokes, and asked for my number + if I wanted to hang out. He was kind of pushy but I still gave him my socials so I wouldn’t seem rude. Maybe he was just nervous or something. He asked me on a date soon after but I told him that I didn’t know him so I didn’t feel comfortable and I wasn’t interested in a relationship. We talked to a few times and he was actually pretty funny. He somehow convinced me to hang out that weekend and we agreed it wasn’t a date. On said hangout, he called his friends in front of me 3 times to say I was “friendzoning” him and would get angry when I wouldn’t hold his hand. He got pissy and scary halfway through because he said “his meds were wearing off” He talked that whole time about his mental illnesses and how he’s so suicidal and lonely. It really made me nervous because who the fuck does that the first time you meet somebody. I left eventually and stopped talking to him over text. He’s spam texted me ridiculous amounts during the day and deleted them all within 30 minutes. I hung out with him during lunch a few times but I’ve almost cut contact completely at this point. It’s been a few weeks since the hangout and he still spam texts me and complements me every time he sees me. He’s made vulgar jokes about me in front of his friends and waits for me after our class together. I literally cannot avoid this guy. I’ve told him over 40 times I’m not interested and don’t want to date him yet every chance he gets, he tries to hold my hand, touch me, or tell me how much he’s into me.

He makes me very uncomfortable and no matter how much I tell him no, he won’t take no for an answer. How do I cut this guy out of my life without him going apeshit.

1071,"From the beginning it started when I was 9 (now 16, 17 soon) I was depressed and suicidal like there was no tomorrow. (Basic brief)

I’ve been on different drugs, self harmed, meditated, had therapy and probably everything else you can think of.. I met a boy last year we was (and still kinda are) extremely happy, which I promised him I wouldn’t self harm anymore, which I’ve stuck to and I’ve been ‘strong’ for a year (besides the temptations and thoughts) but it isn’t the point.

I’d say since October/November time I’ve really been staggering, I’ve been better then dipped down, so far I’ve been a wreck, an absolute ship wreck. I’ve been close to self harming again and tried to commit.. But the only reason I won’t is due to my dad, little sister and boyfriend. 

I don’t want to blame everything on my boyfriend, because it’s also me too, but currently I’ve felt really heartbroken towards him, I’ve wanted to end things in the past 2  weeks, due to how he’s being. Once again I’ll say he’s not everything to blame, it’s partially how I’m feeling to. I still love the boy like there’s not tomorrow, and I forever will.

Am I feeling depressed because of him?

Yet recently it’s as if he doesn’t care about me, I have asked for things to change but it seems as if he doesn’t take them in..

1085,"TW sexual assault, general creepiness

Just as a note, I have been sexually assaulted. Not by the person I will be talking about and I am still working on that, but this will not be about that. Just a factor in why I stayed quiet about this.

When I was in high school, I was in the band. I had a lot of friends in the band including “Emma”. Emma’s older brother “Ben” was also in the band. We often slept over Emma’s house and went over to hang out and swim in her pool. Ben was always home, and we hung out with him too. He was very charismatic and everyone loved him. He did band, theater, choir, he was loved among the music community.

My sophomore year (i was 15 at the time) Emma approached me and said she needed to tell me something. Apparently her and her mother found hundreds of pictures and videos on Ben’s computer of girls. He would tape an ipod behind a ratty towel in their bathroom when people would come over. He hosted a lot of the theater’s swim parties. Emma said she specifically saw some of me, along with dozens of other girls. They apparently destroyed everything. Just as a note another friend was also there when she told me. So somebody else knows too. 

I dismissed it at the time, having been recently sexually assaulted, I stored it away with that. I just avoided him. 

After I graduated he had become an instructor for the band. He was fired shortly after for sending snapchats to the high school girls shirtless and saying things like “how do you not have a boyfriend?? I’d treat you so well!” 

He does the local theater that my other friend is involved in. He harasses her with weird messages and trying to guilt her into being friends. He sends weird things about couples casted in shows and who he would kiss and wouldn’t etc. According to her she gets major creepy vibes from him and he hangs out with the underage cast members to the point people notice he hangs out with the kids in a weird way. 

I went to go see the show my friend was in and he was too. After the show he waved at me and i walked away. I knew in that moment that I was ready to talk about what happened. 

My sister is 15 now, and i would be so angry if this happened to her. 

Help me, how do I go forward? I’m ready. I don’t think I can stay quiet. I’m so mad I let this happen.

TLDR; My friends older brother had HUNDREDS of secret pics of girls changing at his house, including me. we were all underage at the time, making it child porn. what do i do?",24Feb2020,1

And for the record, I don't believe in heaven or that ""I'll see him one day"", unfortunately.",24Feb2020,1

1089,"The title says it all. I’m 36 weeks + 5 days pregnant and my fiancé woke up this morning and told me “I need to focus on myself and I can’t do that with you here.” Went on a rant about how he doesn’t love me anymore, and has been cheating on me for 6 months. Dropped me off at a homeless shelter a few towns over and that’s it. Took the ring he gave me and broke my phone and laptop. I don’t have anything for our daughter, not even a roof over her head. The only thing I have is a small bag of clothes I packed. I can stay at this shelter til she’s born and then I have to go. I have no family to help me at all. Nobody in my family has any room at their homes, I have reached out to everyone who could potentially help and gotten turned down. I’m going to give birth any day now. Please any advice you can I’m so scared. I don’t want to lose my daughter, I already lost everything today.",24Feb2020,1
1091,"I am a 17 year and 1/2 year old struggling socially, physically, and mentally.  I attribute part of my anxiety to my overprotective and overbearing parents.  Just to give some of the absurd and abnormal rules in my house, I'll list them

1) Curfew is 8pm no exceptions

2) I have to eat out and eat crappy food every single day no exceptions

3) Can't go outside, can't really do anything.

Basically, I have a pretty boring life.  I have a job, which is the only job I was allowed to get because it is right next to my house, made some money, threw some in the stock market. Now have around 4k of my own money to spend on what I want and to create meaning in my life.  Another disappointing thing that occurred in my life is that I was rejected to college last week. Only applied to one school because I was only allowed to apply to one school.  Now I'm stuck at home for at least another year, so there goes my freshman experience, right out the window.   Also, starting at 18, I am going to be financially independent.  So basically, my parents expect, me a 17 year old, to support and make a living for himself, go to college with a minimum wage job.  My parents suck, quite honestly.  The ironic thing is that we are rich.  Like really rich. Our house is over 2 million dollars.  Envision my situation as rich parents forcing their child to do as they please.  Fuck all I have is 4k to make a living, like fuck. Can't get a gym pass cause I don't have a car.  If I get a car, then I have to maintain it by myself, pay for insurance, gas, as a 17 year old, as well as get an apartment.  Basically, my parents have set me up to be a failure.  So yeah, I'm basically fucked. Any suggestions. Also, don't tell me to crash at friends houses cuz I don't have any and I can't leave the house. YAYYY",24Feb2020,1
1092,"Hey everyone, I was looking for some good advice. Back in december I had my car repossessed didn't get it back, and now I'm in a shitty situation where I'm looking for a new car obviously. I've been online searching and I'm afraid if I buy car for 2 grand itll be very unreliable but I dont really want to make payments on a car anymore, I would consider it if it's not that long term and low payments. I'm getting 4200 back in taxes I'm not sure if I should spend the entire refund on a car all out or down payment on a used car and pay it off quick. Any advice on a situation like this would be great. 

Also I seen a 2009 pontiac g8 for 5 grand has 163k miles if anyone knows anything about the car and whether that's a bad deal or not let me know aswell.",24Feb2020,1
1093,"I realize how stupid it was. Luckily I only got a small cut that looks worse than it is.

What can I do in order to solidify some safety rules in the kitchen? Some ways to just make sure I am being safer even on days when I'm not really thinking straight. What are some safety tips that I might not be aware of as a new cook?",24Feb2020,1
1094,"Just wondering, I'm Trinidadian and Puerto Rican but most people I know call me south Indian and was wondering, about visiting India for a tech institute but I am worried about the racism surrounding India and don't want to emotionally get involved in those specific situations.

Can anyone give me advice or something because now I really have 2nd thoughts.",24Feb2020,1
1095,"So, currently at the age I'm st right now, it's very uncommon for me to find someone who doesn't know how to swim or atleast tread water. I, (15M), do not know how to swim, and it really sucks when I got to special places like deep pools, lakes and such, because Im always in the shallow end. I know how to float on my back and swim with my arms at a steady pace on my back, but I can't tread. I watched videos that told me as long as I have air in my lungs I'll float back I'm, so Im not super scared of the water, over the summer I attempted to teach myself how to swim at a relatives 4 Foot pool and Im much taller than that. I can kinda sorta swim under water only with my arms but only for a short amount of time until I float back up so I guess it's not swimming. My parents always told me I was going to get swimming classes but us not being the richest of the bunch and very busy, I haven't. The most important thing I'd love to learn is atleast to know how to tread water. Then maybe a front breast stroke. If you read this far thank you for your time, and you can comment any tips or links that you think my help.",24Feb2020,1
1096,I can be doing things throughout the day and trying to challenge my anxiety but at night I dream about tsunamis and other scenarios of imminent death. It takes me up to 30 mins after I open my eyes to feel grounded in reality again. These dreams leave me exhausted throughout the day (even with 8 hrs of sleep) and I feel like I am totally at their mercy. I tried multiple pills my psychiatrist prescribed but they make me dizzy to the point I passed out once. I’m incredibly sensitive to medication and have been on various antidepressants for 2.5 years. At this point I don’t know if my system is messed up from pills so I’m very hesitant to take more. Is there a way to naturally lessen anxiety dreams without relying on medication?,24Feb2020,1
1097,"So I’m a 20 year old guy and I feel like I don’t have enough sex. I’ve messed around with a handful of different girls but my bodycount is just a 2. I’m going on a year without having sex and I just feel frustrated at myself. All my friends are in relationships and I feel like I’ve become that one token single friend. I’m 2 years sober, I’m going to community college, and I’d say I’m good looking guy but I feel like I’m not living up to my potential. I don’t have trouble talking to girls, I just work in and go to school for construction so I’m around other guys most of the time. Ive got tinder but I don’t really like it. I get a decent amount of matches but its just hard for me to feel the same interest as opposed to meeting them in real life. I’m sure I’m gonna have sex again it just feels like I never will. I kind just wanted to write this to vent lol but please comment if you have any advice or can relate. Thanks!!",24Feb2020,1
