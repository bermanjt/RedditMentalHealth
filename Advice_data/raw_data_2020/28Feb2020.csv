1,"Hello, I am fresh out of school living in Canada.

I did 2 job interviews last week, each for my 1st choice (dream job) and 2nd choice job.

Luckily I passed both interviews, and I submitted my job references check for the 1st  choice job as it is a fairly big company. Tomorrow I am seeing the 2nd job's manager for the final interview to assess my technical skills. I am 90% sure that I will be offered that 2nd job as long as I do not severely mess up, which I don't think I will.

My concern is that, for the result of the reference check for my 1st job, I need to wait for another week or two, probably until early March. And when I see the manager for the 2nd job tomorrow, she will ask me right away when can I start and what are my availabilities, and obviously I don't want to start that job when I don't know about the result for my 1st choice job yet. 

I wanna ask that manager if she could wait for me a week or two to make the decision, but I don't want to make her know that that job is my 2nd choice (because she knows that I had an interview last week for my 1st choice job as well).  I  just don' know what other excuses I can come up with, which allows me to stay in good terms with her (cause I don' want to make her feel and take back that offer), but also let me have some time until I hear back from my 1st choice job. What should I do in this case?",28Feb2020,1
2,"I’m trying out for Track and Field, mainly sprints for the 100m and 200m, however the exercises are pretty hard sometimes, and I’m starting to regret trying out. I don’t know if other people who’ve done track think the same as me, but if I’m feeling this way.., should I just continue or step away. I feel I haven’t done it full all the way, so I’m pushing myself. Any advice?",28Feb2020,1
3,"So this may seem like something super silly because he’s just an animal but I’m really worried about my dog, he’s part of the family 

    Recently my mom has gotten a full time job, my brother went back to school and I have a full school schedule this semester (unlike first semester this year) and my dad doesn’t like dogs so he’s been basically alone all day all week.

     Naturally my dog gets sad when we leave but recently it’s gotten to the point where he barks and cries very loudly (he’s a very quiet dog) and doesn’t eat or drink until I come back home in the afternoon. When I get home he doesn’t like being less than a metre away from me or else he begins barking and crying.

   In short I’m very worried about how dependent he’s become on us and want to know what I can do to get him to be less anxious about us being away. What can I do to help him?",28Feb2020,1

I am stressed out all the time about whether or not I am keeping her happy. I just need some time to myself. I can’t get that. I have to lie to her to get time to myself.

6,"
So I have two aunts. My aunt Roxanne and my aunt Veronica. My aunt Roxanne has a daughter, Amber who is two years older than me. I’m 18 and she’s 21. And my aunt Veronica has two daughters who are 11 and 14 years old. I also have younger sisters who are 16 and 13 years old. (This info comes in handy). 

My aunt Veronica used to watch me and Amber a lot as kids because both of our mothers were single moms and working. Amber and I would misbehave a lot because my aunt was mean to us and we frequently wouldn’t involve her kids or my younger siblings in whatever we were doing. Which pissed her off. 

Amber and I acted out a lot and my mom thought Amber was a terrible influence on me and banned her from my house (my mom and her mom didn’t get along well either) and we had to sneak around to see each other (it was hard). When I was around 10 I wasn’t allowed to stay at my aunts house anymore when Amber was there. 

I didn’t understand why I couldn’t see Amber and I believe I got depressed and held resentment towards my aunt Veronica and my mom even more. 

When I was 13, I reached out to amber on Facebook and we had to sneak around talking to eachother, I put her name in my phone as a friend at schools name (my parents were super suspicious of who I was talking too) and we made a huge collection of pictures taken at my aunts Veronica house and pretty much made fun of her on various social medias. I somehow pissed off amber and she went and told on me and my phone got destroyed and I was grounded. I also didn’t have many friends at the time. So I got depressed. 

I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety and depression. 

A few years ago (2017), when I was 16, Amber made fake accounts hating on aunt Veronica and a fake account using my stolen pictures (I wasn’t friends with her on any social media). I set all my profiles to private and my aunt found out and assumed it was me and her. Because I recently got surgery and was bed ridden. I had no part in making the accounts as I haven’t spoke to amber since I was 13. My parents told me if I ever talked to amber again they would throw me out and it’s not funny. They were seriously furious. My siblings don’t like amber at all. They also don’t like aunt Veronica. 

My parents were furious at me and then they got in a fight with my aunt telling my aunt there’s no way I was behind the fake accounts because they were posting while I was in surgery and my siblings were at school. I believe my aunt still thinks I played a part in it. Even though I didn’t. Nasty things were said about her kids and their pictures were stolen on these fake accounts and my aunts pictures were too. 

Aunt Veronica banned me, Amber and my siblings (they didn’t do anything) from coming over to her house every again and blocked us all on social media. She still hasn’t unblocked us but she occasionally talks to my mom. She cut off all contact with aunt Roxanne. None of us have spoke or seen each other since summer of 2017. 

Recently I got a friend request from amber on Facebook and a friend request from one of my little cousins (who has 4 different accounts). And I think amber might’ve hacked my little cousins accounts. I’m not sure though. I have no way to contact any of them to verify (their house phones and cell numbers got changed). 

I haven’t accepted her friend request because I don’t know what she wants or if it’s worth pursuing. I still live at home so if my parents found out they could legally kick me out. My siblings would also be upset if they knew I answered her. They knew about the friend request because I told them. My boyfriend might be upset as well, he’s never met her but he was in the picture when 2017 shit went down.",28Feb2020,1

I cheated on my boyfriend a couple days ago. I have mixed feelings on this one. I know why I did it.. I don't feel appreciated in our relationship. I pay for all the meals. I pay for all the weed (even though he smokes more than I do). I always listen, while it seems like he doesn't listen to me half the time. He also stopped working besides for 2 days a week..  We've talked about it. He says he'll work on it.. But.. I don't know if I should tell him I cheated. We were in an argument at the time.. It didn't mean anything and it was shitty sex..but.. I feel so goddamn guilty about it and ik it'll kill him if he finds out.

I stole from an ex friend because they turned out to be nothing but lies. They gave me 90 bucks to get them weed and instead I pocketed it. They created fake profiles online and pretended to be different people online and made up and lied about so much both irl and as the fake online personas...

10,"On mobile, don't post much so formatting may be rough, my English is also not very good. 

This is gonna be a long one, TLDR at the bottom. 

Some backstory: So in 2016, my parents had a divorce. I was about 16 at the time, and previously been abused by my mother. I suffered from severe anxiety for years growing up, so 2 years before the divorce I begged my dad for a therapy dog, which I had the money to get one. I ended up getting a beautiful black lab border collie Bouvier mix, we will call her Luna.  She was everything to me, a piece of my soul. We did everything together and she was there for me every second. She knew when I was going into panic mode and would sit on my lap and snuggle up to me to comfort me. She was my best friend in the world. 

During the divorce, we also lost our house. We packed up all of our stuff and left a few days later, moved into a really tiny cracked out looking house, where I spent about 1 more year being abused by my mom (dad cheated on mom which sparked the divorce so he moved in with his new girlfriend) with my dog who did protect me from her. I ended up moving out and finding a job, so I took Luna with me. We had the best 6 months of our lives. I ended up getting kicked out because the owners of the home wanted to sell it. I had very little warning so I had to figure something out quick or I'd lose my dog (where I live it is very very difficult to find pet friendly rentals) 

So I couldn't figure anything out. I ended up calling my dad and asking him if they could take care of Luna until I could find somewhere for us. He took her to his farm with his new gf, and since then my life has been crazy. I lived in my car for 3 months, found an amazing job that paid very very well, got myself a new place, and found the love of my life. I got into a pretty bad car accident so now I no longer have a vehicle. But, one thing led to another and my boyfriend and I moved to the next town over and we are doing extremely well! I've done a lot of growing and it's been crazy. 

Here is the dilemma. I obviously really really want my dog back. So I asked my dad when I can come get her since I am able to take care of her again. And he told me that he assumed that when I ""gave her up"" he'd be keeping her forever, which was in no way what we agreed to. So for the last 5 months I've been begging for her back and all he says is that his gf has gotten extremely attached to her and can't let her go. They have had her for about 7 months now, and I don't think that 7 months of attachment matches with 5 entire years of surviving abuse together and all the adventures we've been on. I take amazing care of that dog, feed her the best food, take her on adventures, spend loads of time with her. I love her so much and living without her is like torture.

So I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go about getting her back? I have no clue what to do. I don't even know where my dad lives. I don't know what steps to take, all I know is that I need to get that dog back. I know this is all personal life stuff so there isn't really a clear answer, but any advice would be awesome. 

TDLR: Gave my dog up to my dad that I love to death because I was homeless, and now that my life is really back on track and I have all the means to take care of her again he won't let me take her because his new girlfriend is too attached. Its been 7 months, I had her for 5 years. I don't know how to go about getting her back because I don't even know where my dad lives.

21,"My current job (Job A) is 10 minutes away from home- a luxury in california- and offers a ton overtime opportunities and hours during january through october however business gets really slow during the last two months so you’ll work 40 a week if lucky during those last 8 weeks of the year. On top of that, I have to be on call 24/7 , work night shifts occasionally,and I went three straight weeks without a 2 day weekend so far this year and it’s just the beginning. PTO for Job A is 4 days.

My potential future job (Job B) is ~30 mins from home, pays the same as job A but there’s not possibility for overtime. The schedule for Job B would be 10 hours every day Monday - Thursday so I get a 3 day weekend and Job B has a contract with their refinery site so I’m guaranteed 40 hours throughout the entire year whether theres work or not. Job B offers tuition reimbursement if you decide to go to college and you get 2 weeks of paid time off every year compared to Job A’s 4 days.

It’s important to note that both jobs pay the same and right now my short commute time and overtime hours are the only positives holding me back since at this rate i’m projected to make over 20K this year in overtime however the schedule for job A sucks and 4 days of paid time off compared to two weeks is a huge difference.

26,"Not sure if there would be a better subreddit for this but here goes.

I've been writing for a very long time. However, I have ADHD, and the nature of my particular experience with it is that I need to set manageable routines or else I fall into slumps way too fast and my progress gets sidetracked until I'm ready to push myself again. Sitting down and writing several thousand words when I have time doesn't work for me. I set myself a minimum daily word count of 250 but typically end up writing anywhere between 400 and 2000 words.

This habit has made it much easier and more fulfilling to hone my craft, which is great.

The biggest problem I run into is finding an author's work that is similar to mine but several levels above it in terms of skill, thoughtfulness, intentionality, etc. This started happening to me as I reached my late teens and I more or less stopped writing for something like five to seven years. There have been a few more instances since then, and in recent years I've made it a personal rule to avoid reading any work I think might bear a close resemblance to my own. I thought this would save me from a) being exposed to WORSE writing in the same vein and having my style ""corrupted"" by theirs, and b) being exposed to much better writing which would demoralize me enough that  wouldn't want to continue.

So recently, something happened. I became friends with another, much younger writer (about 8-9 years younger). We happened to know some of the same people and travel in the same social circle, and I had never heard of her, but she invited me to a private chat server with several of our mutual friends. None of them have read my writing, since I write under a pen name that I keep separate from the name I use for social purposes. We just happened to be friends on twitter.

So this younger writer collaborates with several people we both know. I'd peeked at some of their shared work before I knew anything about them. The themes they wrote about were not my thing, but then, I got pulled into a group conversation about the work (somehow) and when all was said and done, I agreed that I'm would read their story and let them know what I thought.

The co-written story itself was okay. But it got me curious, and soon I was wandering over to the author's private portfolio that she has up for public viewing. Her private work is devastatingly brilliant. It's so good that I started reading immediately and spent days working through it. I'm currently about halfway done.

And I'm torn. On one hand, reading was both intensely enjoyable and surprisingly painful. I often found myself admiring how she managed to convey things that I've struggled with for years, or only just begun to understand. I had several moments while reading her of wondering whether it was better for me to just quit, becuase I don't know if I'll ever be capable of turning out writing like this.

But at the end of each night, when I had spent two or three hours reading her work, I found that I had the energy to sit down and write my own stuff. And it was clearly my own, and it flowed well and did most of the things I wanted it to.

And that got me thinking about the fact that students are exposed to great work for a reason. Great work has something to teach us. There's a reason we seek out the ""experts"" and the ""masters"" to consume what they have created. Reading this 22-year-old girl's stories will probably make me a better writer. But it's difficult to resist getting discouraged or hating my own work in the process.

It's doubly hard since we are now friends. I can't just consume everything she's ever written and then forget about her--I have to keep interacting with her, and will probably be invited to read more and more of her stuff as it comes out. I'd really rather not leave the group she's part of, as it's full of amazing people I've enjoyed getting to know. At the same time, I don't have the mental or emotional capacity to keep emotionally torturing myself over quality of work that I can't reproduce, so I'm wondering if there's another way to engage with it WITHOUT getting deep into those sad, lowly feelings?",28Feb2020,1

29,"Hello! 

Back story: My brother(30) has been battling depression for at least 10 years now. He has been on medication for years. last year he has been dumped by his girlfriend because she couldn't deal with his depression and she called our family saying he was suicidal. Everyone was worried about him and he came home and we were around for him and tried to get him help but he wanted to do it on his own. He got himself out of his slump, we got a puppy, he went back to school and he was doing very well! He was up every morning and eating better and hanging out and It was great for me, his younger sibling(28), to have him around. 

However... he recently had surgery for kidney stones and its been going downhill since then. His surgery was a few weeks ago, right when reading break happened for school so he didn't miss much. But he's stopped going to class, he doesn't have a job because my parents want to support him while he's going to school, so he stays home all day, plays pc games, and smokes weed. He lies to our parents about going to school when he doesn't actually go. The only movement he has is when he comes down for food or has a shower. He doesn't interact with the dog. It seems like he's gone back into a pretty bad depression after taking so many steps forward. Whenever my mom tries to talk to him he yells at her, saying she doesn't understand. My parents are frustrated and I'm worried 1) my brother is going to kill himself 2) My parents are going to get pulled down with him (my mom is already worried and stressed about everything and can't get a break). We've suggested therapy but he doesn't want to go. Im considering going to therapy myself to help me through this. We're a close family and I think we support and show love pretty well but I'm at a loss and I don't know how to approach this. 

As an aside: I live at home right now because Im looking for a house to buy and moved back in after my lease was. My brother lives at home b/c he was dumped and has gone back to school.",28Feb2020,1
32,"Throw away account because I can’t have people finding this lol. Okay so basically I’ve recently told my close family that I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for over 3 years now. Initially it was quite a shock to my family as they didn’t suspect anything (or at least they haven’t said anything to me about it). At first it was quite awkward as I felt I was being watched all the time. A family member has gone through something similar to me but our eating disorders are very different. It’s not that I don’t appreciate the advice but telling me to eat more or just have some food freaks me out so much. The thought of having to eat more than I would usually have just makes me spiral. I am on a waiting list to get help for this however it’s taking forever to be seen and I am struggling so much mentally. I’m really snappy with them when they ask too personal questions. I think they are having a hard time dealing with this also. Before I told them, I did set up a support network within my family so they could find it easier to deal with. It worked for a while but it’s just getting too much. I hate all the questions and the feeling of being judged. Any advice on what to do or even better ways to handle how I’m feeling would be appreciated so much!",28Feb2020,1
33,"So Long story short- I live in Canada, one morning my mum woke me up and said ""Hey lets go to the mall- SO I went, Upon arriving at sportchek me and the cashier were visibly interested in eachother, we kept staring at each other I thought she was cute but I was just there to buy socks, So I was waiting in line and she was very short with all the other customers and then when I went up she was doing the twirling hair and smiling and saying ""heey thanks for waiting how may I help you?"" But just in like a very flirty way and my mother saw this and she even realized 

But I was so nervous so I just was an idiot and said nothing and I thought I have to go back and see this girl, SO a week passes I go back and see her, I say ""Hey I remember you from last time"" to which she says ""Oh yeahh! you did look familiar"" and small talk blah blah blah I bought some stupid water bottle; she gives me her instagram and she is VERY attractive, and I say ""How old are you?"" and she says ""16"" and iAM 18 so I was like oh for god sakes in my head. I left being polite and I have her instagram only to find she has a BOyfriend as well who is young as well.

My question is- Can you help me out I don't know if i should text her, my friends say better just leave it but I was thinking something along the lines of ""Hey forgot to text ya! thanks for the water bottle!"" cause I don't know if its weird that I asked for her instagram and then didn't even text her but She has a boyfriend and I really am caught up here in my own thoughts.

41,"So, I've been good friends with, let call her Wendy, for about five years. Although it hasn’t been that long, she became one of my closest friends and one of my bridesmaids for my wedding. However, after years of getting to know her, I think I have reached a point where I don’t know how to handle her anymore.

A few years ago, Wendy was suffering from depression. She had a lot of family drama, stress from school, her best-friend at the time abandoning her, and just a lot of self-esteem issues. She was no longer a bright ball of sunshine and was really beating herself up over everything. Even to the point of being suicidal. I couldn’t stand watching her fall apart so I tried to be her support, someone she could come to if she need help, someone to keep her company, someone to vent her feelings to. I just didn’t want to see my friend fall because she had no one. So, I became someone that she could rely on. I didn’t mind at first but later I notice that my life revolved around her. Not in a good way either, whenever we hung out, she always talked about how me having around was great because she didn’t have any thought of committing suicide but when I was away from her the thought would come back. It gave me comfort that she was doing better but her dependency was worrisome because the thought of “if I am not available for her, what will happen?” There would be days where I couldn’t meet with her and she would call that night having a panic attack. Or whenever I was with my boyfriend at the time, she would always tell me to see her instead because I see my boyfriend more often that her. It was overwhelming but I still stuck by her side. Long story short, she got better because her “best friend” came back into the picture and I was tossed to the side. I confronted her about this, and we just stopped talking after that. 

A year after that incident, we reconnected and became friends again. She was in a better head space and situation. Wendy graduated from college, got a boyfriend and moved in with him, and broke off her friendship with her “best friend.” I was so happy for her and really thought she changed. Oh boy, was I wrong. I didn’t really mention Wendy’s personality, but she is fun-loving person with a very aggressive tiger mom attitude. It’s all fun and games until she tells you it not. For example, whenever I invite her to a party with my friends and we reminisce about high school or our childhood, Wendy will immediately say “I wasn’t there so I can’t relate, can we change the subject.” I get it, it’s hard to join a conversation that you cannot relate with but whenever she talks about something and we don’t relate with it, we just let her talk about it. She does this with anything she doesn’t like or relate to like childhood/high school memories, anime, inside jokes, family, other friends, etc. It sucks because it’s like she doesn’t want to get to know me at all. She is also aggressive with my friends as well. If my attention is directed somewhere else, she will always butt into the conversation a divert it her. This one time we had a party and my childhood best friend was there, she more docile and introverted so I stayed with her so she wasn’t so awkward, but Wendy would always try to pull me away from her or emphasize that I would be enjoying myself elsewhere. She also had the audacity to yell at her to speak up and be more aggressive, when we were playing games at the party. Let’s just say my friend is now afraid of Wendy.   
 

There is a lot of things that Wendy has done that has caused problems with not just me but with my friends but it’s going to take too long to explain but here are a few things:

1. Take credit for group efforts just to curry favor

2. Hide drama behind my back so I wouldn’t find out or think about her differently 

3. Constantly brag about how better she is in life than others. Or trying to one up others.

4. If you don’t answer her calls, she will call your phone constantly until you pick up. Sometime doing it with a private number.

5. She demands you drop everything for her. Whatever you’re doing, no matter how important it is, she expects you to drop it. I had to leave work on multiple occasions because she would be hysterically crying each time (who wouldn’t worry and leave to check on her). 

I always explain to people that Wendy is a little difficult to get along with because of her personality but once you’re use to it, it’s not that bad. But my boyfriend always explained to me that I should never just settle because “you’re used to it.” He told me that I am making excuses and not acknowledge the problem. I still love Wendy, but she’s been causing a lot of drama and straining my relationships with others. It’s been taking a toll on me and I want to confront her about it. As I mentioned, this isn’t the first time we stopped being friends, but I don’t know how to tell her I don’t want to be friends with her anymore. I am also afraid on how she’ll react to everything I tell her because losing me would mean losing a big chunk of her friends too. Her boyfriend is also leaving for a six-month deployment soon so she’ll be alone and I’m worried that I might cause her too much distress and/or she’ll go back into her depression. I don’t know what to do. I want to be honest, but I want to end things on a good note (it probably isn’t) but don’t know what to do. 

Sorry for the long rant but this problem has been brewing for months and I don’t know how to tell such a good friend I need her out of my life. Or should I try to fix this with her? I don’t know. Send help.",28Feb2020,1
42,"First of all, I just want to say that I love my dad. He may not be a good example for me whatsoever, but I still love him.

&amp;#x200B;

He was essentially a deadbeat father growing up, only thing he did that wasn't deadbeat was pay the bill. He's been a hardcore alcoholic his whole life and addiction has crippled him. He wasn't emotionally present growing up, and was barely physically present. I didn't have a dad for the longest time, I still feel like I sometimes don't. Eventually my parents got divorced when I was about 11. My dad moved out and quit drinking for about 5 years. He still smoked a lot of weed, still does, but at least he wasn't drinking. I believe the primary reason he quit drinking was for me and my brother. From here, he basically started attempting to build a relationship with his kids from scratch, and he did his best. I truly think that. He took us out to see movies, go on hikes, etc etc, but he still had trouble connecting with us on ""that"" level. I also suffered with a lot of mental health issues as a teenager and even when I was 11-12. I didn't realize it for the longest time, I had teachers emailing my parents saying they were concerned about me, but nothing was really ever done. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 18 and could start drinking, my dad fell off the wagon and started drinking again. We were drinking together, doing speed together, MDMA, etc etc.. This was 4 years ago.  I moved out about 3 years ago and the past six months I've been back living with him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is kind of where my problem lies. I just cannot stand living with my father watching him fucking kill himself every night with alcohol. He works a good job, but all he does is work and drink/smoke. He doesn't have any hobbies whatsoever. He is so unhappy and he doesn't even realize it. He refuses to go see a therapist. I just wish I had a father who is a good example to me. I get so angry sometimes because he's continuing to do the same thing he did growing up, the exact same thing that stripped me from him. I haven't verbally expressed concern, I mostly just get really pissed off and don't talk to him. I know this upsets him when I do this, but I don't know what else to do.",28Feb2020,1

45,"Someone I slept with is claiming I gave them an STD. I’m having trouble believing him.

I (21f) slept with this dude (38m) on February 16th. We didn’t use a condom. I ended up not liking him very much because he’s clingy and I told him so on February 25th (9 days).

I ended up getting drunk and drunk texted this person (like an idiot). I tell him things might work out, but I’m super busy, blah blah blah. He got mad because I ended up getting too drunk to make any sense and stopped messaging.

The next day, he messages me saying he has STD symptoms and that I gave it to him. He said he was going to the doctor to get tested and that he was getting treated on the same day. He then questioned me about me being drunk.

He won’t tell me what symptoms he has or what his results said (I know a couple tests won’t show for a week, but there’s a test that will show up after 20 minutes).

I don’t have any symptoms. I hit up my previous partner and he doesn’t have any symptoms, and neither of us slept with anyone else in a while (months). The last person I slept with before him was like 2 months ago and he only slept with one other person before me. I completely trust both of them because we had pretty good relationships.

I’m just here sitting at planned parenthood waiting for my test and my doctor let me know that if I gave him anything or he gave me anything, the symptoms wouldn’t show until 2 weeks. 

I just got my HIV test results and it came back non reactive. I just have to wait for the next two. 

This isn’t the first time getting tested, but this is the first time someone has accused me of something like this. I just would hate to know that I put someone in danger like that.

I honestly think he’s lying because he won’t tell me his symptoms and just how everything played out. Why would someone fake having an STD and then romantically ask to see the person, who “gave” them the std, again?",28Feb2020,1

50,"So, my situation is super complicated, and I feel kinda dumb even trying to explain it here because I'm  asking advice when theres no possible way for yall to know everything that goes into this, but I'll try to explain the important bits. 

My father wasn't really involved much in my childhood, aside from occasional, visits. Half of it's his own fault (he's a drug addict) and half of it was outside of his control. (My sister and I were given to an abusive and manipulative grandparent at age 4) 

There's a lot of drama with my mother and father. Father is the one who got mother into drugs, and they had many fights. Mother's back has been broken by him and she lost one of her children (my little brother) a day after he was born, due to issues stemming from father raping mom during a critical stage in her pregnancy. 

So, he's an evil motherfucker, right? Having said that, he's still always shown in interest in my life. He showed up to my black belt test, and he showed up to my highschool graduation, and since I became an adult, he tends to call about once every week or two to talk about exercise and karate (the only interests we have in common). Despite his horrible, horrible actions in the past, I dont think he's ever done anything to me, and I think he genuinely cares about me and wants to have a relationship with his son. 

Now here's where it gets more complicated. He taught one of my cousins, a young woman, how to smoke meth. They've been doing lots of meth and apparently when she passed out at his house, he raped her unconscious body and left $100 by her pillow as ""payment"". I heard about this from texts that were shared to me from her. I told her that if this is true, then she needs to go to the police immediately, but, like most drug addicts, she has a strong aversion to the police. Regardless, my sister and I resolved to cut all contact with our father after this. Its against our principles to be in any kind of relationship with a rapist.

Several months have passed and I just received a handwritten letter from father. He tells me that he loves me and all the stuff I heard and read about the rape were lies, and that he's still friends with my cousin. He proceeded to repeat stuff that I had only told my cousin, proving that they were indeed talking to eachother again. She has been hanging out with father, likely doing drugs with him, and apparently changed her mind about the rape. It was just normal sex for money, apparently now. wtf?

I dont even know where to begin to handle this...

On one hand, I think that my father is a piece of shit and the scum of the earth and I probably should have cut content with him years ago, but on the other hand, it's so hard to cut someone off who genuinely wants a relationship with me. 

My cousin's brain is probably ravaged by meth, so anything said by her is probably best taken with a grain of salt, but the texts she had sent me after the incident showed my dad's number replying and he unequivocally confirmed that he fucked her unconscious body. I think it's still rape, even if she changed her mind and forgave him, because at the time she was passed out on drugs and couldnt consent.

So what do I do about my father?

What do I do about my cousin?

My mom can be very hard working, but ever since she retired she has not done much with her day to day activities. I never really noticed until now, bc I am home from college this semester and see what she does. Granted, I have depression like her and don’t do much , but I mean I have classes and work to keep me up and running for some part of the day. My mom however, just spends her time watching a tv show or playing candy crush all day , and I worry so much for her. She used to be the type of person who would get tired of not leaving the house every day, and would at least go to the mall or something to get out. Now, she goes out for groceries or with me and that’s it.

57,"Sorry if this is long and ranty but I'm pretty stressed and this is my first Reddit post. Ok so I've been in the same job for 6 years now, a ""cashier"" at a ""restaurant"". Those are in quotes because I do so much than cashier (cleaning, minor food prep, make drinks/soups, waitress, etc...) and apparently we're technically a catering company for health code reasons, even though we have dine in tables, normal delivery and pick up orders (my assistant manager who has been there for 8 years didn't know we were classified like that). Why is this relevant? Well a few months ago the owners/managers announced we were moving locations. At first I was fine with it because I just thought we were getting a bigger place but pretty much the same routine. They didn't convey a lot of info about it and we would ask occasionally and get vague answers. So the move is soon, either this week or next week and I'm just now getting shown the new place and it will be classified as a restaurant and we will have to clean A LOT more in depth. And they asked me to make a cleaning assignment list (I'm paid the least there but whatevs) and I asked about the new schedule so I know how to assign what to who and I'm getting ""we don't know"". Which makes me think a lot will fall on me because I don't have kids or a second job like my co workers (4 of us are front of house, 2 of them only work 5 hours of the 8 hour shift). I feel pretty angry that I haven't been kept in the loop about my job/hours changing until we're about to move, but I've been in the same place for 6 years and have known these people for 10 so it feels so weird to think about doing something else.

64,"So, sorry if this isn’t structured well this happens to be my first post on reddit. Recently I’ve started taking boxing lessons and really getting into physical fitness. However, my family and specially my parents have mocked me for it because of my height. I’m 5’6 and they regularly make fun of me for being short say that I would look weird if i put muscle on. It’s gotten to the point where even my grandma says i would just get my face beat in if i got serious about boxing. I can’t tell them that i don’t like what they say about me because I’m hispanic and admitting your confidence is affected by their jokes is a fast way to ruin any sort of comedy based relationship with family members. I would just like some advice on how to deal with this in a way that keeps me motivated and doesnt mess with the relationship i have with my family.

65,"So here I am, sunk low enough to ask advice from strangers on the internet. Ill explain to my best ability what is happening. I’m fucking adopted. There it is. But hey, that’s not all. I’m from a Caucasian family. I’m not fucking Caucasian. Oh yeah and I’m 14. So I am Asian. I hate that. I’ve tried everything to avoid Asian stereotypes. Growing up my sister (22) would make racist jokes about my eyes and my skin. I’ve been self conscious and growing slowly aware of how different I look from my own family. My skin is light tan my hair is black. My eyes are not squinty nor are they “closed”. They are wide and dark brown. My nose is not “small”. I realized when I wear a baseball hat they look bigger. I now wear one 24/7. Some people see me as half white, I don’t look intensely Asian it’s mostly my hair and skin. I don’t know my true race but I’ve been too afraid of the result to get a dna test. So my only source of insecurity would be one, I’m adopted. Two, I’m Asian. I hate that I’m Asian. I don’t go to Asian restaurants. They look at me weird. I don’t make friends with Asians. I know it’s racist I just don’t want to be stereotyped. All I want is to be Caucasian. 

So this week has been shit. I’ve made it clear to those who call me Asian that I am white. I know I am lying. I say maybe I’m mixed or whatever but I’m mostly white. This girl has been calling me “Asian” because she knows it annoys me. I hate it. I really like her as a friend but still. I want to break her fucking face when she says it. But I don’t, I laugh it off and say I’m not Asian. Other than that she’s really nice. Well this other person I eat lunch with has recently been calling me “adopted”. It’s true. I hate it so much. I don’t even like the girl but I don’t want to seem like a sensitive Bastard if I tell her stop. She once told me my dog hates me because he can smell I’m not apart of my family. I don’t want to tell the truth about me. I feel like it would seem like a pity party or they’d see me differently. The last girl I told in middle school then began telling everyone. I hate that she uses that word to tease me. It’s fucking driving me crazy. I laugh it off. But tomorrow if I hear that word come out of her mouth I’m going to fucking break. The only flaw in my life has been that one fact about me “adopted”. It drives me crazy. My great aunt told me “oh they picked out a cute one, how do you like it over here?” When she fucking knows I was a baby. 

I’m so fucking mad. I can’t tell them stop because I’m a pussy. Tomorrow if she tells me one more time I’m going to tell her to square up. I’ve been planning it. I don’t tell my family because I don’t want to seem like it bothers me. So tomorrow if that word comes out her mouth like it’s okay I’m going to show her just how much it’s not. 

Tl;dr I’m adopted. I don’t like to tell people. I’ve been teased for it by this girl at lunch. Too scared and worried to ruin our relationship to tell her stop. Didn’t want to seem sensitive or weak. I’m going to beat her up tomorrow(like punch and kick not full on beat) if she says it again. I’ve had enough. Don’t know a better solution.",28Feb2020,1
67,"Recently my long-term girlfriend (now wife!) and I decided to get married. She was dissatisfied at work and wanted to go back to school but didn't want to be without insurance. I'm a federal employee and we decided to get married short notice at a courthouse so she could get on my insurance (and for love!). She is working and going to school now, but her current job doesn't offer insurance. 

My problem is this: It was last Monday we enrolled her on my plan, but we got our cards in the mail today and I realized that the plan I had mistakenly selected is CONSIDERABLY more expensive in terms of premiums than the one I'd intended to select and truth be told, we cannot really afford it. Does anyone know if I can re-submit the Qualifying Life Event and change this NOW or do I have to live in poverty until open enrollment comes back around?

71,"Its 2am and i cant sleep as i cant stop thinking of the situation iam in so here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

Im a 20 year old student who lives in a flatshare with a woman who is very irrational and verbally abusive to the point that i believe she can get physical. I cant confront her with any issue i have with her and its making me really depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

so the thing is, we both live in an apartment but her name is still not on the contract yet, theoretically i have a little bit of leverage to kick her out but the thing is, if i do, i need to find someone who can take over quickly and pay the rent (€680) or else ill have to be kicked to the kurb. One of the biggest issues i have is actually confronting her with a notice to leave the apartment, i have no idea how she will react and im afraid she would be aggressive. Im not the fighting type but i definitely can defend myself but dont want to be in a situation where i have to do that, especially since im a foreigner in a country where my visa could be cancelled for any minor negative interaction with the police. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of things can go wrong with deciding to kick her out, she can ruin the apartment before leaving and since she isnt registered here and never paid a deposit, there wont be any right to sue her. She can simply decide to 'squat' and then ill have to get her to deal with the landlord who would much rather kick both of us out and not have to deal with me and my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

im simply alone, afraid and i have nobody to turn to for advice. I have no family that would support me in case of homelessness, neither do i have friends.

what do i do?",28Feb2020,1
72,"I swore into the DEP for the Navy on November 8th of 2019. Now I don't know if its what I wanna do.

Here is the background of why I decided to join, my situation at the time, and some other stuff.

I'm a 19 y/o female with a GED. Around July 2019 I had been in a toxic relationship for almost 3 years and was starting to have doubts about being in the relationship. He was joining the marines set to leave in August and I was excited for him to go away. I thought maybe it would help our relationship. So while he was gone I decided I would talk to a recruiter because I only have my GED and thought it was a good option for me. My ex failed basic and came home around mid September and it just wasn't enough time for me to decide if I wanted to stay or leave the relationship. I figured I would go away for a few months and ta-da it would be okay. We moved out of our parents houses and he had lost his job early that year so I was BURNING through my savings paying all the bills alone. I had lost my job in July so for months I was alone paying bills and couldn't handle it. So when I swore in I wasn't in the right state of mind. My depression was at its worst, my relationship was shit, I was broke and jobless, my ex had basically convinced me to hate my family.

But now, I'm set to leave may 5th and my life has changed so much. I got out of that relationship and I'm with someone new, literally the love of my life. I have 2 jobs with average pay. I have tons of pets. I moved back in with my family and have gotten closer to them than I have been in years. I just reconnected with an old friend. My life is going really good right now. So I'm just lost on what to do. I'm scared I'll lose my relationship or that the Navy will change my personality. I don't want to regret it and I'm starting to think I might. I'm so happy and I've realized the Navy isn't my only option anymore.

Here is a little bit of a pros/cons list I made and like what I plan on doing if I don't go.

Pros:
Consistent job/money
Make family proud
Easy
Place to live
Health care
Get in shape more
Travel
They pay for school
I can buy things I've always wanted

Cons:
Constantly moving
Can't see friends/family whenever i want
Have to remove all piercings
Can't call out sick
Can't dress how I want
I'm stuck even if I hate it
Can't see my pets :'(

What if I don't go?
Apply for college 2021 if I save enough
Tattoos
Keep piercings
Dye my hair again
Do whatever I want to my hair/body
Get into drawing more
Get into make up like I've been wanting to
I don't have to leave my pets alone
I can keep my friends and stay in contact with them
Get to choose my job/boss how I want


I feel like my lists are pretty even and I'm just so lost on what to do. I know this is a long and MESSY post but I felt like I had to add all of this for proper advice. I've talked to friends and they just say do what makes me happy but I'm not sure if that's the navy or not anymore. Please, I need strangers to look at this and see whats best.

75,"I was asked about two weeks ago by a few girls from my school if I could take care of the music for the upcoming spring dance. (I do stuff like this for a hobby from time to time and also have some equipment for it.) It is a large event that we (200 students) have planned and organized for almost half a year now and I was very happy when they asked me, of all the people they could have asked. 
I agreed to do it. For free, of course! 

The event is taking place this evening and the problem is that I got sick over the weekend (I probably got the flu from my sister) and am still battling with fever, headaches and nausea. 
With some meds I could probably get through the day but I don't know if I should do it. Last time I tried to do something demanding while being sick I almost passed out and I am afraid that it might happen again in front of half of my school.

I already wrote J (one of the girls organizing the event) on Wednesday and we came to the solution that if I can't make it, they will have to hook a phone up to the amps. It would work, but it would not be as ""good"" as a live mix, according to J, and I feel really, really bad for letting them down.

What should I do? Value my health and stay in bed while missing out this awesome event that we have been planning for so long or should I take some. meds and JUST DO IT?
Thank you very much for reading this and maybe even giving me a bit of advice!

76,"I’m not sure where to post this, so if there’s somewhere better, please tell me.

Here’s the gist: my brother started going to therapy since it’s covered by insurance. So, naturally, he spills his thoughts and feelings to this doctor, especially his feelings about a girl. He’s known her for years, and they’ve been best friends forever. My brother was in love with her, and still loves her (as a friend), but feels like she keeps flirting with him. So he told his therapist this, and the therapist got this idea that my brother is basically a stalker and has delusions. Which, I feel is very much not true. I spend an obscene amount of time with my brother—I’ve seen he and the girl interact. He never sees her except by chance because we live in a small city. She DOES give mixed signals, and my brother is very level headed about it all. But the doctor is convinced that my brother is delusional and in love with her, and has even had me come in for a visit to ask me about him. He recently had the girl come in as well, and told her that my brother is stalking her and may harm her, and claimed to my brother that he broke confidence because he believes my brother is a threat. This is all INSANE to me, especially because I think the doctor seems to exaggerate everything—when I was there he would say things like “that’s very autistic of you” and told my brother he seems like he has Aspergers, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Anyway, after his most recent visit, the therapist is now threatening to take away my brother’s medication (vyvanse and prozac) if he doesn’t consent to being put in a ward. And we’re just. Flabbergasted. And my brother is freaked out, because this man just told his best friend that he’s been stalking her (which he literally HASNT been) and now she’s blocked him. Which is fine, because to be frank my brother wasn’t wanting to be friends with her anymore because of the mixed signals thing, but is understandably frustrating that this man just told a complete lie about his mental health. It’s just. Insane. And we have no idea what to do, because this man is basically trying to force my brother into a ward.

Tldr; my brother’s therapist is threatening to take away my brothers medicine if he doesn’t admit himself into a psych ward, and broke confidentiality to ruin a friendship of his based on false assumptions. Is there a way to fix this? Are there more concrete rules to patient confidentiality to try and get justice for him breaking it?",28Feb2020,1
77,"Hey all, 

So recently I made the decision that I wanted my girlfriend to me more than just my girlfriend and I want to propose to her. I already have her parents and her brother's permission to do so, and thankfully the stuff she likes isn't very expensive, so I would need to save maybe 600$ at the most.

Problem is, we share finances (she can see the activity in my bank account and vice versa) so if I were to save up any more money than usual she'd immediately know something is up, not to mention transaction history and stuff like that.

So, if you guys have any advice in stashing away money inconspicuously, I'd greatly appreciate it.",28Feb2020,1

79,"Does anyone have problems with people messaging you out of the blue after having nothing to do with you for months or even years? How do I handle this?  


I just had an old friend message me. I haven't hung out with him for 4 years and haven't heard from him in 5 months. The reason he disappeared for those 5 months was because I confronted him about giving me a fake Steam account to add him as a friend. He came back asking how I was doing and then bragged about how he has an ""opportunity"" that will allow him to retire at age 20. I told him that ""opportunity"" sounded shady, that we haven't hung out in years and haven't spoken to him in months, and then he disappeared again.  


He was kind of strange and quiet when we first met. He announced that he was a 30 year old virgin in a group of friends thinking that this was appropriate. He's ditched me and others for the first girl he thinks he's in love with (even if the feelings aren't reciprocated). He's violated my privacy by letting others look through our messages. He has basically blamed me for the reason why him and a girl (who wasn't even into him) didn't get together. I was in a relationship with my now husband so I don't see how I'm responsible for this. Before he disappeared all he did was ask me advice about girls. He'd coax me into building his self esteem by telling him he was attractive and usually did the whole ""Oh, woe is me. I'll be lonely forever and I don't understand why."" routine. It got to the point where we didn't even hang out or talk as friends anymore and it was obnoxious. I did confront him about this because I felt like he was only around for me to build him up and that we weren't friends anymore. Of course, he disappeared after that too.  


I've tried to just move on when he disappears, but then he comes back and acts like nothing happened. It still kind of bothers me because we used to be pretty good friends before all this craziness. I was always down for him when he needed me. We told each other personal things about past traumas. I don't know if I should confront him, leave it alone, keep him added as a friend, or block him. I'm sorry this is long.",28Feb2020,1

82,"My (20M) friend (20F) has recently (last week) added me on facebook with a new account she made (not anonymous, her real name and a real photo). Tonight (it's 3AM here and I'm writting all of this with a lot of mixed emotions), we started talking (on facebook) about some unimportant stuff and it quickly moved to the subject of the trust we put in our significant other.

My gf and I put an absolute trust in each other. I was telling to my friend that I could spend a night out with my friends without having to write my gf a report or even send any text for the night and that she could do exactly the same. My friend (let's call her Mary) was jokingly shocked but I asked her why she was shocked.

Long story short, her boyfriend absolutely forbids her to have any male friends and everytime she adds a guy on facebook for some group work for university she has to report to him who he is. She had to tell him that I'm gay so she could add me. She thought he would follow the same rules, turns out he interacts with girls on social media. The thing is, Mary is absolutely under his influence, she told that when she learned that he was interacting with girls on facebook, she started not texting her bf for a week, and that she felt sick doing that and that she naturally stopped eating. Even just telling me everything she lives through made her feel guilty and that she shouldn't be talking about all that.

Now let me tell you 3 short stories: My youngest sister's godmother, a friend of our aunt that we used to see a lot when we were  young, and my own godmother. They all were/are in abusive relationships. My youngest sister's godmother, one day, realised she was in such a situation that calling the police was actually the right solution. The man is now in prison. Our aunt's friend, we (including my our aunt) haven't seen her in 5 years because her husband is sort of isolating her from all her friends. My godmother is actually my gf's neighbour (my gf and I both live at our respective parent's). But my godmother's husband is an absolute narcissistic pervert who puts pressure on her. Long story short, she tries to appear as if she's living a normal life, but she tried to commit suicide in secret. Twice. I've heard it all. ""My situation is different"", ""he will change"", ""I can't control my heart"", ""what could I do without him""...

Now let's come back to Mary. I'll pass all the details but she is aware of the situation. She knows she shouldn't be under his grip in such a way that she hasn't talked to most of her friends for 3 years. But she will do anything for him. She will beg him to stay. She will obey and comply. After all, she really has no one else, does she ? I keep telling her that everything she tells me, I've heard it before. That in a few year, if she doesn't call the police right now (apparently her bf has never insulted or hit her before. My youngest sister's godmother had never been hit as well. At least in the 5 or 6 first years of the relationship) she will end up like my relatives I mentionned. But you know, there's always hope, isn't there ?

So now I have all of this evidence on our messenger convo. I really, really want to report all of this to the police. But first, I have no idea who her bf is. Then, there are no actual illegal facts mentionned since she has apparently never suffered any psychological or physical violence (I forgot to mention the fact that she suffers depression, a perfect prey for a narcissistic pervert and any abusive person). And last, I fear the repercussion on her if it doesn't go to an end. He might do bad things to her that I'll never know about. All of this is so messed up and I feel so bad because I know what is going to happen if she doesn't realise all of that herself. She will end up alone and, in the worst scenario, beaten and/or suicidal.

I was shaking and practically crying half an hour ago. What should I do ?

19 years have gone by, I have never had any sort of relationship with a girl or any other interaction. Of course I have close girl (space) friends but not the kind I would die for. I tried and failed like 4 times, having lost hope of any sort of interest.
At 17 I made a deal with myself, if at 25, I still couldn't have manage to get something, I will kill myself. It's getting awfully close tbh.

Also my health is pretty bad. I weigh prob 20kg too much, which my parents and prefect brother keep reminding me of. I'm pretty sure, after reading stuff online and doubting for months; I have some form of diabetes.

Now, I don't know what to do. I am already born with something which results in me not being able to have childeren. So even if a girl ends up being with me and I'm around idk 35.., she ofcourse will leave me. If I indeed have diabetes the chance of someone  willing to talk to me is zero, therefore no possible future.

I am really afraid to tell my parents that I think, I have diabetes. I know they will get even more dissapointed. I already cost so much money, my medicin which don't get covered by my insurance, my eyelenses, my school and college, there is so much, I can't have this diabetes thing also.

This guy is super weird and clingy and gets jealous if someone else is near X. 

My friend group has always joked around with X as friends do, but today as we were doing it, she pulled me aside and said she might be pregnant with Y's baby.

I really dont like this and she said she didnt want to do it, but she didnt want to say no. I told her to break up with Y but she still says no.

100,"I am a 17 year old male who has been having problems with interpersonal connections in the form of emotional isolation and unrequited love. Although I have a functional group of friends, (which includes a lot people who are effectively acquaintances) I don't feel like I have any intimacy with anyone in the sense that I can share my emotional struggles with them well. I do have great times and laugh with these people fairly often, and even go places with them as a group every now and then, though I don't feel any emotional intimacy in a way I can't fully understand sometimes. I often have the feeling that I rarely ever am personally sought out by any of these friends unless they need something from me. Sometimes I have tried sharing some emotions with these people but it feels like they never fully understand what I need or how I feel, sometimes they even proceed to talk about themselves instead. I even sometimes had a feeling that my struggles are not even worth sharing with them and that they are not even that big of a deal. I've also had a history of repelling people I have felt some intimacy for out of clinginess which I am deeply insecure about, has lead to a short period of depression, and still haunts me every now and then.

In terms of my experience in dating, I have had general feelings of hopeless, self-doubt and regret. It feels as though no matter how much I try to put effort into another person those feelings are never reciprocated and it has been severely hurting my self-esteem. There have been many instances in recent memory where I would try hard to get a girl's attention and develop something with them but they would seem to almost resist it completely to the point of it being toxic. I would keep trying to get their attention, believing that there is some hope in a relationship only to be continuously hurt and only give up when it is too late and the damage is done. I have even blamed myself for alot of these shortcomings which has had the matter exponentially worse. It felt as though I let so many girls just play with me like a puppet and I never had any self-respect to stop them. Throughout my life in general I have had a long history of toxic friendships that seem to have weighed me down into who I am now and have gave me a low amount of self love. I have even suffered from long periods of being a complete loner a few years ago and even a bit as younger child. 

Overall, I have had a relentless struggle with interpersonal connection in general which has seemed to have been going on forever really. All of this has led me to have issues loving myself despite anything I may have achieved in my life. If there is anything anyone could say to help me it would be greatly appreciated.",28Feb2020,1
101,"I’m in a really, really tough situation that requires me to make a difficult choice, choosing between my family and my boyfriend/his family. I’m torn, and it breaks my heart.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
I’m an Illustration major at a prestigious art college, about to graduate this-coming May. Currently I work two jobs— one on campus and one at Starbucks— that collectively add up to full time on top of my thesis class that meets twice a week for 3 hrs each. As most may know, art college is hella expensive and almost impossible to do without student loans (not to mention someone to help you with them and cosign). On top of the traditional 4-years, I also took an additional year becuase I had to medically withdraw (worst depression/anxiety episode to date). I reapplied the following semester and changed my major in the other half of my Sophomore year. I needed to take the necessary classes to catch up. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 2 years now. We’ve talk all the time about marraige, and are excited for what our future holds together. However, his situation is rough, as he is here under his parents’ E-2 Visa. He recently got approved for his Student Visa, but his time is still limited here in the US unless he keeps taking filler classes. Though the situation is unfortunate, we do genuinely love each other— and in getitng married, he will also be able to gain US citizenship. My parents do not see it that way, and frequently make their belief clear that he and his family are using me.  They want me to toss my relationship to the side and focus on moving where the money is. But they don’t want to accept the fact that I prioritize our relationship just as much as getting a job in my field. There were concerns from my parents about him pressuring me into marraige earlier on in the realtionship— but we’ve been together for a good while now. And now that he got his Student Visa, the pressure is off. Marraige will come eventually, but we’re both content working harder than ever, fueled by the dream of living a happy life together. He works hard with his dad’s business all week, while I work my jobs all week. My parents are greatly opposed to this, and claim that I will be much happier if I move home with them until I find an art job.

Sometime late last year, my parents convinced me to revoke the grace period on the previous loans, and soon my federal student loans are going to kick in as well, shortly after I graduate. I won’t have my additional source of income from the college job anymore once I graduate, and even if I switch to full-time at Starbucks, the 40-hrs aren’t guranteed. I need to find a steady source of income during the week, while keeping up with Starbucks on weekends— all to be able to keep up with paying these loans. As such, I need to decide what I’m going to do about my living situation when May rolls around.

THE ISSUE:
With the above things mentioned, this brings me to the issue which I desperately need advice on... do I move back home wtih my parents? Or do I move in with my boyfriend and his family?

In staying with my parents, I would not need to pay rent. I would have to be jobless for a while until I find a job there, or an art job somewhere else, however. I would also be reunited with my emotional support cat, Cosmo— which I had to give up and leave with my parents due to my boyfriend’s family not permitting it in the home when I lived with them before. But I would be stuck living in my parents’ basement, in a home with two parents who constantly (and have always) guilt tripped me about “how much they paid &amp; sacrificed for me regarding college”, how “my father traveled halfway around the world to adopt me”, how “choosing to take a break from art for a year would be like spitting in their face and everything they worked for”. They also constantly compare me to my closest college friend/other friends who recently graduated and got a high-paying job in CA not even a month afterwards, and say how I am wasting my time in trying to maintain the relationship when I SHOULD be going where the money is. They forget that I’m not in the same situation as my other friends. Unlike them, I have a relationship with a man that I prioritize just as much, if not more. I am perfectly content with working a normal, non-art job for a year or so while keeping my eye out for art opportunities in the future. I am just so burnt out, and feel that going straight into the industry would be a bad move on my part. My parents invalidate my feelings by brushing them off, or somehow redirecting blame whenever they might be in the wrong. I have always been afraid to tell them anything, because they ALWAYS blow up at me and guilt trip, make me feel like scum of the earth. Because of that, I’ve become a habitual liar when it comes to telling them anything. I feel like a piece of shit trying to make individual decisions for myself. They always need to have the final say, and feel the need to control my life. I am 23 fucking years old. 

In staying with my boyfriend and his family, I would need to pay minimal rent. I would be able to continue working at Starbucks while looking for another job on top of that. I would not have my cat with me. But I would not have to deal with my emotionally abusive and pressuring parents. Most importantly, I would be with my boyfriend and a family who loves and supoorts me without that kind of pressuring and guilt tripping. I have no doubt that my parents truly love me, but they have a terrible, toxic way of showing it. And they fail to fucking realize how damaging their actions are, even when I try opening up to them about it. I feel like my individual growth is severely stunted by them, and it takes a huge toll on my self esteem. I love them, but can’t stand being around them more than I have to because of the reasons I mentioned above. They won’t accept family counseling together, and they are “always right” when it comes to knowing what’s best for me. What about what I think what’s best for me? They don’t care about what I want. It’s like they’re trying to live their life through me, and compensate for their failures when they were my age. I’m the first in our immediate family to graduate college— let alone even go to college. Saying I don’t want to go back home for the forseeable future is a huge understatement.


... I apologize for this being so long. I am just under an enormous amount of pressure right now, and am so scared for what the future holds. I am so, so lost. Every day is a struggle just getting up in the morning and pushing through the day knowing I have to make such a huge decision in my life. 😰 Please, please help me.",28Feb2020,1

106,"I live with my grandfather, and for the last 3 years I have lived there rent free with no problems at all. However for the last 2 months I have had so much anxiety to the point where I just cant take it anymore. He had a ceiling that may have contained asbestos and he had a cheap laborer come and rip the thing out and I pleaded with everyone to test it first for asbestos and my parents and the laborer seemed like they didnt care. I then decided to move in with my parents for like a week while the laborer ripped out the old plaster ceiling and replaced it with sheetrock. As soon as the laborer was done they kicked me right out and told me I had no reason to stay at there house and that there was nothing wrong with that house and that I should leave. 

Quite literally like one or two days after moving back into my grandfathers house I started having incredibly bad lung pains that I never once had before in my life. My parents said it was nothing and  that I was just being paranoid. 

I have been over there for about 2 weeks since the ceiling was ripped out and he vacuumed up with a non hepa vacuum and I just dont feel safe here.

 I have an incredible amount of room to myself at the age of 17 but at the cost of potenally exposing myself to cancer causing materials. I mean to be completely honest it sucks because the house was nice up until 2 months ago but now it has an incredible amount of water damage, potential asbestos floating around in the air, lead paint chippings, damaged windows that are rotting out and are drafty. 

Also the house has well water and the sinks and showers all turn green only a week or so after being cleaned I am putting getting the water tested on my schedule. If there is arsenic in the water then I think I am definitely gonna get out of here asap because that alone would be enough for anyone to move out. 

It just sucks and it would mean I would have to move back in with my parents at the age of 17 after years of living by myself in my grandfathers apartment which Is a lot better cosmetically then my parents house although my parents house is safer in terms of my health. 

I was living with my grandfather for free and I couldn't just go out and rent an apartment because apartments in my area are about a minimum of 5-10k a month and I just dont have that money. 

It would mean giving up a lot of things. There is no room to store my car because my parents house doesn't have room for one and it would be giving up my privacy since I have been living alone for the last 3 years and would have to deal with my parents and sister. 

My grandfathers house also had a 50k central air unit put in and my parents house doesn't have that. Infact during the summer I would have to put up with a noisy air conditioner again. 

All in all what I am asking is if you would move back with your parents in this situation or if you would stay in a nice apartment that has asbestos potentially floating around in it. 

I have already been over there since the ceiling was ripped out for about 3 weeks so if there is asbestos I was alright exposed and theres nothing I can do about it now. Not a single window was opened since the windows dont open because of the fact that they are 100 years old. I am gonna be incredibly depressed if there was asbestos in that apartment. I would have to spend the rest of my life knowing that I breathed it in for 3 weeks straight. And if there is arsenic in the water it means that I have been drinking it for 3 years straight. 

I just dont know.",28Feb2020,1

109,"

One of my friends was abused by their dad as a kid and he’s going on trial soon, so my friend is in a pretty rough place in the their life right now. One of my other friends said we should “give them something to look forward to,” which I totally agree with, but I also said that sometimes people need space and to think things over by themselves. Note, the friend in the difficult place right now usually goes quiet when things like trials or whatever come up. 

Anyway, after I mentioned giving them space, the other friend (and one other friend too) argued with me over what the one friend needed claiming that they knew what my friend needed and that we had to help them before they got to that point. 

My question is, was I in the wrong for suggesting they needed space? I also said we should figure out what they needed next time we see them, but the arguing friend said that we couldn’t wait that long. So what do I do? I feel kinda shitty about suggesting it bc they made me question whether or not I knew what was best, but at the same time, I don’t want to assume what the other friend needs?

112,"TL;DR: We've agreed not to tell her boyfriend. Thoughts?

Curious to hear Reddits advices, specifically caution I should take.
I aim to have her sign a document stating she's a primary suspect in the event of a toxic death. Is there anything else I should be concerned of aside from guilt?

Details:

Housemate arrives home extremely intoxicated (this is rare).
She brings in group of people (rare again)
They're making wild noise before I go downstairs and tell them to leave.
They don't leave.
Other awoken housemate screamed at them, a few mins later.
They all leave (including intoxicated housemate)
Intox Housemate returns with male who was with them before they all left.
They have sex downstairs and then sleep in her bedroom together.
Housemate apologises via text the next day- I ignore.
We meet in kitchen few days later, she apologised for noise.
I tell her it's not me she need apologize to.
She shows confusion.
I ask if shes on break with long-term boyfriend
Her reply ""no, why?""
Tell her not to play dumb,
She plays dumb or genuinely doesn't remember.
""Tell [Boyfriends Name] soon"" I say,
She's visibly panicked and appears confused.
I tell her what I've just mentioned,
She starts crying and soon mentions killing herself.
She reports aloud to me ""I just text him [long-term boyfriend] 'we need to talk' ""
She keeps saying aloud ""how am I goin to tell him""
Spend next 10mins weighing options with her
We agree telling would cause more harm to him (my suggestion, not proud)
I agree not to mention to him (rare of me to be deceitful, but I believe this is best)

My mom and I have always had a hot and cold relationship, there were times where I could trust her and confided some really personal information with her. Then I started noticing she would later throw it back in my face when she got angry so I was very adamant about sharing anything with her from that point. Two years ago I had told my mom I planned on transferring jobs for a career change and that I would still help her with Bills when she needs it but I never was able to get my desired job. So fast forward to now I ended up leaving the last job I had working in a warehouse and went into security work and have been doing it for 9 months during these 9 months the rent and bills pilled up, the arguements have been getting more heated so I began looking for other positions within the company I work for to find a higher paying position around the area I was at but couldn't ,I still informed her about what was going on far as job searching but still no luck until recently I had found a position in l.a that pays more. And I told her about it before I went out and now shes pissed off.

117,"17M, High School Senior. Middle Class financial background- no qualification for financial aid/limited for scholarships

Planning to live on campus in all scenarios 

***I have no idea what I am actually asking advice for.*** But please bear with me (is that the right bear?) as I write this. I also wanna state I am very thankful for my parents and everything they have done for me. They say no matter where I choose to go they are determined to make it happen. Since the fall, my parents and I have been looking at three colleges.

College 1 - State university in my hometown that I have lived in my entire life (No acceptance decision yet)

College 2 - University across the country in an entirely different state with a completely different way of life (Accepted)

College 3 - State university in my own state, but only about 90 miles away from my hometown. (Accepted)

I feel so alone because all my friends that I actually talk to are going to the local community college and do not have to go through this. I'm not the biggest on opening up to anyone especially new people so I really do not know who to ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background on my general life situation that will affect decision:

Dad works 80 miles away, but commutes because he only works two days a week. Plans to move closer to work with my brother and mom after graduation. Brother is on the high functioning part of the autism spectrum, but basically has no plans for a life without my parents. He is currently studying at the local community college where he plans to transfer to a more prestigious university in-state. Because of the way he his, he can be quite misguided and well, delusional at times. He is in his last year before he transfers, where he intends to major in some type of engineering. 

I graduate at the beginning of June, and my parents plan to move out of my hometown sometime in the month following (July). 

This situation in itself has already caused issues with me, because I firstly do not know where I want to go for school because all schools appeal to me greatly. Regardless of where I went, I planned on spending what could be my *last* summer in my hometown with everyone and everything I known for two reasons; everyone I know is here and I would like to spend more time with them before I leave, and also my birthday is during the summer and I haven't had a good one in a little while so it would be nice to spend it with people who care. 

My parents are heavily advocating for college 3 for a number of reasons. First is cost, its very manageable to the point where I possibly would not even have to look into getting a loan. The second is distance, because where they plan to move will only be a 45min to 1hr drive away if needed. But its also far away enough from my hometown and my parents that I will be able to grow as a person. 

I am very much a fan of college 3, in fact I could see myself really going there up until now, because now, I have actual options, and I didn't really have a lot of confidence going into my applications. 

I just received my acceptance from college 2 and now I do not know what to think or how to think. When I think of life there, I think of how great it could be and the quintessential college experience. I think I could really see myself going there, and it would be everything I want and more. Its almost 1,800 miles away, and because of that, I would be forced to paying out of state tuition. The net cost calculator put it well above our price point, but my parents are very optimistic and as I said before, will do ensure I am happy with my decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats just the college side of things.

I run track at my high school and am currently in the process of transitioning events because of my lack of progress in my original events. I have made relative progress, but adding practice back into the mix, coupled with my own personal competitive drive, has added stress to my life. 

I am also on the student council. Although my position is one of relative unimportance, I've displayed my dedication to the student body to the point where my advisor has given me a great amount more of responsibility. I chose to take this on because its something I enjoy and has been a great experience for me. Our school was entered into a competition between other schools comparing their fan student sections and their level of 'hype'. There's a really good chance we won, and as I put a lot of the work together for our student sections this year, I feel like I carry a lot of that responsibility as well. All of this adds more to my plate. 

I'm somewhat stressing about prom because its getting closer and I would like to take someone who is genuinely happy to go with me, and vice versa. 

My grades are fine, as I chose to take easier classes after challenging myself 10th and 11th grade.

***So if I could perhaps get some clarity on how to clear my head with all of this stress so I can make a good decision? Or even advice on which college you may think be better for me.***

118,"Tl:dr I am in love with a great friend of mine who I sort of dated a while ago but broke up do to her not feeling the same way and I haven’t gotten over her


So let’s start at the beginning back in around July of 2019 I met a girl who we’ll call “Amanda”. So Amanda and I became great friends right off the bat and I eventually asked her out. She didn’t say no but didn’t really say yes but we were basically a thing. We both liked each other and it was great. Later though after school started we broke up I had found out from a friend that she didn’t like me like that anymore so I ended it. We kept being friends and eventually around November I realized I still liked her I told her knowing that in order to keep being friends I had to take a break. After a while we continued where we left off and recently I found out to fit in with another girl we will call “Sarah” she was shit talking me behind my back. And Sarah and I have always hated each other she’s an A class bitch she is self centered and I would expect nothing less of her but I had thought Amanda was different and even though she has claimed she didn’t mean any of what she said (I found out from another friend what had happened) it still doesn’t really matter what she did basically killed me. Ok and so what made this sting even more is I had just realized that again I still liked her. I sort of started to forgive her recently and those feelings are once again coming back. Just for information amanda and I really get each other like in ways others don’t we have this really strong connection that is sort of why I started to forgive her also I can tell how bad she feels but I digress. So basically now I’m stuck with 2 questions do I forgive her fully and move on? and do I tell her how I’m still in love with her and possibly risk ruining our friendship by giving her a reason to never be able to fully trust that I don’t still like her?",28Feb2020,1

He eventually breaks up with me but even after that he still told me he still ""loved"" me but i just told him if he would distance himself from me for a few days so i could just try to move on.

This weekend my clise friend invited both me and my ex to her birthday. Durinf this whole time i felt bery uncomfortable that i wasnt talking to him so that night i told him i still liked him and would like to work things out and to that he agreed.

About a week after the whole breakup, it turns out that my close friend liked him but she told me she wouldn’t pursue him since i still liked the dude. We’ll call this close friend Startish. 

One day after Startish told me about her crush on my ex she asked me if it would be okay to start dating him since it turns out he liked her. Let me remind you its been one week since we broke up. I tell her that i still liked my ex but if they really wanted to date that i shouldnt be involved in that decision. At the time i believed that this was the best thing to say since i didnt want to interfere with their feelings and i wanted them both to be happy.

Later that day they started dating. Turns out that one week after we broke up, my ex was talking to 4 different girls including me, his other ex, Startish and another close friend of mine. I was incredibly furious finding out this information because in the process he hurt a very close friend of mine. 

Starfish and my ex have been dating for about 3 weeks and I learned to realize just because they were happy didnt mean that i was. I started to think if she even was my friend because she kept on getting my hopes up when me and my ex broke up. Startish would say things along the lines of ya’ll are probably gonna get back together just give it time.

I give all baths, all feedings including getting up in the middle of the night with him. I am a stay at home mom while my husband works 40 hours a week. I also do all house work and car work and take care of both of our dogs) 

I’m at a loss as what to do for this. I can’t sleep at night because I feel terrible for letting my child scream the way he does. It goes on for two hours or more. I get that children need to be able to comfort themselves at some point but my husband doesn’t do very much as far as actual parenting. He just tells me how things should done. Help?",28Feb2020,1
125,"Hi, I'm uncertain if I should post this here or on r/relationship_advice, but I'll try here first anyway. 

Some background: me (F28) and BF (M29) has been together for a little more then four years, and lived together for about three of them. This is perfectly normal in our country (one of the Scandinavian). We're both in the process of writing our masters in different fields, but there will still be a few years of work full time before we buy an apartment together and maybe consider marriage. 

We've previously talked about if we want kids in the future. Me bf loves children and I really see that he'll be an amazing father some day. And he also really want kids some time in the future. Me, I love my nieces and nephews, but am not really thrilled of other children. So I've always been thinking that wether or not I'll have kids will depend on the guy I end up with. If he really wants it: I'll be happy with kids, if he doesn't: I'll be happy without. My bf has known this for quite some time.

Recently I've started thinking that this might not be the case anymore, I'm more and more leaning towards being happier without children. 

What I'm seeking advice regarding is this: how do I best approach this topic? And, how long is it ok for me to avoid talking about it? We're in a really good place, and I don't want to mess it up, but I also don't want to keep going for too long without telling him, as I don't think that's fair to him.

129,"Hi all,

So I have been dating a friend of mine for 1 month now. We have been friends for around 4 months. Most days the past month we have been sleeping together.

Three days ago she asked if she could sleep at my place, sure. She was quite tipsy and we drank a bit more while watching a movie. During this time I noticed she was texting a guy I introduced her too on WhatsApp. I know the guy likes this girl and think she is prettt. The way she looked at her phone while doing this seemed a bit off and she was archiving the chat (like sliding it away from the home screen). Furthermore she suddenly went to the toilet for around 10 minutes and she took her phone with her. This was all out of the ordinary behaviour and made me feel very uncomfortable. We went to sleep and there was not intimacy at all even though I tried to start something in the morning.

Then yesterday we chatted a bit more on WhatsApp but at the end of the night she ignored my very basic message. 

Two days ago she gave me her instagram and yesterday morning I suddenly noticed that she started following this guy on Instagram. Even though she didn’t bother to reply to my message in the meantime.

Yesterday  we had a date planned for which I had already purchased the tickets. She still had not replied to my earlier message but I wanted to know what the plans were for tonight so I suggested to meet up at around 6. She again ignored this message, while being online many times.

I just called her and she said she wasn’t sure if she could make it tonight. She also said I could not pick her up at her place because it was more practical to meet at the cinema. For all of our dates outside the house so far I have picked her up. Then she also noted that we could not sleep together because she had to get up early in the morning. I said I thought I was strange but ok whatever. We decided to meet up a bit later at around 7.

15 mins before we were supposed to meet she cancelled on me saying she had not finished her tasks. She said maybe we can meet up on Tuesday. I expressed my dislike of this whole thing and asked her if something was wrong. She said nothing was wrong.


This whole situation is making me very uncomfortable and I am not sure what to do. I am bit obsessive in this situation because I just feel i cant trust it

I am a bit angry at her but also afraid to lose her.

Today I didn’t send her any message. She also didn’t send me any message. I was expecting an apology to be honest because that is what I would do in such a situation her shoes, also again I had already purchased the tickets worth $50. Not that I care about the money but just in principle.",28Feb2020,1
132,"I'm confused about the meaning of some strong chemistry I have with a friend. We have a thousand inside jokes, we tease each other a lot, we mimic each other's body language and speech a lot, etc ... She also told me that we click/vib a lot. I'm a lesbian and she's straight.

Obviously, I like her, and as I've never had this kind of connection without some sort of romantic undertones so I don't understand that she feels this chemistry as well but that she treats it like a platonic thing. 

Have you ever had platonic chemistry? Is it a real thing? I don't want to bother her with the fact that I like her but on the other hand I wouldn't want to miss my shot, as small as it might be.

134,"So back in the first quarter my GPA was 3.8 which is really good. I was feeling confident and I attribute it to the warm and sunny weather. 2nd quarter it started getting cold and dark out and my GPA has dropped to a 2.1. 3rd quarter rolls around and it's the middle of winter and I am struggling with severe seasonal depression. It is hard to focus on anything I do and all I can think about is how fucking awful this weather is (I live in Ohio and nothing good comes from here) my GPA is hovering around a 1.3 rn and I am at the end of myself. I genuinely try in school but nothing helps. I also have a job which makes it hard to get study time in, but without my job I would probably have killed myself because I also feel like I don't have a purpose but having a job gives me a sense of accomplishment.

135,"I currently work as a paraprofessional for severely autistic children in a public elementary school. Some of these children are extremely tough cases and have really aggressive behaviors. I attended a training on proper restraint training and asked questions and gave very basic examples and ask the trainer what she would do. She suggested having a meeting with all the trained staff and admin in my building which I thought would be great and helpful. Today I went into work and was blind sided by a meeting with the principal and assistant principal stating that they received emails saying that my co worker and myself were making claims that our school is doing everything wrong. This was absolutely not the case but the principal began interrogating me and not believing anything I said. He also brought up other issues regarding things I’ve voiced my concern and pretty much stating it’s not my place. I cried the entire meeting, offered to email whoever to clear up any misunderstanding but they told me no and to just forget about it. I have cried all night since the moment I left work. Meetings similar to this have occurred earlier in the school year making me feel horrible.

140,"I have posted this in a few other places, but I need all the advice I can get.

Alright, here we go. For context, I (21F) am an English major at a pretty large university in the Midwest- I am graduating in May. The class we’re talking about is an African American literature class. The professor is black, and two other students are. The rest of us are white. My professor very obviously favors the students of color (which is not what I’m here to talk about, I don’t mind this), and often contests what the white students say, just for context.

For the class we had to do a very short (two to three page) literary analysis of “The Mulatto” by Victor Sejour talking about heroism in the story. For more context, “The Mulatto” is known as being one of the first well-known pieces of literature by a person of color. I chose a quote from the passage he gave us, and elaborated on why the main character (a black man) was the hero of the story, and the significance of this at the time as an anti-slavery narrative. I also talked about the differences in the ways that black and white heroes were (and are) portrayed differently and how it relates to this story and discrimination, using examples he explicitly used in class- I cited his lecture here. The class is about African American heroes in literature, so this seemed on par.

Today, I get an email saying that he cannot pass my paper because “it advances a racial logic at direct odds with the obvious intent of the author, which is a critique of slavery.” He said it was “inappropriate” and that I was insinuating that slavery is not bad, and that the other character (a literal r*pist) is the hero. He also asked “Perhaps it is because you have never spoke up or asked a question in class, and have harbored certain notions?” I have really bad anxiety, and it’s registered with our disabilities office, so it’s really not that easy for me to do those things. I do go to class, and actively listen. He also said “When patterns arise, even subtle ones, I often see the subtleties.” I don’t know if he read into it wrong, but there is really nothing in it other than a literary analysis of race and heroism, which is what the paper was supposed to be about. We have emailed back and forth a bit, and he just keeps accusing me of this. 

Here’s the thing. I have read through this paper over and over. I would accept his judgement if he said something like how I expressed my ideas poorly or if he asked for clarification, but I honestly think it’s a pretty good paper. I’m not afraid for other people to read it, if they have to, because it’s just really not doing the things he said. I would bring it to other professors, deans, whoever. I’m a progressive, politically active young person, and I understand internalized racism is a real thing. I would never, ever turn in a racist paper. I’m scared to do anything else in this class, and I’m scared to write more papers. I’ve been trying to be sensitive and understanding (I responded by saying I’d love to meet up, so I can learn and understand his point of view), but I think I might need to talk to someone else. I would not be opposed to sending it to anyone on here for opinions, that’s how sure I am about it.

I need this class to graduate in May. I’m meeting with him in office hours tomorrow, and I really don’t know what to say or do. How should I approach this? 

TLDR; my professor accused me of being racist in one of my papers, what do I do now?",28Feb2020,1
141,"So I'm a 21 year lesbian but at the time i was dating him i was sure i was just bisexual.

That he wanted to be with me even if I felt nothing wich at that point it was starting to make me uncomfortable. I told him no and the thing ended there. The relationship ended good so to speak, we continued as friends. However a few months after the breakup he keeps sending me messeges like ""miss u &lt;3, i love u, ur the best person ever"" etc. The first time i got them I told him to not do it because it made me feel uncomfortable. He kept doing it and stopped only after I told him I was gonna block him if he continued. He apologized and promised to not do it again. He still sends me this kind of messeges but more tamed. Things like ""I just wanted to remind you that your the best person ever"" and honestly at this point I dont know if I should consider this as a friendly reminder or just him trying to get back.

142,"I met a guy in a college class back in September. We'll call him John. He is funny, progressive, talented and very beautiful. 
At the same time I was taking a class with a girl who I went to high school with. We'll call her Mary. She is generous, eloquent, loving, and also, very beautiful.
I didn't think it big when he told me he liked her. I had no reason to think she liked him back. After all, she was affectionate with everyone. I was wrong.
Last weekend, they got together after a painstaking month of flirtation.
From anyone else's perspective, my side of the story is probably irrelevant, but I'm hurting a lot lately. I'm left wondering where I stand. My heart is caught in the crossfire. I'm in fight or flight mode.
When I met John, I liked him immediately. There was no build-up to my attraction, it was instant.
With Mary, I've always admired her. But it was her kindness, openness, and passion that won me over. I don't know anyone like her; who will let me be selfish without consequence.
Mary stole my first kiss during the week before she got with John. He watched it happen. He hugged me, smiling when I told him it was my first.
I don't know what to do with these feelings because, frankly, I'm not sure what they really are (jealousy, loneliness, FOMO, etc.). If I was a good friend I would grin and bare it for them. But I can only do that for so long. If I was more certain, I would pursue it. But I don't know what they want (or maybe I do...) I just know I'm too afraid of losing them both as friends than to push my luck.

145,"New at a job, moved to be closer to nature, and recently went on training with the safety manager and a worksite supervisor. I was sent because I ran the same training internally at my old job for 4 years. I am the youngest of the three, but had direct reports in my expertise for 5 years prior to this work. So not new to the industry.

Neither of these people are my direct supervisor. 

Biggest employer in the are and thinks it does everything world class... It doesn't. It's not the worst, but I have already made large improvements in my area that co-workers still thank me for months later. More things to fix than I could do in a lifetime. 

During the training, Safety manager openly argues with the trainer (who knows way more on the subject) for almost every item. Nothing rude or angry. But a lot of: ""That's not what we do. We are better. "" (When in fact we are not). We all join in the conversation, I often take the side of the trainer. Its a Canadian standard. It's not law. But enforceable through non compliance. People could die. I don't think they will in our case immediately, as most of the field crew are 30+ year people. But we openly disregard safety equipment the standard calls for, could lead to injury with new employees. 

Get back from training, I didn't see anything coming. Safety manager has talked to my boss. Said I acted like a ""know it all"" and openly disrupted the entire course. New boss is angry and says that I shouldn't expect a promotion or raises if other people don't like me. Suggests personality training. Suggests if people are at risk. To make an alliance of employees on my side before asking for change.

Kicker is I still need to develop the training with the safety manager. And I know he won't want to follow anything we learned at the class. 

My thoughts are between two places. 

1. I have a comprehensive list of things we need to decide on. And I was going to let the safety manager make every call against the standard. Escalate as necessary.

2. Let the safety manager run the show and just shut up. See what happens. But basically don't speak unless spoken to.

3. Any suggestions?

I have already discussed with my wife. If the company makes large safety issues that risk lives I will remove myself from the training roll out on ethical grounds. I can't tell employees to do things I know are not as safe as they should be. We are okay with me getting fired if it goes south from there. Though not what I want.

146,"A couple days ago I took the bus home after shopping, I was sitting in a horizontal double seat while there was a young child that looked to be about 7 years old seated in vertical 3 person seat. He sat on the seat closet to me.

I just thought it was odd that he kept looking at my direction and the contents in my bags. Later he got up and walked beside me and began to eye me hard, again I thought this was weird so I looked at him a little and turned my head to the left.

149,"So i've been having problems with my social life. I'll start from the beginning. When i was younger in primary school , I wasn't a very popular kid because I was considered crazy. It was really hard because I was the kid, that needed social interaction and it would make me sad on a daily basis. Then one day I met this girl, and we became close friends. Then she started hanging out with other people, and I would get crazy jealous. She said a hurtful thing and I would freak out over it. I considered her a bad friend, and my parents agreed with me. So I would ignore her and minimize all interaction with her. This hurt her and for a long time, I considered her as the bad friend, the one who was the reason for the hatred and revoltion inside of me. 

Coming to the present, I moved to another school and met 2 of my best friends, that I very much regret hurting them. During our friendship, Whenever I would  hang out with them, I would always get weird feelings that, they hated me or only hung out with me, out of pityness. I showed them something funny on my phone, and they got concerned to as to why I would share that video (be aware its not a violent video or anything inappropriate.) I got super mad and started feeling resentment towards them. I always struggled with letting my emotions out, so when I told them that I wanted them to stop being overprotective of me, they got mad. I don't think they understand. After that our relationship was put on a big strain, and I started wondering why they wouldn't hang out with me anymore. After that, they would sit with the upperclassmen and I couldn't sit with them anymore because I felt like I was getting in the way of their friendship. I felt like a third-wheeler. Again the feeling of hatred comes back and I start thinking i don't need them anymore. This continued for like a year and half. Now it all comes back and i realize that it's all my fault. I couldn't keep a simple relationship because of my past experiences and my ego. they've moved on, but they don't want to my friend anymore, at least one of them doesn't want to.

I am currently filling out the application for a NASA internship opportunity, because I know that would be an insanely awesome experience. Also, my mom happened to previously work at the AMES center for NASA, so she has a lot of really good friends there. Her best friend there is pretty high up, and she told my mom that she could basically make an internship position for me, let me stay in her house for the summer (10 weeks for the duration of the internship), and commute with her to work every day. She also said that the internship would be involving several of the things that I am especially interested in, so it’s basically, a golden opportunity with my name on it. 

However cool this opportunity is, though, I’m not  too keen on giving up my very last high school summer with my best friends, many of which I will probably never see again. I should mention that I don’t live in California, so I would have to fly out there for the summer and be completely isolated from my home. 10 weeks leaves only about 2 weeks leeway for being back at home, and even that depends on where I end up going to college (which I have not decided yet). I know this internship could put me on a track towards being an astronaut, but I can’t help but think I would just dread being away from every one of my friends for the whole summer.

She doesn't go out with her friends anymore, she's practically moved in with her boyfriend &amp; is super concerned with 'playing house'. For example, for Christmas all she wanted was new bedding &amp; furniture for their bedroom, something that's not sp typical for a 15 year old.

161,"Summary is in bullets below. Bagel shop stalker appeared nearby my work today. Important to note I work in a busy metropolitan US city, and my office is located in one of the most trafficked areas of the city (financial district):

-about 8 months ago a man (40ish) started chatting with me (25f at the time) at the bagel shop just with a general good morning while I was adding milk to my coffee.
-see him there again a week or two later and he acknowledges me, I think it’s a little weird but I think of it as overly friendly and he just thought it was funny we ran into each other again.
-next few visits, appears very desperate to talk to me. These visits are all a week apart minimum. So this bagel shop is not somewhere I go every day by any means. 
- I start placing myself in places where I think he can’t say hi to me or get my attention, on a stool facing the window for example. He exits via the entry door just so he can wave to me outside.
-the next time he circles the area I’m sitting in like a shark desperately trying to get my attention. He eventually realizes it won’t work and sits at the table right in front of mine so I have no choice but for him to greet me.
-I stop going for months. Decide to go one day hoping he’s gone, there he is. Says “he hasn’t seen me in a while” and dumps a ton of personal information on me. (Why would we see each other? We’re strangers)
-again stopped going for months, recently I went and when I went to exit there he was opening the door for me, this was Friday.
-Today I exit my office building which is not exactly next to the coffee shop. When I round the side of my building there he is. Ready to talk to me and not seeming surprised the way you would think someone would be, I.e. “what are you doing here?”. Instead he asked me where I like to go to lunch. So creepy.

Based on all of the bagel shop interactions I find running into him to be very alarming. I had already dubbed him my “*bagelshopname* stalker” and even have a text from my visit Friday of me saying I hope he isn’t there.

Did he follow me to my office and is now loitering outside or was it really a coincidence?

Tl:dr: coffee shop stalker has potentially gone to real stalker after appearing outside my office building.",28Feb2020,1
162,"I recently took a work trip to another country and was connected with an extremely helpful person who drove me around (I paid for gas and ALL meals, I didn't put them out financially at all) and showed me the town and connected me with people. 

I might have said that if they're ever in the US, I'll hook them up, but just as vague as that. 

Now they're coming to the US for two weeks and are staying in a nearby big city and have asked for me to help them set up meetings with the president of the organization I work for and for a meeting with my own branch. I do not have a car, so I would not be able to pick them up, drive them around, or even show them around (I HAVE to be at my job 9-5; I can't just leave for hours during the day like they did when I visited there). 

I know this person is going to ask for funding for their own project and/or a job, and I REALLY don't want to put my colleagues out like that. I also DO NOT want to connect this person with the president of my organization... I am not on those terms with the president nor do I feel comfortable vouching for my friend (I think they are going to again, solicit funds and make big ""asks"", which ARE NOT deliverable now). And despite the help this acquaintance gave me, I don't think they're a really good person... not someone I want to be the connector for. 


I am SUCH a people pleaser... I didn't think they'd ever come to the US let alone be in my neck of the woods.. I would really hate to let my acquaintance down after all they did for me, but I just can't deliver. I'm feeling EXTREMELY guilty and anxious about what they're going to think of me or say about me if I don't make these things happen. 

What would you guys do? How would you tell the acquaintance? Would you be honest on not delivering or make something up? 

I'm taking this as a huge learning lesson to NEVER make even vague offers again unless I'm 100% sure it's doable. 

TLDR; made some vague offers that I can't keep good on. Person I made offers to did A LOT for me and is super helpful. Feeling guilty and anxious for not reciprocating and don't know how to tell the person.

163,"Hi all, I'm feeling a little out of my element here so I hope you all can give me a hand please.

I'm getting ready to go on a 10 day vacation (to another country- I'm from the US for context) in a few months that I'm totally stoked about, but my entire family and my new partner are coming with me.  In fact, my parents and siblings have paid for my share of the vacation to celebrate my birthday, but a bigger part of me feels like they just wanted to do something big and fun for me when my birthday rolled around last year because they felt bad about my last relationship falling apart so disastrously.

So, Reddit, I need some advice on a few things, could you please help me?

1- first and foremost, I'd like to thank my family for doing this for me, but we are going to an all inclusive place.  what the heck can I do for them while we're there to show real appreciation?
2- my new partner and i have been together for only a couple of months and this is the longest we will ever be together at a single time (and we're going to be with my family all of the days!)  we do have our own room at the hotel away from them, but I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse. any advice here is appreciated.
3-I'm really a homebody introvert. How do I manage the anxiety of being so far from home and away from my pets for so long while still having a good time?
4- how do I even pack for this??  the place we are going to is a more southern country so it will be warmer, but besides a couple of bottles of sun screen I have no idea what I'm doing.  the last vacation I was on was over 15 years ago.

165,"I’ve been in a pretty serious relationship with this guy since this past summer. We’ve been pretty open with each other about our past relationships and failures. 

However, today he said something that worried me. I started talking about how I had a dream that he cheated on me and he was like “oh I’d never cheat.” But then he was like “there was this one instance though...” He had been dating this girl and they both got drunk at a party. Then he gets a text from this other girl saying to come over to her house. For some godforsaken reason he then goes to this other girl’s house and cuddles with her in her bed though he said “nothing happened” between them. He never told his girlfriend about what he did.

This might seem minor but it upset me because my ex did a very similar thing to me that my current bf did to his ex. I was shocked that he said this because he did not seem like the type of person to cheat. He then tells me that he wouldn’t cheat on me because he “has no reason to” which kinda rubbed me the wrong way. 

He’s leaving for the military in a bit and right now he has no job. He says he sits at home all day but sometimes he turns his location off for no reason. I also found on his phone that he sent hearts and a flirty text message to this girl he’d dated briefly before and we had an argument about it. 

Should I be worried that he is a cheater and might cheat on me??

TLDR: my bf sorta cheated on his ex and he displays some cheater-ish behavior and i don’t know if I should be worried.",28Feb2020,1
167,"So I’m really proud of my weight bc I used to be very underweight (not bc of an eating disorder or anything, I’ve just always been a skinny girl) so I worked my ass off to gain weight and I’m now sitting at a healthy and normal weight for my height. But ever since I’ve gained all this weight, my mom (and actually my entire family) have been telling me I’m fat and need to lose weight and it’s pissing me off.

My mom makes mean comments about my weight at every chance she gets. Whenever I walk into a room, her face wrinkles with disgust and she’ll say something like “eww my eyes” and she always calls me tubby, fatass, porky, etc. she makes fun of my “fat” stomach and tells me that the reason I can’t get a boyfriend is because I’m too fat (when the reality is i can’t get a boyfriend bc I’m too skinny since guys only want thicc girls). 

Now onto the worst part. My mom will sometimes refuse to let me eat certain things bc she says I need to lose weight. If I ask for seconds at dinner she’ll literally say no, if I ask to buy a cookie at the store she’ll say “no you’re gonna be obese.” That really fucking annoys me because I’m actually trying to gain more weight bc I still think I’m a little too skinny. My mom on the other hand thinks I need to lose TEN pounds. 

I’m really sick of her calling me fat all the time and especially mad that she doesn’t let me eat as much as I want to. I honestly think she’s delusional bc 115 pounds is NOT fat at all.

By some miracle of living in a medium sized city, my new desk neighbor is my recent ex-girlfriend's roommate. When I say recent ex-girlfriend I mean end of January breakup (relationship lasted nearly a year). The girl who now sits directly beside me five days awake has heard our arguments, been to my apartment on more than one occasion, seen and heard me cry, taken care of me while I was drunk, and likely has heard me have sex.

We were always cordial with each other and spent an incredible amount of time together over the past year because their apartment was significantly larger than mine and there was a stretch in the summer when my air conditioning did not work making being at home unbearable. My only complaint about her was that I thought she was a bit nosey and my ex mentioned more than once how the two of them ""shared absolutely everything and kept no secrets."" I have convinced myself that my now coworker knows an incredible amount about my personal life and my past relationship.

I’m 20 years old and I’ve met a girl that I plan to date as she’s very interested in me as well as I am with her. I’m done hiding my relationships because it always becomes the downfall. My mother is the main concern. I love her so much but being raised in said religion makes you date strictly within said religion.

i texted what was wrong and he said he had an anxiety attack because he got a haircut and i guess he heard his ex flirting with someone so it made it worse? thats what he told me. but like why does he care what his ex gf is saying to people. its not like 8th grade relationships are that serious. and his haircut literally looked like his hair before just less thick.

he has never had an anxiety attack before like ever. i guess maybe when his ex gf broke up with him and he started crying a lot but thats not really anxiety its more like emotional heartbreak.

i feel like he is just saying this because ive heard that people with anxiety dont like talking about it and they are embarrassed about it. he told everyone about it. i could make a documentary about it. he is also saying he cant take it anymore (i guess making people angry/sad?) and he doesnt want to hurt anyone yet he never has

i just feel like hes doing this for attention 

when his ex gf broke up with him he acted all depressed and once said he wanted to kill himself even though the only word he could describe her with was “cute” i doubt they even liked each other. now he blames her that she just wanted attention in the relationship yet no one knew about it until they broke up

kinda ranting rn because i know people with anxiety and its not something to joke about and i feel like he’s just using it to manipulate people",28Feb2020,1
198,"There is this boy (15M) in my biology class. He asked if he could join me (16M) and my friend in our group project, and for some unfortunate reason, we said yes. Keep in mind, this kid is known for being a complete douchebag (we deeply regret letting him work with us). In the past, he has made perverted comments towards other students, has made a teacher cry, and has said “rape isn’t a big deal” - which I did not find out until earlier today. 

As we were working on our presentation (around 2 days ago), he’d asked me if I have ever kissed anyone before. I said yes. 

Yesterday, as I was putting away a laptop, he goes behind me and gets very close, then starts singing sexual music DIRECTLY in my ear.  I assumed it was some sort of distasteful joke. 

Today, he got in between me and my friend, with his legs spread wide open, facing me. My friend told him to stop (he didn’t). He kept staring at me, in a very creepy way. Then, he comments on how “cute” I am (I highly doubt he is doing this because he is interested, but most likely because he knows I am bisexual and is making fun of me). He moves closer over to me, and starts to touch my arms and back. I asked him to stop, surprisingly he did. 

A few minutes later, after making more suggestive comments about me (which I do not remember because I was trying really hard to block him out), he whispers “bend over” to me. I was mortified and shaking. My friend was disturbed as were other students. 

This whole situation has been extremely anxiety-provoking for me, and I was wondering if this is considered sexual harassment - or if I’m being irrational (which is not unusual for me). 

If so, I don’t know how to bring it up to my school’s administration. There have been sexual assault and harassment cases before, but our principle just assures us she’ll take care of it, but this behavior continues to occur. I really don’t think they’d care if I told them, so is there a point? What do I do?",28Feb2020,1
200,"I am in design school and we are evaluated in large part due to our ability to collaborate. For our term project we were assigned groups
of 4. While my project has been going well work wise, it appears as if one of my group members is trying to cut me out. For example, we had to something animation related and I have experience in that. However she went behind my back and started doing my work with her friend on the team, then to ask a teacher later for animation help. When I confronted her what she was doing she couldn’t answer. Then I asked her what I could do to help, and told her what I’d been doing and said her friend was doing. She also didn’t say what she thought I should do.  Essentially there is lack of leadership and delegation, and every time I do something she overwrites it. The other guy in the group likes her, but will go with anything.  

I’m really not sure what to do because the professor WILL ask our contributions and they’ve essentially cut me out of it. I am not sure what to do in terms of talking to the professor either because I don’t want them to think I can’t get along with people or assert myself or worse, haven’t done much.",28Feb2020,1

203,"I've been in and out of therapy for years, and growing up I developed a very avoidant attachment style on top of this. It is hard for me to functionally form words at all and I easily slip into a dissociative state before I feel I have a chance to identify a lot of hard feelings.

I want to bring up the assault because it affects how I have always felt about sex, being touched in general and, along with having an avoidant attachment style/dissociative issues, I tend to not notice how or when triggers arise until it is too late. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months and he is more supportive and understanding then anyone I have met before. When issues arise we actually get to talk things out respectfully and work towards a solution. 

I'm conflicted because I have such a hard time identifying my triggers from the abuse, I don't want them to even exist at all, and how i show affection/my libido changes so often. I am so worried that in starting this conversation, I worry him more then he should have to, or that it will be seen as an excuse for really just me not being a good Girlfriend? 

Typing this all out it seems so strange now but those are really the feelings that prevent me from feeling I can make that step. Intimacy is something I don't want to sacrifice, and I'm not used to having conversations about something I want to just be easy and natural. I don't want the conversation to cast any doubt about my attraction to him, because I have such a burning desire to be with him.

204,"
I live in a dorm with my roommate. This is her second year at college, my first. We met on the app that pairs roommates together, and we have all of the same interests and same sense of humor. But before about like Christmas time, she told me she’s moving off of campus. Her old roommate got permission to move off the sorority house and they just signed a lease to an apartment together. I took the news really, really harshly. She reassured me multiple times that it had nothing to do with me, that her and her roommate had been planning this since they started college, and she doesn’t think me and her roommate would get along. But honestly, the fact that I’m the one that has a job, and my roommate didn’t even like consider how sad/upset that I might be since she doesn’t want to live with my anymore might feel. Like don’t get me wrong, I was an asshole about it sometimes. But she even referred to me as “manipulative”, which I don’t think is a fair assessment. I was definitely a bitch, but most of the time I wasn’t necessarily mean but I was really hurting, and she doesn’t seem to empathize how that might feel. I’m very confrontational so if I feel hurt I talk about it. When we had this talk, I cried, apologized a lot, said I’d be a better friend, and that I’m always on her side. But she’s been weird these few days and said “I just need time to like, process things, you know?” And I just hate that she’ll never see me the same way again. I don’t want to keep bringing the issue up but I just hate that she views me this way, when I don’t feel like I’ve expressed it’s her fault and a bad thing she’s moving, but it hurts and I always feel cast aside by her new roommate. It’s something I’ve brought up before and she really doesn’t see that she doesn’t do anything with me, but does a lot of stuff with her. I don’t know. She isn’t channeling the feeling of feeling unimportant in a life that’s important to yours. Sometimes I think she may not be the friend I thought she was if she can’t see the things I do right, and the times I’ve been there for her, and only sees the bad things. It makes me feel unwanted, unappreciated, and unloved on a new level.

Long story short I was pondering her value as a ‘friend’ today, wondering if I should block and try to forget about her. Well, I mentioned the hobby, how I’m improving, and thanking her for introducing it to me. That’s when things were kinda weird. She went a year without even opening my messages but as soon as I sent that message she reads it almost immediately?

209,"A little backstory: I know the age gap is very odd but I work as a receptionist at a very small company. She's one of less than 10 coworkers and I genuinely enjoy talking to her. She is divorced, single, no children. Her only family (her brother) lives states away. She decided for her 60th to go overseas for the first time with her friend for 10 days. She need someone to stay at her house and watch her cats. I didn't ask for payment, I figured it would be a nice sort of vacation (my roommate is... not the best roommate; I'm moving out in November but it's nice to have a breather from her for now when I can) and she offered to provide food.

She left this morning. I walked into her apartment tonight. 

Starting off with the least important information: I spent extra money paying off my student loans this month with the assumption that I would not have to pay for food for alittle over a week. in the fridge are lime juice, brown sugar, tortillas, an old pan of bacon fat, and a carton of eggs. 

I am only mildly peeved about that, because it pales in comparison to the main issue which is:

The percentage of space not taken up by random objects and boxes qualifies for hoarding.

Boxes take up most of the space in the living room. I have enough space to get to the couch and see the tv and the rest is boxes. Boxes and items. 

In the first bedroom, there is a narrow path leading from the door to the bed and back to the closet.

In the main bathroom, across from the first bedroom, there are litter boxes and a cat carrier in the tub for some reason. 

In the second bedroom, a table that takes up most of the room. And boxes. Other assorted items I was too overwhelmed to parse. I have to step over another cat carrier to get into this room. 

Leading through that room is the other bathroom, which is just clear enough to shower. 

My father had a cacophony of mental health issues. His apartment was always disastrous on the few times I was able to visit him. When he committed suicide when I was 11, my mom told me that you couldn't see the floor in any room except for my brother and I's, where everything was spotless. Vacuumed. Even the clothes in the drawers were folded.

I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder at 16. 

When I got into the apartment I tried to breathe through it. But when I went to feed the cats, my hands shook so badly that I dropped the bowl. And I snapped. I started crying and screaming in bursts. I paced around for two full hours before calling my boyfriend and then another friend to calm down. Then I cleaned the mess, scooped the litter, and left. 

I don't think I can do this. I don't know what to do. 

I want to be able to push through this but I don't think I can. 

I don't think I can just drive back and forth the entire time either though. I did tonight because I was positive that I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't. Both my boyfriend and friend recommended to ask someone else to do it, but I don't think she has anyone else who can. My boyfriend offered to stay instead of me but my friend doesn't know him.

This is the worst breakdown I've had in several years. I feel like an asshole. I feel melodramatic. I feel so drained. And lost.

211,"I think she is may be living strong because she is afraid to show weakness. She has been a huge impact on my parents, my brother, my sister , and I. She has been a mediator through the phone, and a listening ear through our hardest times. Sometimes lots of anger. I'm sure shes played a big part in keeping my parents together. As well as keeping me sane and just loving me a whole lot. Never afraid to mention how much.

I'm 24 I live by myself hours away. She has not shown much emotion about the death. Its been 3 yrs. I called her today. She just needs someone to talk to. I know she does and i was there for about twenty minutes of the conversation but at a certain point I just wanted to end it and kept saying ya...ya...ya. that mightve been the only conversation shes had in two days with the weather being how it's been. But I did make some effort to get off my phone and actually get engaged. She knew I was ready to get off. And as I was trying to get back into more she had to go. She has no one, we are all just external. Just people who've came to her with problems because she loves us. I know shed say we owe her nothing and even if there were some massive praise it would mean nothing. 

I guess I wonder if I should give up the things I have and just move in with her, help pay bills and allow her to stay in her home for more years because shes getting to the point where money is going to be an object and eventually property maintenance will become unmanageable. 

I'm single I have a car and a dirt bike. That's basically it. Things I can move easily. I have goals or at least one but I have to wait till January to apply for the apprenticeship. 

It just sucks because I've hated living alone and not having anyone. Thinking I need a girl for happiness. I know that's not true now(sort of.) But I fear shes depressed and hating herself/ life. She misses my grandpa more than she leads on. Shes said since hes died that shes just gonna be a crotchety old lady. Stuck in her ways. I added the stuck in her ways part. It's not like her ways are completely poor she just not open to change very much. She tells me most times we talk, that she never cooks. My grandpa always did. I thought she did too but maybe it was always him. Today she had said shes been hard on herself which I've never heard her say. I really dont think a therapist is an option.",28Feb2020,1

216,"Ok so, my boyfriend and I dated for about three years before temporarily breaking up (on good terms). After about a year gap, we got back together, and have now been together again for about three months. During our break, I stayed single, while he had a short relationship. When we got back together, he told me that he and his ex had remained friends and talked regularly. Although I couldn’t help but be a bit jealous, since they had broken up quite recently, I told him it was fine, and I didn’t mind that they were still friends. He assured me that they were both completely over each other and I took his word for it. I already knew him so well, and I knew he was trustworthy, so I figured it would be alright.
However, a few weeks ago, he confessed to me that he still had some lingering feelings for her. I was extremely upset, to say the least. He promised me that nothing would happen between them, and he wanted to put those feelings behind him as quickly as possible and continue to develop our relationship. Although I believed him, I couldn’t help but lose a lot of trust in him. I trusted him to be completely over her, and obviously, he was not. I asked him to stop talking to her at all, as I thought his feelings for her would never go away if they continued to be so friendly with each other. He was upset, and begged me to rethink my decision, but I stayed firm. I felt awful about it though, because I didn’t wanna be a bitch, but it seemed like the best course of action to keep our relationship thriving. He agreed to stop talking to her for my sake, and I felt like the world’s biggest piece of shit. I wasn’t letting him be friends with someone whose company he enjoyed, but I also felt I had good reason.
I finally thought we’d put her behind us, but today he told me that he’d lied to me, and that he hadn’t stopped talking to her. Saying I was pissed would be an understatement. But, as he justified himself, I began to feel more and more guilty. Apparently, his ex had developed extremely suicidal tendencies, and her support network consisted only of him and her new boyfriend. He had worried that if he just abandoned her so suddenly, she might hurt herself, so he continued to talk to her. But, he also didn’t want to hurt me, so he told me that he would stop talking to her. He said that she’s started going to therapy and developing better coping mechanisms, so he felt comfortable to stop talking to her now. But now, I feel EXTRA awful if I tell him he can’t speak to her anymore. I worry that she WILL end up doing something drastic, and I’ll end up being the indirect cause, but also I want my own relationship to stay stable.

219,"A couple years ago, I started interning remotely as a grant writer at a small nonprofit. I mostly did it for experience, and at the time, they were doing a project I was invested in (which they dropped later). I had a coordinator, and everything was great for a while; I was learning, contributing, and doing weekly check-ins. Then my coordinator left to pursue other things, and suddenly I was the nonprofit's grant writer. I was cool with that, but eventually I learned the main challenge of working remotely: communication. Even if I emailed team members, it'd take forever to get the answers I needed for a proposal. And I've always felt out of the loop. Many of the team members gather once or twice a year where the programs take place, but I was never able to get time off. 

I graduated and got a full-time job, but I stuck around because I'd only submitted a couple proposals and hadn't won them anything. But I started putting in less and less work until, as of a few months ago, I've done basically nothing. I have more time off to go to the meetings, but now I don't want to. I look at a long list of grant requirements that once would have been a fun challenge, but now I just feel hopeless about it all. I'm not a grant writer. Honestly I'm not that invested in their cause. I want them to succeed, but I don't think it's my purpose in life to help them. I keep hanging on and putting in a bit of work here and there, thinking I've just got to get them one grant and then I can go. And it shouldn't be that hard, right?

Part of this is definitely laziness. In fact, it's the same thing that happened at a previous internship--my coordinator quit, I didn't have anyone to answer to, and I did less and less work until I told the boss I wasn't keeping up. Even at my current job, I once put off so many things I was seriously considering suicide. Those feelings didn't go away until I finally caught up with my work, so I'm wondering if I just need to keep pushing forward with the nonprofit, rather than giving up. I just wish I'd put in a lot of work at the beginning and then left once I got a full-time job, grant or no grant. I could've helped get them started and put the experience on my resume. Then they could've taken on someone with actual experience who's really into their cause. 

I feel like I'm never going to be self-accountable, like I'm dragging on a relationship without a ring. So the right thing would be to tell them that, right?

220,"Hey, for background I am currently in grade 12 of my high school journey and will later this year be heading into my HSC exams.

Today I completed my 2nd maths exam for grade 12 and I’m confident I went absolutely horrific .

This is for advanced math and for me it has been no easy subject but I have managed.

Now this is my issue, I’m not sure how it works in other countries but in Australia this year your ranking in the year determines your HSC results and due to me possibly getting one of the worst scores out of all students I’m pretty sure my ranking is screwed, dooming me to no matter how I perform in later tests, a very low rank.

This means that for maths I will probably get a very low ATAR mark resulting in my overall ATAR mark being horrible.

I am now unsure what to do as I will probably put in a large amount of  effort all of this year and will get very little reward out of it.

How I feel/What actions I feel I should take: I want a one on one. I DON'T want fight him, I dont feel violence is a good option at this point in time; however if need be it wouldnt be an issue.

I want to confront him and make it clear we're not having his crap any more. An aggressive non-physical confrontation. Tell him to back off and leave us alone (he bothers me alot). Make sure he understands it's not a joke and it's not funny and it's going to end.

But I do not feel as though the governing body of the country is likely to act in the best interest of the populace and do not want to squander my health and safety for a cause I do not believe in. 

But, I feel like some form of service will make me a better more compassionate and competent person.

However I do not know what side to approach this problem from.

I have a Bachelor's degree. I feel like serving will create more opportunities for my future decisions. I hope to within the next three years become a physician assistant ( between doctor and nurse) 

I do not doubt that my family would be against this decision, but I has been on my mind so many years that I decided I should at least gather more information.

So friendly folk of Reddit, I need your advice:
Should I join armed forces? Would reserves be a more reasonable option? What branch? What are the differences? Would I even make it through basic training?

Thank you for any words of wisdom",28Feb2020,1

I wrote them down for him on a piece of paper, he didn't take it because he said hed remember. About an hour later he came to me while I was in the kitchen doing homework and he asked me something but I didn't hear it cause I was focused on some math problem, so I looked up and said ""huh?"" and he scoffed loudly and rolled his eyes so I said ""I didn't hear you, I'm doing homework. I don't work for you."" so then my parents both jumped at me and said ""why are you talking to him like that??"" and started screaming at me. I started stammering cause I'm trying to explain myself and they keep yelling so then I yell back and it just escalates. This situation always happens, my brother does something unthoughtful or rude and I'm the one who ends up apologizing to everyone.

I know I could have been nicer when I responded but he could have also been nicer/more patient when I didn't hear him. I had good intentions, i swear, I wanted to help him with his cat I was just preoccupied. This happens every time tho, I'm ALWAYS the one to blame.

They tell me I have no right to feel the way I do, they deny defending my brother and they just gaslight me telling me everything I'm feeling/saying is wrong.

238,"So I'll be getting my first tattoo on Saturday, which is actually the start of a sleeve. I'm super pumped for it and I'm pretty sure I got the mentality down for it as well, there's just a few questions I have. I would have asked on r/tattoos but their weekly Q&amp;A thread has been gone for almost three weeks now. My first question is about the needle. As a kid I had no problems with needles and would donate blood all the time. I was fine up until they did the Hepatitis B shots in elementary school, I think it was grade 7. Ever since that shot I always turn pale as a ghost and feel sick. I'm not sure whether I have an allergic reaction to them or that I just wean't eating enough before the shots. Would a tattoo needle cause the same kind of reaction? I already have plans to eat a huge breakfast right before my tattoo just in case. 

My next question is about pain. I know everyone's pain tolerance is different but is there anyway of knowing what your own pain tolerance is? The biggest injury I've ever had was a very bad ingrown toenail that I walked around with for 8 months before I finally got it removed. It never hurt unless i whacked it off something. The needle from the surgery honestly wasn't bad, it was just an awkward feeling but the post surgery was bad. My bandages got stuck twice and it was extremely painful to remove. I was also off work for two months, it took me a month and a half to even put pressure on the foot. 

My last three questions are short so I'll keep them together. 1: What's a good % to tip and should I be doing it after each appointment or after the whole sleeve is done? Lastly, what is the general time frame for each sleeve session? I've heard it was anywhere from two weeks- one month but my problem is that I booked way back in November, couldn't get in until March and now his books have been opened again since two weeks ago.",28Feb2020,1
239,"What’s up fellas, I’m not even 20 yet but my libido is at an all time low. I won’t get into too many details but I used to be in a relationship and had sex frequently. After I hooked up with a girl on a one night stand and had sex with no issues, I was looking forward to doing it. I tried to have sex around a year ago after a night going out and couldn’t get it up when a condom was introduced. After, I kept trying but the thought of it happening again just kept reoccurring and gave me more and more anxiety before hooking up. Fast forward a year and I haven’t had sex since. I’m nervous that I won’t be able to successfully have sex especially with a new partner who is attractive.

I’ve also messed up talking to a girl because of this problem and how I avoid going home with her because of these nerves which only adds to the problem.

I (30F) recently matched on Tinder with a woman I was friendly with in younger years. Her profile said she is ethically non-monogamous, I am also. We have been talking for a couple days and it's been going quite well. We unfortunately don't live close and are both busy, but planning to meet for a date soon. I was scrolling through her Instagram and found a post with someone she has been dating, a friend of mine. 

He and I have had a friends with benefits situation ongoing for several years. In fact the night her and I began talking regularly, he and I met up for some play. We aren't close, and generally don't talk about our personal lives besides the occasional mention of other sexual activities.

243,"I wasn't sure where to take this but I guess it's advice in a sense so here I am. So to get this post started I just want to say, make sure your loved ones know you love them. Keep the ones you care for close to you, they won't be here forever. I'll start with some backstory. When I was young my mother was never really there for me, and I had an abusive step-father. Naturally I was an upset little kid. I used to stay at my grandparents' house a lot and one day they eventually saw my situation and took me in at about 4 years old. They ended up becoming my parents basically and raised me up till I was 14 and my grandpa passed. It was very tough on my grandma but me and her were able to overcome the struggle we went through. Than my grandma continued to care for me and I loved her more than anyone in the world. That is until my 19th birthday she ended up in a nursing home due to her declining health. She got to a point where she couldn't eat, could barely speak, walk, or move and remained in this sad state until February 24th at 9:20am when she unfortunately passed away. It seems surreal and I'm obviously heartbroken, yet I haven't cried since the morning of her passing. If anything, I just feel distant, like I'm not living in reality. I want to cry, I want to scream, I want to be angry, but I can't do any of those things. I suppose my question would be why is it that I feel this way? This is the 2nd death I've dealt with and may be one of the hardest I will ever deal with but I feel empty. How is it I can hold someone so dearly, yet when they're gone I have no emotion? I'm trying not to stress because everyone grieves differently and maybe it just hasn't hit me yet, but I loved my grandma like a mother and I want to be sad.

My friend tells me she knows she's ""not supposed to care"", which she doesn't. BUT whenever 18M is in the same room as him or ever just comes into her thoughts, she gets this internalized hatred for him. She swears herself to keeping her actions peaceful, but chooses to say the things she wants to do instead.  


Here's the thing: she can't exactly get away from her ex because her friend group still allows and/or tolerates 18M being around them. Tiny interactions between her and 18M are enough to make her feel insecure again and have panic/anxiety attacks.

246,"Since it's the spring season, our school has multiple sports going on, and 2 of these sports include Tennis and E-Sports. In the previous semester, the teacher who chaperoned the E-Sports team recommended that I join the team in the next semester.

The tennis team also didn't have enough players, and I felt like this was an opportunity to pick up a new sport. I've been on the team for a couple weeks now, and we've gotten fairly close. However, I'm not that good at tennis, and I'm most likely going to be a sub for most of the games.

250,"Hi reddit this is my first post so sorry if I sound ignorant or like a newbie. Lol
So around a month ago I just got tired of writing on notebooks and paper and of my MacBook Pro. So I became infatuated with the iPad, I watched like 50 YouTube videos about it and within a week I decided that I was going to buy one for myself. However it was an expensive device and although I am not struggling for money or anything, I wanted to get my families input and see what they thought about it. My mom thought it was a good idea and I told her that I wanted to do a monthly plan. She said if I get a credit card that would help me build my credit and was a good idea if I really felt like I wanted it that bad. 
Then I talked to my dad and got his input and he said he did not want me to pay monthly payments because he believed that I would end up paying more than the original price in the long run. I had both of my parents telling me two different things, and I felt conflicted. I told my dad I was not willing to take out over $1000 out of my savings in one big chunk, so I would pay for it monthly. He basically told me “OK then since it’s for school I will pay for it for you.” I was taken back by this and I was not expecting him to say this. I was still in an hour away at my dorm at the time, and the weekend was coming up so my dad said “we can further discuss it at home.” 
The weekend came (this was Super Bowl weekend) and I could tell right off the bat my mom was definitely not on board with my dad paying, but she didn’t say anything. Me and my dad talked giddily about the idea of the iPad and eventually I gave in and told him fine you can pay for for me (didn’t take too much convincing). The next day, which was the day of the Super Bowl, I was the first one to bring it up so that he could order it. I wanted the iPad as soon as possible and had originally planned to have bought it by that time on my own. My dad ordered it and my mother was sitting right between me and him. She gave me a look.. something like “you’re so spoiled” but not in a very resentful way, a jokingly way? I guess. Idk
It came in two days later and I thanked him sooooo much for it! I started using it and I fell in love with it! 
Now here are some important details, I wear wigs and I was also thinking about going on a Miami trip with my friends. I knew initially, that if I was going to buy the iPad I would pass on the wig and the Miami trip. After three weeks with the iPad, I decided that since I didn’t have monthly payments I would be able to cover my other secondary expenses. I bought the wig which was $240 (half off) and I had almost planned the spring break trip to Miami which would have been around $700. 
About a week after I bought the wig, my mom texted me and said that they would cover half of the price of the iPad. I was confused because by now the iPad had already been paid for, in full a month ago. She also said in her text “I guess. you already knew that? We will pull it out of your savings account.” There was no mention of me ever paying for half, no discussion, and 0 hints. And I had made it clear I was never planning on taking that much money out of my savings account at once. I told her this, and she said we could possibly do five $100 monthly payments. 
I told her that I would call her later but I really do not know what to say. 

The iPad was $1200 dollars for the Apple Pencil, apple care, and case he got me. The only accessory I paid for was the screen protector. 
I understand that most kids could never dream of having a gift from their parents this expensive in their life, and I also feel obligated to mention that they had just bought me my DREAM car (~19k) for Christmas. But the situation does not sit with me well. There was nothing that triggered this, I want to make it clear that me and my mom nor me and my dad had ever argued within this one month or gotten into any type of disagreement.
They’ve never done anything like this before, and I honestly feel shocked and confused. 
I feel lied to, it’s not about the money... I have way more than $500 in my savings and was even willing to pay for it myself. It’s about the fact that they lowkey are “Indian giving” their own child. If I was told in the beginning that my dad would cover half, I would’ve been more than happy! After all I was planning on buying it myself! But for all of it to have been paid for, and then a month later have half of that revoked... it just seems really weird. I’m sorry if I sound spoiled but I really am grateful for everything and the situation does not make me angry it just confuses the hell outta me. Any advice? 

Other things I should mention:
—They don’t pay for college (not that parents are obligated to do so... ) I have a full merit scholarship and make all my money from my internship and stipend, my scholarship program also gave me my MacBook and pays for all of my school supplies (notebooks and pencils and textbooks etc) for free. 
—they pay for my iPhone and I contribute around $50 a month to the bill
—they pay for my car and health insurance
—I am careful with how much money I spend, because I am saving for medical school 

TL;DR: My dad paid for my $1200 expense after I told him I would buy it myself (in monthly payments) and now my mom tells me a month later that I will be paying for half of it in full.",28Feb2020,1
251,"I have no health insurance and want to go see a doctor for my social anxiety.

I researched online and discovered that I can get an online doctor to prescribe me Zoloft. If I were to go to an actual doctor, I think I would go to one of those cheap clinics that offer sliding costs billing and would probably get the same generic treatment except I'd wait longer to be seen.

There are some legit online doctors but they charge over $99 for consult or $199 for a specialist. 

Or I choose my own in-person doctor (which would be a primary doctor) who could possibly prescribe me the same generic treatment.
But it would cost much more.

I think I have ADD, Apathy, Depression, and social anxiety.
It's so bad I get really scared with sudden movements.

I also need to see a doctor for some stomach issues that have been causing me a lot of trouble, do you think I can bring up the mental issues on a doctor visit for stomach problems?

Also please answer this question!
I've never had a regular doctor, I've been to doctors once and paid the new patient fee. Which brings my total to about $100-130

258,"Hi all! First time poster. My roommate (we’ll call her A) and I have shared a room for about 6ish months now. For the most part it’s okay besides the usual problems. My specific problem is that A is a very heavy sleeper who doesn’t really wake up for anything. Bright side: I get to go to bed late and it doesn’t bother her at all. Down side: A completely convinced that I am just a light sleeper and that’s why I think she is loud in the morning.

In truth, I am not the deepest sleeper but I would say that I am of average sleeping ability. In the morning, if something wakes me up I’m usually able to go back to sleep immediately. This is where the problem is. A gets up wayyyy earlier than I do and it’s creating serious problems. A sets 3 alarms every morning that she swears are at half volume but there is absolutely no way because I set my alarm at half volume and it is much much quieter than hers even when it’s next to my head. A refuses to turn it down any lower because she just won’t hear it and that it’s something I’m just going to have to get over. 

Next, A is a very loud walker. A walks on her heels and stomps around on our hard wood floors while she gets ready. Sometimes A puts on her hard bottom heels to go to work and continues to walk around our room in them. 

A also slams the door. She walks around from room to room fairly fast to get ready in the morning and will just slam the door behind her. Once is one thing but A probably goes back and forth between our room 5 or 6 times a morning. 

Lastly, A swears she packs up her bags and such the night before but somehow she ALWAYS forgets something that requires her to empty out her bag or pull out her under the bed storage to find something. It shakes the bed and it’s just loud. 

A keeps this whole thing going for about 2hrs every morning and I lose about 2hrs of sleep every day. It is impossible to just go back to sleep only to have the shit scared out of me every 5 minutes from a slamming door. I have talked to her about this probably once a week for the past 3 months in very polite terms and in not-so-polite terms. She absolutely does not believe that she is disruptive and that actually I’m just a light sleeper. Regardless, I think that she should still try to be more considerate even if I WAS “just a light sleeper”. 

I spoke to my other roommate (we’ll call B) (who has her own bedroom) about it and B agreed with me. B used to share a room with A and has spoken with A about these same issues through out the time they roomed together. I am already working on moving out but financially it’s a ways a way because I need a more stable job.

It’s like we don’t have anything to say anymore and I find myself asking the same questions (how’s your day, stuff like that).

280,"I will do my best to keep this from being a long novel but I do think details are important . So here goes.

My gf and I have been together for 3 years now. And things are pretty good. We have moved into a newer house and have been working on getting it updated and making it ours. No big arguments or fights usually with the exception of the occasional dust up. Like any relationship I guess. Nothing that last too long bc we communicate the best we can bc we've both been in relationships where the was none and well that's why we're with each other now. Lol.  I just want to set the stage for why I have concern and feeling kind of disrespected in a way for what happened a week ago. 

We are just hanging out watching TV and playing some on line slots when I come back from the kitchen and she shows me a text from her ex that just simply says "" I love you"".. Nothing else. Just those 3 words. It was from her ex , let's call him Daniel, actually not her last ex but he came before her last bf. They dated for a few years and had a good relationship even living together for a year or so. She did say at one point she loved him . But Things hit the fan for them one night after he had been drinking too much at a Christmas party and she went to their hotel room a little early which was in the same place as the Christmas party and when he came back to the room later on he assaulted her by getting on top of her and slapped her in the face. Twice. She ended up leaving that night after calling a friend to come get her even tho they were about an hour away from home  . Long story short they ended up breaking up that weekend bc she has one line to never cross and that is getting physical with her. Which obviously should be the line for everyone in a relationship. 

He did try to say he was sorry and get her back and tried everything he could but she just couldn't take him back bc she said he had a drinking problem and she didn't think he would ever stop. She had told me when we first started dating that things were good up until that night except for the fact she started noticing the drinking . I could tell she was a bit still hurt by the situation but I don't think bc he was someone she still had feelings for. But bc of the physical part. Since then.....

 Once about a year ago she reached out to him bc his father had died. He and his dad were very close evidently . At the time she didn't tell me she had text him 3 times that night and made one phone call. I was not with her that night. The only reason I knew she had reached out is bc I seen his number on our shared account which I  discovered by accident many weeks later when viewing our bill. I asked her why  she had text and called him and she told me why . When I asked why she didn't tell me and she said bc she forgot about it and it wasnt a big deal. To me it kinda was bc of their past and the fact that he had tried getting her back in her last relationship before ours. I didn't like her answer but I trust her and chalked it up to not telling me bc it might have upset me and there was no reason for me to be upset. 

Fast forward a year and a half and he sends her a text saying I love you. She showed me immeadiately and said to WTH? She mentioned he was probably drunk and being an idiot. She also said that she would understand if I was not happy about it bc she wouldn't be if my ex sent something like that . We talked about how to handle it and she asked if I wanted to text him and let him know that it was not cool and to never text her again. I told her that I would only if she didn't want to tell him the same thing. But only if she didn't text him and tell him and if she was ok with me doing so and to let me know. It was kind of weird for us both I guess on how to handle it. Well last night a week had passed and I asked via text from work if she had decided to let it slide and not say anything to him. This made her defensive and upset saying that I should have handled it like she would have If one  of my ex had text me she still loved me. I told her no she would not have gone off on my ex bc I would have replied immediately to my ex saying that what she sent is totally unacceptable and to never send any text again. My gf said that he was probably drunk and sloshed as usual and that she was over it so if it still upset me that I can send him a text or call him etc...... I was kind of thrown off with her answer and to be honest felt like she was being totally dismissive of any concerns I would have or my feelings on the subject. This pissed her off by me saying I think she should have handled it. 

Am I wrong here? What is the correct way to handle this situation in your opinion?",28Feb2020,1

283,"I (22 F) and some of my roommates (also F, early 20's) are concerned about our 5th roommate (non-binary, 30). Let's call this roommate River. River has been living with us for a few months, and we're all really uncomfortable. They are pretty mentally unstable and off their meds. They don't really understand personal boundaries and they often come up to our rooms late at night and give us compliments and tell us lots of really personal stuff. This is weird, but not too big of a deal. But, they have said some really concerning things. In the first couple weeks, they told another roommate that they didn't feel welcome and they should just live on the street. This was a big red flag to me as it seemed really emotionally manipulative, but ultimately we needed the money and it wasn't like they did anything. Recently, River was gone for a few days and the rest of us ended up really coming out of our shells and feeling comfortable in our own house for the first time in months. River ended up feeling left out, which we felt bad about, but it was totally unplanned and not something we did on purpose. Eventually, we began talking and found out that River has said some really disturbing things. One of my roommates (let's say Lana) was asking us about if someone had hurt her cat because he had a burn, and River came up to her room while she was alone holding a blowtorch and saying ""do you think I'd do that to a cat? It would blow his fucking face off."" When we finally decided to kick them out, Lana talked to them (we were all going to talk together but Lana ended up getting tired of waiting and River just told her that they wouldn't be paying bills for a while), and River said they'd rather kill someone and go to prison that move out and go to a halfway house. Lana was really freaked out and said so, and River said ""of course I wouldn't hurt anyone, if I was gonna hurt anyone it would be myself."" They've often threatened to kill themselves instead of moving out. How the hell are we supposed to deal with this situation? They're not on the lease, by the way.",28Feb2020,1

I swear the only time she actually takes her dog out is when her family comes to visit or her boyfriend comes over. I’m 90% she just had those pee pad things for puppies in her room. The smell is really starting to get to me. She will leave for the whole day and keep her dog in the room so the smell will really stink up the whole apartment.

My room is probably the best smelling room in the whole apartment, yet I sometimes still wake up basically choking on the smell of dog pee.

286,"So yeah not sure why I [20M] did all this but it wasn't wise. Basically all my life I've been the quiet/awkward kid. Have some good friends and all. Don't downvote, really just want advice. 

So a couple years ago when I found out I was endowed it kinda got to my head and gave me a huge boost in confidence. Soon after I found the sub bigdickproblems, where I asked a lot of questions over time and found some others I could relate to about random things. I did this on one alt account at first, but then much later I mostly gave away my alt account's name to my old friends (from back in high school) in a joke (blurred name on comment but a guy searched it back), and I had already deleted those posts. That friend was like ""there's nothing too personal on your alt"", to which I was like ""well one thing but doesn't show on my alternative app, and nothing that could be used against me"", and yeah you know how it still shows the ""active in"". So he just sent a meme awkward emote and I did same, then dropped it. Note: I'm 200% straight but I originally found the idea of anyone knowing just made me feel good. I guess I craved attention, wished anyone knew. Idk what my reasoning was, I guess I thought it'd make people respect me more or something.

I moved to other alts after that of course. As we watch anime and such I was saying how I'd be making a lewd anime sub on an alt, and he found the sub pretty fast (also we usually joke about hentai and such a bit, his username is a pun from hentai). Over time I continued to use this alt for inappropriate stuff, mostly posting to that sub but at one point wanted just wanted more attention and posted a nude in an appropriate sub for that. And that got buried under more of my profile posts. I knew there's a chance of it being seen, but again I'm not humble.

I started using another alt, where all I did is just post to bdp and random subs a little bit over a while. Recently I also used it to make a post on my college sub that got some funny replies so just texted those friends the vague gist of a reply. I knew they could find it if they looked but once again I'm some bragging idiot. Same guy found that alt pretty fast, quoted a guy. 

So here I am. Nothing has been said about it since the single emotes after one saw it in 'active in' forever ago, but they probably noticed and are likely tired of seeing this weird activity of mine. I'm going to try to fix this a bit, by no longer posting to that nsfw anime sub, and just drop those alts completely. I really need to learn to be more humble, and less totally weird. I've said one thing in the chat that I'd stop posting weird stuff to my anime sub and ""everything else"", last thing that I said about it. I still feel I've worsened how they think of me, whether just one or more of them. I was an idiot, didn't think through any of it until now. We still text the same as usual but idk what they might think.",28Feb2020,1

I hadn't seen him for 9 months so like a week or two ago I texted him and asked him what he was up to. He told me he was at a hotel for work three hours away. I went up there and we ended up having sex. 


A few days ago I went to his house to hangout and I ended up falling asleep for close to 8 hours on his bed instead of hanging out with him. When I woke up he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner and I told him I wasn't feeling well and went home. 


A couple days ago he offered to take me out for dinner. I didn't want to go but I decided to anyway. When we got to the restaurant I told him I didn't want anything to eat and I basically just sat there and watched him eat while I drank soda and played on my phone. I don't like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why I didn't eat. Plus I just wasn't in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. 


Earlier today I went to his house. We just hung out for a little bit. Then I ended up giving him a blowjob. He went down on me for a couple minutes. In the middle of it my phone started ringing and I got up to answer it. I told him I had to leave and got dressed. When I said bye to him I just gave him a quick hug and he leaned down to kiss me but I walked away. We usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other.

293,"I’ve been struggling with mental health for 6 years now and a major issue has kicked in. I’m a 16 year old male, and while I’ve always been hungrier than the rest so to say, over the past few months my appetite has developed from a little above average to absolutely voracious. I find myself eating out of boredom, eating to cope with my borderline crippling depression, eating until I’m full rather than just not hungry, etc. The realization that this is happening only starting to kick in now, and I’m 55 pounds heavier than I was last June. I’ve realized I was gaining weight and always wanted to shed it off, but couldn’t do it. I’ve been on ADHD meds for these 6 years but since around september I’ve stopped taking them because it doesn’t feel like it’s helping me anymore and I feel like all it’s doing is stopping my appetite, which makes me feel guilty like I’m using it as a diet pill. I haven’t taken this in months because of this underlying guilt, and I don’t know what to do anymore. On bad nights where I get really self conscious I starve myself and freak out at all calories except incredibly low ones. One time I wouldn’t make a low calorie bowl of soup because 150 was “too much” and opted for 3 pickles at 5 calories each because I was freaking out about my weight. I’ve also realized I haven’t gone out in public in around two and a half months without wearing an oversized hoodie because I’m ashamed of how my body looks. It also doesn’t help at all that I’m working in a grocery store so I’m always surrounded by temptation. I’ll often impulse buy these tasty high calorie foods, eat it all, and then ask myself later “dude, why the fuck did you do that, dumbass”. I’ve lost any confidence I previously had, as little as it was and I’m starting to also think that this has become my main depression coping mechanism. Onto part two of this little essay. I’ve dealt with depression since my parents split right after I turned 10, and since then, there’s been an exponentially growing hole in my heart where love and affection. I don’t feel anything anymore and I’ve been starved of love and all feeling apart from anger and depression for years, and it’s only gotten 5x worse than it was last year. Since about three years ago, I’ve tried coping by getting a girlfriend, but nothing has turned out the way I wanted to after how many girls I’ve been interested in. Always getting friend zoned or blocked then ignored IRL, etc., has drained me, yet I keep trying. My depression has, in my opinion, caused me to develop a lot of unattractive habits. Obviously, my weight and body are one, but I also don’t care about school. This is more writing than I’ve done all school year, and I have to retake classes, but only literature classes which I hate with a burning passion. A bad student and a careless person isn’t attractive, nor is an overweight and depressed person attractive. The list seems to go on as my anxiety draws conclusions, plays out scenarios, and makes things up to be the worst possible cases day in and day out. I’ve lost motivation for anything which is why I’m failing school. I just don’t care, and it doesn’t help that I believe passionately that the school system has extreme flaws that nobody seems to have addressed which make me reluctant to do anything. I just don’t care. As much as I want to say more, I think I’ll stop here to make sure I don’t ramble for much longer. I have no love and motivation, care for anything, my appetite is voracious and it’s my terriblemental health coping mechanism that’s caused a massive weight gain. I have no confidence, nothing. I need help. Depression has tried to take me out of this world, and I don’t need it trying again. Luckily there’s one person who’s stopping me without even realizing, and it’s my mom, knowing how much it would derail her. It’s her and one other person that seems to genuinely care.

296,"Im not asking about motivation, im asking about how to actually work effectively and efficiently when I am doing homework.

It's hard to explain but theres a state of being where you just sit at a desk, with your homework open in front of you and your body just refuses to do it. You just sit there staring into space and you are maybe only able to write 1 - 2 lines every 5 minutes.

I initially solved this problem by going to a library to work instead of doing homework at home but i was just at the library today again and in 3 hours all i managed to do was write 2 pages of a story (i should have written at least 4 AND started work on another subjects homework).

298,"Hello all!

I have a question regarding student loan debt. I was recently accepted to my top choice graduate school but interestingly enough, rejected from a lot of my backup choices. The problem is my top choice school is going to cost me about $90k total (twice as much as some of the others), including living expenses. 

The program I was accepted to is specialized and competitive. It does not allow me to work outside the program more than 10 hours a week or enroll in classes part time. I’ve applied for many scholarships and grants but it doesn’t look like these will cover even half of the cost. I also applied for work study. I really want to justify the cost but as far as finances go I’m not exactly an expert. 

So here’s my question: is acquiring this amount of debt reasonable? The expected median salary for my specialty is around $120k but the entry level salary is around $65k. I can’t work in the profession without a graduate degree. Also, if it’s important, I don’t have any debts currently and I don’t have any credit either. 

Does anyone have any other advice as to how I can minimize the amount of loans I have to take out?",28Feb2020,1
300,"Hello,

I’m in my mid 20s, in a stable long term relationship. Every day I work, I get home, my partner and I are too tired to do anything but watch TV and browse reddit. We eat takeout for dinner basically every night. On the weekends we sleep in, and generally do the same thing- maybe with video games thrown in.

Neither of us have a drive to do anything. We don’t have sex, or go out very much, or do things most people are age do. But I’m also pretty happy too? Like I feel self conscious some times (like right now as I type) because I feel like I should be having an active life since it’s not normal to stay in, but I don’t feel bored or unfulfilled. My partner seems to feel the same, if anything she seems more happy with things than I am.

I say “happy depression” in the title because I feel like loss of drive and staying in are the symptoms of depression, but I also like my life a lot— and the only time I ever kind of feel sad comes from the feelings that I’m doing my 20s wrong. I dont know. What do people think? Am I going to regret my life? Is my lack of drive weird? I personally don’t know how people feel the energy to do anything after working- when I was in school I had plenty of energy for adventures, but now I just don’t.

306,"I experienced a very rough time when I was in high school. I was not taking good care of myself and the environment was not the best for me. I wasn't sleeping well, I had crippling anxiety, no friends, not eating much, and just feeling like a mess. 

When I left high school, I got into a nice uni, the one I'm attending at the moment. I decided to change, and I started reading lots of self help books and applying the concepts. I also started tracking my mood. You can tell I was feeling very happy for the first couple of months. I'm talking about eating right, working out, getting 8 hours of sleep, waking up early in the morning, studying, feeling confident, meditating, quiting porn, etc. 

Well, a bit before last week I started midterms. Suddenly, all my good habits deteriorated. I failed a calculus midterm and I have two midterms left. I've given up. I feel like shit constantly. Every bad habit has resurfaced again with the excuse of ""you have to treat yourself."" I'm not eating, I'm laying in bed on YouTube, missing lectures, not studying, sleeping 2 or 3 hours a day, not working out, and just on standby. I'm just watching everything go back to crap and I'm not doing anything. I'm a victim and a pathetic loser at this point. I just want to lay down in bed all day. Worst thing is that anxiety is coming back.

I think I had built such a good routine that messing up a bit made me go downhill really fast. I'm reading my journal and I was happy. I was doing so good, but just a bit if stress threw me off entirely. Am I just weak? How am I even going to get it together now? My grade is messed up for that class now. I have other midterms that I will probably fail because I haven't been studying. Too many people are looking up to me. I will not survive this semester in this state.

317,"My brother and his partner have asked me to donate. They asked me before when  I was younger, I said no but maybe in the future. Now at 30 and them already having one child through ivf they've asked me again

Theres a lot of things going through my head, the easy thing would be to say no its too complicated and weird. Saying that it may be my one opportunity to have a child in some way, even if I dont raise it myself; they have said the child will be theirs but the child will be told I am the biological father and will not be prevented from having a close relationship with me as uncle/biological father. I have no idea how that will work out but in theory it could be nice. 

Now heres where things get much more complicated. For one, me and my brother, even though are relationship isnt terrible and has improved somewhat over the years we arn't close either. In fact our relationship has been quite bad in some ways. He was always seemed abit resentful of me growing up, steal things from me, angry child, even as an adult he would do strange passive aggressive behaviour such as flaunt money at me when its a bit distasteful to do so, exclude me from any family photos (take photos when im not around). I think the cause he has never liked that im the older brother and he may have wished to be me in some ways, but whom knows really. As an adult even though I know he would be very loving towards a child, I don't particularly like his personality. He can be manipulative , ignorant (pretend not to hear people, talk over people) bossy. They have a child already and he makes a massive fuss over her and is very loving , hes also very loving towards animals and they bring out the best in him. My concern is when they become older and they are not this novel cute child anymore and some of his bad side starts to manifest. Its hard to gauge and look into future and imagine how good of a parent he would be but i have concerns. 

Not only that but his partner and I used to date briefly , we are friends but If things start to breakdown between my bother and her. You can imagine a scenario where she turns to me and things get messy. This is something I can discuss with them as a concern but even then it doesn't guarantee it wont happen. My brother and her have a platonic relationship, Its no secret she finds me attractive still and it doesn't bother my brother he sometimes make jokes when he notice she is flirting with me to embarrass her. Hes not jealous because they dont have a sexual relationship. (I would say their relationship is based on a strong friendship and ultimately a desire to have children and a family) But still it makes the worried scenario of her turning to me more likely.

319,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this on, but I'm currently in my third year of college doing a Bio major to get into PT school. Originally I did Computer Science because I grew up for a good chunk of my life having an interest and passion for everything computer related, however after my freshman year I noticed I wasn't fond of the more advanced programming classes and the field's deep tie with math especially turned me off. I went through a crisis of career, went undecided for a year, then switched to Biology because I had a fond interest in the sciences when I was younger and wanted to enter a field where I could help people. What I've noticed about myself through the grueling years of college is that I'm not a disciplined and hard worker and there are many days where I wonder if I've made so many switches in my major to avoid the struggle that comes with working hard.

Recently I received my grades back for all of my midterms and had a bit of a panic because of how low the scores were. In a field as competitive and strict as the medical one, I'm almost entirely confident I would not be able to properly keep up without working myself to the point of misery which lead to my existential crisis (I always knew that I wasn't a hard enough worker to succeed in the medical field, but I ignored that reality in favor of naive optimism). Sufficed to say I attempted to do some soul searching and bumped into the field of IT which attracts me due to my history with tech and the fact that it lacks the specific qualities that repelled me away from CS. I've done my research about the qualifications and requirements of the job, however it's impossible to properly gauge my enjoyment of the career without getting some experience in it first. I face the following problems:

1. I'm knee deep in difficult science classes that attract the majority of my attention, study-wise. I even had to reduce the amount of days I work in order to keep up with my classes.
2. I'm not entirely sure if I'm genuinely interested in this career or if I'm just looking for an easy-out for my current 'academic suffering'.
3. I wouldn't necessarily need a college degree to get into the field and working on both a degree and a career (especially when they're both unrelated to each other) doesn't seem practical, however I bar myself from a large chunk of the job market if I decide to drop out.

I graduate in summer and unfortunately I have been unable to find a job despite applying for a lot. I did not get the one which I really wanted and it looks like I am going to be joining the many qualified individuals who aimlessly float around.

323,"In a few days I need to apply for the next part of my education, and I’m having a hard time making a decision between 2 places because they both seem good in their own way. (For context; I’m pretty sure that I want to study science in some form at university after this, and I’m mostly interested in biology and chemistry. I also play music and have done so for many years. I enjoy it but don’t want to work with it.)

**School A** is focused on science, construction, design etc., and lot of the students there go on to study engineering or science at university. A lot of the classes are more focused on working with projects, creating products and doing experiments. They also have a very modern facilities including laboratories that you get to work in a lot. in general the work you do here is more reminiscent of what you’d do at university or at a workplace. I think this could really give me a head-start in terms of working with science as well as train me to be more innovative and in being able to carry out my ideas. 

A lot of the subjects are in some way related to science, and the ones that aren’t might still make use of science-related topics. I’ve also heard great things about the teachers, and some of them have backgrounds in for example chemical engineering, software development etc. I’m able to study chemistry at a higher level than at school B, meaning that my knowledge will be more in-depth, but it doesn’t make that much of a difference in terms of what I’ll be able to study at university. My chances of getting into this school + the class I want are both quite high, so in that sense it’s a very secure decision. I might also be able to get a bit of support with some mental health issues I have. 

The days are very long though, and there’s also more homework and fewer holidays. Furthermore, there’s a very long break in the middle of the day, which I feel kind of breaks the work-flow. I’m quite worried that the added hours might become overwhelming to me. 

Chemistry and biology are studied isolated, and I’m not sure that I really enjoy chemistry in this way. Most of the work here is also done in groups which I don’t enjoy that much. 

I spent two days at the school, and I didn’t have a very good gut-feeling about the place. It’s very big, so it’s easy to get lost, and some of the classrooms are quite dark and uncomfortable. Most of the students seemed very closed-off, which made me worried that I’m not going to be able to make friends if I go here. The classes seems bit more disorganised compared to school B, and I experienced more noise and more students just walking off during class. It’s also slightly further away compared to school B, and is located right next to a construction site. 

**School B** has a music profile meaning that you can take a music-class, some of the other classes might have a music-spin and everyone there plays music in some way. 

The school is known for having a lot of skilled students. (So is school A). There is a class that’s focused on science, but not quite as much as a science-class at school A. Here, at B, I can have a subject that’s a combination of chemistry and biology, which is what I find most interesting. I’ve also heard a lot of really good things about the teachers responsible for science at the school, and the people I’ve heard from seem very happy with the school in general. There are ewer hours here compared to school A, and the tasks are more straightforward and often more theoretical. You also have more of a choice in, whether or not you do work individually or in groups. (Technically, both school A and B teach at the same level of difficulty and mostly about the same topics, just in different ways.)

My good friend goes to this school, so I’ll be able to get some guidance and help from her while. This could especially be a help in terms of getting introduced to some other students. 

I visited the school for a day and had a really nice experience. The teachers seemed nice, and the students were very welcoming and kind to me, and I got along with them well. The school isn’t huge, so most people know each other somewhat, and it seems, that almost everyone has friends/ someone they hang out with.

The school doesn’t accept everyone who applies to it, so there’s a risk that I won’t get in. (Which would mean that I can’t get into school B either, as I can only apply for one of them.) Furthermore, I might also not get into the science-class. A lot of the science-teachers are quite old, and some of them could potentially retire soon. I’m also worried that there’s too much focus on music, as I don’t have any plans to pursue it. Some of the students here are really into performing on stage etc., which I'm not. Some do go on to study science, but I think that more pursue music. 

I’ve heard that there’s more competition among students here (only heard it from adults who went here when they were young, not any current students.) They do have much more of a party-culture with drinking and smoking, which is something I don’t see myself enjoying much. 

There are a lot of subjects I need to have here, that aren’t very useful to me in terms of studying/working with science later on. I’m worried that by choosing school B, there are a lot of very useful skills I won’t gain, that I could’ve gotten by choosing B instead. 

tldr: By choosing A I think I’m going to gain some useful skills in terms of studying and working with science later on. It’s the most logical and secure choice, but I didn’t have a good feeling while there. There’s also more hours, more technical work and work in groups, which I think might become counter-productive for me.

By choosing B I’m getting a broader range of subjects, including ones that I dont need, ones I would get either place, and one that I’m extremely interested in. I enjoyed the place a lot more, and it has some aspects that might make it less stressful to go here. But I’m worried that I’m going to miss out on knowledge and skills by going here, and that there’s too much competition. It’s also less secure, since I might not be able to get in.",28Feb2020,1

They helped keep me up and not go further down the hole I was in. I felt like I did not have a purpose in life so they gave me one. Now they have started to ask for things. They ask for pictures of me. They have not asked for nudes but I think that it will inevitably happen. I have seen this happen before and I know what manipulation and gaslightning looks like. The gaslightning has already started, that I know. They give me compliments and I say ""thank you"" without saying anything back. They respond with that I dont seem to like their compliments and that they will stop and apologises for trying to be nice. It does not make me feel guilty like they want me to because I know what's happening. I just dont know how to get out of the situation.

332,"Track and field was fun during freshman and sophomore year but this year it just feels like the enjoyment isn’t there. I’ve lost the passion for the sport and it’s showing.

At the end of the appoinment the doctor gives me a copy of the paper I let her look at. I look at the paper, and it is obviously a copy, and the paper even has indented writing all over it (like it was beneath a paper someone was writing on). I was a little annoyed, and was expecting to keep my original document, not the scan of it, with indented writing all over it. So I asked if I could have the original document. The lady at the desk said ""ok one second"", and then comes back and says ""that is the original"", then me being dumb, I ask ""like, the original one, the one I had"". She is still confused and then brings the doctor out. The doctor holds up both sets of papers, and says ""this is the photocopy, and this is the original copy.  At this point I know I'm just being annoying, and she gives me my original document that I had before. People were watching confused.

343,"TL;DR   Sorry for the really long text just wanted to get it off my chest. But, my friend is a narcissistic and hypocritical asshole. I decided I don’t want him in my life anymore, how do I get rid of him?

My friend is a narcissist. Or so I think. We met in kindergarten but didn’t start talking again till middle school. In 9th grade he was a super close friend. But now in 10th grade I realized all his bullshit I put up with. I realized how arrogant he is, how he’s always trying to be better than me and my friends. For example, he tries so hard to be the funny one. We all joke around in our group, but he of course thinks his jokes are the funniest. Of course I wouldn’t really care if he thought that it’s just how he tries to rub it in our faces. He’s always bringing up how he’s the “funny one”. The thing is, the funny one is usually called that by other people, not the person himself. And my friends jokes are dry asf. He’s always using the same dry humor in his jokes and we sorta laugh so it’s not awkward. Also, someone who’s friends with some of us has started hanging out with us and his jokes are actually funny so of course we laugh harder. But of course the narcissist doesn’t like how someone is doing better than him so he treats him like shit. Calls him out on every little thing he does even going as far as being hypocritical just to call him out. Okay, another example. He’s always but I mean always saying he wants to get in a fight. One time, someone was keeping a teacher from opening the gate to let us go, so my friend tells him to stop trying to act so hard. Guy gets mad and tells my friend to not say shit like that or else they’ll get down on the spot. Moment of my friends life right? Wrong. Look on my friends face says he’s scared shitless. My other friend stepped in trying to calm down the gangbanger. I just really wished he hadn’t. Another time, my narcissist friend was saying he wants me to be his first fight so he can win. (Im a little short compared to him) To which I told him “I’ll knock your ass out”. He laughed but when I told him I’m down to fight and threw down my backpack, he looked scared and shut up. Another example, he thinks he’s a lady man. Again, I could care less if he thinks like this, it only bothers me that he tries to brag to us. He told us how he lost his virginity when he was 14. Story is a bit unbelievable. Hint, girl goes up to him. Now that I think about it, in all his stories about doing something freaky with a girl, the girl goes up to him. He tries to give us advice on girls and when we tell him what we think about his advice he gets all offended and says we’re dumb because he’s the most experienced. He’s really not. He’s had 1 girlfriend that lasted a month. He thinks he’s had 2 because he’d been texting a girl at school never talked. She asked him out and broke up with him the same day. Oh, but he’s so “experienced”. I can give more examples but it would be too long so I’ll list some. Other things he tries to rub in our face, that he’s smarter, stronger, more attractive, more athletic, knows how to fight, has the best music taste, dresses the best out of us, is more popular/social, has better hair, and theirs more just can’t remember. Oh, also want to add, he is a huge hypocrite. He’s always telling us we shouldn’t vape or smoke or whatever, and when one of our friends we use to be close with in elementary posted on his story of himself smoking, my narcissist friend was mad. Next day at school he confronts other friend telling him he’s still mad at him. I was right next to him so I stepped in and said “Why, it’s his life he can smoke if he wants, he doesn’t have to listen to you” I’m also against smoking but if my friends do it why would I be mad, it’s them not me. Like a week later narcissist friend comes all high with some other people saying he ate an edible, acting all stupid while high trying to be funny. God what a f*cking hypocrite. I’m done with him, how do I get him outta my life.",28Feb2020,1
345,"I’m about to be disowned for being gay.

My parents are Indian and pretty traditional. Though I’m 22, they’re controlling. They’re not into me partying, don’t want me to date, want me to get an arranged marriage to someone in our caste, think I should exclusively study rather than get a job, want me to be a doctor, etc. I had to fight hard to get them to loosen up at all. I’m not a bad kid but we’ve had a lot of fights because my views and theirs don’t align. Realizing I was a lesbian was a nightmare for me. 

I accepted it a few years ago, and met my girlfriend after that. We’re serious now, but I’m in the closet.  Until my parents found out about us because someone saw us on Valentine’s Day and told them. At first they freaked out and didn’t want me to see her, took my car keys and cards, and told me I’m not going out of the house anymore. It’s been a few days and they’ve returned it all, and weirdly have hardly mentioned her. They’re just talking about school. 

I thought my girlfriend and I had a chance, and they weren’t seeing it as as much of a big deal as I thought. I was starting to feel really optimistic. I think in reality, they’re just hoping it’s temporary and that I won’t make a fuss about it. That whatever happened between us is over and that they won’t have to deal with it. They see her as a bad influence that’s distracting me, from what I’ve gathered in the few minutes that they’ve mentioned her. I think they’re worried about me.

Today they made a big deal about watching this movie they said was really good. The movie had a lot of themes about family, making your parents proud, keeping up their legacy, etc. and my dad was getting emotional. I don’t know if it was planned but it was clear that my parents were heartbroken. Tbh I can understand them since they were raised differently, but I feel like I‘m not what they wanted.  

I wanted to sit down and have more of a direct “this is my girlfriend, she’s not going anywhere” talk, but it hurts. I don’t see anger in them, just betrayal and heartbreak. They seem to be hoping that if they’re nice to me, I’ll be okay and stay away from the bad influence. I feel like I’m on the edge of a cliff.",28Feb2020,1

347,"I have a supervisor who trained me to take over on her days off. She taught me to leave the door ajar when coming and going because it’s quicker and that made sense to me. We work night shift and do  things differently than day shift she told me this about a few other things too. The morning shift people came in and flipped out saying I left the door open. My supervisor would flip out if I left the door propped open when I first started. I learned to not leave it proper and very rarely do it now. It’s become a habit for me to now not shut the door all the way. When the morning shift flipped out the door was propped open BUT I think  (in hindsight) they propped it to show me that it wasn’t locked all the way. 


Well the other day they made a big deal about the door being left open again. I was confused and thinking to myself “ I can’t believe I would have left the door propped open again??? I don’t ever really do that”, so I asked. Was it wide open or just ajar? They  said it was ajar. Okay. I was told that wasn’t a big deal. 


Anyways, the morning shift people complained to the higher ups. And the higher ups talked to my supervisor, and asked her if I was trained to shut the door or not, and  wanted to speak to me about it, and she said “of course!!! I’ll talk to her about it!”.

Wasn't usually a big deal since I was actually employed to that place.

The floor was wet from pee/mop water as well which made it hard to not slip. They immediately swarmed me as soon as I entered which is normal, but while I was walking one bit me on the side. At the time I didn't realize it was a bite and not a scratch as my back was turned. I got home and upon closer look noticed it was in fact a bite. I called the place and asked if all the dogs had their shots and explained what happened, woman says yea.

They released us from the second ER because my mom wasn’t showing any major issues. 

I’m not usually one to freak out but I am wondering now if I should self-quarantine myself from my wife and daughters in case I may have been exposed to Coronavirus. There are reports of exposures and a case or two in the Sacramento area. 

I know that, statistically, my wife and I and our kids are unlikely to contract it or to suffer major symptoms but we are expecting my in-laws this weekend who are in their seventies and are suffering from major health issues and are very fragile right now. I’m thinking that it might be an abundance of caution but we have been suffering from a run of bad luck lately (luck, another thing I don’t believe in) so I’m a little over cautious right now.

355,"So.

I’ve known this guy for about 5 or so years. I never thought much of him except that he’s physically attractive. However, even though I haven’t seen him for 2 years, I’ve been having obsessive sex dreams about him consistently for the last 5 years. Lately I’ve been waking up full of a burning urge to find him and have sex with him. I don’t get why I feel this way and I want it to stop. I’m not in love with him, I don’t have a crush on him, I don’t want to date him, I just want to fuck him. I understand that, as humans, this tends to happen from time to time, but for me it’s like my subconscious is obsessed with him. No matter how long it’s been, no matter how much I ignore it, I can’t rid myself of it.

Now get ready for some red flags:

Red flag #1.
I’m married. I love my husband, we have a good sex life and we’ve been together for almost 5 years. We have an open flow of communication between us and he knows how I feel. He’s not okay with it but he understands that I’m not in love with someone else and that I still am in love with him.

Red flag #2.
The guy I am dreaming about is my ex’s best friend. We met through my ex, we became friends because I was dating my ex, and since then the dreams started. My ex doesn’t know I’ve felt this way. Obviously I’m not with my ex anymore, and even if I wasn’t with my husband, it’d be a shitty thing to go and have sex with my ex’s best friend.

Red flag #3
I think he hates me. I really hurt my ex during our break up, and he’s a loyal friend, so he hates me for what I did, hasn’t spoken a word to me since, even though me and my ex are good mates now.

358,"
I recently got a fwb through Tinder — tbh I went into the first “date” thinking it’d just be a one night stand and that we’d never talk to each other again. This was also my first time ever doing something like this. We actually had amazing sex &amp; amazing chemistry together; the hours just flew by. 

To my surprise, during the entire first evening together, he kept saying how this wasn’t the last time he would see me, kept asking when he could see me again. The next morning after the hookup, he texted me asking when he can see me again. 

We scheduled plans but i chickened out because I already found myself kind of getting attached/having a little interest in him. I expressed this to him &amp; we communicated. He said while he’d like to be fwb/casual, he’s “open to more” and that if either or both of us get attached, we’ll “take it from there.” 

I agreed on that and went over for a second “date” — again, amazing sex &amp; chemistry. Two rounds of sex, lots of cuddling, watching YouTube, and he even took me out to get a quick bite to eat. I stayed from 6pm to 3:30am; the time just flew by. While we were together he even mentioned needing to go to IKEA soon and asked if I wanted to come, and also said we should go to a concert together. 

For our third time meeting, he invited me over to his place to “hang out” even though I’d be on my period, and he said we can do stuff not involving sex. I don’t know what that would be but yeah lol. 

Tldr; My recently-met fwb wants to do stuff not involving sex (hanging out, going to IKEA, etc.) Does this mean anything? I’m a novice at casual dating so any insight would be appreciated!

Edit: It might be worth adding that during our drive to getting food, he was holding my hand while driving / placing one hand on my inner thigh. And while in line to order food, he was very touchy with me / I was also touchy with him. I know it may not be a big deal but it meant a lot because I am a really touchy person so it felt nice.. but again, don’t wanna read too much into it! Lol",28Feb2020,1

I don’t know how but my bf talked about breaking up , he was asking me questions about how I would react if we broke up.
I thought that was weird and eventually I asked him if it was something that he would consider . After a bit of hesitation , he said ok . I wasn’t sure if he said ok about breaking up or if was talking about something else. So I asked him plain and simple if we should stop our relationship . He eventually said that we should stop.
At this point , I’m shocked. 
He then sends me a long text where he says that he had to choose for the both of us and that he will always love me . 
I replied back by saying that I was in shock . 
Then he calls me and tells me that it’s not what he wanted , he was under the impression that I wanted him to break up with me by the way I was talking to him. 
I am lost right now , I don’t know what to believe. I really need some advice , how can I discern what he really wants ?",28Feb2020,1

373,"i'm a f(19) and all the time, i've been daydreaming about getting work done on my face. it's been affecting my concentration while studying.

i can't help but keep thinking about my looks. i know this sounds bad, but looks seem to determine everything, like what kind of jobs you get, how much money you make, how people treat you, who you attract, etc. and because of those things, i crave to look pretty. these thoughts get worse whenever i see other girls who are beautiful or when something bad happens to me and i think ""that wouldn't have happened if i was good looking"". 

i already know what things i need to fix on my face, the biggest one being my nose, which is something i've always wanted to fix. i'm seriously considering getting fillers in my nose, but the cost and possible harm (going blind or getting an infection) is stopping me right now. 

i just feel frustrated because i want to look good so that my life gets easier, but at the same time, i'm scared of the possible consequences of getting my face altered.

i want all these superficial thoughts to go away, but they keep coming back whenever i see pretty people or when i get anxious.

Today I told him "" I'm off to bed I hope I have time to message ya later today."" he said "" You didn't go to bed?

Lately I’ve been having really vivid dreams of my deceased grandparents. I would wake up crying, missing them terribly.

It’s to the point where I want to go to sleep so badly so I can just be with them and talk to them but on the other hand it’s like I never want to go to sleep because it’s so painful seeing them in my dreams and not being able to see them in real life anymore. In my dreams I’m always talking to them and they seem so happy together, but some dreams I have to save them and I never can. I don’t know what this means but losing them was the toughest thing in my life and I don’t know why it’s hitting me so hard lately. I even think about seeing a medium and asking if their okay and together. I miss them so much and I tears me up inside that I can’t see them anymore.

381,"Sorry this is a long rant. I'm not entirely sure where to begin.. I just wanted to post this anonymously because I am too afraid to talk to people I know. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do and how to cope. 

Ever since I could remember my dad, he has always been an angry and short tempered person. So much that I feel like it's borderline abuse. He grew up in an extremely emotionally abusive home and doesn't enjoy his job at all. 

He would frequently storm out of the room over anything that irritated him and his outlet was to break or throw something in the other room and I sometimes caught him hitting his own head with his palm or biting his hand. 

When I was younger he would have a rage fit if I just stood in his way. My brother and I were afraid of him and we were always on edge whenever we had to go out with him. He wasn't a vocal person but his road rage was terrible as even minor things made him furious. 

Some of the times I felt the most terrified was when I was younger where he once broke a window with a stool, he drove extremely aggressively (because my brother spilt a drink in the car), grabbed my arm and lifted me half off the ground (because I spoke to him in a tone he didn't like), late at night he would be upset over something and I would wake up to him in another room breaking things and hitting himself. He has never apologised to me and has never approached me to explain himself. 

Through primary school and mostly middle school I would also go somewhere alone and bite my arm or my hand as hard as I could or I would hit my self when I was extremely upset. I have mostly gotten over this bad habit now. 

When I went into high school, he changed quite a lot. He was a lot more quiet and things like accidentally standing in his way rarely upset him. He suddenly began to offer to do nice things for my little brother and I, like bringing snacks or taking us out for lunch (""because I want to spend quality time with my kids"" he would say). But by now we both felt very distant and scared of our dad so we would decline. And when we decline, then he gets very offended or upset and the anger just won't end. 

My mum (who is Japanese) struggled to communicate properly to my dad however for a while she did try and calm the situation and fix whatever was wrong. But lately when I would talk about dad to her, she would say that she's given up on trying to help because it doesn't solve anything. My little brother hides in his room most of the time because he is too nervous and afraid to deal with dad and I am the only one who would confront him about his behaviour. 

Whenever I would talk to my dad afterwards about his rage fit from earlier, he explains to me what was bothering him in a way as if he is 100% the victim. Again never apologising or talking about how he reacted to that problem. What's worse is that everyone else apart from my brother, my mum and myself, thinks he is a gentle and kind father who could do no wrong. 

My mum would be treated terribly but she would always have a ""it can't be helped anyway, it's okay"" sort of attitude and just accepted his behaviour even though she is scared of him. When she told my brother and I this, we were extremely upset. 

Recently I have realised that I am almost 18 and I am able to leave this environment. But then I also realised that I can't leave behind my brother and my mum living like this without someone that would confront him. 

After knowing this I have brought myself to finally call a kids helpline number and talked about my problem. Obviously she couldn't do much at the time but she told me to either call the police or file a child safety report on him if it becomes out of hand. 

I felt better after talking to someone about it but I don't have an urgent feeling of needing to call the police or report him for child abuse (if that even counts as abuse). 

Is there any other option for me to stop his behaviour?

Should I file a report or call the police on him?

385,"I’ll make this quick because there isn’t time to go into every in incidence. Basically at the beginning of the year my roommate’s (19F) boyfriend of like 3 months broke up with her. I’m fairly close to him, and it was a pretty amicable break, honestly due to incompatibility (and, though he won’t say it, her emotional unavailability).

Over the past 10 weeks, roomie has been making incredibly poor decisions. Drinking or smoking every night, staying out till 7 am, going to the beach at 3 am,  skipping classes, failing tests. I’ve tried unsuccessfully to help her. She has A LOT of difficulty processing and sharing emotions and mainly tries to numb herself to them. 

The main part: roomie is a strict Catholic who didn’t want to have sex till marriage. Recently she’s been hanging out with a really shady guy (frequently boasts/posts about hating women, extremely misogynistic, compulsive liar, and has a mark on his permanent record for threatening his last roommate with physical violence, all of which roomie knows). She’s been out drinking/smoking with him and sleeping in his bed. Last night she had sex with him. The consent part is negotiable, since she was high and has a very hard time saying “no”, however she was the one to tell him she wanted to have sex. She was distraught the next day and I begged her to talk to someone about it and get on birth control. She refused, just blatantly not talking at points. She said she didn’t want to get BC because it made it “real”. However she continues to go to the creepy guy’s room. 

I know she’s in denial and I don’t want to rush her through a healing process, but I’m very concerned. She has continued this unsafe behavior, and I’m really worried that she’s going to get pregnant. How do I get through to her? And ESPECIALLY how do I get her to go on birth control?

tl;dr my roommate is making very bad decisions. how do i support her and also make sure she’s safe and on birth control?",28Feb2020,1
386,"A guy DMs me flirting (on a dating or non-dating site) and I have a pic(s) up there or he talks to me and requests a pic. If he has a pic up I find attractive, I'll send him one. Approximately 2 out of 10 of them do not comment on my pic. He doesn’t say I'm pretty, cute, look nice, nothing--but he asks for my Snapchat/Kik/phone number and wants to talk further with me. I block and forget him. Isn't that the appropriate reaction?

If I saw a guy’s pic or I ask for it and he sends one to me, I’m going to say something nice— but genuine. If he’s super-fine, or he’s cute of course I’ll say so. If I find him completely unattractive physically I’ll say “Your suit is sharp” Or “Cool glasses.” Something. I was raised right. Add to this, one of the main at least INITIAL sparks of chemistry a woman feels with a man is she likes that he finds her attractive. In OLD, if he doesn’t express that what is the point of talking to him further?

Second question: Why do you think is up with the roughly 20% say nothing about my looks, but continue to purse me? A) He is just clueless about how to talk to women, and has no game, no finesse? B) He probably believes in Red Plil, PUA or similar backward misogynistic rhetoric that tells men only ""cucks and simps"" complement a woman other than negging? Or C) He simply finds nothing attractive about me, but still wants sexting or sex from me?",28Feb2020,1
387,"Tl;dr - I'm trying to make sense of this weird intense relationship I had with a grill I ___wasn't___ dating but basically was in a way. We've since taken a break from each other after I blocked her, she blocked me, and it got messy. Can anyone help make sense of it?

I did everything with her like spend valentine's with her (with my dad too), cuddle, we said we love each other, I gave her pecks on the cheek, she slept over sometimes in my bed sometimes on the couch, I was in a band with her, sometimes spent like 4 days in a row with her, she held me when I was crying because of a condition I have giving me pain, we shared intimate details of our lives and painful family histories, i copped a few feels but that honestly was the extent of it sexually other than just the general intensity of the damn thing.

Eventually she got weirded out by my condition affecting me in weird ways and she didn't want to be responsible for me so she started avoiding me. That hurt a lot and her suddenly not wanting to initiate anything with me at all really tired me out and caused me to freak out.

No idea what this sort of thing is but it was really ambiguous and she even said she was ""datish, nothing official"" with the girl singer in our band, and I was dating another girl for a stretch as well. The singer girl is coming over next week to talk and I've cuddled with her too so apparently the weirdness isn't done with just yet.

I've only ever been monogamous and never friends with a girl much less this close to one who I wasn't dating. Not sure what I can learn from it tbh, and I still have this person's music gear in my apartment so I'll definitely be seeing them again at some point. Never felt this specific way about someone before, I cried like 2 months straight and even needed to see therapy to help deal with it. I'm fine now it's over but I don't want that intensity to happen again without being better prepared for it.",28Feb2020,1

She replied back saying that she used to have one for a few months, and at one point she had 40+ followers. She also told me she posted not full nudes, but like boob/ass teases, feet, her sucking things, etc. 

I shouldn't feel weirded out by this but I am. I'm into her, but this has sorta shook me and I'm not too sure how to feel about it as it's not something I tend to look for in someone. I know it doesn't define her, but at the same time it just feels so indescribably weird to me.",28Feb2020,1
391," My brother and his partner have asked me to donate. They asked me before when I was younger, I said no but maybe in the future. Now at 30 and them already having one child through ivf they've asked me again

Theres a lot of things going through my head, the easy thing would be to say no its too complicated and weird. Saying that it may be my one opportunity to have a child in some way, even if I dont raise it myself; they have said the child will be theirs but the child will be told I am the biological father and will not be prevented from having a close relationship with me as uncle/biological father. I have no idea how that will work out but in theory it could be nice.

Now heres where things get much more complicated. For one, me and my brother, even though are relationship isnt terrible and has improved somewhat over the years we arn't close either. In fact our relationship has been quite bad in some ways. He was always seemed abit resentful of me growing up, steal things from me, angry child, even as an adult he would do strange passive aggressive behaviour such as flaunt money at me when its a bit distasteful to do so, exclude me from any family photos (take photos when im not around). I think the cause he has never liked that im the older brother and he may have wished to be me in some ways, but whom knows really. As an adult even though I know he would be very loving towards a child, I don't particularly like his personality. He can be manipulative , ignorant (pretend not to hear people, talk over people) bossy. They have a child already and he makes a massive fuss over her and is very loving , hes also very loving towards animals and they bring out the best in him. My concern is when they become older and they are not this novel cute child anymore and some of his bad side starts to manifest. Its hard to gauge and look into future and imagine how good of a parent he would be but i have concerns.

Not only that but his partner and I used to date briefly , we are friends but If things start to breakdown between my bother and her. You can imagine a scenario where she turns to me and things get messy. This is something I can discuss with them as a concern but even then it doesn't guarantee it wont happen. My brother and her have a platonic relationship, Its no secret she finds me attractive still and it doesn't bother my brother he sometimes make jokes when he notice she is flirting with me to embarrass her. (I would say their relationship is based on a strong friendship and ultimately a desire to have children and a family) But still it makes the worried scenario of her turning to me more likely. So yeah thats my predicament.

392,"I don’t have any inclination to wear them myself, this is purely about women wearing them. I’m 27/m.

Since I was about 10 I’ve fetishised women’s nylon leg wear, mostly how their legs feel to the touch, but to a smaller extent how they look and even how they smell when brand new (not worn &amp; sweaty, keep that shit away).

I get distracted to a massive extent if I see women wearing them either in public or at work, and I can’t get off during sex with my girlfriend unless she’s wearing either tights or stockings, which occasionally puts a little strain on our relationship. The porn I watch (I know I need a porn detox - I’m working on it) involves only women wearing nylons and it’s really fucking with my testosterone levels and sexual performance - I have sex with my gf maybe once every 7-10 days. 

This fetish is so ingrained into my psyche and has been for such a long time, I’ve no idea if there’s any way of mitigating it or removing it completely. I feel like if I don’t do something I could end up getting into trouble (not to the extent of sexual harassment/assault) or end up cheating on my girlfriend (we were at a house party the other day, my gf went off to talk with her friends and i was left chatting with this girl who was fairly attractive and wearing black tights, we were sat at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and her leg kept brushing against mine, I had a raging erection and, had I been given the chance, probably would have cheated with her.

She refused to give me access to one system and told another employee that I was so far behind that I was not going to get access to this.  I told the manager about this and she said well you are behind compared to most people training this job. I had worked in the same area before but with paper charts and instead of electronic and having three screens Everything was right in front of me in a more tangible way
I had a really good cry in the bathroom after that for like 15 minutes while five different people came in to pee.  And I felt like I really didn’t have the strength to leave the bathroom and stop crying. There is nothing worse than a team of people thinking That you are stupid.
I told the girl training me who is super heartless that my dad had died nine months ago and she said very flatly, “I’m sorry to hear that.” Which is what we’re trained to say in customer service. Everybody talks about patients while on phones they place you on hold, talk about how stupid you are, and does not sympathize or empathize. I feel my genuine nature is being compromised by this position.  
I accidentally left my computer unlocked my second day to go to the bathroom, And the trainer girl impersonated me on their chat log announcing to the team that I was bringing donuts the next day.

I can no longer send her a frank, long, and honest message about how I feel and ask if I'm being a bother. That's what I've been doing, lowkey for the past week. So in order to move on, I asked her how's she's been then requested a picture of her. I'm planning to make a vector version of it. I told her it was for my school project. She said suree, no problem. Sent 5 photos, told me which one to pick.

Finished the artwork, sent it to her. Said "" I'm sleepy goodnight"". She said, ""thank you so much! It's so beautiful! But my ugly face is ruining it.""

402,"I'm currently in a country right now where there are a lot of cases for the Coronavirus (or Covid-19) and so sorry if I sound really paranoid. 

About an hour ago, some guy (I think 18-22) came up to me while I was walking and looking at my phone and put his hand on my shoulder and showed me something the size of a business card. He allowed me to touch it but  I didn't read it in time before he covered it with his hand and looked at me and asked for my age. I told him 13, (which I am btw) and started coughing before proceeding to walk away. He had a mask on and everything, but I rushed home to wash my hands anyway.

I'm honestly terrified that I might have the virus or that there other intentions he had, (like why would he ask for my age).

Anybody know what I should do and why he did such a thing? I've heard stories in the news of people deliberately spreading the Coronavirus in my country so maybe that was what he tried to do? Will I be okay? I don't know if washing my hands is enough. The only contact I had with him was the card that I touched and his hand on my shoulder.",28Feb2020,1

I caught him texting other girls on an app and he is denying of ever doing that and it wasn’t him. He tells me that someone made a fake account and etc.. nothing makes sense. I left him and he is crying and insisting for a year now that it wasn’t him.
Why would someone tell  an obvious lie? Chances that it wasn’t him fooling around on the app are like 0. He was a good bf before hand too. I feel like I am being gaslighted as he was sweet to me and I never expected him to do this behind my back. But then obviously that’s him on the app.

405,"So I’m pretty much on my feet for 7-8 hours standing and walking. My feet hurt a bit around 5-6 hours into my shift. I noticed that after I get home and take my shoes off the pain intensifies and my feet start to hurt pretty badly. Walking around the house makes the pain worse so I usually try not walk around too much once I’m home. The pain is mostly on my heel and that area below my toes.

Today is seems to me particularly bad. It’s been 5 hours since I took off my shoes and my feet still hurt. The pain isn’t as bad compared to when I first took my shoes off but it still hurts and I’m having a bit of trouble relaxing because of it. 

Is it normal for your feet to hurt like this after walking around and standing for a long period of time? Is it something I have to get used to?

407,"Hello. Forgive me if this sort of thing isn’t allowed, or if the wording is weird.

I’ve never made a post like this before. It’s past 4 in the morning and I’m just lying in bed, confused and completely exhausted.

It started around midnight, my boyfriend and I were settled in, eating dinner, watching the Witcher on Netflix for the 8th time, a normal quiet night with our cats. I have anxiety, so our nights are always quiet and nice.

My neighbor knocks on the door. She is in an abusive relationship. He is a drunk, has bashed her face open more than once, whipped her quite literally— with one of those necklace chain things. We have had to call the cops on this guy several times before. The short version of describing him is just... deadbeat abuser. Anyway. I open the door and she comes in, terrified. She’s carrying mace, and a pair of scissors, and he’s right behind her. She comes in, he does not. I shut and lock the door in his face. My boyfriend and I calm our neighbor down enough where she decides to bring the cat over for a bit (I was super confused at this, I’m assuming because it didn’t reek of alcohol and drugs in our home, since neither me or my boyfriend drink or do anything like that.)

She stays for dinner, the cat mingles with ours, ends up playing with our cat for a bit. All is well. She started spouting off about various conspiracy theories and fear mongering about the corona virus, and my boyfriend and I realized she wasn’t quiiiiite all there. Whether it was high off pot, drunk off alcohol, or some other drug buzz, we couldn’t place. I don’t pay attention to that sort of thing due to my father being an abusive addict himself. But I know what it looks like in a nutshell.

Anyway, At about 2, she said she had to go use the bathroom. While we have a bathroom and offered her to use it, I just assumed she had to go take a shit, because most ladies don’t like poopin’ unless it’s at home. Fine, okay, cool. No biggie! I get it. 

I distract myself, exhausted but not wanting to go to bed yet due to us having a cat that isn’t ours in our home, at that time. 

10 minutes pass. 20. 30. 45. An hour. I gingerly walk down the hall with her cat in my arms, knocking on her door to see if everything is okay. No answer. 

We wait for a bit, and her boyfriend comes back home. At this point it’s 3:30 AM, and he starts buzzing everyone on the floor’s doors. Since I’m up still, I hesitate letting him in to the building, but do it anyway as I know one of our other neighbors just had a baby. They need as much sleep as they can and shouldn’t have to deal with [gestures vaguely] this. 

I return to my apartment with no incident, listen to him knock on her door for a few minutes before everything falls quiet. I’m exhausted and want this cat back in his rightful home before I go to bed, and peek out to see if I can bring him back, yet. No, the guy passed out in the hallway and made the entire length of it absolutely reek of piss and booze. 

I hid back in my apartment, having a deep fear of people like that— especially since I have seen what he is capable of. My boyfriend and I talked, trying to come up with a solution. We opted to call the police, explain the situation, and see what could be done. We didn’t want to be accused of stealing someone’s cat. I don’t like cops. I don’t like them one bit. But I want it on record that I did try to give them their cat back. 

A cop comes out, wakes the guy up, and while I’m waiting in my apartment for news, manages to get the woman to open the door and let the guy inside. Cop assured us that neither of them were sober in the slightest, and he advised me to keep the cat here overnight and make a complaint to the landlord. 

Now, I already feel terrible for calling the police, but as an abuse survivor I know I can’t help everywhere. We’ve given her cat some food, water, and a folded blanket to sleep on along with a litter box, and he’s kept in the bathroom for now— as we don’t want him getting into anything overnight while we’re trying to sleep. I’ve called our landlord, as well, despite it being past 4 am. I let them know of the situation and asked what to do. 

Now, I just... don’t know what to do. This sort of situation has never happened to me before. Does anyone have any sort of advice? This is all just so bizarre. I’ve lost sleep over these people on more than one occasion, and this woman’s boyfriend makes me feel unsafe as hell living here. What do I do?????",28Feb2020,1

410,"Hey everyone. Really didn't know who to talk to about this; whenever I try to tell my friends the specific words that were said, I can't get anything to come out.

Some context: my mom was born in Jamaica, and came to the US at 18 for college. She was raised Protestant by her parents up until age 9, when they moved to the US for work. She was then left to live with her brother and an aunt, who maintained their religious beliefs. My mom had me at age 42 by a sperm donor, as she hadn't found anyone with whom she was happy enough to have a child. She then proceeded to get a master's degree from a really great school, which speaks to her dedication and stubbornness. I was born two months premature, an emergency c-section when my mom was told that she had pre-eclampsia at a normal doctor's appointment. Her faith was a huge part of getting her through the experience of my birth and subsequent time in the NICU, which led her to raising me Protestant from a young age. I grew up homophobic (lol) until age 11-ish, when I realized that old conservative beliefs were pretty fucked up to me, and I didn't actually vibe with them at all. 

I'll skip through my experience realizing my sexuality, because it's not really relevant for the story. If anyone wants it, though, I can add!

I told my mom I was bisexual in my sophomore year in high school. At first, she took it fine because she thought I was faking, which I found out later. I have some memory loss due to mental illness and other stuff, but I'm pretty sure I told her I had a crush on a girl and she didn't take it well. I was in the depths of an eating disorder at the time, so my mom took the liberty of reading through my text messages to see if she could find any evidence to confront me with—as you can see, she's really overbearing.

Somehow, in the spring of my sophomore year, she found messages from a senior in the play that I was in, who was a lesbian, that she deemed as ""seductive"". She came to the conclusion that I was being ""groomed by a sexual predator"", who in reality, was serving as kind of a surrogate sister during a tough time for me. She had also suffered through eating disorders, so I confided in her a lot and always asked for advice on how to deal with that. My mom also later deemed this to be causing my eating disorder, which was fully just not true. The girl and I were always really affectionate because that's just what our relationship, which was fully platonic, consisted of. During this time, I found emails on my mom's account coordinating with my school psychologist and a school in Jamaica to arrange for my transfer the upcoming fall. If I hadn't ended up in the hospital and subsequent treatment for my eating disorder, I strongly believe I would have started junior year in Jamaica. 

That summer, when I was inpatient for the first time, I wasn't allowed to put this girl on my contact list or send her mail because my mom wouldn't give me her address that I had written down at home. It became a huge issue in therapy, and never got fixed during my 2.5 months in treatment. 

Fast forward to junior year, when my friend told me that one of her female friends was single and wanted to go on a date. I thought the girl was cute, so I asked my friend for her number. We started talking, and hit it off pretty well. We hung out for the first time in a group event, at a concert with our now mutual friend who set us up, as well as another girl. My mom and the other girl's dad ended up coming to the concert with us, because they're helicopter parents. They both knew my friend who had set us up, but hadn't met the girl I was now ""talking to"". 

Our relationship kind of progressed from friendship into more over about two months. We had to go on our first date after two months because of how strict my mom was and how bad it would be for me if we were found out. So, one day, we planned to go to brunch. She came to my neighborhood and my mom was fully aware that it was happening. We ate at a restaurant and had a great time, and ended the day with a nice walk to the subway so she could go home. We held hands on the way there, and she kissed me before I left. 

My memory gets a bit fuzzy here, but at some point in the future (maybe a few days or weeks?) my mom asks me if what I did with the girl was a date. I denied it, of course, to which she told me that a neighbor saw us getting ""too friendly at the restaurant"". That hadn't happened, as we only shared a brief hug when we were getting food. I freaked out when she started to call me a d\*ke and telling me my grandfather was rolling over in his grave. I don't remember a lot more of the specifics of what she said, so I'll list the parts that I have snippets of:

\- calling me a lesbian when I repeatedly told her that I was bi (nothing wrong with being a lesbian, of course)

\- told me I was going to burn in hell

\- started outing me to my relatives, who are all devout Jamaican Christians

\- cried herself to sleep (this one makes me feel really sad and guilty but I don't think I did anything wrong? I regret coming out so much now because of it, but I'll save that bit for later)

\- telling me that she regrets not having a man in the house/a father figure because it's probably what made me gay

The kicker, and the one that I think really fucked me up, was the following: graphically describing sex acts and condemning them in front of my godmother, who she had brought over to pray for me. My mom confided in my godmother, who I'm not really close with at all, and brought her over to the house to pray over me and ask God to fix me or something along those lines. They did so, and I sat there. Eventually I got angry and upset, and kept telling her that it wasn't a choice and God made me this way. My mom was furious, and said some variation of the following: ""it's absolutely a \[jamaican curse word that basically means f\*ck/f\*cking\] choice to suck on someone's p\*ssy"". My godmother told her to stop, and I think she cried. 

I somehow managed to make my mom think that it was actually just a phase and I'm not into girls, after all (I had to break it off with the girl I went on the date with. I feel horrible about it to this day). I feel like such a fraud and a coward for lying like this, but it's for my own safety right now. I'm experiencing so much guilt about lying to my mom, but I know that if she found out I'm still bi, she would likely go batshit crazy and maybe even stop paying for college. Still, it's college and I have really low self esteem, and I really wanted to feel wanted by someone. Because of this, I met a girl on a dating app who I have kind of a friends with benefits relationship with. We met about a month ago, and had a sleepover in my dorm room, which eventually led to sex. I'm planning on sleeping over at her house this weekend, under the guise of visiting my friend at a college nearby. My mom would be driving me (she won't let me take the train there), and I would have to take pictures with my friend as evidence to send throughout the night when she checks in. I feel so fucking shitty about this part, because I'm hiding a lot of other stuff from my mom right now related to my mental health. This situation with the girl I'm seeing, though, has honestly helped my self esteem in a different way than I've ever experienced. I think it's truly good for me, and I wish I could share it with my mom, but I'm not prepared enough to risk my safety or livelihood by telling her.

I'm currently at a crossroads, unable to decide what to do. I could do the following:

1. Go hang out with the girl this weekend and have a great time, but be stressed the entire time and risk my mom finding out
2. Tell the girl I can't do it, which would risk us having to break up the situation, which we're both really enjoying

413,"There are 5 of us living in a shared house, we are all reasonably close and good friends. We are all young adults making minimum wage. One of them is going to Asia to travel for two months and we are trying to arrange for someone to rent their room while they're away. However, they are under the impression that if we can't get someone to fill the room then we should split the rent 5 ways because they won't be using the space and would do the same for us.

I am 100% opposed to this because I see it as basically us paying for them to go travelling and that even though they aren't using the room, we are keeping the space for them and therefore it is still their responsibility to pay the rent. Another housemate agrees with them and said they didn't find an issue with splitting the rent as it is only an extra X amount a week. 

I feel like I am taking crazy pills, am I the one being unreasonable? They said they would be able to pay us back with ""reserves"" if it came down to that but I don't understand why they can't use those ""reserves"" to pay the rent.

So I want to move to London to be closer to work and live in central London. 

In order to do this I decided I will rent. I still want to save a decent amount every month so decided to cancel my gym membership and sell my car (I hardly use it) those are my biggest expenses.

Now if I do that I will be spending all my money that I would on travel gym and car on rent instead so I can still save.

I don’t know if it is a good idea to rent or should I stay at home and save as much as I can. Even if I did have a deposit for a house my salary and the fact I’m single makes it hard to get a mortgage also I don’t like the idea of being responsible for a house what if I lose my job etc.

415,"Hey everyone, sorry this is going to be a long post.
An incident happened recently. I have a guy friend who is seriously a very kind soul. He recently moved back home and I guess he doesn't know a lot of people there. 
Anyway so he got enamoured by this girl at his gym. He said he found her ""intriguing"". I encouraged him to strike a conversation but he was unsure because he didn't want to come off as a creep. 
Over the next week or so a few words were exchanged, nothing great. Nothing to make him feel like she was interested. So he slid into her DMs with an innocuous ""Hi would you like to hang out sometime"". That's it, no other messages. Next thing he knows some guy is messaging him calling him a creep, threatening him, telling him to ""watch and wait"". And he is getting calls from his gym. 

And I am so torn about this. As a feminist, I want to empathize with the girl because she should never have to feel uncomfortable. On the other hand I hate this situation because I know my friend is super nice (and not in a nice guy trope way). I don't know what to say to him. Part of me almost told him to be careful when he talks to girls, and that makes me mad at myself because that's an excuse that chauvinists use all the time.

Hello everyone,

I work in a new subsidiary of a very big pharma company in Europe.

The subsidiary is in the scale-up phase and there's a lot of growth to be expected. That means up to 200+ people need to be staffed asap.

Everytime a referred individual is hired, the employee who referred the new hire gets a substantial bonus in the next payslip

I've been referring people like crazy to take advantage of this because I think our HR and the staffing companies are not looking for candidates in the right places. (they are using oudated technology and they don't know the market they're operating in. Plus, they don't get any referral bonus because they're doing this full time). Having graduated in the city the company operates in I have quite a good network and I know the demographics, interests, and habits of potential candidates that would apply to this job in the blink of an eye if only they knew about this opportunity.

This is where my idea comes in. I have no idea if it would be legal and/or if it jeopardizes my job.

I'm thinking of making a fake staffing company profile on various social media, having a nice website with a CV submittal form and also a dedicated communication channel, run my own ad campaign with my own money as an investment and get recruits this way.

The ad campaign would be run like any other staffing/recruitment company:

no use of any of my company trademarks. In fact, I wouldn't even mention the name of my employer until it's time to refer. Every referred individual will eventually mention my name on their application form which could be a risk if any of this goes against guidelines or it's illegal.

I would ask HR but i'm sure they'll tell me no because it wouldn't be the ""professional"" way to hire individuals.

I have already referred 8 people, the hiring manager tells me he appreciates my efforts but i'm afraid this would be too much.

do you guys have any advice? I could potentially buy a house by referring about a hundred individuals.",28Feb2020,1

435,"Hello! I'm soon graduating uni (studying game development) and I kind of need to start looking for a job. While I try applying for something basic to begin with, just to have some sort of income, I want to work with writing later on.

How do you create a portfolio as a writer, specifically as a narrative designer for video games? I have a couple short stories I've written, unfinished game design documents, essays and reports from classes at uni, some game prototypes I've made with Twine 2 and poetry pieces.

What can I use in my portfolio? How do you present a portfolio to someone, and to whom do I show it? Do I have a digital portfolio or do I print it out on paper, and how would that work with the game prototypes? Do I put complete pieces in the portfolio or do I only use the best parts of each piece? How do the people who look at portfolios evaluate them and what parts and details do I need to think about?

437,"I met a girl.

In the 3 weeks dating time we talked a lot about mental health: She gave me some pretty good advice and analyzed me to the bones without me realizing.

I had to cut some stuff out for privacy:

She told me she is not able to get into a Relationship because of her past. She assured me, that it was because of her and not because of me. It didn't seem like a shortterm decision, because she told me 3 days prior to this that she would like to talk to me on the phone.

On the phone she did not only tell me that she doesn't want a relationship, she also doesn't want to ""loose me as friend"" and hopes that we could at least be that. 

I asked her if its possible for me to change her mind and if not I am willing to get into a friendship. (Because it's better than loosing her completly...but)


Fast forward a bunch of days:

We met again in Bar, I came a little bit late because I needed to finish some stuff. At my arriving she was pretty drunk, but no problem, she is happy, laughing. There are two other dudes and a girl there, all of them pretty chill, we get along very well. 

But as the night is going by, I realize she sort of flirts with this one dude. 

Also she starts dropping comments about pretty sketchy stuff. (Like: ""Good Thing that word doesn't make round here."" meaning she can do a lot without other people knowing) Note: She is still pretty drunk, drunk people say a lot of real stuff.

At one point I kinda felt like I was starting to be third wheeling, and me beeing only a ""friend"" what the fuck could I do. So I left.

Now I am just thinking about all the stuff she told me, and I don't know if I can stay in a ""friendship"" with her. 

I had a similar situation like this once, and it fucked me up pretty well. I don't want to be someone who gets played with like that. Not another time. I don't want to see her flirting with other dudes. I don't want to be the guy you can do everything with....

But I also don't want to loose her. She gave me so many new perspectives on my live. It would be fucked up to throw her away like that. 

So my question is: Am I overreacting? Am i getting played with? And what the fuck should I do now?",28Feb2020,1
439,"Hey reddit. I made this account just to ask this question, It's a really nuanced topic and I'm struggling to make a conclusion on how I should treat this situation. The problem involved two friends of mine. For context, These friends had been dating for around a year before they broke up. We're all between 13-15 now. Okay, So.. My friends who were dating at the time did a lot of sexual things together. There was never any penetration but they'd do things like fingering. It's been a year since these two broke up, And one of the friends ( we'll call him R ) always spoke not-favouringly about the sexual encounters, Things like ""it was boring"" or ""i couldn't be bothered"". But now he's calling his ex boyfriend a rapist. His ex, Who is one of my closest friends, Is really just confused and so am I. It really upset him because he never wanted to force himself on anyone, And he was under the impression that it was consensual. R says he never said no because he felt pressured to please his boyfriend at the time, But the ex insists that R always seemed enthusiastic. It's an iffy subject and there's more to it but I don't have enough time to write out every little detail. I don't want to pick sides because that's not appropriate, Especially for a subject like this, But how do I deal with it when R is telling me about how he feels regarding the experiences? R has been really passive aggressive and mean to me when I ask questions, I get that, But he's actively pushing me away. I think another important detail is that everytime we talk about it and i try to understand him, He makes the issue about something else. Suddenly the problem isn't that he was assaulted, but instead that we bully people or that we're a group of freaks. I really don't want to be a victim blamer or victim shamer, But it's come out of nowhere? I don't mean it in a 'you didn't say before so it's not true' kind of way, It just seems like he's saying it as a front for other issues he has with me being friends with his ex.

440," So let me keep this brief and keep the angst to a minimum...

College didn't go so well for me, (my dad's drinking problem + financial issues really made it very difficult to progress), so in 2018 when I was 21-22 years old, I decided to go to a coding bootcamp and become a developer.

In my coding bootcamp I had a great experience at first, it was a unique place where people of colour from ""lower income neighborhoods"" in the city of Boston could be payed a stipend to code, I really enjoyed it, there was a great community, I made a lot friends, and got a job a couple weeks after graduation. However, there were some issues.

I was one of the youngest people there, average age was around 27 - 30. Maybe because being so young I soaked up information like a sponge and graduated at the top of my cohort. However, I guess the nature of the startup began to show its ugly head, and it being a place for ""people from the hood"" to get real jobs, some people started to really bring ""the hood"" to the workplace.

One person would often come into the office drunk, stay late hours, even break beer bottles and start fights with other people, in front of staff, and nothing was done about it. Eventually this person had finally began to target me, first name calling, then making memes of me and posting it into our slack channel, then harassing (borderline sexual harassment) to students I was trying to mentor/tutor, and finally sending me pictures of him holding guns and actually challenging me to a fight at the office, saying ""he would be waiting for me on Thurdays"" they day I had to come in every week to meet with my mentors.

Because of the threats I was recieving, scared for my own safety because I don't know what his person was capable of, along with the continuing issues of my father's drinking at home, the culmination of prolonged stress made me quit my job.

Since then, my professional life has been cut pretty much short. After less than a year of professional web dev experience, I tried to go into the Air Force, but was denied a waiver due to my asthma, and speech impediment that would very much limit what job I could get anyway.

In 2019 I went back to college to finish my degree and work retail, but AGAIN, in a drunken episode, my father started to become violent with me, and for the last time, I had to leave mid-semester and stay with another relative.

It's now 2020, I am 23 almost 24, I've been coding on the side all this time, but I need to get a job again, but I have this huge gap since Nov 2018, I have had no work experience.

In hindsight I probably should not have quit what I had in Boston, but I was young, already full of anxiety, suffered from daily panic attacks since high school that were never treated, and getting migraines and tension headaches so bad I could not focus on my work anyway.

When I start to interview at companies again, what should I tell them when they ask me ""What was I doing in my gap""? Should I just tell them I was going to school? I've been going to college for 4 years and do not have a degree, I'm not even close. Do I tell them that I left my old position at a startup because of workplace harassment?

I'm really at a loss here, and would like some kind of reddit advice........

First week: small talk, started to become acquainted
Second time: more small talk, getting further acquainted
Third time: becoming certified acquaintances, finding out about our interests and free time
4th week: probably about as much small talk as week 2/second time

453,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible... maybe skip question this unless you like lame problems with spiderweb-like complexity.

My Aunt is my employer of 19 years. I live in Toronto, not 5 minutes from my grandmother who is turning 99 in April. My Aunt is hosting a birthday for my Grandmother in Windsor (3.5 hours drive from Toronto at best) because her brother (92) and all extended family live out that way - my Aunt is basically hosting everyone - hotels, dinners, and the gathering appears to be at a casino. They did this last year, we couldn't come but I am feeling pressured that it 'may be her last, and it'll technically be her 100th year').

My wife and I suffer from depression and anxiety. When my OTHER grandmother turned 90 2 years ago, we had been uncertain about going but RSVP'd - we aren't very comfortable with that side of the family. The day of, my wife had a migraine (she suffers from very bad migraines from time to time - this was one where we nearly ended up in the hospital) so instead of me travelling up alone (1.5 hours from the city), I stayed home to take care of my wife and be on standby if we needed to go to the hospital. It was gut-wrenching when I got a call from my brother who yelled at me for not coming, he didn't care that I felt it was necessary to take care of my wife and he just short of accused her of lying to get out of the event. Also, we're vegan. We were told there would be little accommodation for us (drinks, fruit &amp; veggie trays), aside from our presence there, we didn't leave anyone at a disadvantage, but it's bothered me every day since. Two years later I feel my family dynamic is breaking down; like my wife and I are weird, shitty hermits.

Now for the tricky bit - our senior dog just had surgery on his teeth and a hernia removed, we have two cats. My aunt (my EMPLOYER) has gone ahead and booked us na AirBnB with my brother, his wife and two kids and is expecting my wife and me to attend and is pushing for an answer by tomorrow. I thought it was for one night which we're already uncertain if we can find someone to sit our pets, especially to have an answer by tomorrow. I'm a 36-year-old depressed and anxious and reclusive guy, I realize as I sit here, what the hell happened to my limited friend base; I have next to nobody, let alone people I can trust to stay at my place to take care of my pets and have a solid commitment by tomorrow. And they've never been put into boarding and I'm positive my wife would never agree to that, she works in the industry. We've got someone slated to look after our pets for 2 weeks in September but that was secured months ago, and that's only because my wife sits for their pets, they won't know if they can do this weekend for us until about a week out, let alone by tomorrow.

It turns out this event is actually 3 nights. Friday-Monday. There is just no way I can get anyone to commit to doing this for us in such a short period of time, my family, MY BROTHER, my Aunt (MY EMPLOYER) are all going to judge us as shitty, anti-social hermits which I am positive people already think we are. I will also mention reluctantly that I can't just go out there myself. As above, I said that the event will be at a Casino.

I tried to take my life a few years ago from depression and anxiety, a byproduct of that was a psychiatrist who put me on a gambit of medication, one of which was called Abilify. Very long story short, I began to gamble for 7 months straight, nearly to the day, completely in sync with the medication, it was an impulse I couldn't control or understand at the time. It was terrifying, it nearly cost me my marriage. In speaking with my family doctor and pulling records from my pharmacist, we've all but confirmed this stage of my life was due to Abilify, a known side effect of which is impulse control including the random and terrifying urge to gamble - there is now a lawsuit as it was never a warning on the medication in Canada up until the end of October 2016 if memory serves. I have been in GA since, great support, great people, even though it was likely the 'medication',  I need to remain diligent in my accountability, so I feel shame. All of the time.

Anyways. I am uncomfortable stepping into a Casino, WITH my wife or ESPECIALLY alone, my family will likely ask if I can come alone if we are unable to find someone to look after our pets. I'm not afraid of gambling - I will not gamble; it'll be 4 years since I last gambled in May. I have absolutely 0 impulses or urges, just like before the medication and shortly afterward. I am immeasurably concerned about what it'll do to my psyche. I am petrified and ashamed of gambling and I don't want to be anywhere near that environment. I can't see myself being much fun around my family.

So.

What the @#$! can I do? I don't know how to back out of this. I don't know how to commit to this with the pets, and even if we compromised and I went alone (to which i'll feel like shit without my partner and she'll worry endlessly) and have to spend my time in a Casino, my own personal nightmare. I don't know how to proceed without my extended family, my brother, his family and my aunt (my employer) and everyone else being extremely disappointed, or worse. I don't know how to tell my Aunt WHY I cannot go alone (past gambling addiction). 

My grandmother (as above) is 5 minutes up the road. Why the piss couldn't we just pop by for cake and spend some time together.

Anyways, thank you. I hope this has been riveting, if not confusing, and that someone can see this from a perspective I'm not able to right now.",28Feb2020,1

455,"My father and I were never close, we live together and it feels like he's a random roommate. Heck, we never even sat down and talked just to talk. I don't know anything about him, and he doesn't know anything about me. He taught me how to bike when I was 8 and that's the only memorable part of our relationship that I can remember. He never spent time with both my mother and I (well, mainly after they had me) unless we are eating with him and he's drinking.

My father is subtly verbally manipulative/abusive to my mother when he is intoxicated. I'm not sure exactly what he says but he twists his words to make it seem like my mother is at fault and he is not. This happens when he is drunk, and then once he's sober he acts like nothing happened and is quiet.

A few months ago, I decided to write a long text to my father talking about how I feel like we're not close and that we should talk and spend more time together and that he can feel comfortable with talking to me about his problems. It took a lot of courage to send this, because we never talk or call or anything. He replied with a smiley emoji and nothing else. 

I believe that my father has deep-rooted inner issues from a combination of environment, life experiences, traditional toxic-masculinity mindset. (like when he says: ""daughters should listen to mothers"" as an excuse to not bother talking to me or caring about my life) 

I'm not sure, but it feels like my relationship with my father has affected my personal life such as self-confidence, self-worth, etc. 

It also feels like it's affected my dating life. I am afraid of long-term commitment and control by another person and tend to get bored of those who are ""good"" for me, yet I also crave the feeling of being loved, especially from those who are ""bad"" for me and those who don't actually value me. I end good relationships, yet I always seek for reassurance and affection from bad relationships. This is why I always seem to end up in short-term relationships, unsure of how I feel, which leads to endings. I put physical affection more value over emotional, because I'm afraid of long-term commitment, yet I also want the emotional aspect at the same time.

Based on that, I can’t tell if he feels the same and is just hiding it or if he is really good at separating emotion from sex.

465,"Account is a throwaway, including the false name.

Small background, I'm a student studying my second out of third year in Aeronautics. Wasn't that bad in year 1, got a GPA of about 3.6. But at the end of year 1, I found out i absolutely loathe the course. Not only have I lost interest in Aeronautics, I strongly dislike the idea of being an Engineer in general.

This was due to a class of Career Guidance where the class was told that as an Engineer, we would play as an ""advisor"" sort of role and lead a team or something. Human interactions is something I dislike but won't avoid if I'm forced to. The real problem would be being a leader. That is a role I can never see myself in. I need orders to act most of the time and to be asked to make orders for others instead? I'd be cluelessly stuck. To add on, I have a significant amount of mental indecisiveness and cannot bring myself to assign roles and orders.

From there, I've been in a constant cycle of ""just finish the third year"" and ""fuck it, i don't really care if i get dropped"". As of now, I'm leaning further and further into the latter. This of course doesn't fare well for my grades and I'm hanging a little above 2.

  
Sure, I could just drop the course and do something else. Problem is, I don't know what I have an interest in. The dullness of study and life seems to have blacked out the dreams i may have had at some point. As well as that, this isn't the first time I've ran away from a course/something I disliked. If I decided to drop the course, I'd have wasted 4 years at this point (2 from this, and 2 from another). But if I don't drop it, I'd need to pick myself up in this course (which I cannot find the motivation at all to for a long time).

466,"I'm 17 and have been driving for a year without insurance. For the past year, it wasn't a huge deal that I had no insurance since I only drived a collective amount of like 10 miles a week. My school and work were extremely close to my house. However, just recently I moved to a new house and my work and school are now farther away. It went from putting gas in my car once every 2 months to now once every 2 weeks. 

As such, I now feel extremely uncomfortable driving without car insurance. As a little bit of background, my entire family has always been a bit poor. I only have my mom and she only makes 30,000 a year, while i have a part time job and I only make 250-300 a month. Actually, it took her 8 years to save up and buy this house and she has to pay $1,000 a month for 4 years to pay it off.

As such, she has never wanted to buy car insurance for herself and me ever. I didn't mind too much since my mom has drivin successfully for 30 years and like i said, my predicament didn't worry me about car insurance. However, since I'm driving large distances and will even start commuting to college with a 30 minute drive to there and back, I REALLY want car insurance. 

Since I'm first insured in the family, I am looking at $250 a month for car insurance. Obviously, I can't be working my whole part time job just for car insurance since I need to save up for college and I got other home bills to pay. 

With recent home bills, bills in general, and providing for myself and my sister, she can just BARELY afford car insurance. After getting in a fight with her last night about me wanting insurance vs her telling me just to be careful, she texted me this morning telling me she felt bad and would pay for it completely.

I feel awful. I REALLY want insurance, but at the same time I feel absolutely awful making my mom pay for it since she alteady haa so much on her plate. 

What should I do?",28Feb2020,1

468,"I have this friend who is really needy. They constantly dump their personal problems to me and I just can't deal with it anymore. It feels like I exist just for them. 

  
Time is a luxury I do not afford, I have to work, take care of my younger siblings and juggle my academics. I rarely have time to myself. The little time I have left after is taken up by them. I flaked out on them before and they turned and told me that I wasn't there when they needed me the most.   
I feel sick to my stomach because I know deep inside me that I'm starting to hate them. I really looked up to them and hoped to be their friend some time ago. Now that I'm their friend, I'm starting to regret it. They chalk it up to mental illness and they are constantly depressed and anxious, hence they need constant attention. 

What really pissed me off was their SO calling me in the middle of the night saying that my friend is having a breakdown and I need to be there ASAP. I didn't go. I had personal things going on at that moment too, why can't I put myself first?   


Every time they call or text, I ask myself ""What is their problem now?"". How do I deal with this friend? Do I dump them? Talking with them does not work because they take it personally and it might send them into a spiral. I feel like a horrible friend because I feel like I'm just faking the friendship now.",28Feb2020,1

475,"So I work in a mostly conservative environment, so most of my managers and coworkers go by the whole stereotypical man of how you should be and are just very conservative in general. Last week my direct manager called me and my other coworker into the office and told us our new schedule is going to be me 8-5 and my coworker, 7-3:30.

I'm not fully against working 8-5 if it would work, but it just won't and I fear that he knows this already. I spoke with him in August about being able to work from home because I needed to devote a lot of my days to my son and his therapies and school. He signed off and had me sign a contract stating I could work from home as needed. This meant I would only be in the office maybe 2-3 days a week and sometimes not even full days. I know this put a strain on my coworkers because our boss still wanted someone in the office between 7-5, usually split between my coworkers and I. I kinda assumed since this schedule was OK'd that it was just kind of a thing that they knew wasn't going to work.

Well after he told us about this schedule I talked to him and explained that I still have a lot of therapies for my son, and that daycare for my 9 month old closes at 5:30 so I wouldn't be able to pick him up in time either at his current daycare. He basically told me to switch all of my sons therapies to the morning, and switch my sons daycare to one closer. 

The therapies can't just change on a whim and even if they could, there's no guarantee I can get all of them back to back. The daycares for my baby all either have waiting lists or cost about $100 more than our current one and even if I get one closer to me, I would have to drop him off to my wife before I go to school, and wouldn't have enough time thus being late to school, which is for and paid for by my job. This would also mean putting my eldest son in after-school care which makes me spend another $60 a week.

Add on top of this, he doesn't want me working from home anymore, because he says were slow enough that all of our work can get done at the office. So that means, taking off for my sons therapies is going to cut into my paycheck. I asked if I overstepped by working from home, and he said I did nothing wrong, just that he wants everyone in the office now.

I asked about switching with my coworker, except my coworker likes the new schedule, and my manager says 8-5 is my schedule because he says so.

He basically told me to just figure it out, and that it sucks I'd have to pay more money, but that's life. I agree that's life, but all of these problems would be easier if I had the 7-3:30 shift and he should know that as I've explained my situation to him before.

My fear is that he knows I'm not going to be able to make it work and use it as an excuse to fire me. I could be being paranoid, but why else would he do this knowing how my life is? I was thinking of sending an email to him and copying my branch manager just explaining I'm trying whatever I can to make it work but that it's just proving more difficult. I just fear this is going to come off as whiny and almost like I'm snitching on my direct manager to my branch manager, especially with the environment this office is.I mostly just want to send the email so it's documented that we had a conversation about this and just everything I'm trying and that it might not be able to work as immediate as he would like.

Any advice for this situation if needed.

476,"I know that I’ve dealt with low self-esteem my entire life. I take everything seriously and am rather harsh on myself most of the time. I believe what people say to me and have trouble saying no. Unfortunately, my self-esteem has plummeted while being in college as guys would tell me that I’m rather average and seem to judge me and other women based on appearance. Mind you, these guys are also average and don’t take care of their appearance that much. Yikes. I know I should just brush off their words, but it seems to make me more unconsciously insecure. Whenever I see a guy I’m interested in, I automatically think that no way, he’s going to ever be interested in me because of my appearance. I keep telling myself guys only like pretty girls and I should just give up, because no matter how much I try I’ll still be average. I know my mentality is so skewed and unhealthy but it feels like something ingrained in me. It sounds bad, but I often settle for guys who end up just using me because I’m the closest available girl. I have lost trust in guys if I have to be honest, and think that I will never meet a decent guy. I think it’s because I’m starting to feel lonely and want to be in a relationship, that I feel this way.

The big issue is that I can't play any audio through the phone speakers or the app trying to play audio, or in most cases, the phone will just instantly restart.

Before we met in person I had done some Facebook stalking just to make sure he was who he said he was. Yes, it was him. I was able to find a lot about him.. including that he has a child. I didn’t care at all I just wondered why he didn’t tell me. I thought maybe when we met in person he would.. but he didn’t. And still hasn’t. 

Then, a few days ago he messaged my other reddit account and lied to me over and over saying his account was hacked and that he couldn’t get into it... after I even sent a screenshot of it to him. He continued to lie. 

Now this morning. I had mentioned the Facebook thing for this reason. I had noticed he had either blocked me or deleted his fb after we met in person. Didn’t really think anything of it.

495," 

Let me start this thread by saying I am nineteen year old college student.

In my life I had only one girlfriend which left me roughly 8 months ago. There was nothing wrong with breakup, but after a couple of months I began missing her and feeling a little depressed. Well, I would understand my behavious if I were emotionally involved in relationship. Tbh I didn't care about her too much and she was more of a trophy to me than an actual girlfriend. She really liked me, but I wasn't satisfied with relationship (I wasn't going after sex at all) and wanted to break up with her. I didn't because I was not able to have enough empathy if she would start crying or do something similar. I spent some time on red pill, but didn't become intoxicated like many people there. This girl was 10 if such scale existed and she was interested in me. We began dating cuz why not. As a guy who was shorter and excelled academically who was always deprived of attention from girls this was once in life opportunity.

(If it actually means anything to you I am 19 now and was 18 then. She was 15.) Please do not do some pedo or FBI jokes because it is perfectly normal in my country.

The real problem is that I wasn't satisfied with relationship and I know for the fact if we were together again I would get bored in two weeks. Despite everything written I still somehow miss her. It may be due to creating idealistic image about or just not having enough experience with girls. I am a bit of socialy inept, but improved my skills greatly when I started reading books on body language and psychology. I am somewhat good looking (got a lot of remarks about my looks from many girls). There were a couple of very attractive girls interested in me, but I would always ruin my chances by being inexperienced. Before I was acting like stereotypical nice guy. I improved myself now.

The fact that concernes me the most is the fact that I started missing my ex when she got new boyfriend. That made me really insecure. It sounds somewhat contrary to what I wrote before, because I wanted this to happen and thought she would never find someone like me( yes, I know it sounds really narcissistic :( )

Add a couple more problems which are not mentioned here and you get recepie for beginning of depression. (This is very sad because I claimed to my girlfriend I could never be depressed, but here I am 8 months later).

I am looking for advice from someone who was in similar position. Also please do not write things like

""you are sick"" (heard that from my friends. After that didn't need to talk to them again) ""don't behave like blue pill"" and things like that. If you don't have some concrete advice don't post anything. Thanks in advance

I like G and he's a good guy, but it really upsets me that J has practically forgotten about me because of how much he is basically in love with G.

500,"Hey all, looking for some advice on leaving a job that I only started 5 months ago . I’ll start by outlining the situation to you.

I’m a Stationary Engineer 3rd class, I started a job recently with a hospital with rotating 12 hour day and night shifts. The job was advertised and marketed to me as a part time role, 80% scheduled hours with 20% casual. Every document I received stated the job would be as a stationary engineer at this specific hospital, so I moved to within 40km of the town that hospital was in. After starting at the hospital it was revealed to me I would be expected to work at two other hospitals that are day shift only with on-calls over night, this was not discussed with me prior to accepting the job as I would have turned it down knowing this. To make matters worse one of the hospitals is 120km away from me and they are potentially expecting me to work full time (both my 80% scheduled shifts and 20% casual hours) to fill in for an employee on disability at this hospital, the role at this hospital is not as a Stationary Engineer but just as general maintenance however I’m still paid my usual rate.

I spoke to the person I replaced (they moved into a full time role) and he told me they pulled the same thing on him, although he lived closer to the other hospital so it was less of an issue. He showed me a clause in the union contract that allowed them to assign me to any hospital in the province, so I have no recourse with my union. 

Knowing what I know now I can’t continue to work there long term. I currently have job offer elsewhere I intend on accepting, it’s more money and they’ll pay for me to obtain a 2nd Stationary engineers certificate but it offers less job security.

Basically the advice I’m asking for is how to best quit my current role. While I’m upset I’ve been put in this position, I’d like to hand in my notice in the best manner possible while also offering them an explanation as to why I’m leaving. 

My current plan was to hand in a generic notice and just explain to my manager why I don’t think the role I’m working is the same role I was offered. I have a print out of the job advertisement and my final offer and neither mentions the other hospitals or the fact I’d be expected to work on-call at night. I’d like to convey that my biggest issue is the on-call as it really means that the company owns my time outside of work, and I would not have taken the position knowing this as I feel it is obviously a major part of the position and should have been mentioned before hand.",28Feb2020,1
501,"Throwaway account because friends know my personal account. 

I feel incredibly stupid for posting this but I recognise an issue and don’t know how I can change it and could really use some advice.

So I (F21) am a board member of my student association. Which is something I was incredibly excited for in the beginning but has now been causing me some problems. Before getting started people asked me if I could deal with difficult people, I told them yes, I could stand my ground even if I am a fairly small and not at all intimidating girl. Now I am not so sure anymore.

There is a division of tasks that is made clear to the student association so people should be able to know who to contact for which problems. I often only hear about problems or situations regarding my tasks from the other person in a similar position to me. That bothered me before, as I felt like people didn’t trust me to solve their problems but I decided to blame that feeling on my depression and that seemed to help a bit. It was all in my head, no need to worry. I only voiced my concerns with my close friend who is also on the board.

However, a few weeks ago something happened that brought this feeling back to the surface and has been bothering me ever since. 
As board member, you each have certain groups to supervise and one of these groups has just started up and fell under my supervision. I have been trying to get the group structurised and help them get on their way as it is a really important group. 

Last week there was one issue I wanted to discuss with a group of four: me, the other girl on the board with a similar position, and two guys that managed the group. 
They set a date when they wanted to meet and I told them that wouldn’t work for me as both me and one of the guys had another meeting at that time but I would be glad to look at other dates.The other people  proceeded to say that it was okay and they didn’t really need me there anyway. They met without me and while it certainly hurt and felt like they didn’t need me at all, I decided to ignore that feeling and move on from it.

Now today the other girl on the board (who is also the girl I confided in about my struggles) sent me a message asking me if I could do one really basic task related to the issue they had discussed without me. I told her I wasn’t sure as I wasn’t there and wouldn’t know if I would be the best person to do so. 
She told me that it was still my task and “no offense” but it seemed like I had just let go of one of my responsibilities.
That definitely hurt as it felt like they were the ones kicking me out of that group. I told her that, and that I didn’t feel taken seriously.

She got mad at me and told me that me not feeling taken seriously has gotten out of hand and we would talk about it next week.

I feel incredibly down now. I am aware that this is an issue I have and while I tried ignoring my feelings before by only sharing them with her and not acting on them any more, the issue I discussed above was something I felt I was right to feel excluded. 

I want to solve this issue, I don’t want to feel excluded when it supposedly isn’t happening but I have no idea how and could really use some advice on how to deal with the issue in general and this situation in particular.

TL;DR: I am in a high position in my student association but feel like no one is taking me seriously for it and want to know how I could change feeling this way",28Feb2020,1

505,"Hey Reddit,

So I am currently suffering from the best dilemma I have ever had in my entire life and need some advice to know what to do next...

Some background: I’m from NJ and just moved to LA for an internship while i finish up my last semester in college from online classes. I moved here because I wanted to be an agent more than anything. Well, I did it, I have an interview at one of the biggest agencies next week for their internship program which will than lead into their agent training program which is my absolute dream job at my first pick company. 

However, rn the internship I have is at a management company where we frequently collaborate with this agency for our clients. Agents/ managers are on different sides of the coin, working together for the client’s future and securement of projects. I work 3 days a week for this company rn but the agency requires i also work 3 days if i get the job, which i know i will. How do I approach my current boss and ask to take an extra day off, and if working at this other company is a conflict of interest? Do i just say i need to take a day off for financial reasons and not the agency i will be working for? I love my current company but don’t want to anger them in any way as i am one of the most skilled and trustworthy interns they have where they trust me to takeover larger responsibilities than the others. But i also want to perform the best for this company as it is where i want my future to be. Any ideas on how to approach this situation?

Thanks so much for reading and your input!",28Feb2020,1

The issue is that these things are self-imposed. It's like watching someone you care about actively run into traffic and then vent about how cars shouldn't exist. 

There are solutions, active solutions that will at least do SOMETHING, that I've tried to provide to help him. Even if they don't all work, he could at least one of them.

I cannot keep seeing someone I care a great deal about consistently stay in, put themselves in, and fail to try to work through difficult situations that do have solutions.

512,"New to this subreddit so bear with me here, but I’m coming here instead of AITA because this seems like a better community to give me advice: 

I have a half sister (I hate using the term half, but just so you understand where I’m coming from, here you are) who is 13 years younger than me. She was conceived by my dad and another woman. I learned of her almost 8 years ago now.

One of the terms for me to have a relationship with my dad (who was absent from my life) when we reconnected is that he not do the same to my sister and so what he could to be an active part of her life. He hasn’t been active in her life and barely active in mine. He never wanted her (he only wanted one child and that was me)(he even dropped the rope on my only “full” related sibling)  but his girlfriend at the time “trapped him” (I personally think it takes 2 to tango) because she wanted a child and he felt like he should do the right thing and “stay.” However, my sister’s mom got direly sick and my dad was serving yet another prison sentence so her grandparents (her mom’s parents) ended up raising her and the mom is still not competent enough. 

And that’s where the issue lies. My sister’s grandparents. They have done everything to cut her father’s side (so me and my grandparents and other family) out of their family. We’re not allowed to see my sister, all my grandparents maybe get is a school picture. For the longest time, my grandparents were only allowed to see her after Christmas and on Easter because my grandma would spend a lot of money on gifts. My father threatened court once years ago so we were invited to a few things. That stopped after they realized my father wasn’t actually serious. Thing is, he’s also selfish and he only did it because of my grandmother who does genuinely love my sister and doesn’t overstep boundaries. Her grandmother even told my grandma that she “had other grandchildren and to stop seeking out a relationship with my sister because she’s ‘theirs.’” I understand that it was hard for my sister to see her dad because she didn’t understand the situation. The situation has hurt my grandparents so much, they had to drop the rope because it broke their heart. They also got sick of feeling like they were being used by my sister’s grandparents. I don’t really know anything about them other than the town they live in. 

You’re asking where I am all this time: I wasn’t around for all of it, and no one would give me any answers. I got a phone number but never a call back. I tried social media, and nothing. My dad never sought out that relationship, much to my upset. I swear he’ll blame everyone else if my sister ever comes around. I realize I should have been so much more persistent but I was going through a lot health wise and I knew at the time I couldn’t be a stable person in her life. I didn’t know if I had any rights and we were told my sister was acting out and needed therapy and that we all overwhelmed her because of my dad, so I understood and also gave her space. And while I tried to see my sister and be a part of her life, I also wasn’t welcome. Which saddens me because my sister adored me and we were getting close despite the age difference. 

But I honestly want a relationship with her. I always have, and now that I know I maybe have *some* rights, and am in a better place to be a good influence, I feel more equipped to try. I’ve heard that they’re trying to move to another state, which is why I feel a sense of urgency. I don’t mind doing it slowly and on her and her grandparents terms (for example letters, phone calls, text messages) because I was also a child exposed to something similar with my egg donor and the back and forth that person did to me damaged me and my brothers so bad, I eventually went to court against her at 13 just so she’d leave us all alone. I don’t mind going to joint therapy sessions, not mentioning my dad at all (it apparently gets my sister upset, which I completely understand), not mentioning my grandparents would hurt, but I’d understand if they didn’t want me to mention them, having only supervised visits in a public place with a neutral party when the time comes to that, I honestly just want to be in her life. I know I also dropped the ball and I should have maybe done more, and I regret my lack of action. 

Should I pursue it or leave it alone? I would hate for her to come around when she’s older and ask for her to ask why she was never wanted by us, when that’s not the truth. However, I don’t want to cause any issues for her mentally or put her through the ringer. If my sister said she didn’t want to see me, it would sting, but I’d totally drop it and not pursue that until she wanted to pursue that, if she ever did.
If you think I should pursue it, how should I do it? Should I write a letter to the grandmother and hope for the best? And if I don’t get a timely response, should I get the courts involved. I really don’t want to get the courts involved, but I’m scared it might be my only option.",28Feb2020,1
514,"Some things that are important as to why i would need to ask why i am feeling lonely is that i have a girlfriend who i see at least 3 times a week. I recently went out with my buddies and still keep in contact and play games with them at least 2 times a week. I get enough space for my own free time as well. However i do not have any hobbies except for outside activities like ice skating which is too expensive for me and gaming. Gaming is like the only thing i enjoy doing currently.

How i realized i felt lonely is after i started having dreams that made me feel bad about myself/made me feel left out. These dreams that i had have really affected me alot and everytime i have these types of dreams i wake up feeling a pain in my heart and i would have a strong urge to cry but i hold it back becus i dont find it reasonable to cry because of a dream. For some reason these dreams really hurt my feelings. I am really confused as i have friends and a girlfriend who spends alot of time with me but i just cant stop feeling lonely every night,morning and occasionally in the afternoon. Anyone has any ideas as to why i feel lonely and why i would dream of being lonely even thought i am being sociable and having relationships around me? I hate the feeling of wanting to cry everytime b4 i sleep amd after i wake up. I want to talk to my girlfriend about this but honestly im scared to.

They basically acted like they were in a relationship, but she adamantly claims they aren’t together. It’s been over a year now. She’s told me they have sex even at the beginning but other than that and the fact she is over his house all the time, nothing more has come from her. Recently I asked what’s up with them because she brought him up and she still said nothing is up, that they were “just chillin” and “no title is needed at the moment”. She’s said this about 6 months ago too, but I stopped asking about it after that, mostly because I felt she was lying. My thing is if she is lying or keeping it from me, I don’t understand why. She’s told me about her past relationships and also she was in one briefly about 2 years ago and she would mention and acknowledge that one. But with this guy nothing.

517,"Okay so, my parents are separated and have been as such for almost 4-5 years. My dad basically grabbed his shit and left us when our grandfather (mom’s dad) died. He was basically “fuck this shit” and left. For a few months we basically never heard from him. This was extremely shitty for us since here in Saudi Arabia, women like my mom, basically couldn’t make any substantial income, especially not enough to support a family.

After said few months, my dad called and dictated that me and my two younger siblings HAVE to go out with him twice a week, basically taking away our weekends, the little time we had to actually enjoy ourselves.

Ever since then, every single Friday and Saturday has been literal hell. He’s emotionally manipulative, picks out and bashes my insecurities (even though I have made this very clear to him), he guilts me and my siblings (one boy and one girl, they’re twins) into doing shit to “make him happy” ???? 

He’s also been toxic in so many other ways, his beliefs of toxic masculinity are just disgusting and overall it’s safe to say he’s more than a hassle to deal with.

My 2 siblings like him, huge emphasis on like, and this is just because it’s societally obligatory for you to like your parents and engrained from a young age but I’ve come to see past this.

My mom isn’t that much better and still wants to keep my “dad” happy regardless of all the shit he pulls. 

WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, I am fucking sick and tired of dealing with all this bullshit and am just exhausted from just fucking crying cuz the little time I have to “be happy” has been stripped away from me. I need my dad’s money to like not starve and I can’t just go around asking relatives for money n shit cuz “society”. What in the ever-loving fuck am I supposed to do.

521," I told everyone my mother was dead and now shes threatening suicide but i can't tell anyone, because everyone close with me thinks she's dead. What should i do?  


For some background, my mother has been homeless for years and is extremely schizophrenic. She's convinced the government is watching her, people are copying her, the media is obsessed with her, etc. During the summer, i would receive calls from her where she'd accuse me of being a clone and then threaten to kill herself. These calls would last hours and were very stressful on me. One night, i received a call from her and she began to threaten suicide. Later that night, she consumed rat poison and ended up in a mental hospital of some sort.  


It was a few weeks after that incident I told everyone she was dead. I can't really say why I did it, I hate admitting it but part of me wanted her dead because it would save me all the stress, and I felt that it was easier to act like she was dead now so if and when she does end up dead from suicide or her lifestyle It wouldn't be as much of a shock.  


I didn't talk to her for a few months (her phone was broken) and now she's back and doing it again. Her threats are much more specific now and it seems that she's devising a plan to off herself. I don't know what to do, and I know the easiest thing would be to admit to my boyfriend and friends that I lied about her passing, but that scares me. Any advice?",28Feb2020,1

534,"I was going to post this on legal advice but after reading their post rules I wasn't sure if it was the best place. My sister also doesn't really do the whole reddit thing either so that's why I'm her in her stead.

So, as the title states, my sister is having some issues with her landlord. Her and her boyfriend moved into their current house maybe three or so years ago. They've been living there with his kids staying there regularly as he has joint custody of them with his ex-girlfriend. They also had a child together and she is a little over a year old now.

Maybe two years and some change ago, they got a dog. Kona is a cane corso so she kinda looks like a pit bull. She barks at unfamiliar people like any other dog but not obnoxiously so. Other than that she's really sweet and timid and really isn't at all mean or vicious in any way.

When they signed the lease, it said no pets. They got permission from the landlord to have a dog before they went out and got her. He said it would be fine and that was that. They've lived there with Kona without any issues since they got her. Since they moved in a housing development was built next door to them. Someone in that housing development has since complained to the landlord and is now telling my sister that the dog has to go.

Unfortunately for my sister, they aren't really able to just pick up and move somewhere new in order to keep Kona. They don't want to just give her away and they don't want to pawn her off on someone else for an indeterminate amount of time only to go back to that family and take her away from them after they've gotten attached to her.

535,I've kept around 3 hours this week but today's it was just under 6. What should I do?,28Feb2020,1
536,"I've been living with my wife (both 27yo) in our rental home for over a year now. We both attend the same university but she graduated and moved a time zone away for a job. I still have a couple years left to graduate so I visit every other weekend for 4 days. To help with rent, I posted an ad searching for a roommate. A 20yo, looking to move out of mom and dads and be closer to school is the first to reach out and come by. I had my reservations about younger roommates but he was in a relationship, worked a lot, went to school, and seemed to fit the bill of who I was looking for. I told him I moved here to go to school, I was clean, I kept to myself, and I was quiet. I was looking for someone compatible. He agreed, he said he only had like 3 friends (me too), he would bring them over for board games, he smoked weed sometimes (sure I do too, that's fine, all that is fine). He was really young but seemed like a serious person, the kind of person I was and was expecting to live with. We met one more time to get to know each other better before he moved in. No red flags. 

The first red flag is within 10 minutes of him getting here to move in. I can tell mom is worried so I crack a joke that I have to put a lock and chain on the fridge because of the beer. She replies ""oh he's going to drink all your beer if you don't."" 

Second red flag, I learn pretty quickly he likes to take LSD, MDMA, i dont remember what else. Never mentioned it before, I never really asked but I'd hope you'd disclose something like this beforehand. Whatever, moving on, if you're still a responsible person, I don't care. 

Third red flag. Having people spend the night, at least a couple times a week. We briefly discussed overnight guests beforehand, I was fine with it, just lmk beforehand. Even though it's more than what I wanted, they were people with good heads on their shoulders and were respectful. And they played with my cat, so two thumbs up. It was mainly just two other people. 

Fourth red flag. He doesn't clean. I'd maintain the house, especially the kitchen through the week. I would come back from visiting my wife after 4 days and not a damn thing was cleaned, thrown out, put away. 

Ok so I'm slowly starting to get pissed off. I try to put myself in his shoes... Yeah when I was a 20 yo guy who just moved out of my parents house, I wasn't worrying about keeping the house clean. I get he likes living here and wants to bring people over. I remember what it was like... 

The fifth and final red flag.   
I mentioned that I visit my wife regularly and it amounts to me being gone for \~8 days a month. The night I get home, he brings over a girl after a 3 day edible/LSD binge at EDM concerts, telling me he wasn't going to sleep until 5am. Ok bro, cool hahaha (you're a thoughtful &amp; respectful person though, right?) Wrong. I ""interview"" each person he brings over to my house because 95% of everything of the house belongs to my wife and I, but also I like to meet new people. I instantly stereotype her as the hippie chick, and was proved right by her talking about how she wants to grow her own food because she doesn't trust the government, talks about the hallucinogens and other hard drugs she and my roommate have taken, etc. I talk with them for 30-45 min, I don't like it but whatever, I'm off to bed. They end up being loud, having sex and talking until 5am. I had to say something at 2am when he started playing his keyboard. 

So I texted him the next day not to bring anyone over after work, that I had some things I wanted to talk to him about. I politely told him my feelings, that I felt he lied about who he was, that I wasn't comfortable with him having people like that spend the night, let alone having them here in the first place. It's a concern for my liability as a tenant, and more importantly for the safety of my cat. I didn't want those drugs here at all. I didn't feel comfortable with people like that here, especially when I'm not home. Also that what I mean by quiet, is I want whispers, better yet silence when I'm going to bed. He agreed, said the right things and I figured it was a done deal, that he understood what I meant. He even took the initiative to clean up around the house the next day. 

2 days later he tells me he's bringing her over again. They come over last night with another buddy he didn't tell me about  and smoke a couple blunts and setup a gravity bong. I'm studying as I usually do in the kitchen. Whatever, kids being kids, have at it. She fucking spends the night AGAIN last night. Even though they were much quieter, I could still clearly hear them fucking. I'm already uncomfortable and pissed so I don't go to my morning class this morning, only to hear them go into the shower and hear her moaning as i'm doing my homework.  

I'm going to be RREEEALLLLYYY clear with him next chance he's alone. I didn't sign up for this. AITA? Should I be extremely frank with him?",28Feb2020,1

State came through her work yesterday. I don’t know what they did, but they definitely went yesterday. And it kind-of went shit for me.

So, enter my family: lifetime of ignoring horrible things, sweeping things under the rug, secret-keeping. I have an awful family. My whole family is a family of “helpers,” that will sink themselves to keep someone else afloat. Well, after yesterday, I get a call from my grandmas home phone. Usually my gram calls me on her cell, so I figured it might be one of my cousins. I answer the phone and it’s my twin. She goes, hey. I say who is this. She says “who the fuck you’ve been talking to about the cocaine?” I hang up. I go to block that number. She’s calling me on grams cell. I block that number. I then get a message, through my grandmas Facebook, where my twin is threatening me. She called me a dumb ass bitch and said she’s going to do whatever she can to fuck up my life.

I’m not too worried about that, but I am now worried of her coming to my house and destroying my property, or any number of other joyous behaviors she will decide to grace me with. The reason why I’m posting today is because I am wondering if I can get a restraining order or some sort of protection from her? She already threatened me. But she did it as my grandma. What now?

And the reason I wanted to explain my helping family is because at this point, my grandma called me back and told me it’s sad that I can’t just get along with her and she started shaming me for reporting my twin. I had to cut her off yesterday too, she is my twins #1 enabler. Just wanted to follow up in case anyone wondered. It went like shit. :(",28Feb2020,1

539,"The title basically sums it up. 


I'm interviewing for a new job and I had hoped to leave my current job gracefully, I've been there for 3 years and didn't want to burn any Bridges. Unfortunately getting any amount of time off is harder than getting teeth pulled, requests needing to be submitted weeks in advance. 


Due to my current work schedule there really isn't any scheduling outside of that window for interviews. And I'm not really sure how to handle this. 

I think it's ridiculous that if I need an hour or two off I might have to call out sick and burn 8 hours of PTO. 


I've spent the last three years building myself up as a reliable employee and I don't like lying or feeling dishonest so I'm not really sure what to do.

Appreciate any advice",28Feb2020,1
540,"Wassup I’m a freshman in college and basically I’m in a learning community so everyone on my floor is essentially friends with one another. 

Except me. My whole life I’ve been that person who people have nothing against, but they just don’t ask to hang or be in the friend group. Like any community, there are cliques and different friend groups. But I always sit in our lounge to do work or just attempt to try to get in one friend group (I ended up giving up and just be happy people r willing to talk to me when I’m in the lounge). Anyway, 

First semester I wasn’t rly in the lounge a lot but this semester, I’m always sitting in there doing work. I call myself the blackmailer because I have all the info to blackmail someone lmfao. But I hear a lot of stuff every single time like drama. One person would be heavily talking trash about someone in our floor who they all hate (I have no opinions but I can see why). She would talk trash when that girl left the room and mock her voice and shit. First few days, I found it all agreeable that yes the person she was talking shit about was semi annoying lmao. I tried not to judge because I myself never want to be judged so I don’t want to be a hypocrite. 

But as the weeks went by, people started talking shit about the same person and yes she’s truly a bad person so I agree with the talk, but the girl who started to talk shit started bothering me. She has been talking shit for a month now and I’m starting to get tired of it. You can talk shit once and a while but if that’s all I hear when I’m in the lounge, I’m gonna get annoyed and yea I did get annoyed. I dislike that girl she hates but is it just me who thinks talking shit for a month would get annoying? She’s stating all these bad things about this person but it bugs me that it’s a constant conversation in the lounge now.

Throughout the month, I’ve always just listened to their conversations. I have so much info in my hands but they all trust that I don’t tell anyone which I won’t cuz wtf is the point. Nothing to hide when you don’t attempt to tell anyone. That’s why I call myself the blackmailer because if one day I wanted to go berserk, I could blackmail at least 6 people in the lounge lmfao. Anyway I guess my main question for advice is, should I step into this conversation and mention how she’s been talking for a month about this person and why she cares so much about her if she dislikes her lmfao. I’m not one to jump in a convo, and since I’m not rly her in her friend group and just that kid who floats around talking but no friends, idk if it’s my place to say something",28Feb2020,1
541,"I was scrolling through porhub last night on my phone and came across a video of myself getting a blowjob. Had no memory of ever filming it but was 100% me; as I kept watching the memory slowly came back. Black out drunk one night a girl probably 5 years older than me at the time scooped me up right at closing time at a popular summer bar. She took me one street over to a condo complex and we had sex.... somewhere in the mix I ended up with her phone filming it. 

Not sure how I feel about it, part of me wants to have it taken down, but the other part thinks it is hilarious (and my face is not in it at all).",28Feb2020,1
542,"So long story short my best friend of over two years who is now my ex girlfriend is coming over this morning to see me and talk. About a week ago we basically called things off because she said that I need to get certain issues in my life straightened out. We have plans to go to a big city twice in the next month, attend a wedding a few states away in May, and move in together in June. 

Yesterday she texted me saying she was so upset that she had to leave work and get someone to cover for her. She’s never left early or called off or given a shift away before. She then texted me saying if she could come “see me” after her class this morning. I said okay to which she responded she missed me. She’ll be over in about an hour or two. What should I expect? I’m expecting her to either call it off for good or to try and start trying to get back together. But probably the first one. If it isn’t how do I save this? 

Tl;dr : Girlfriend left earlier this week. Asking me to come over and see me this morning. Am I about to get dumped for good?",28Feb2020,1
543,"Hey guys, I hate to bother everyone here but I'm in bad shape right now. I'm not asking for pity or for people to feel sorry for me and I'm sorry for bothering anybody here, I just don't know where else to turn right now. It seems all  I ever do nowadays is screw everything up. All I drink a lot of the time too to try and deal with the pain I feel but it doesn't seem to help. I feel like I absorb people's pain and have to deal with it as well as my own as crazy as that may sound and it's became overwhelming. I've been in the mental hospital five times and it doesn't seem to help because the doctors I saw seemed to be more interested in getting paid than actually trying to help me, I had one tell me they would hold me as long as my insurance paid they would hold me and the medications they prescribed during my stays didn't help. I'm ashamed of going to the mental hospital so many times too. I feel like I'm a failure and that's all I'll ever amount to. I've even contemplated suicide a few times, the pain and troubles would all go away, I don't have many people who actually care about me and the ones who do would get over it if they cared enough and get on with their lives. Memories of my past and stuff I've been through haunt me. I was just wondering if there's any way I can make life better and what should I do? I'm at a loss and don't know where else to turn.

544,"Hello.
I am a 18 year old german student and recently started digging my own mental grave.

A few days ago I found out both my parents lied to my face. My father lied about his whole childhood and adult career and my mother about her love life. You see, i don't really have a good bond with them. I cut my dad out of my life for gaslighting and abuse, but tried keeping my relationship to my mom stable. It is super hard for me to do, though, since she is quite an honest and passive-aggressive person towards me.
Both preached to me to be an honest person, my mom even told me she wanted me to be honest with her and shouldn't keep secrets. Which I always tried to do. 
Since I have found out they are not the people who they pretend to be I am deeply hurt.
As stated earlier I cut my dad out of my life a while ago now and currently live with my mom, but now stuff has gotten worse. Major trust issues started blocking my path. I started doubting the honesty of everyone around me and started backing off. I feel uncomfortable looking at my mum, interacting with her or even be in the same room as her. I tried pretending all is fine, but I am screaming inside. I locked myself in my room and refuse to leave, which got me into more trouble as she started banging on my door, yelling and demanding to unlock it. Another thing, I lost trust in my friends. They did absolutely nothing wrong, but i doubt their honesty, so I stopped interacting with any of them. 
I don't know what to do and how to cope with this right now, for now I did nothing but cry in bed. I do have therapy, but my next appointment is in two weeks. Did anyone else experience similar things? Any tips on how to cope with this?? I don't know where to turn and what to do. I am scared.",28Feb2020,1

547,"So I’m in college as of now, applying to university for the fall term. I’m at the part where it asks to list your entire post-secondary education

I completed a 2 year degree in Game Design back in May of last year and listed my degree the dates I was in the program up til the day I got the degree. 

Now the problem is, there’s a specific note in this part of the application that states to be as honest as possible about revealing your entire post-secondary education since they’ll see your transcripts/grades anyway. 

I’ve started at this college almost 4 years ago in an arts program for one semester, then did some general courses...the only problem is there’s no option or box to tick off or a space to write that I didn’t finish this degree and just dropped out after a semester and transferred into the new one.

Should I list the incomplete degree?",28Feb2020,1
548,"About two weeks ago, after a fairly full on and quick relationship of just under 4 months, my girlfriend and I broke up.  Unlike a lot of other breakups, it was totally mutual though more bought on from her side, but I totally accept and understand why she felt the way she did. We met on Tinder and went on a first date within a week of really hitting it off. 

She's 25 and I'm 27, we met in September 2019, but didn't get together until the end of October after several successful dates and meeting each others friends &amp; family, in fact she really got on with my mum a little too well!  

We only saw each other twice a week, sometimes only once on a Wednesday night when we'd cook dinner, but we'd see each other on weekends if we were both free. 

It was pretty low maintenance and we both enjoyed little things like movie nights, sharing life stories, cooking and watching cartoons, so we spent a lot of time doing quiet stuff, as much as I often wanted to do more, she preferred things a little more quiet and helped me come to terms with taking a step back and relaxing.  We both felt like we could be bored around each other which is a good thing, as she pointed out ""the person you want to be with is the person you can do nothing with"" and that really stuck with me.  

We got super close super quickly and hastily started talking about our future and making plans...this was coming from both sides, so despite the short time together, I felt confident about taking part in this too. Its been about 4 years since I'd been in relationship, so I wasn't super confident about this sort of topic at first, but found it giving me a sense of direction and some goals in life.  

Sex life was great, despite my lack of confidence and she even reassured that foreplay was the main part to her, if I wasn't doing so well, but I eventually got a lot better at satisfying her. 

This is the end of the good, and the start of the bad however. Bad isn't really the right word, but these were the issues. The one issue for me is that I found myself relying on her a lot and despite my increased confidence, I felt a bit lonely when I couldn't speak to her and I unintentionally isolated myself away from my friends.  

On her part, she had only had been 2 months out of a long term relationship that had turned sour due to her ex, and put her on a bit of a downward mental spiral. She's on mood stabilising medication daily and seeing a counsellor weekly, but I was fully respectful and patient of what she had going on, she was even always grateful and appreciated me for being so cool about it. However, a few weeks before the breakup, her ex got in touch about the car or something and it got to her and it shattered the illusion she was ready to jump into something big again, which makes sense. 

The part that leaves me confused about whether to hold out, is that a week before we broke up, she said to me she wanted to slow things down, which I was happy to commit to, even if it did shake me up a bit, she felt bad for having to do it, and even when we properly broke up, she said she'd hoped slowing things down would make it better but ultimately she felt she just wasn't ready. It's not like she didn't try to save it. 

She assured me thoroughly I'd done nothing wrong, we then hugged it out, pinkie swore we'd see each other again and that was it.  I haven't spoken to her since, but lines of contact have been left open. I've been working on myself and do feel a lot better after making some lifestyle changes, hitting the gym, setting myself daily goals, etc. She taught me a lot about myself and understood me so well, that a lot of what she taught me is being put into action now. I've taken peace in the fact that I know I'm taking the steps to become my best self, and I'm taking comfort in the fact she's doing the same. That said, we ended things in a way that felt pretty open if I wait for her to heal up...should I wait this one out?

I hadn't felt a connection like this ever before and I don't feel like either of us wanted things to end, a perfect ""right person wrong time"" story perhaps, but a happy ending feels achievable!",28Feb2020,1

554,"So I work at a family owned company. The “owner” of the company is the father and his two sons are executives... one is the CEO and the other is a director. 

The owner of the company retired recently, but still comes in the office, still uses company money to travel, expenses trips, has his assets under the company name, etc. 

His son, the CEO, has been trying to remove him from everything to separate... but it’s awkward because of the circumstances. 

The guys has a really bad temper and occasionally blows up on employees and members of the company. HR doesn’t do anything about it because of the family owned business situation... his own son won’t make any moves. 

My question is: if the owner is no longer attached to the company and no longer the boss  of anyone.. isn’t it a huge liability for him to be walking around the office yelling at employees and walking into/interrupting meetings?

I have around 3k in savings but I quit my job as it was taking a mental toll on me.                    

**Now onto the actual issue...** I don't know why but everytime I go out or eat with my friends or do anything I feel so stressed about spending money, and I get really uncomfortable when im going to restaurants where I don't know how much ill need to spend. Like id rather eat a shitty meal that's cheaper than a good one and I just feel guilt when I spend too much on food. Even when im online shopping I always sort stuff from lowest to highest and will only buy stuff that's towards the lower end. I only buy stuff off Ali express and eBay.  I feel like i'm being really dramatic but I don't know why it stresses me out so much. The thing is I've been fortunate my whole life, with very hardworking parents who've managed to give me an amazing life filled with luxuries (private schooling, music lessons, tutoring, nice clothes, nice electronics etc).       

Am I just being over stressed or is it good that I have a frugal mindset for the near future.

560,"I am a junior in high school, so I am really busy with school and other stuff. However, my parents don't acknowledge this, and they still force me to do chores. Yesterday, there was a broken gutter, so my dad insisted that my mom and I help him. It was very dangerous. Both my mom and I are weak, but he still made us help him. He wanted to climb a ladder and go up there. That wasted 4 hours of my time, and trust me, I could have gotten other stuff done in those 4 hours.

Every single freaking weekend, my dad asks me to do some boring electrical work or woodwork. To be honest, I don't see why I have to do it. My sister never does any chores around the house. And she also has a bed, electronics, food, clothing, education, and my mom drives her around to the malls, friends' houses, etc. Yet my parents almost never reward me or appreciate me for my hours of labor. (Please note that I have scoliosis, dyslexia, and mild dyspraxia. I am busier than my sister, who is a freshman, so my sister is better off doing most of the chores).

My dad probably knows when I have to write an important essay or work on an important project for school. Every single freaking time, he calls me to help him with something boring and crappy. I will start keeping track of my time he has wasted and bill him at the end of each month. My part-time job pays me $16 an hour, so I will charge him that much.

My sister has a terrible habit. She brings her iPad into the bathroom and when she waits for the shower to warm up, she leaves the flippin door OPEN and waits about 5 minutes. That's how the shower base got moldy and broken. If I were in charge, I would make her earn the money to buy the supplies and fix it herself. But my dad makes me do it. When I ask him why, all he says is ""this is something you must know as a guy"".

ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?

My parents are feminists (mostly my dad, my mom is usually fine). My sister never does any chores and she gets more privileges than me, including, but not limited to, later bedtime, hanging out with friends, money to spend on crap, and the promise that she will be given a brand new car for her 15th birthday.

Thing is that some people seem to think highly of me and I don't really understand why. Regardless, I don't want to let those who think of me in this way down.

A few weeks back he made a comment on my ass. I was wearing those pajamas that have the flap on the ass part. If he made a comment on the flap part being cute or my ass. No father should look at their daughters ass.

I really hate being a girl, well I’m not a girl at least not mentally (I think), this would make me trans (female to male). It’s an argument to make that being trans has become more popular and it’s easier to actually transition over the last few years and the number of detransitioners is scary. I want to come out so badly, I just want to be myself but I’m also scared that I would regret things in the future. I’m still young, 16 in April, which is definitely too young to transition medically. If I did come out then I’d just be living with my binder and my feminine voice, I would just feel fake, like I’m doing it for attention or because I don’t know maybe the internet made me think I was trans. I’m worried about being called a trender, so many people (mostly girls) think that body dysmophia is dysphoria. Hating your body is different than feeling that it’s just so wrong. When I look at myself I don’t necessarily think my body itself or my face itself is ugly but I hate it because it’s not me. Sometimes I just look at myself and feel nothing. (This may be caused from some form of depression?) When I see myself as a female I don’t think that everything is ugly I just feel like it’s not me. It’s nearly impossible to explain the feeling of dysphoria. If I actually wanted to look female I’d be a relatively attractive female but that’s the problem. I’m not saying this is how all trans people feel but some don’t completely hate their bodies. 

I’m very uncomfortable with things that most people don’t think about like my hands and the way my legs are shaped. I really hate my hands, they are very small and you can they’ll they are not a mans hands. I used to make my hands look really beat up (I still do just not as much) I would try to get cuts and scratches on them so they looked more masculine. Maybe it’s just that I don’t like my hands, everything has another side to it and this is why I haven’t come out yet. My voice has been extremely dysphoric(?) recently, with being at a new school and all. I just don’t want to be called she. I’ve found that I pass much more to adult strangers than teens, I guess younger people look a bit closer than older ones (idk). I don’t know why but I just feel more comfortable when I get called he. Its really scary when other people are around though, I hate being in those situations. When I get called he It makes me feel like all my efforts are actually paying off. 

Another thing about my voice is singing. I’m not the best singer ever (by far) but I’m not the worst ether. It makes me so frustrated, I love singing but sometimes it mentally hurts to sing with my feminine voice. Of course that doesn’t completely stop me from singing but I mostly sing when I’m alone. At the same lots of people feel that way, maybe it’s just me being shy. Everything that I define as dysphoria could just be other things making me think that I’m trans. I hate it so much. What it I’m just thinking I’m trans because of something else. I feel so trapped inside my head. Some detrasitioners say that they were depressed during the time they thought they were trans. I know I’ve had depression for around 2 and a half years so maybe that’s changing my mind. I’ve always been uncomfortable with my body (we’ll probably since like age 12, so puberty lol). 

Thinking about when I was younger makes me question myself so much, just when I get confident that I’m trans my head goes to my younger self. I think I began trying to pass as male or when I realized since December of 2018 so about a year and a half (ish). Before that I had a period of trying to be as feminine as possible, I tried wearing mascara and dresses more often. I bought leggings and other girly things. I thought that being more girly would make me more confident. After that I thought that maybe I was a lesbian because I felt more masculine and I guess I thought all lesbians feel masculine (lol). I dated a girl and had had a massive crush on a girl which made me think I liked only girls and tried to completely ignore my attraction for guys. 

I know I am an extremely clingy person. Once I make a friend or even a good acquaintance I immediately attach myself to that person. When I was younger my mom babysat twins and we were really close friends. We did everything together, I didn’t really need anyone else. I wasn’t anywhere near as bad with it as I am now because I had a few friends when I was younger. I think I noticed it when I got really close with a guy named Max in 9th grade. We were best friends, I literally would tell him everything. Anyway that didn’t last long and I kinda knew that I wasn’t going to work out, nothing ever does. I had become so dependent on him in a sense of emotional support and I dunno I would vent sooooo much to him. I was (and still am) really really annoying and I regret spilling out everything to him but I had so many locked up things I wanted to say. I just let is all spill out, I told him I was trans which I regret. The relationship was really one sided and I know I was a pain in the ass to him. I feel like such a shitty person for the way things turned out and how I couldn’t control the crush I had. I wasn’t like super weird or anything but there were a few situations where I know know must’ve made him uncomfortable. He’s very gay (like full on stereotype gay) and I was a stupid freshman who didn’t understand that simply telling someone you think ur tans automatically makes you the opposite biological gender. I guess I thought he would be a bit more supportive and whatever but blah blah blah that doesn’t matter anymore. After that I had a short internet friendship and I think the exact same thing happened. I’m working on being less attracted to people who are clearly just friends and hold back any crushes. I just don’t wanna drag anyone else into this mess until I’m a bit more confident with who I am and maybe until I’m out (or whatever). I’m lonely but I guess it’ll be that way for a while longer.

Ive had crushes on boys in the past (like elementary school) but I blocked that out and ignored it. I think as I became more depressed I went through this self discovery period (I still am). I tried my hardest to forget labels. Eventually I developed a huge crush on a guy (Max, the person I explained earlier). I tried my very hardest to ignore my feelings but I decided to let it go and let it happen. That’s an entirely different story. Now I’m mainly attracted to guys. Once again I’m dealing with a crush on a gay guy.(Side note: I’m not into him anymore lol) This really messes with my head because I’m like um do I have like a thing for gay guys or is it because I am a gay guy myself (or Bisexual or something like that although I tend to be much more attracted to guys than girls. Like 15% girls and 85% guys) I know that’s also a thing that some trender girls do. They just really like gay guys. I really don’t feel like this is me because I did think he was attractive before I knew he was gay (along with other guys, not in a sexual way.)

I think that I just won’t let myself develop a crush on someone unless I have a slight chance with them. I’ve had 4 legitimate ones. Anyway because I feel like I’m mentally a guy (who is mostly attracted to guys) this is why I fee attracted to them. Of course my mind always goes back to thinking that I’m just a girl with creepy crushes. The thing is, I’m not a very sexually attracted person, I just want to have someone to talk to and like cuddle innocent stuff like that. I don’t know if that has anything to do with bottom dysphoria. My bottom “dysphoria” is not as strong as some trans guys. its not that I don’t wish I had male genitalia and all that but I just don’t think that stuff is as important. Like if I decided to transition and alleviated things like chest and voice dysphoria then maybe things like having a dick would be more important. For right now it’s the struggle of passing, maybe sexual activity in the future and bathroom stuff but for right now I have bigger worries.

 I think I could survive without bottom surgery, unlike my chest which I just want it to be flat. It’s confusing to me because I don’t completely hate my chest but i feel more like myself when I’m binding. I’ve put on bras to “test” my dysphoria. I don’t hate what it looks like I just can’t imagine myself going out in public like that it just doesn’t feel correct. (It’s honestly quite impossible to explain) I’ve tried putting on one of my sisters wire bras and it just feels so so incorrect. Ugh I’m just very confused. I really think I’d be happier with top surgery but then of course my head says that maybe I just don’t want to wear a bra (instead of binding) because everyone is used to me having a flatter chest now. Maybe I’m just a female who doesn’t like having a bigger or having one at all. This has happened before and I’ve heard of a few women who got top surgery because they just didn’t like having tits. Maybe it’s because binding has just become so normal. But then why would I get so uncomfortable when my binder isn’t flattening as much as possible or when my jacket zipper folds up making a bump where my chest is. Is that dysphoria?

I just really hate being called she, of course before I realized (or was convinced or whatever) it didn’t bother me. Now though it’s just gotten worse and worse. I’ve gotten used to my family using she/her for me so I think I block it out more. At first at my new school I passed as a male. Of course when I started making friends one girl could tell I was biologically a girl and yeah it’s confusing now. I completely blame my voice for that situation tho. When she asked if I was a guy or a girl I said (and I quote) “well technically I’m a girl but I’d rather be a guy.” I am such an idiot. I completely made myself look like the biggest trender ever. I really really regret saying that. Now everyone at my lunch table say she. most people now know I’m a girl but some say he (which can be very awkward at times and it makes my anxiety go haywire. I like being called he but I’m not out so yeah. 

I mean I feel I look much more like a guy than a girl but maybe I don’t pass as well as I wish I did. Those feelings change daily, like if I get called he my confidence will be pretty high or if my chest looks more masculine. 

One of the biggest things that’s been stopping me from coming out is my early childhood. I have definitely always been very different. I loved playing with bugs, I absolutely loved stuffed animals (not gonna lie, I still do) at one point I thought I was squirrel. I was a really weird kid (but like aren’t we all?). I dressed however I did, however I wanted to. Whatever clothes I had I would just wear. I didn’t care about that, it was the least of my concerns. I wore dresses sometimes and other times I ran around naked in the woods covering myself in mud. I just didn’t care. Gender wasn’t something I ever really thought about, I mean I knew I was a girl so I went with it. I’m an easygoing person most of the time and avoid arguments and stressful situations or thoughts. This would make sense as to why I didn’t have dysphoria as a child. To be honest maybe I did but I have a terrible memory and can only remember tiny snippets of my life before the age of like 12. I remember getting our cat Quinn at 5ish and little bits of me and my sister playing but that’s about it. Everything else I just remember through stories or pictures and that keeps them much more accessible in my mind. I guess I have memories of what a did but not at all about how I felt. I don’t know if I ever felt like a little boy, my mom never forced me into any stereotype so I was just myself. She let me play with the toys I wanted to (which was a decent mix between “boys” and “girls” toys.) I know in like 4th and 5th grade I dressed almost exclusively in boys clothes. I had gotten hand-me-downs from my older cousin and kept asking for more because they were more comfortable (or something like that). I remember my sister making fun of me for wearing them and I’m not sure how hard that affected me because she’s always acted like the older sibling (and I’m quite scared of her now to be honest haha). 

I don’t really remember if I got bullied because of this and I know I should talk to my mum but she already has wayyyy too much to worry about. My elementary and middle school situation was a little different than most because I went to a k-12 island school with around 65 students altogether. The teachers really didn’t like my mum because she would speak her mind and call out the school for all its shitty problems. I was treated differently than most of my peers by teachers but that’s a completely different story. Ether way I stopped dressing in boys clothes and tried my hardest to act like a “real” girl around 12 or 13ish. 

I know I’m jumping around everywhere in this post but it’s just so hard to get all of this figured out and written down. I guess I’ll talk about more of my childhood because this has been bothering me for a while. In my early childhood My sister and I would play “prince and princess”, i was always the prince. My mom said I didn’t like it, but when I did try to be the girl i was really bad at it. We also played it sooooo many times and it was getting really old for me, we’d play it way too often. I would ‘save’ her or we’d get ‘married’ or both, ether way I’d dress up in some kind of makeshift suit and put my hair up in a bun. Sometimes I’d even draw on a fake beard or mustache. 

Even when we got older I was still usually the boy. (like I said I barely remember this) We also started playing a game called “mother and sweetie” where my little sister was my daughter and I’d have a bunch of babydoll children. That game was usually more enjoyable and I loved pretending to take care of kids and run a household. I’ve always wanted to have kids. Haha like at least 4 (I don’t really care if they are biological or not and I’m aware of the medical procedures that are necessary for a trans-med guy to have bio kids like freezing eggs and all that, which I’m not sure how interested in that I’d be because I’ve heard the process is pretty intense in physical and especially mental terms.) 

Anyway, I just kinda always went with it, whatever game she wanted to play that’s what we would play. “If a biological little boy was given girls toys to play with and told that was the norm and be content with it why wouldn’t a trans boy?” Ive posted this (less edited version) on a different subreddit and someone said something along those lines, I just had to include it in this rant of mine because I liked that idea. I mean it makes sense, especially if someone is naturally a ‘go with the flow’ type person like I am and was. 

The thing that tends to throw me off is that when I was like 12 and 13 I really liked reborn baby dolls. I was in that stage (or phase??) when I dressed more girly to attempt to fit in more and I guess try to be more confident. I thought that would fix what could have been dysphoria. I’ve always played with Barbies but I just loved playing and creating stories, I love writing and making storylines so that would make sense in terms of playing and creating scenarios. I got a reborn baby doll and I loved it. I would shop for it and pretend it was my kid, I like really loved dressing it and creating outfits. A memory of walking to my grandmothers always comes to mind because I was wearing a blue floral dress and was pushing the doll all the way there in a stroller (at the age of fricken 13 lol ew). I’ve always been a relatively childish person and I still played with my stuffed animals at like 13. But whatever, playing with stuffed animals doesn’t really bother me that much. I just feel like every trans person I’ve seen on the internet has had dysphoria symptoms and signs since they were like 4 and I don’t really have that. Does that mean I’m just confused or convinced or been greatly affected by depression. I just don’t understand and I really want to, I want to know my inner truth. I find it really funny that technically speaking, I should have all the answers in my head, like why do I have to try so hard to figure out something as simple as gender? 

When people at school say she it just makes me so uncomfortable. Like do I really look like a girl to you? Please be honest. I don’t know, why can’t I just be a girl, why can’t I just feel like one, then I could just be normal. Or be a regular guy who doesn’t have to try so hard for nothing. Maybe I wouldn’t be so angry all the time. Some days I just kinda give up and let it happen. It’s so annoying having to try so hard to just be myself but even then I still find myself drowning in thoughts and confusion. It’s one thing for my family to use she her, but my new friends too. I have so many mixed emotions and I just need help. I’m so scared if I come out then it will ruin things with my friends. It’s so new to have people to sit with at lunch and being able to help them with their problems and give them advice. Although, I don’t ever really ask them for help or ask them for advice or tell them how suicidal I am. I just feel so annoying and selfish and like I’m wasting their time. They’re good people but I’m scared to get too close to them, I just don’t wanna scare them off like I did my last friend, Max. I told him and after that he just kinda stopped caring about me. I miss him so much and I wish I hadn’t complained about all this so often, I just couldn’t hold it in anymore. I know realize that I was just using to vent and vent and vent. Of course that wasn’t the only reason I was friends with him but I was young and didn’t really know how to maintain a good relationship (honestly I still don’t but I’m a lot better at it than I was, lol I think.) I just wish I hadn’t have ruined that one because he was one of the best people I’ve ever met and I wanted to help him, I didn’t want him to hurt like I did. 

I realized that I don’t have a massive amount of bottom dysphoria, i don’t really care about that. I don’t know, I mean I think I’ve just accepted the fact that I don’t have a dick. Currently I’m not sexually attracted to anyone in the “real world”. like I’ve watched porn shit and I get like turned on or whatever but I don’t really care about sex. I’d like to keep that kind of thing to myself, which I feel is relatively normal given my age ether way. I think I do want to have some form of sexual intercourse in the future but I’m still young. I don’t know if I wish I could get like a boner or whatever, I mean you can’t miss something you’ve never had. It just doesn’t give me massive dysphoria. I do like attempting to pack though, making it look like I’ve got a bump there.

I just worry that this means I’m not trans but just saying that makes me almost angry. I ‘want’ to be trans because I want to be a guy I don’t enjoy being this way. I don’t wanna be like this, but I can’t say that I wish I was a ‘normal’ girl because My head is so against that thought. I just want To be me, I don’t care about this stuff anymore I just wanna be happy. I wanna date people without having to explain everything or dragging them into this mess. I wanna be able to tell people my name but I don’t really know what that is. Obviously I have a name but ugh it’s just so tiring, I’m so done with this, I feel like I haven’t gotten anywhere for months.

Recently I’ve been getting so frustrated over picturing myself as an old women on accident. I was just randomly thinking or putting myself subconsciously into a random situation. I picture myself as a girl. This person I picture looks nothing like me. An example would be when I was watching a YouTube video and it was about some kids getting kidnapped while they were being watched by a babysitter. I think it was a chills video or something spooky. I was like well, what if I was in that situation. Then I picture myself as a girl. Like in mid 20s or something and then I’ll correct myself but I dunno it just doesn’t work. I’ll get mad and try to remove myself, The girl I picture doesn’t look like me. I don’t know but if my head naturally puts myself as a girl in situations or if I’m just used to picturing myself as a female I guess? It only happens when I’m thinking about the far future and I’m not fully thinking just wandering in my head. I’ll almost immediately catch myself and get mad. But if I wanted to be a guy so badly then why is this even happening. In dreams I picture myself as how I look, dunno all that is just mildly annoying.

I know I overthink absolutely everything. Everything in this endless rant is overdone. I just think ‘what if what if’. I never let it just be anymore, I hate thinking about this stuff, I try not to because it hurts, I give myself a headache.

I also really want to use the guys bathroom. I’ve never used the bathroom in my new school because whatever one I go into I’m screwed. If I go into the guys bathroom I’m not worried about not looking like a guy I’m worried that someone I know will be in there and then nope I can’t even think about it. If I go into the girls bathroom it’s the opposite problem. I’ve got a big school so not that many people know me, I know some people still think I’m a guy (which feels amazing when someone my age says he) anyway I’m going to get a lot of strange looks if I go into that room. I have bathroom shyness ether way lmao but I’d love to use the correct bathroom at least. 

I used to take ballet classes. I hate thinking about it now, I wasn’t a good dancer and I will never be a good dancer. I took them for like 5 years and I stopped taking them at like 12 or 13 I think (I don’t really remember much of this ether and I probably messed up the timeline a bit). My little sisters also took it and they were much more serious than I was. We had recitals and had to dress up in fancy costumes and dresses. I would have to wear makeup and I hated that, I’ve always hated makeup. I don’t remember how I felt during that time but the last like 2 years I took it I didn’t want to, I just ended up taking it again because my sisters were. I would often get in trouble in class and would complain every time I had to go. I liked to get my energy out and I didn’t mind wearing a leotard (idk if that’s spelled right). But at the same time, guys can do ballet. They can dress up in dresses and costumes and enjoy it. I really do wish I actually remembered how I felt about all that because I feel like it would be really helpful. me and my sister would also dress up and dance around in the living room and wear dresses and stuff. 

I’ve been going through a bit of a foggy patch In life. I can feel my friends leaving me. I watch them make new ones. I don’t think it’s jealousy because it’s not that I don’t want any of my friends to have any other friends. That wouldn’t be fair. I just feel them getting bored of me. I feel them leaving. It can’t be their fault because this happens every time I make friends. I don’t think I’ve had a friend longer than about 6 or 7 months since like 3rd grade. It must be me. They all just drifted, I guess that’s normal but I do always put effort into the relationship. I’ve gotten better at keeping my problems in my own head. Every time I reach out for help they leave me. I’m just so done with everything, I’m done trying. All I do is lay in bed that’s it. Feelings have been harder to reach, music is getting old, I struggle to feel. I’m stuck, I’m trapped. The best solution is to give up. I want to be done, I want to give up. 

(most recent feelings)

I’ve just been feeling numb, I really struggle to feel now. ‘Dysphoria’ is still there and I still cry every time I watch a trans related video. I think I’m getting used to these struggles and feelings but new problems have risen. My hips. I thought just wearing baggy sweatshirts and men’s jeans would cover all that up but I was liking at pictures my mom had takin of me and my siblings while on a hike and my hips are so ughhhhhh. When I sit I get so anxious about how my sweatshirt is tucked and get sooo anxious about my hips. It’s hard to explain but yeah sitting down has become one of my biggest forums of dysphoria recently and walking down the hallways at school. I think I have some kind of social anxiety because when I walk down that hallway my heart beats extremely fast I can feel myself shaking and I feel Ike everyone’s staring at me. Maybe that’s normal but I feel like it isn’t. It gets so bad that I can hear my heartbeat in my head and I just go into autopilot mode, I just get to my class and then get really anxious about the way I sit and how my legs look and how ‘female’ they are shaped. My hands still bother me and I get so angry if my binder isn’t working enough. I’ve also noticed how much of a baby face I have and how when I look in the mirror and look masculine I get like a small wave of confidence or happiness or something. I still don’t really feel anything while taking a shower and my voice still bothers me. When I’m at home I usually just hide in my room and I’m quite numb to my family members using she/her. When they speak that word always seems louder than all the others, I always hear it. My anxiety goes crazy when my sister has friends over because I hate it when she says “my sister” when she’s taking about me. Not sure why because I don’t really care about her friends but that definitely bothers me. Sometimes I’ll go in her room and hang out with them but I can’t for very long before I want to cry. I just don’t want them to think of me as “her weird big sister” I want them to think of me as “her weird big brother”. When hanging out with my little brother I just want him to think of me as a big brother. The word babysitter also triggers something in me now, it just makes me feel like a girl? I know guys can babysit and often have to watch younger siblings but ‘babysitting’ makes me just ugh. I don’t mind watching them and I know it really helps my mom out but I tend to cry when they don’t listen to me or if something just gets kinda shitty. Instead of showing anger I cry, this might have to do with trigger words and my depression but I’ve also always been a bit of a wimp. I hate it when I have to yell at them tho because my voice is so loud and feminine and it just makes me feel sick. I don’t enjoy arguing ether way but if you’ve ever had to watch younger siblings (for free) you know how it gets sometimes. Fights happen and they really don’t like listening to me (most of the time it’s all good but they will get mad if they can’t play Minecraft or aren't allowed to watch a show or something like that). 

I’ve also been ignoring my feelings recently, I’ve been ignoring them and trying to just not think about trans stuff because it gives me a headache and I never get anywhere. It can just be so tiring and sometimes I’d rather just not feel. I haven’t had a massive breakdown in a while and being stressed about schoolwork has definitely helped keep my mind off of trans stuff. I just want to escape, I wanna get out of my head. I want to go a day without thinking about that stuff, I want to live freely. I know I’m not alone with depression and anxiety, so many people have it and I hate to say it but it almost seems common for someone my age to have them (especially some form of anxiety). 

I’m sure I’ll think of something else to add to this mess and I’m sure new things will happen but I just need advice, I need help. Don’t go easy on me, I want true opinions. I don’t care if responses make me upset, I need help and at this point I’m willing to hear anything. Obviously don’t be crazy rude or anything but give the cold hard truth. I know I’m overthinking this but that’s why I need outsider opinions. I might post this again on a different subreddit so I’m sorry if this thing is just one big rant of annoying or me being selfish. If anyone has questions please ask them!! I just want to be careful about this, even socially transition is a big deal and I do believe you need dysphoria to be trans. If one person read this I’d be so thankful and I don’t think I could put into words about how greatly I’d appreciate advice.

568,"Okay you guys . I made a reddit account just so I can get advise and heard its a good place to do it .

So I have been in college since I was 18 and received my AA diploma . After I received my diploma , I have tried getting into the RN program at the same school, but couldn't pass the entrance exam . I have been trying different programs and schools to see if I would like other types of medical jobs, but my mind was always on the RN program . I would quit the programs and make excuses about how I know that the RN program is what I want to do and not finish the schooling .

Now I am in the nursing program, I am debating if I really want to be here . There are so much responsibilities and information that we have to obtain and it is getting rough . My grades is a 76% which is a D and I have to pass the course with a 80% . Just feeling discourage because I have 3 more test not including the final exam, I really thought the last exam I did really good, but I actually got an 80% which only bumped up my grade to 76% . Was thinking about giving the LPN a try, but I also know they don't really get hired on hospitals .

If there are any nurses or anyone that has been in a situation like this do you have any good advise ?

Thank you in advance",28Feb2020,1

570,"Could be triggering so watch out!! Long story short, my tutor makes me feel uncomfortable and it’s hurting my attendance. Wish I was strong and could just ignore him but I can’t and would rather just not attend his class. He’d been annoying me for a little while but nothing “big” had happened until the start of this term. I had a huge bandage round my arm after getting a tattoo and he started joking with me about self harm and asking me if I had cut my arm in front of the entire class. Didn’t take me outside to ask, didn’t even do it in a serious way, just made me feel wildly uncomfortable by poking fun at something I have done in the past. NOT TO MENTION I’m an art student. We’re not particularly known for being emotionally stable and he just spoke about this openly in front of everyone? Anyone in my class could be facing these issues ya know? 
He says things all the time that are just... insensitive? He talks about other students behind their backs, makes sexual innuendos, and argues all the time. He’ll butt into my conversations JUST to argue with me. His teaching style is just criticising people’s work and forgetting to give them anything constructive to work on. Every time I leave his class I’m frustrated and angry. I just want nothing to do with him. So yeah, my attendance for that class is bad.

576,"I've been struggling with feeling guilty for not hanging out with my friends. 

I live 50 miles from them and it isn't easy for me to always come up to see them. 

I work a full time job and when I am not working, I'm usually working on maintaining my family land. We have 16 acres and it is essentially a full time job to keep it maintained. I also take care of my 74 year old grandmother.

It makes me feel guilty because they've been so good to me. When I do see them, they always ask, ""where've you been?"". When I explain to them what I've been doing, they seem like they don't believe me. Like they think I'm making excuses or something. 

I'm not one to discuss my personal affairs when anyone, so I think they make up their own assumptions. 

It makes me feel weird when I can't participate in the stuff their doing because I'm out working in the woods all weekend and doing other chores. I tend to think that they assume I'm sitting at home jerking off and playing video games, but I really do have responsibilities.

I met a guy recently through a friend/old colleague. He’s about 10 years older than me but I like him so far, we got on really well when we met and he wants me to go out for dinner/drinks with him alone this time. I’ve cancelled once before but he now wants to meet me this weekend and I feel a bit guilty having to cancel again. 

The problem is, I’m currently in a very bad financial situation. I basically have almost no money at all and would not be able to split the bill. I’m not sure if he’s expecting me to do so and I wouldn’t want to seem rude by not offering, but at the same time, if I keep cancelling, he may assume I’m not interested.

I don’t mind talking finances in a relationship, but bringing the topic up before a first date just seems really awkward and uncomfortable. Any advice? Thanks",28Feb2020,1

579,"I thought it was done with this for two years now. Two years free of petty highschool drama (I’m still in secondary school but my friends now are mature). We’re all 17 now and I assumed we would be fine.

I’m wrong obviously. One friend of mine (who I’ve been friends with for so many years now) is very opinionated and has very controversial opinions (like me). We’ll call this friend A and she’s honestly one of the most understanding and kind people I know. My other friend, B is also kind and amazing. She has the more common opinion I guess? She’d very stubborn too. 

Anyways, these two tend to have an argument every day at lunch. One time it was about Kobe Bryant, A said she’s not really upset because “he was a rapist” B says that wasn’t proven and he still died so she should feel a bit bad. They argue. Me and another friend end it. 

They’ve also argued about religion. This is where Bs stubbornness comes in. A is from a VERY religious family but she’s an atheist, she can’t tel her family this though otherwise she could she kicked out of the house. We’re all atheists but B for some reason gets annoyed at A for saying she’s an atheist. B says since A has been christened, done her confession, goes to mass and has had her communion that she MUST be a Christian and she CANT be an atheist if she lies to her family about it. I’ve back A up on this but they argued again.

Arguments are usually B getting really annoyed, yelling and saying stupid shit. A trying to explain and defend herself calmly while doing more stuff she knows will provoke B. 

Issue is, today they both didn’t really speak and B was upset. I called A and asked why and she ranted so much about how B always accused her of starting the fights when in reality B is the one who gets mad and starts yelling instead of trying to understand that people don’t always need to agree. I agreed with that. But honestly I can’t deal with this drama. I told A she needs to talk to B about this, they need to sort this out. I said maybe mention that the arguing is upsetting you and you don’t want to lose a good friend. Say that you think you should stop speaking about such controversial topics but that also B should try not to get so frustrated and worked up about her opinions and should try to understand a bit more. She said she might do that. 

Idk I just know that they will argue again and that they will split up, not wanting to be friends and this stupid drama will affect the entire friendgroup. I’d have to be careful with who I spend time with and when to avoid upsetting the other. And I can’t be fucked with that shit. I don’t want to be worried every time I speak to a friend because “my other friend might think I hate them” I thought I left that shit behind when I was 14. 

What else can I do to help this situation? To make them see eye to eye and resolve their own shit so the entire group won’t be hurt?",28Feb2020,1

Main lady who id be working with was really analytics-focused, technical audience targeting - and i didn’t think I had strong skills in that. 

Creative Director and I hit it off and I liked his style, it was like mine. My entire presentation was about the ways we speak to different audiences and using a different writing style to achieve it. He said there was a creative copywriting position open and he thinks he would like me on that team. He invited me to email him about the position. 

I brought it up to the Hiring Manager - and she says she wants me as Social Media Manager.
I honestly don't know if I want that role anymore. But I've noticed they've removed it from the jobs site listings. I do not know what the copywriting position salary is and I don’t know if emailing the Creative Director would feel sneaky to the others.

However, I'm unemployed at the moment and picking up odd jobs and things to get by. One is teaching ESL online. I have to take several quizzes for a type of teaching certification and it took me three attempts to pass the first quiz. That shook me. I would usually pass those kinds of things on the first try after passively reading through the materials once. I have also felt like my professional writing has slipped and my ability to make sense of how I feel/what I'm thinking/what is happening has declined.

587,"Just in case anyone would like to know I am a 21-year-old female I am a senior in college and I apologize for any bad grammar or punctuation I’m using speech to text on my phone right now because I don’t feel like typing.

So basically, I have a little bit of a spending habit and it’s getting to a point where it’s starting to have a negative affect on my life. It all started at the beginning of the school year, I moved out of an apartment because of a bad roommate situation and I’m now living with my parents again and I commute to school. I also have a very light courseload this semester so that means a lot of downtime for me during school hours and I tend to get very bored and often when I get bored I will go shopping. I normally go shopping with the intent to buy something specific, it’s usually just one thing that I have convinced myself that I need to buy but then I will continue to explore the store and end up buying several other things when I didn’t need to buy anything at all usually not even the first original thing I wanted to get. Over the course of six months roughly I have accumulated $1000 in credit card debt for purchases that I didn’t need to make. On top of that I am in debt due to school, a car that I need to pay off and some unexpected medical bills that popped up during the school year also. I had my boyfriend take my credit card from me and he’s not going to give it back to me until all of that is paid off and I am really proud of myself for being able to admit that I have a little bit of a problem and I thought that taking the credit card away would help but it has not. Now I’m just using my debit card to buy things that I don’t need but I can’t just take the debit card away that would make things a little bit difficult for me so I’m not really sure how to kick this habit. I am very afraid that it’s going to get worse it’s not super bad right now but I’m afraid that it will spiral out of control if I don’t stop it now. 

I also have a bit of a problem with food. I wouldn’t consider myself a binge eater but I definitely eat more than I should and my diet mostly consists of fast food. I have tried to quit many times and I’m just not sure how to do it I absolutely despise vegetables and it’s hard to make myself eat healthy. I thought that it would be easier to just incorporate healthy food into my diet instead Of cutting out all the bad stuff but neither way has really worked for me. 

I am also a huge procrastinator I put off everything in my life from paying bills to school work I have no motivation to do anything. Most days I would be perfectly content laying in bed and I absolutely hate to admit that because it’s really pathetic but it’s the complete truth. I don’t like school I don’t like learning I don’t really like doing much of anything. I could go into way more detail about this but this is already a long enough post and overall I’m just very fed up with myself and I’m not sure how to motivate myself to do things and to reach the goals I set for myself and I also have no idea how to have any sort of self control and I really just need someone to give me some ideas on how I can fix this.

596,"Am I too dumb to do math?

There is hardly any self-confidence remaining in me for mathematics. In my first year of undergraduate college at UCLA, I made C’s and B’s in all of my classes. I guess that it is because that I hardly ever attended classes, but it could also mean that I am just not gifted enough for math. I did work through the textbooks for some classes, but my memory sucked. I never went to office hours. I never felt the need to go through concepts more than once, but look where that got me.

Ever since that year, I have been taking online IQ tests to see where my IQ could be because I’m such a insecure piece of garbage. I currently get between 140-170 SD 15 on the online IQ tests, which is weird because I have never felt that gifted before. I have always been insulted for being slow in middle and high school, and I was never in a gifted and talented program. I’m also a member of Mensa after scoring in the 99th percentile on the RAIT. I was in the top 30 in the state for UIL Math contests, but there are always others who did a lot better. I don’t know if my crappy performance was a result of having started doing contest math in tenth grade while the others started in elementary and middle school. Or it could have been because they have higher IQs. 

I have never felt like a person with a genius IQ, and I feel like I’m as dumb as my father who got fired as a janitor for being so mediocre. Will I end up like him? Do I have what it takes to become a Fields Medalist, or should I work at McDonald’s? This is not a troll post. I’ve been really depressed for years now because of my apparent mediocrity. Every time that I want to do math, I would have to remind myself just how hard and long it was for me to understand the concepts. I’d always feel discouraged. I would get problems wrong, and I’d hardly understand the solutions. Maybe I’m over exaggerating.",28Feb2020,2

They kept me in the same starter positions (usher and ticket taker) before I expressed interest in working in the kitchen a month later.

The gm even promised that i’ll eventually worked concessions in January. Two months later, that has yet to happen. I want to know concessions mainly so that I can become a supervisor after i’ve mastered every position.

I'm in my first year of university and it's been a really rough start. A very close family member died and I spent a lot of time travelling to see them when they were sick, then better, then sick again which all took a massive toll on my mental health. The people at my uni who I told didn't really seem to care - the one person who I felt would have cared had left earlier on in the year. I find it hard to make new friends due to my anxiety - whenever I leave a social situation I reduce myself to tears because of my intense fear of judgement which is just sending me into isolation, there are people I can reach out to but it's just easier being alone. Guys who I meet in class just end up trying to be flirty and never seem to have the intention of just being my friend and it makes me feel so objectified (don't mean this in a braggy way, just kinda what happens). I just miss my friends back home so much.

I feel like I've lost most of my motivation to do anything, I can't concentrate on my work and I just don'y really care about it. It's so difficult to get out of bed most days, I just want to be in my room and ignore everything going on outside. I absolutely love my location and I would be so sad to leave but I'm just so unhappy, I can't really tell if I hate uni, hate my course, if I'm just lazy or unhappy with life in general. All I want is for the world to stop for just a minute while I try and figure things out but of course that can't happen. I feel like things are going a million miles per hour and I can't stop it.

The thought of dropping out just seems easier but I'm nearly finished with this year so it feels like a giant waste of my time as well as everyone else's. I desperately want to do my family proud even though they're always going to be supportive of whatever I decide. Being at uni also means I'm closer to my boyfriend which has definitely been helping me cope and I don't want to go back to being long distance, that was hard enough. 

I've had these thoughts for a few months and I've just kind of ignored them and powered through but I don't think I can do that anymore. Everyday keeps getting harder and I just don't know what to do anymore - I know a lot of it can be typical of uni life but I don't think I'm one of those people that can power through.

i just find the whole ordeal to be incredibly unprofessional, and I'm curious as to whether or not this is by law an okay thing to do?

I was technically hired and never heard back on whether or not they actually want me on as an employee so I'm not sure if I'm legally employed or unemployed currently.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",28Feb2020,1

618,"I’m a 16 year old girl and no girls want to be my friend. I had a pretty bad experience where my whole group of friends started to hate me and turn against me because of a girl within the group telling lies about me to get them to dislike me. They made up secret code names to talk about me and even resorted to talking about me in front of me, and would make jokes about whatever I did. I got the hint and left them alone, despite having been the one that brought the group together. Since then, I only have my boyfriend and his friends (who are all male) to hang out with and whilst I love them and find them to be great friends, I long for a female friendship. I want a friend to go shopping with and have sleepovers with but no girls seem to like me. I used to have so many female friends but now I just find them hard to talk to because I feel like they’re judging me like my last group of friends did. I also have pretty bad ocd and anxiety and that combined with the fact that I’m pretty traumatised by my last group makes it quite difficult for me.

&amp;#x200B;

For quite some time I have been someone a little insecure, however it has never affected me so much because I have used that insecurity to become someone better in various aspects of my life, which has been quite useful and made me happy.

The problem is that lately that insecurity increased dramatically, I realized this when I slept with a girl from work, I was a virgin and she was not, I saw no problem to that but after a few days I began to dislike the idea that she had been with another person or people, which surprised me and I started to investigate on the internet why this happened to me, all the answers I found led to the point that I was disgusted because ''I thought women should not have more than one partner, which was a machist thought '' and I don't agree with that, I think women should be able to have more than one partner just like everyone else.

That's how the days went by and I kept thinking about the problem (I must clarify that I started dating that girl and we love each other a lot), when one night I discovered what bothered me, it was the thought of insecurity, my mind thought ''What if she doesn't like me as much as her old partner?'' ''What if she think I'm not as good at sex as her old boyfriend?'' ''What if she thinks about someone else while we have sex?''

I don't know what to do about it.

To give a little more history, this girl has a split tongue, something that hides because it was done in her teens and now she is embarrassed of it, which makes me think about how her past life was, maybe she slept with a ton of men or whatever and all that makes me even more uncomfortable.",28Feb2020,1

This has been something that has made me feel disgusting and ashamed of myself for the past year. It's gotten to the point where I dont feel like I deserve happiness in life and I'm a terrible person. Now I never thought I was a racist person, I always thought of myself as the opposite actually. I care or thought I cared deeply about the equality and acceptance of all people, especially being someone that's suffered abuse myself. This was until about a year ago I got into a terrible fight with someone I cared about a great deal. We had dated casually but we had more of a friendship if anything. I messaged him asking if he knew where I could get some weed one day after not talking in a bit. Apparently he had my name saved as honey boo boo (lol I know) in messenger and his girlfriend at the time saw this and broke up with him (there was no cheating going on I hadn't spoken to him for a while before this went down) anyway after this he was rightfully upset but he started blaming me and abusing me saying extremely hurtful things to me about how I was gross and everyone hated me (things he knew would upset me I guess) at the time this was happening I was sitting next to my mother in hospital who has now passed and I was on drugs (this isn't me trying to play the victim in any way shape or form, my circumstance doesn't excuse my behaviour but may explain why I acted the way I did) so I wasn't in the right mind frame at all i told him this and told him to leave me alone, I should've just blocked him but I was so upset by this I proceeded to make the worst decision I have ever made and am honestly still disgusted by my behaviour. I said some hurtful things back to him and called him a dirty Ni****. I don't feel good even typing that out and I honestly dont know what to do anymore. I've since apologized to him, first time in person he said he didn't even remember but I don't think that's true &amp; even went as far to tell me I'm a good person despite what I said but honestly a good person would never say such a thing, and the second time on messenger but he didn't respond because hes currently seeing someone else. I've felt like an absolutely disgusting piece of shit since and don't know how to live with myself, not only have I acted in a completely disgusting way but I feel like I've ruined my own life in the process,as well as hurting this person deeply. I get nervous around people of colour now , because I feel as if they can sense my past wrongdoing almost, I'm not sure if that's weird to say this whole situation has given me anxiety. Even if this person did hurt me it was extremely low of me to bring race into the equation. I also feel as if I'm not deserving of going after my life dream of being a rapper, knowing about its roots and origins after what I said I feel like I have some nerve if I were to do this it would be completely disrespectful. (I'm caucasian btw) this whole situation has made me feel depressed and horrible tbh and I'm not sure how to forgive myself and move on from the past. This shits haunted me since it happened.

I can open with “hi, how are you?”... And that’s easy to break the ice I guess, but then what, i freeze and become lost for words. I don’t want to bore the person I’m talking to, since my goal is to try and get a phone number or a date. And for that reason I’m anxious to put myself in those situations, there’s nothing worse than embarrassment. I don’t handle that so well :/

639,"Hello everyone,

I am attempting to end my lease early due to some negligence on their part. From December to now, they have been undergoing ownership change. In December, they lost several documents. An example, me and my fiance had to sign documents stating who occupies the unit. Another example, and this example relates more to this post, was service requests.

&amp;#x200B;

On December 24th, 2019, I put in a service request to have my garage repaired. It would close all the way, but come right back up. Since this would occur, I had to take my storage out of my garage and store it in my apartment. The garage is detached. I waited a week and called them again to ask what the status was. They had lost the service request, so they had no idea it was even a thing. They sent out a maintenance man who simply paired a new garage opener to my garage. He did not bother closing it, or attempting to see if it fixed my issue. After he left I had to get back in contact to see what the next step was, and to tell them that they had not fixed my issue. They said they could not fix the issue and they had to get the Garage Vendor to come out and fix it. Fast forward another week, I called and asked for an update and was told the Garage Vendor was short staffed. It finally was fixed an additional week after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now that we know that issue let me present to you a small portion of the lease that pertains to this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;31.RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We’ll act with customary  
&gt;  
&gt;diligence to:  
&gt;  
&gt;(1) keep common areas reasonably clean, subject to paragraph  
&gt;  
&gt;25 (Condition of the Premises and Alterations);  
&gt;  
&gt;(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating and A/C  
&gt;  
&gt;equipment;  
&gt;  
&gt;(3) comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding  
&gt;  
&gt;safety, sanitation, and fair housing; and  
&gt;  
&gt;**(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay**  
&gt;  
&gt;**for damages for which you are liable.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*If we violate any of the above, you may terminate your tenancy and*  
&gt;  
&gt;*exercise other remedies only as follows: (a) you must make a written*  
&gt;  
&gt;*request for repair or remedy of the condition, and all rent must be*  
&gt;  
&gt;*current at the time; (b) after receiving your request, we have a*  
&gt;  
&gt;*reasonable time to repair, considering the nature of the problem*  
&gt;  
&gt;*and the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and utilities; (c)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*if we haven’t diligently tried to repair within a reasonable time, you*  
&gt;  
&gt;*must then give us written notice of intent to terminate your tenancy*  
&gt;  
&gt;*unless the repair is made within 7 days; and (d)* ***if repair hasn’t been***  
&gt;  
&gt;***made within 7 days, you may terminate your tenancy and exercise***  
&gt;  
&gt;***other lawful remedies.*** *Security deposits and prorated rent will be*  
&gt;  
&gt;*refunded as required by law.*

&amp;#x200B;

This all seems to fall under point 4. 

For (a): I had put in an initial service request, and a week later put in another one.

For (b): It took them a week to have a call placed to Garage Vendor. Their first attempt to repair after the first week was described as simply attempting to pair a new garage door opener. 

For (c): They did not diligently attempt to repair the garage within the first week. They didn't bother to see if their first repair request would fix the issue.

For (d): I am attempting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought up all of my facts of the issue and emailed the manager. Her reply was as such:

&amp;#x200B;

They would not be letting me out of my lease because when the complex was sold and new ownership was obtained, they lost all service documents. *Is this not their responsibility, therefore on them?* They also said that the garage not working did not affect my actual apartment living. *I don't believe the lease mentions that the repair has to affect apartment living?* She then mentioned they told me that they had to wait for a part, and when it got there, that the repair would be made. *They told me that the Garage Vendor was short staffed and that a repair would be made soon. That took another week.*

&amp;#x200B;

Where should I go after this? We would like to get out of this lease because of the many inconveniences not mentioned here.",28Feb2020,1

643,"I don't want to turn this into r/iam14andthisisdeep kind of post. This is actually bothering me that's why this is a throw away account.

Anyways.
I always like reading crime stories ever since I could read, which was at 4 years old.
Crime stories just catch my interest for some reason. The older I got the more brutal the stories I read got. Right now I am really into serial killer stuff, but they are boring me now too. I know this is a pregty common thing to like so that is not what is concerning me. 
But I usually don't find myself hating the serial killers. Usually I admire them.
Ever since my childhood I was prone to violent outbursts. Usually it was against myself. I started self harming very young. About at 8 years old.
But now that the self harm is gone I keep getting the urge to harm others.
It pops up in my head just like the urge to selfharm did, if you ever self harmed you know what I mean.
It is just an all over taking urge that consums my thoughts.
I will ne minding my own bussines and something irritates me and boom there it is ""I wish I could rip your throught open"", ""I wish I could strangle you""
Seeing violence in media doesn't phase me. I want to become a doctor so I watch a lot of surgeries.
When I was in my early teens I used to look up car accident victims because I thought it was so interesting.
Usually my emotions are shallow. I am rarely angry, sad, happy. I feel them, I don't want to act like an edgy teen.
Just very shallow.
And I don't care about people who aren't my very close friends. In fact, I hope a lot of people die. The earth is over populated anyways.
I can't help but feeling like me consuming a lot of violent content as a very young child had something to do with that.
I technically know thinking about killing your teachers/parents etc. On a semi daily basis is wrong, but I can't help doing that.
I am scared of what might happen. I just seem too loose myself. I can't help it. 
I don't know what to do. I don't even fucking know myself.

Probably will delete it because this is dumb.",28Feb2020,1
644,"Okay, I’m going to try to talk about this without exposing who either party is. Here’s what happened to the victim, without too many details: They were in a relationship with someone who ultimately murdered them in a very violent fashion. I’ll call the victim “A” and the murderer “B.” 

During B’s trial, her legal team used every tiny detail from the writings of A to make them seem like an evil, sadistic person who tried to rape/kill B and thus deserved to be brutally murdered. Many people still support B and believe she is 100% innocent and A was an evil man who deserved to be murdered. The evidence, however, all points to B being guilty, and she is now serving a looooong prison sentence. But her supporters are still loud. People tend to side with B because they believe a small, quirky, middle-class white girl would never murder anyone, but that a nerdy young man like A would of course want to violently rape her (of which there is no evidence).

It was all over the news a few weeks ago and I couldn’t help but feel connected to A, as their abuser reminded me of my own and their interests are akin to mine (and also they were just a very kind and sweet person). I feel that, had I been less lucky, my abuser would’ve put me in the same place as A, twisting the narrative so I look like the perpetrator and she looks like the victim. I am also truly in awe at the fact that such a young person was so intelligent and wise. So I read some Reddit threads and uncovered some things a friend of A’s wrote about them and the trial. This friend spoke at the trial and videos of it are available online (which is how I know they really knew A). So, I went back through the friend’s Reddit history and found where he and A engaged in conversations on a subreddit on here. This led me to A’s personal account, which is full of years’ worth of their hundreds of comments and posts. The posts stopped just a few days before A was murdered. It seems that the subreddits A was a moderator on are completely unaware that A, whom they had been engaging with for years, was murdered (given that A is still listed as a moderator). I feel very sad that A’s online friends never knew what became of them and thus cannot mourn them.

This brings me to my dilemma. Many of what A wrote on reddit disavows everything that was claimed by the defense about them. A was kind. A was loving. A was respectful, believed in human goodness, and was more supportive than I’ve ever encountered a person being. All these sentiments were echoed by their friends and family in trial, but detractors still claim there was some sinister person behind A’s mask just ready to pounce and rape an ex-girlfriend. There are even a few posts about B, where A talks about how much they cared about her and wanted her to be happy. All the posts, going back three years prior to A’s death, paint a picture of an intelligent, thoughtful young person with a lot of promise whose life was tragically and unfairly cut short.

A’s reddit also shows that they identified as nonbinary, a fact I believe no one in the courtroom was aware of. Exposing the reddit means outing A’s personal life even more than happened in the courtroom when their personal writings were torn apart. I’m not sure that it’s right to do this to A’s memory—for A or their family and friends, who have already heard horrible things claimed about A in court and in the media.

A also had intentions to one day write a book about their niche interest. The reddit posts include upwards of 10,000 words of lessons, lists of favorite books, and guidance. I think this would be a very valuable thing for people interested in their niche interest to have access to, especially since A wanted nothing more than to educate people and help others grow. What’s saddest of all is that A truly believed no one was beyond redemption and no one was without an ounce of goodness—it seems it’s always these kind-hearted souls who attract sadistic individuals who want to feed off their goodness. It’s devastating to see all the things A wanted to accomplish and the growth they were capable of and know that was cut so short.
I have a few choices—
1. Expose nothing and leave the reddit account alone. Let A rest in peace. I feel guilty for ever even finding the account, though it was my fault for going looking.
2. Expose the reddit account, hopefully showing that A isn’t what B and the defense claimed, and also showing detractors of A that they were more than the vindictive, slimy, sexually perverse man they paint them as.

What is my moral obligation here? I don’t want A’s memory picked apart more than it already has been, but I also don’t want a skewed image of A to exist in people’s minds. Despite never knowing them, I care very much about A and I don’t want to do anything that would tarnish their memory or bring further pain upon their family.

646,"I have never wanted children. I don't know how to interact well with them and because of this I've always been extremely uncomfortable around them. My husband has an older daughter that I have a decent but somewhat distant relationship with. She is due to have her first child next month, her baby shower is tomorrow. 

My husband is excited, it's his first grandchild, and is talking about the future with this child. I've been having a lot of anxiety about this because I'm realizing that this child is going to be a big part of my day to day life (he's away most of the week for work). 

I find it incredibly difficult to wrap my head around that fact that I'm going to be a grandmother (I'm only 36). My free and  childless future seems to be disappearing fast and, as bad as this sounds, I feel like this child is being forced on me. My stepdaughter is not financially stable and I don't see how she'll be able to afford daycare.

I don't think I'm a bad person. I would never neglect or hurt a child in any way. I will do my best to make him feel loved. But how do I do that? What can I do to ease my anxieties? How do I tell my husband that I'm dreading this? How do you deal with something that completely changes your life in an unwanted/negative way?",28Feb2020,1

Soooooo...how do I reconcile comforting my friend who just broke up with someone they genuinely loved and the want to just go off and list every rude thing the ex-girlfriend has ever said to me or our other friends and just be like....she was a genuinely unpleasant person to be around.

I’m indoor percussion and when we did try outs I tired out for the drum set. I practiced my butt off everyday on those warmups and I had a competition.

Because I thought because they favor him more then me and because they are closer to him. So once we get our results for our instrument. I didn’t get set and that hit me so hard. But I got back up. I was upset and apparently it showed on my face and just physically. I always cried when I went home. I was affected deeply from not getting it. Now 3 months I for the season I’ve grown used to my part. The other day the directors pulled me in their office and talked to me. They said they noticed that I look unhappy In indoor. I don’t know where they were taking Thai conversation until the director brought up that they know I really wanted drum set. Now I knew what this was about. I was caught off guard just saying “Oh...uhhh.yeah.”   So the directors told
Me that they both wanted to touch base on this and tell me how eveything went into the decision making. and that it wasn’t personal, the director said that he was choosen because V is more further along as a musician and he’s been music-ing ever since he was in 5th grade and he’s in 11th. The director wnated to give me a head start in a similar part that is like multi instruments. 
But anyways know that you know what happens when I think about it or listen to the recording of the convo I get upset and get testy eyed. I have no clue why I’m feeling this way. When I wasn’t even getting yelled at. Idk why it’s making me so upset. It wasn’t even a bad convo. It was motivating and so brutally honest.

653,"So my dad died about a year ago. It was really sudden and we were not in the best place when it happened, so i definitely have some regrets. It really hurt to lose him even though i try to pretend it didn’t and doesn’t still hurt me. I really loved him despite the bad and had so many amazing memories with him.

Ever since he died, i’m constantly worried my other loved ones are next. I’ll be saying goodbye to someone after hanging out, and all i’ll be able to think is “this could be the last time you see them.” 

Last night i was feeling extra emotional (to be honest i got my period lol) and was thinking about my dad, and it got me thinking about how absolutely scared i am to lose anyone else. I pretty much prayed that he would watch over me and watch over my loved ones. 

This same night when i went to sleep, i had a dream that my boyfriend died. It was of a really random cause, i don’t even remember what exactly, and i got a  nonchalant call from someone we know saying “yeah he died, sorry”, and they hung up and i was absolutely devastated. When i woke up, i was super upset and now i am so paranoid that something bad is going to happen since i had a bad dream about it, especially when i was just crying the night before and praying to my dad and asking to watch over us.

I really don’t know what to do or how to stop worrying. I had a dream in the past that a place i visit frequently got shot up when i was with a family member and nothing actually happened in real life, but just the thought of my boyfriend dying is the dream i had last night is sending me all over in anxiety and panic mode. I know i’m being dumb, but it’s genuinely how i feel.

I would also like to add to this that whenever i see my boyfriend, for some reason i have to tell him i love him 3 times before he leaves or else my mind thinks something bad will happen to him on his way home. I know that is absolutely insane sounding but it’s just how i think, and i’m like what if i don’t do that and something bad happens and it’s all my fault?! I don’t know where this comes from or if it is some way to make me feel more in control.

I’ve recently realized i am deathly afraid of losing him, more than anybody i know, so maybe that’s where this dream came from? From my fears? Either way, has anyone experienced anything like this and what can i do? Im really making myself suffer at this point and can’t seem to fully enjoy being around loved ones without the worry overhead of me.",28Feb2020,1
654,"Long story short - I had to give up my full time job as a teacher due to a poisoning from a prescription medicine (taken as prescribed), and have had to rely on disability benefit to survive.

I've been staying with a family member but they're now moving on and selling the house. I have 1 month to find a new place.

I'm looking to move to the South East of England as ambulance times are better (I'm currently in the South West and had to wait 2 hours a few days ago as a Category 2 high priority call).

I called about a flat yesterday and was told the landlord wouldn't take me on with housing benefit as it affects his mortgage. It's the second time I've been told this - once directly with a private landlord and once through an agency.

I'm now in a position where I'm panicking and wondering whether I should just not say anything.

The money gets paid directly into my bank account so technically the landlord doesn't know. I did actually rent privately last year and it was absolutely fine - I paid rent full on time, and just said I work online as a designer and tutor (which is half true - I do that when I can but not enough to cover full outgoings).

However most of the properties in the South East (Sussex specifically) are through agencies and I think they want proof of employment/income

So the advice I'm seeking is, is there a way around this? 3 options I thought of:

1. Could I provide bank statements showing my income which would be above £1k per month in that area - but just use a black marker over 'DWP' (Department for Work and Pensions), which obviously may raise suspicions but I could just say my work is private..?
2. Could I fake a contract of work (say with a friend or family member who's self employed),  e.g ""this person works for me as an online designer and earns £1k per month""- then show them above statement too, or would this count as benefit fraud?
3. Crazy as it sounds is it worth me applying for a full time job in the area, purely to sign a contract and then show landlord that contract and obviously have to quit fairly soon after (NB: after 3 years of this situation I am looking to get into part time work when I move but obviously a part time contract won't be enough to satisfy an agency/landlord).

Does anyone have any advice on this? Many thanks",28Feb2020,1

However, when it comes to family and my marriage I can go off the handle. I remember when my mom moved my now-stepfather and his kids into our house I punched a walI. I was 8. I still have scars on my knuckles from that day. 

I should mention I didn't grow up in an abusive household but it was very stressful. My mom is extremely defensive and if she somehow thought I was blaming her for anything in any way she would start screaming and stomping around the house, slamming doors, etc. One time I came home from high school 5 minutes late because I was working on a project with my friend. She came up to the door with me because we were proud of our finished product and wanted to see my mom's reaction. She grabbed me by my collar and yanked me inside, slamming the door in my friend's face. Then continued to punch me in the back while I was curled on my bed for 15 mins. Though it wasn't common I think maybe it affected me?

Anyway, from maybe the age of 10-21 I never had any expressions of violence. No punching walls, for example. Then I moved in with my SO and one night she got mad and threw a mug across the room and said she was leaving. So I kicked a couch. 

We broke up and I worked on myself for a few years. Smoked a lot of weed. Didn't think I was that person anymore. I moved to a foreign country to be with my spouse which set off a lot of stress. It's caused some really bad issues between us and one night when we had a fight I punched myself in the leg until I have knots. That was a new one - never hurt myself before. Never been violent since the couch incident.

To wrap up this novel, I don't want to be this person. I feel like it's not even me. But in the moment I'm watching myself from out of my body..like an alternate reality. It's the craziest thing. 

I really need help. What can I do? I have had issues finding counselors here that speak English well enough or just kind of blow it off. I don't speak the language well enough that I think I could really explain my emotions with 100% clarity.

One incoming colleague (also recently graduated from college, knows no one in the area) has reached out to me suggesting that we live together. This is where I need help.

665," About 4 months ago my car was hit in the parking lot at work by a linen companies box truck. I have been calling the customer service branch manager on and off for months, and had gotten multiple estimates for the damage. Since it happened while I was at work I only managed to get the guys information before he left for his next stop. (originally attempted to flee the scene and a bystander stopped him.) Since then, the customer service manager has denied two of the claims given two him by my body shop, the manager changed the story from his driver hitting me while reversing, to his door hitting my car (miraculously shattering my rear headlight and deeply gashing the rear quarter panel.) Now on my third attempt to get an estimate we can agree upon, he says he still wont pay it; only if he can take my car to his company's personal shop. I am in desperate need of help. I really need to get my car fixed, it needs to be inspected and wont pass by a mile if this doesn't get fixed. This guy has given me no reason to believe his shop wont give me cheap replacements and a botched job. He refuses to acknowledge potential electrical damage to the tail light that needs to be looked at and makes me worry that it will get swept under the rug by his shop along with any other issues he may be able to get away with.

I’m facing a heartbreaking situation with regards to the person I honestly and truly believe could be “the one.” It’s on a level I have never experienced or dreamed of, but having now been together for 2 years, I have a difficult situation to consider: I have to leave. My family has emigrated from a disadvantaged country, and I’m on an expensive but possibly extendable/reissueable(?) visa and expected to follow. It is a great opportunity.

I’m a young guy, to tell the truth, and my life is nowhere near to the level, to be completely solo - live alone, support myself, just be an adult. I mean; I am trying as hard as I can, and while I do have options to potentially get to that level, alone, I know it wouldn’t be without heartbreak and hardship to my family and to myself. I’m scared, I feel alone and insecure when I’m alone but with her, I feel like myself - I feel strong and I feel she is where I am meant to be. I feel complete, but she is thousands of km away.

She has however, shown interest in potentially joining me - but only in atleast a year or potentially 2 and long distance is no venture for the faint of heart and it isn’t something I want to do - not again. 

How do I go about this? I won’t lie, I’m willing to try - to go alone and do this and I know she wants me to. This woman could be my wife, and I desperately want her to be, but how do I get us to that level if I’m not there? How much should my relationship mean? Am I giving her too much?

Now again we go away travelling together about 4-5 times a year. About 8 months ago we went away and got really drunk and we slept together, it was all initiated by him. 
Straight after he told me that he hopes it doesn’t become weird and that we should not make it a regular thing. 
The next two times we went away same thing happened, in one way or another initiated by him  but I was more than willing. 
Last night it happened again and straight after he said we should drink less. 
I confronted him this morning asking him how does he feel about our “relationship” especially so that it’s him who starts it. 
He replied that he doesn’t judge me for wanting it but he doesn’t want it to impact our friendship! 
He then changed the subject. So didn’t give me a proper answer and pretty much turned it on me. 
It frustrates me because it is fun what we are doing and i too want to maybe try things etc instead of just being all led and initiated by him, but if he does not want to talk about it, I don’t know what else I can do whilst I want it to continue but I also want to know where I stand.",28Feb2020,1

Up until around the beginning of February, everything has been good, a good amount of criticism from everybody just to keep everybody in check. Recently, I was at my friends house and he made a joke that got to me a little more then usual, and started laughing. I, upset and wanting revenge, punched him in the balls (ik shallow move, but what else do you do when you’re a teenage boy.)
After this he decides to tell our entire friend group, that I “grabbed his balls and tried to fondle his dick.” Everyone believes him, and the first friend starts making other claims to make it seem like I’m gay, like saying I scooted over next to him on the couch, and that I humped him. None of theses things are true, yet my whole friend group believes him.
Now, every time I hang out with them or talk to them, they somehow mention that I’m gay. They beat me up for trying to argue against them, and tell their snapchat that I’m gay and I’ve been trying to come out for a while, and everyone believes it. I now have girls hitting me up, telling me they’re “not surprised” that I’m gay. Every time I try to ask them to stop, they hit me with the “learn to take a joke.” I’ve had to try and defend myself multiple times, but it never works, and I have times where we start having a conversation, and out of the blue completely unrelated they call me gay
I’ve gone home sometimes after hanging out and just cried in my room, wishing they treated me like how they treat everyone else in the group. Being called gay is something I’ve sealed with my whole life, but having people and my friends believe it is new. Every time they can make a gay reference they do. I’ve asked them to stop multiple times, and even went home from a sleepover because they wouldn’t leave me alone.

674,"As the title says, I'm 19 years old. I'm a second-year college student on track to graduate three semesters early due to AP credits I have from high school. I'm currently taking seven classes (five is standard at my university) and I'm doing well in all my classes, but I'm miserable.

I have very few friends at school. I've always suffered from social anxiety, so it's hard for me to maintain friendships if I don't see the other person reciprocating my efforts to spend time together. I always end up feeling like I'm annoying people by asking them to hang out, so I avoid asking. I end up very lonely because no one reaches out to me to spend time with me. It makes me feel like I'm not a likable person.

I have a job on campus, but I hate it. It's a receptionist job and admittedly very easy, but it's basically *too* easy. I would function better in a job where I was kept busy -- last summer, I worked as a cashier at a restaurant and my managers loved me because I was so productive. Meanwhile, my current job just involves sitting idle at a desk for hours until someone needs help. We aren't allowed to bring anything to do to pass the time. The lack of stimulation is draining.

I have been having mental health issues since the fall. I was doing really well for the most part, and then I had a seizure that landed me in the hospital. The doctors were running all kinds of tests to figure out what caused it, and they diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was put on an anticonvulsant, but had to stop taking it after just a few weeks because it was making me tired, dizzy, anxious, and suicidal. 

I spent a lot of time over my winter break trying to clean up my mental health and I felt like I started the spring semester strong, but it's just been one thing after another in terms of stressors. The first week of the semester, my school informed my roommates and I that we would have to be relocated to a different campus apartment because it was discovered that there was a water leak from our apartment to the one below, so they had to rip up our floors and replace them. So we began the process of packing our belongings to move out for three weeks, which was physically exhausting and a huge time commitment in my already packed schedule. On Valentine's Day, I moved back to my own apartment, but since then I've been too depressed to clean and fully unpack, so my bedroom is a mess. I feel like a robot lately -- all I do is wake up, go to class, shower, and go to bed. 

I've talked to my mom about what I should do. She suggested therapy, but I had a traumatic experience with therapy when I was younger, so I feel very panicky thinking about putting myself in that environment again. She told me I should think about what makes me happy and what I would like to change about my life. The problem is, I feel like I want to change everything about my life. I don't like my clothes or my hair. I know that I'm perceived as attractive, but I don't feel confident or even comfortable in my skin. I want to change how I look, but I feel guilty spending money on myself because I'm trying to be responsible and save money for school and for my future. I want a different job, but I don't have a car (and likely won't get one because my license gets suspended if I have a seizure), so it's hard to find one that is accessible to me. I don't even like my major anymore. I'm studying journalism, but all I keep hearing in my classes is that journalism is a dying industry and that journalists don't make a lot of money and that the public doesn't like journalists. I used to love writing, but now I dread having to do it. Because I graduate so soon, I need to start thinking about internships, but I completely lack motivation.

I feel like it's hard for anyone around me to tell how badly I need help because I look like I'm doing pretty well. My grades are all A's and B's, I project like I'm a confident person despite the fact that I hate myself, and I'm always keeping myself busy. But I just feel so miserable and I hate getting out of bed every day. 

TL;DR: I'm depressed but I feel like I have no agency to fix any of my problems. I'm successful on paper but I hate being alive.",28Feb2020,1

676,"Hello everyone! I recently spoke to a family friend about her move to Annapolis and about how her life has changed so much from living in the south (I also live in the south). She told me about how different the culture is, and how nobody has down time. Entire days are meticulously planned out, with every moment taken up by work or errands. People would be confused when the family friend said she played outside with her dog because she had free time. I completely respect this lifestyle, and if people are happy, that’s all that really matters. I just know it’s not for my family friend and I. 

After hearing her talk, I realized my life is somewhat similar in that sense. I go throughout my day from one commitment to the next, always preoccupied with the next activity on the agenda. I’m never really “in the moment” as they say; never truly focused on or enjoying the present. 

For those of you that have struggled with this too, how do you live more in the moment? How do you let future commitments stay in the future and not take up time in the present (in terms of thinking about them)?",28Feb2020,1
677,"Intelligence is one of my best traits and I value intellect both in myself and in other people. For the most part, this is fine and normal. But in some aspects, such as at work or with my relationship, it has manifested itself into a superiority complex. I wouldn't say it's severe; I keep most thoughts to myself and I'm not outwardly an asshole about it.

An honest assessment that my friends would give to describe me is someone that's smart and owns it, but still very kind and emotionally intelligent. But if I were to assess my own self knowing the thoughts I keep to myself... while I don't discount my kindness and emotional intelligence in some aspects and the value that provides for others, I also know that my unexpressed thoughts are super judgmental and I don't like it, even if I don't manifest them outwardly. I do know that what while I have several strongly established friend groups that love me as much as I love them, this complex is preventing me from properly making connections with new people as I find myself subconsciously distancing myself from people that I don't see as intelligent as myself. It has also caused me to distance myself to an extent from my existing friends as well.

I don't think this has always been the case. I've always valued intelligence but I think this superiority complex only developed in the past few years or so? I'm working on checking myself more when I have these judgmental thoughts but the habit is so ingrained in me now that it is admittedly difficult.

I've tried to assess the cause of this issue, and I've found that while my superiority complex exists purely in the realm of intelligence and mental ability, I have severe inferiority complexes when it comes to... well, many other things in life.

For example, I've been enlisted in the army for 3 years now but I joined ROTC 1.5 years ago. Since joining, I've had severe feelings of inadequacy and inferiority because I'm definitely not as good as my fellow soldiers in terms of tactical knowledge and also physical ability.

Another example, I've been hip-hop dancing for about 8 years now, which is probably where I can see the ""split"" of me just having a normal mindset to having both superiority and inferiority complexes. I've always been healthily confident in my dance ability and my passion and drive to grow and train in the craft, up until a few years ago where I suddenly just felt like shit every time I danced and couldn't stop comparing myself to others in my dance community. My confidence was just... gone.

One more example is family. Without going into specifics (if you think it's relevant to whatever advice you want to give, you can ask), I've had a broken family life since high school and family has always been a sensitive subject for me. Yet most of my friends and my girlfriend have extremely healthy family lives and do ""normal"" family things like get together for the holidays, family traditions, etc etc, which is something I haven't experienced in a very long time. It's weird to have an inferiority complex for this because family is family and it's not necessarily within your control. Perhaps this part is less so an inferiority complex and moreso envy/jealousy? Either way, I thought it was worth mentioning

There's other examples of inferiority complexes that I've experienced, but army, dance, and family are probably the most important ones to me.

TL;DR - I have a superiority complex when it comes to my intellect. I have inferiority complexes when it comes to skills/hobbies/professions/other tangible things in life. This wasn't always like this, but I feel like the two extremes developed and diverged in the past few years. 

How can I work on developing a better and healthier mental equilibrium, humbling myself where I need to be humbled, and regaining self-esteem/confidence where I need to be kinder to myself?

679,"Hello all,

I'm fairly used to receiving emails intended for other people as I have a very old email account with a popular platform.  Over the years I've had everything from airline boarding passes in my name to tv subscriptions and all manner of things. 

Last month I started receiving emails from an American credit union.  I contacted their customer services and informed them of the error, mainly to protect the account holder, who clearly isn't aware.  They informed me that they would action it immediately, as it was a security issue.

As of today however, they have done nothing and I'm still receiving regular information regarding personal financial information including deposit amounts, partial account numbers, account names etc.

I am not familiar with the US regulatory system, so I am hoping someone here could point me to an authority to whom I can complain?  It's not really much of an inconvenience to me, but the poor customer has no idea his data is sent to the wrong person and I'm sure he'd want it corrected.

If it matters, I believe the customer is a veteran.

He added me on Instagram and now I’m sort of regretting it? 

Right after I gave him my Instagram he asked me if I wanted to head to the skatepark with him mind you like I said earlier it’s 9pm so it’s dark outside and the skatepark was about a 2 miles from my place. Obviously I said no because I’ve never met this person in my life and I’m aware I’m a small girl.

I’m not a very social person and I thought hey maybe I could make a skate friend but after seeing his posts and those last interactions it made me realize I wasn’t comfortable sharing my Instagram with him. I feel really bad but it just makes me feel really uneasy especially being a girl. He hadn’t posted in a year according to the dates on his last posts and then suddenly that night be posted a shirtless photo. He messaged me that night after adding me and I haven’t replied because I really don’t want to meet up in person with him because I’m afraid of his intentions. This whole situation has me sort of scared because something about him doesn’t seem right to me and I don’t want to put myself in a situation that could potentially harm me or just make me feel really uncomfortable. It was my mistake to say I would add him on social media because from our conversation thinking back on it he’s not someone I would typically be friends with in the first place and I should’ve just left it at that conversation.

We live in the same city and I worry about potentially bumping into him one day or something but other than that I was thinking maybe I should just block him?

She moved in last fall, and since then she has been rather disrespectful of me and my time and space. 

She’ll sleep past her alarm and will miss her shower time (for some reason she likes to shower first, going as far as saying she’ll get up at 4am in days that I need to leave the house by 6am (I can get ready in about 45 minutes, it takes her a good two hours), getting in the shower at 5:10am, 5 minutes before I would get in the shower. This has happened multiple times. 

She does have a small half bath where she does her hair and makeup, while the main bathroom with the shower is where I get ready. She does not shed as much as I do, but she does shed. She is blonde, I am brunette. My hair is more noticeable. I clean my hair out after every shower. She never does. 

I just got back from a week of travel, and the drain catcher is full of her hair. To the point I almost don’t want to shower today, to show her the build up that I’ve been cleaning out when she gets home from work today. 

Any time I talk to her about perceived issues of us sharing the bathroom and shower, she becomes the mouse in the corner and avoids me for days. She’s a very contrary personality and likes to argue just for the sake of being right.  It’s hard to talk to her about behaviors she needs to change because she plays the victim. 

She is moving out in early May, so this only has to be dealt with for another couple of weeks, but in order for the friendship to survive, I need her to start thinking of someone other than herself and be more respectful of shared spaces.

1. Stolen tons of alcohol
2. Taken a previous roommates car and drove it around
3. Yelled at my sister and blamed her for “stealing” her face wash when my sister did not
4. Stolen food from the fridge

712,"I [18yo F] have been having night terrors lately. The first one I had was in probably October of last year give or take a month or so, and I had another last night. These two were the most disruptive because I screamed for a prolonged period of time until I finally realized that I was awake. The first terror I had, I was kicking at my jacket on the coat hook next to my bed that also had some hats hanging on it. Since then, I had taken the hats off the hook, and that seemed to help. After removing the hats, I would wake up breathing heavily but I wouldn’t scream bc I could process that it wasn’t a person. I would say that including the event in October, I’ve had about 4-5 night terrors, but only two where I was screaming violently. The other night terrors were just me waking up breathing heavily. Last night, I had another night terror where I was fully screaming, and I felt like I saw a figure/face in my room. After a couple of seconds, I was able to figure out that it wasn’t real. 

After the first night terror, I started leaving my lava lamp on at night, or these small, Christmas-like lights on at night so that if I wake up I’m able to see and not flip out right away, and that seemed to help for a while. However, I realize that I scream before I even wake up, so the lights don’t really help me become aware of my surroundings. It’s as if my dreams cross over into reality. 

I’m mainly concerned because I’ll scream before I wake up, and it’s the sound of my own screaming that wakes me up.

714,My mom has a long history of anger issues. I moved out when I was 17 partly to get away from her. I’m 29 now and we have gotten along great ever since I moved. Anytime I’ve visited her and she blows up on my stepdad or brothers I’ve just walked away. However I have a daughter now and when we visit her explosions scare my daughter and it is stressing me and my husband out. We live 3 hrs away from my mom so we only see her about 6 times a year.  My daughter is 15 months old and this has been a recurring issue since our very first visit. My husband has told me if she goes off while we are visiting again he wants to stop allowing her to visit our daughter. I plan on calling my mom tonight and trying to reason with her but I know it will be very hard to get my point across without her getting mad and going off. I want to give her the opportunity to understand our boundaries and control her temper around us. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I’m a nervous wreck. If this conversation goes in the wrong direction it could really hurt the relationship I have with my mom and the relationship I want for my daughter with her.,28Feb2020,1
715,"You know how everyone tells you when you leave high school you’ll never talk to most of your friends again? Well this is my last friend from high school I still have regular contact with. 

We have been through so much in the last ten years. Both of us had issues with our moms, cheating boyfriends, failing marriage, getting kicked out. Lots of not fun life events went down and even if we weren’t super close at the time we were both there for each other during the most important times. 

We don’t always see eye to eye on how the other handles certain situations. But we have pushed through. She hated my ex husband and I hated the fact that she had an off and on affair with a close girlfriends fiancé now husband. 

It really put a dent in our friendship. We didn’t really talk for a whole year, and during that time my marriage fell apart and I lost my sanity. Not a record year for me, but when she found out how bad I was struggling she came. She flew up and helped me get my house ready to move and painted it. She helped me pack and forgave me for telling her off about the affair. 

When I moved back we never said anything but it was like all had been forgiven on both sides. However she still hung out with this group of people with that dude and his now wife and I just kept to myself how much I didn’t like it. We hung out here and there but I met someone and moved about an hour away. 

She has stopped having sex with him for at least a year now. She started talking about this new guy, how she couldn’t fall for him because he was older and her parents would never approve but about how amazing he was and how fantastic the sex was. I was thrilled, even though it wasn’t a boyfriend it was someone who was available or so I thought. 

We were FaceTiming the other night and I asked her if I could have a name that she was chatting up a storm about him and I had given her enough space and not drilled her about him but I deserved to at least be given a name.

She had this look on her face and I knew whatever was going to come out of her mouth I was not going to like and I didn’t. She wouldn’t tell me because he is a step dad to one of her friends. That she knew I would be mad but that the sex was to amazing to give up. 

I didn’t say much but asked if he had an open relationship with his wife and the step daughter just wasn’t aware? Nope. So when this blows up what happens? Nothing, no one will find out. When I talk about it to my group, same group with the first guy and his now wife and the step daughter I change names and dates so no one will put it together. 

My fiancé came home at this point from work and she let me go. He came over to give me a kiss and knew something was wrong. He already doesn’t like her because of the other affair but gets that she helped me during my divorce so he doesn’t usually give an opinion but after this he doesn’t like her at all. Which I get, I don’t like her either. I’m the only one she can be honest with.

I never thought I would be this person hiding affairs like this and I feel like shit about it. I don’t know what to say to her, whether I should tell the current wife of this guy or her other girlfriend about the past or both? She was there for me during the hardest part of my life and I feel so conflicted about all of this. She shouldn’t be cheating with anyone but is it my place to say something? What do I do about her? I love her but her decisions suck and what she is doing does not sit right with me at all. I know I don’t owe her but she was there for me when others weren’t. What do I do?",28Feb2020,1
716,"Hey y’all. I hope this is allowed. I’m having trouble with love in my relationship and I thought who better to ask then y’all. 

So, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 7 months. This is the best relationship I’ve ever been in. He’s an incredible human being and I am so happy to be with him. 

The problem is that we haven’t said I love you yet. Logically, I know that our relationship is strong and we’re happy so I should just be happy with that. But the fact that he just loves being with me and doesn’t love me is kind of tearing me apart. 

I’m 23 and he’s 26, and this is his first serious relationship. I’ve always been willing to go at his pace because I don’t want him to feel pressured or rushed. This is why part of the reason I haven’t dropped the L word yet. The other reason is because I think if I told him I loved him, and he didn’t say it back that it would break my heart. Which I know is illogical. 

I was wondering if y’all could offer me any advice to cope with my illogical emotions regarding saying I love you in an otherwise incredible relationship.

724,"I'm 30/f. I've had anxiety all my life and depression about 15 years. I'm medicated and managed to get a degree and work as a healthcare professional. I hold it down relatively well and haven't had any time off for my mental health in a while. 

On and off, for a few years now, maybe once or twice a week I will eat enough food for three people and then throw it all up, deliberately. When I buy the food I don't think I'm going to, but invariably I will make efforts to get it all out in several goes. I drink pints of water, jump up and down, press on my stomach, shove my fingers down my throat. After that I go back to my evening and it won't happen again for days. 

I'm overweight anyway. I could do with losing a good three stone. The rest of the time I eat and keep down enough food to be this overweight. But sometimes this happens for a few months and goes away. 

Is this an eating disorder? What is it? It doesn't feel like punishment or self harm. I feel good for treating myself to the food, I just don't want to digest the calories (probably 3000 in one sitting). Afterwards I feel good for getting the food up and more comfortable. I'll do it at home, at other's houses and out in restaurants. I try and hide my watery eyes and puffy face because I don't want people to know. 

There's a relatively strong family history of eating disorders and unhealthy food relationships (laxative abuse, diet meals only, calorie restriction, body dysmorphia, negative comments about fat people, extreme measures for weight loss and excessive exercise), but I'm one of the fat members of the family.

I'm so confused. Can anyone shed any light on this?

725,"My fiance' and I are trying to plan our wedding, however, we don't really want a ""wedding"", but both side of parents do. My fiance' was the one who started the idea of a super small wedding, or even not having one at all (so I'm not ""that"" guy).  

Her family isn't too well off, and mine is going through some financial troubles, so her and I would be covering the vast majority of the cost. Her mom and my mom want a wedding of \~150 people, and after viewing many locations, vendors, DJs, etc, the price just seems out of the control for 6 - 8 hours of one day. I get it, it's supposed to be a celebration of our union, but is this really what the vast majority of people do? 

My real questions:

1) How often do people go into debt for a wedding? I can't fathom the idea of starting our lives together with a huge debt over our heads. 

2) Would we be jerks for not having a ceremony and reception? 

3) Am I missing something, is there financial support for a wedding (it'd be crazy, but maybe I just don't know)?",28Feb2020,1

728,"So I started a new job recently, one of my coworkers is really cute and kinda shy, but also a good laugh when feels comfortable. I kinda enjoy our little conversations and my coworker is hilarious when comfortable enough (and cute!). But for me is one of those that you look, you appreciate and you do not touch, although sometimes I steal a glance here and there, it is always inocent and I do not want to cross a line. I'm happily married and so is my coworker, I don't know enough about their personal life to ask if they have kids or not, neither do I honestly care of knowing tbh. Like I said I enjoy the innocent half flirting (where neither parties knows if it's really flirting or not) and that's about it.

So now that the introduction of the story is done lets fast forward to my problem. 

I knew my coworker was passing through my office, but as my office is a group I didn't want to look directly at them (yes I'm avoiding gender just in case? Reddit is pretty big but god knows if someone actually recognizes any of this I'm even more fucked), so instead i tried to steal a glance through the corner of my eye, fucked up part is they were looking at me through the corner of their eye too, at the fucking same time and we both quickly deviated at the same damn time, like really really fast. The more I think about it the more paranoid I get, I really enjoy this job, is a huge opportunity for me, I don't want shit to be awkward, or for them to think the wrong thing. I am honestly overthinking by now and now that I was caught I'm scared that the other part thinks they can advance if thats what they want? Or if they will report me for feeling uncomfortable? I mean I'm hoping that they felt exactly like me but what if they don't? What's the best way to approach this situation without anything going to shit?

I have since been avoiding the other party as much as I should, that coworker needs to help me from time to time but so far I managed to not have them help me at all. I feel they have been avoiding me to. Maybe it's for the best?

Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance.",28Feb2020,1
730,"Hey all, my problem is basically the title. I’ve just generally had a bad time with doctors over the years. Just rude, misdiagnoses, insurance issues and billing that come afterwards, and just generally not being treated as a person with a problem. 
I go when I must for basic things like prescription refills for asthma but it’s usually a quick visit so even if the doctor has a bad mood or whatever it doesn’t matter. 
Well now I have some health concerns that are more serious and I’m deeply afraid. I’m afraid in general because I’m pretty sure I’ll need surgery (it’s a hernia), and I’m just worried about being treated like garbage, being an absolute anxious crying mess, and getting charged out of my mind because I don’t understand insurance and billing. 

I do have my wife who is very on the ball with these things but we’ve not had a day off together and we’re moving out of state in two weeks!

There's this guy (21) I (19) love. He's literally perfect, and we're super close. A couple of days ago a friend of mine pushed me to confess to him, so I did.
We started talking and he told me he likes me as well and wishes to be with me, but cannot do so because of this medical thing, very similar to crohn. He's in physical pain constantly and sometimes it gets worse to the point he can't get out of bed, so handling a relationship is way too hard for him.
It pains me to know he's suffering and obviously I don't want to push him to be with me or whatever, but I'm not exactly sure how to see this situation. We both want to be together and he says he wanted to work on his situation, he went to see doctors this past week and has lots of examinations soon, but I'm not so sure about what to do right now. I don't wanna ""move on"" and give up on this because I really love him and he says it's mutual, we have so much in common and we live really close to each other, literally everything about this is perfect, but I also don't like the idea of waiting too much, because I'm not sure how long it will take, how many chances I might get with other just as great guys, or maybe waiting and being told the whole medical thing doesn't get better so it probably won't happen.
What am I supposed to do with myself? Also, how do I make him feel less stressed about this as well, since he said it saddens him as well?

She’s very polite and kind but also a bit on the ridged/idealistic side. She also seems to be going through something because she seems a little more extra than usual. 

So anyways she comes up and asks if I can ring her though kinda in a silly voice. I stand there looking at her funny, thinking about, weighing if I can or can’t. Just joining in the fun. Then she starts yelling at me asking me why I’m always so difficult. I just think she had no right to yell at me, where both adults. I get people have different approaches and personalities but where do you draw the line and stand your ground. I just don’t like that I take on the blame with interactions like this.

751,"I'm the child of a narcissistic single mother. I have dealt with a lot of hardships throughout my life because of her. She yells frequently. She is irrational. She literally thinks that I was born to serve her.

She once made me homeless because I turned on the air conditioning in the summer heat when she didn't want it on. But I'm not here to talk about that.

I am now 26 years old and I finally graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science this past January. Programming is my passion. My grades are great, but it took a little longer than usual to get my degree, largely due to my circumstances.

Since I graduated, I was forced to move out of my dorm and back in with my mother. I have been applying to jobs, and trying to escape. It hasn't been easy to get to the final round interviews.

A top tier company (think google-level competitive) gave me an opportunity for a final interview. I was suppose to catch the flight today for that interview. However, I made the mistake of telling my mother about it, and she objected. She said I would not be allowed back in the house if I went for that interview. Her reasoning was, I could catch the coronavirus from traveling, and if I returned home I would infect her. Part of me thinks she did this to prevent me from becoming independent. Being homeless is absolutely hell and I can't do that again, so I gave up a once in a life time opportunity.

I am a new CNA at a skilled nursing facility. my very first night on NOC shift, i had a seizure. no one was around at the time but what i sat back up, there were about 4 people standing around me. the nurses really didn’t care, didn’t tell me what happened or what it looked like. so i have to take their word that it was a seizure and not just fainting or anything. as soon as i stood back up, they handed me 2 stacks of paperwork to fill out. once i completed them, i had to go to the other side (facility is divided into 2 sides) to hand them back to the supervisor. she then announced to all the other nurses and cnas on that side that i had had a seizure and hit my head. there was no privacy. 

i switched to day shift after this incident and when i came back, everyone knew about it. everyone was talking about it behind my back. just yesterday i asked someone how they found out, they said a specific patient told them. i’m an absolutely humiliated and pissed off that it’s spread to patients. 

i don’t know what i can do. i feel at this point i was humiliated, not just in the moment but continuously with the whispers behind my back. people i thought i could trust are gossiping about my health but none of them have come to ask if i’m okay. that’s what really hurts the most. 

i feel like i can’t go to my DON or my DSD because 1) this incident happened a week ago and 2) they can’t prevent people from talking about it. it makes me not want to go to work there anymore but i am stuck in a 1 year contract.

754,"So... I'm a Brazilian guy in my early 20s and I working is sucking the life out of me.

**TLDR: dropped out (no interest, internships sucked and were unpaid), got a min wage job on retail, commuted for over 3h a day, helped parents with living expenses (mainly rent, internet bill and some groceries), left it, was given an ultimatum, found yet another min wage job flipping burgers, commuting a bit less than 3h a day now, trying to learn some marketing things (even though not really interest on anything) but it's hard as I'm way too tired, my feet hurt from standing all day and work is taking its toll on me for the second time. Have no idea what I could do.**

I'm going to try keeping it pretty short, I live in the metropolitan region of São Paulo (which we call ""Grande São Paulo""), started Computer Science, flunked out (no actual interest in programming/IT and the 2 internships I had throughout my second year were too stressful; oh, they were unpaid as well because I couldn't for the life of me get into a paid one). Good thing is both those internships took place near the university, so... yeah I guess.

(I perhaps suck at making things pretty short when it comes to my life. I'm sorry, lol)

After flunking out, I manage to get into a minimum wage job which is a bit too far from home (I spend a bit over 3h a day commuting assuming no major traffic jams or heavy rain) and my parents start charging me rent as a ""punishment"" for flunking out of university, Alright, 50% of my monthly salary goes into rent alone (we pay about 1100 BRL for a 2 room apartment in a pretty meh place, but that was the most affordable we could find while not being way too far from São Paulo), I pay for the internet connection (~15%) and help on other bills. In the end, I have about 200 BRL (~20% of the minimum monthly wage) for myself, which is fair enough I guess.

Life goes on for a year or so and... I eventually feel extremely fed up with wasting 13ish hours a day for minimum wage and decide to call it quits as dealing with customers pretty much all day + commuting for 3h a day was sucking the soul out of me. I know, I acted impulsively, but I don't think I'd last another week in that retail job without having a major breakdown.

And this is where things go awry as my parents give me an ultimatum: I'd have to pay rent or be kicked out of the house. I had exactly 2 months of rent saved on my bank account and managed to find a (yet another) minimum wage job a week before the deadline, this time flipping burgers. The worst part: I'm still looking at almost 3h of commuting a day (~1h15 omw to work and ~1h35 omw back). I'm glad to have some extra minutes, but it still sucks.

I'm pretty slow when it comes to learning things and I felt like giving up more than once, but I eventually got the hang of it. Still, wasting ~13h a day to make minimum wage simply sucks, especially when most of it has to go to rent. Heck, this alone is why I still haven't moved on my own or with friends - in bigger cities, it's very common for rent *alone* be more expensive than the monthly minimum wage.

I have been trying to study something (mainly marketing) at home, but I don't really have an interest on anything in particular, so it's pretty hard for me to get some free certifications as I find it hard to concentrate on anything for any longer than 10-15 minutes. I'm also pretty damn tired at the end of the day as my feet are hurting a lot from standing on work and bus (was born with severe clubbed feet by the way, worst case he had ever seen in 25ish years according to my doctor).

One thing that's a given though is that I'm still doing something even if 10-15 minutes a day, so I'm not 100% wasting my ""free"" time. I sadly still work part time on Saturdays, watch some Netflix to help me cope with stress and I just relax on Sundays because jfc living like this sucks and I don't even have the shorter ends of the stick considering some of my peers are doing worse.

I don't know what to do as I don't want to live like this for any longer. I'm reaching my breaking point again, but I can't find a way out. I'm glad I was given a day off out of the blue so I could write this off my head while not being too tired to do it. Does life have to suck this badly? Am I lacking resilience? How do I suck it up? What are some options I haven't considered?

756,"So, some context:

I've met this girl on a dating app and we've been seeing each other for a few months now. We spent the entire last week together (we were travelling) and it was nice. During this time, we decided that we were in a relationship and since she's non-monogamic and I am, I asked if she wanted to see other people and she said no - that we could start it as a closed relationship. I thought: ""great!""

The entire dynamic of this relationship seems rather unfavourable to me though. It always feels like I exist to please and she exists to be pleased. I try my best to give her comfort and pleasure and I don't usually feel like it's reciprocal. I thought that was odd and I'm not very comfortable with it, but I like her so I thought I could tolerate for now and hoped it'd change eventually.

Anyways. She went home Yesterday (we don't live very close) and today I went to the app where we met to check on something and realized she wasn't on there anymore. I didn't think she unmatched me at first but that she simply deleted the account. But I felt strangely insecure about it and decided to log on with another account (I have multiple, it's related to my work) and to my surprise I saw her profile real quickly with all new photos – including some we took during these days we were together (without me, obviously).

She unmatched me so I wouldn't see these updates. Now, why would she do that? Why does she want to keep using the app if she's with me now and she told me she didn't want to see other people?

I'm not in love with her yet but I really like being with her – however, I feel like I've been cheated. Please give me advice, Reddit. She's been trying to talk to me and I don't know what to say.

772,"So... I was just chilling in my bed, since I'm a bit sick from having just moved into a new apartment. Like 15 minutes ago I heard two dudes walking past my window, talking but I couldn't really make out most of it. I did hear them mention something like ""this window here?"" or ""is it this window?"" And it sounded pretty close, close enough to lead one sitting next to their window to think they might be referring to them.

So I just yelled, ""yo"" to make it clear someone was here. I didn't really care or think it through too much. Basically if they're trying to rob me, maybe they won't if they know someone is there as evidenced by the ""yo"", and if they're not trying to rob me and they hear a ""yo"" they'll just assume the nearby residence is on the phone or something.

So a few minutes later, after thinking of wtf they could've been doing, I decide to look out my window. There's a dude basically in between my apartment complex and the one next to me, wrapping up what looks to be ankle weights or something like that. Then he pulls out these tiny bolas (like two wooden balls attached by string) and packs them in his cargo pants. He then walks into the stairway across from my complex, and I've only been here a week, but I've never seen anybody walk into there. Even the patio is empty, so I was sure no one lived there.

Now I'm not a detective or anything, but that's a pretty fuckin weird thing to see and it raises some red flags. Idk if I'm just paranoid because I've only just moved into this place, but... come on... 

If I were to guess wtf just happened, I'd say that two dudes are gonna try and rob me tonight. They picked the window they're gonna break (with the bolas or ankle weights) and are now squatting in the empty apartment directly across from me and said window. 

If you've read through all this, thank you. Now idk what I should do. I've never been robbed before, I've never even had to call 911 before, so I genuinely don't know what I should do or if doing anything is an overreaction.  

What are my options? Wait and see if I get robbed or not, and if I do then I'll most certainly be fucked and caught by surprise. I'm a big guy, mildly athletic, but I was always a class clown. I talked my way out of trouble. Never been in a real fight before. So I can't take on 2 or more dudes, especially if they have the element of surprise, via breaking the window right next to my bed in the middle of the night. Or I'm wrong and this was all just a weird thing, which idk... now that I've said that, it seems less likely that a dude would fill his pockets with bolas and walk into an empty house for no reason other than to chill. 

So maybe I should just call the cops? If I'm right then cool, robbery averted. If I'm wrong, maybe they'll understand? Idk.

I know everyone in the world has to work but I can’t get over it. I know it’s going to take me awhile to get used to having a job again. When it happens though I usually am sad. I feel like my time is limited and I have to choose what I want to do and if I spend it doing something and then regret it later then I can’t get that time back. 

How do I ease myself into this feeling? How do I manage my time correctly when I’m off/get home from work? Do you guys feel this way too??",28Feb2020,1

I'm desperate because my (30 yo) brother is mentally ill and not too long ago he tried to kill me, choking me. The cops were called but they shrugged it off as nothing despite there being some evidence...and no I did nothing to bring it on, I was just sitting there.

She acts like a complete jackass to my friends opinions, doesn't take any helpful advice, and is hurtful a lot of the time. One of the main reasons I broke up with her, was because of her radical right opinion. (I RARELY have an issue with people expressing their political opinions) (I also don't completely blame her for this because this is how she was raised) She would often talk to me about how she dislikes the LGBT community, which I very much disagree with and she would express these opinions in public, which made me very uncomfortable. I also broke up with her partly because of her personality, but I obviously didn't tell her that. Whenever I would give her advice to not say stupid things, she would completely ignore me and do it anyway. Whenever someone in our friend group expresses something she doesn't like, she goes off on a tangent about how she hates it and it's really annoying and it's pissing me off. It's especially bad when someone expresses a democratic opinion within ear range of her. She will basically go off on that person's opinion with the most ""colorful"" vocabulary. I want to essentially just tell her how much of a jackass she's being and tell her if she wants to be friends with me, she needs to change, because I've had it. The problem is is that shes always with my main friend group, and it's kind of difficult to get away from her.

Therefore, I've come to believe that Reddit fosters mean-spirited and ungrateful people who would like to ruin me and turn my life into a shambles, a living Hell. Just what is this?

792,"So I work with disabled students at my college and one of my job requirements is to sit with them during lunch.  The only downside this semester is that I have to witness a lot of kissing between two students in particular.  They seem to think it's normal to do that but it gets to a point where I need to look away because it's too uncomfortable.  Although it's only a quick peck on the lips, they do it almost every minute of the 1 hour and 30 shift I have to be with them.  I also don't want to tell them to stop doing that in front of me because I don't want to come off as bossy or creepy.  

I don't know whether to ask my boss to remove me from the lunch shift without seeming ridiculous but I feel very awkward around them.  Don't get me wrong, the two students are really nice but they are inseparable and it can be very distracting when they're meant to be studying.

Nothing interesting happens until lunch some apple hit my foot when I was looking the other way and the dude that threw it normally isn’t on good terms with me so I’m down to fight (I’m already pissed about the gum wrappers) the principal gets on the middle of this to end it then and there.

It seems like every time we talk she ends up bringing up some sort of very negative thing. Politics-related drama/fiascos, something bad someone did or said to her once, how horrible this or that person is. I try to satiate her or lighten the mood by switching topics, but it always somehow comes back to some other negative thing with her.

(Another example: I was telling her about this person who made me upset, and she went onto their account and read their posts aloud to me, which made me even more upset. She couldn't understand why.)

I don't mind telling her to stop, but I'm a bit scared of how she might take it. She's from an abusive family and has had a rough past, so she tends to apologize for things she didn't do and takes most criticism to heart. She's also an aspie and has trouble understanding some social cues. I'm an aspie too, so I've definitely been there. 

I'm also a bit more sensitive to negativity than the average person - when I hear something upsetting, I get upset too, and it sticks with me for a very long time. This can be helpful (for example, I helped the friend discover someone was being creepy towards her when she didn't realize they were being creepy), but it's also why it's more difficult for me to deal with this/brush this off.

Well, in my university I hang out sometimes with a group of girls. There’s one specific girl that is SUPER smart and disciplined, which legit is the reason I feel super attracted to her. She has a unique personality that I absolutely love! She is the type of person that usually says “fuck it, I’ll do it myself”, and damn dude, that’s a super green flag for me because that demonstrates that she is independent and capable to do things by herself (something that most of the girls nowadays lack... at least for the ones I’ve met in my entire life). 

The problem here is that, I’m not sure if she likes me too or not. It is super hard to tell! We used to text a lot, and by lot... I mean PARAGRAPHS about how our vacations were going, opinions and super cool stuff we shared to each other. But when school started, we kinda stopped texting that much... but she was always and still super polite to me. At first I thought she was being nice, but then today... when we said “bye” to each other she wanted to actually start some sort of physical contact. A simple “high five” that indeed, she said “hey, let’s high five!” this is, indeed out of the ordinary for us. 

My fear? Getting rejected and that factor to ruin all my relationship with our friends in that group and stay awkward because I also got a class ONLY with that group of friends. Just imagine how AWKWARD that situation would be. 

But gosh, man. That girl is driving me crazy! Would it be prudent if I ask her out? It’s super hard to catch her because she is always with one of her friends or her sister... so I always take my chance to talk to her or at least whenever she is with her friends. I’m sure she got and understood all my hints already...

808,"This happened over a year ago but it still haunts me and I need to know if I’m in the wrong. My best friend at the time, we’ll call her Z, had two friends A and C. The three of them all struggled with addiction and other things, I come from a different background. A, he was 25 or so, C lived with him she was 20 and they had sexual relations, weren’t in a relationship (C is in love with A) and Z had slept with them a few times. I was about 18 at the time and was like hm ok cool. We would smoke and A did body painting, he always asked what I was comfortable with and I always felt like my boundaries were respected. A few times into hanging out A made a move while painting and I was comfortable so I let him continue. Later he talked to me about it and I shared I would be interested in sex with him but that was about it After hanging out with them a few times Z saw what happened with A and kept mentioning we should have group sex. I personally was not into it or ready for that and I told Z this but every time we would go over she would joke about it. It got to the point where as I’m driving us over I’d specifically tell her “I’m not having group sex with these people today or ever”. Well one time I met her there and it all went south. We got high and I was tired we were all resting. Z and A went out for a cig and I was chillin dozing in and out. Once they came back I don’t really know how it happened but there was an orgy and I was in it. I was confused but I didn’t really say anything because I didn’t know what to say or how to get out of it. Afterwards it was triggering for me, I’ve had sexual abuse in the past and this was something I expressed I didn’t want. As we were going home I told Z that that was absolutely not ok and because I expressed I wasn’t interested this was overstepping a huge line. She got pissed saying I had no right to be upset because I didn’t say anything while it was happening. We didn’t talk for a bit but we had tickets to Disneyland for spring break. She got kicked out of her house for relapsing (on the adderall she took from my glove box without my knowledge) and I take her to A and C house. Z goes to a meeting and C tells me she wants to speak to me privately. Apparently z told them I was going to the cops for sexual assault which I never said. I explained how I felt and that I’m sure there was a misunderstanding. Weellll turns out while Z and A were smoking Z kept telling him how much I wanted this and how I kept talking about having sex with all of them so he went for it. After I found that out I was disgusted, changed her plane ticket and went with someone else. Right after I found all of this out Z, C and I tried to have a discussion but obviously Z was just denying things.

809,"Ok this is a really weird situation. I am renting an apartment and my lease is up at the end of May. I just bought a house a couple weeks ago and me and my roommate plan to move in next weekend. 

My apartments policy on breaking a lease early is that I need to give at least 2 months notice AND pay a 1,500 fee on top of making those 2 months of rent.

However, I'm not sure if I want to do sales. The only preparation I have is a semester working as a telemarketer for my university, and a small course that I took online. I want to do it because I want to get out of the house, and meet other people (like my therapist said, but with the side benefit of profiting), and there is money. But as for now, I am submitting job applications to as many job positions in Texas as there are open.

819,"I'm in my 2nd year of high school. Out of 16 compulsory subjects I, for the life of me, can't figure out what I want to do in life.
Is this the right subreddit or is there some other that can help me? A site maybe? I don't know where to start looking.
I want to start thinking about this soon, as for some colleges you need to apply a year early to get housing. 
Below is everything I think is necessary (general situation, things I can do and 2 things I thought of as career choices).


Because every college in my country is very general  (math/chemistry/etc. or medicine/engineering/and so on) and the least every country has and there's only a few really good ones, I've already decided to go out of the country.
I have good grades but I could be an (almost) ace student if I wanted to, I just don't have the dedication to study for hours. I train a lot and do extra things instead (I did acting most of my life, now I stopped and picked up Japanese).

I'm in a mathematical-science class, but I don't enjoy physics, chemistry and biology as much as I've realised it's not my thing.
I've realised it's the logic behind it that appeals to me. I've grown to love programming and I'm good at it even though I started in high school. I like math too, because of the satisfaction. I'm no genius, but I understand it.
I'm also quite the philosophical type, I enjoy discussion and analysis of things I find interesting. I always wanted to get into psychology.
I would never be a teacher, but I have a knack for explaining things. I'm also not bad at languages (I speak my mother tongue and English, I understand Italian, I'm studying Japanese and I'm good at Latin) but studying one doesn't interest me. 
I'm not the type to sit down and study, so law and medicine especially are out of the picture.
I like making things, but I don't have any skill for it to be a job. It's more like casual art stuff, photography, fixing VERY simple stuff and building Ikea furniture.
If there's a skill I have, it's bullshitting. And building Ikea furniture.

 When talking to my parents, they always said I knew how to get what I want and told me I would be good in any marketing type a thing, because I can understand many things and I'm good at talking (I have anxiety, but if I know you, you have to listen to my schpeals at least once a month). I still wouldn't *study* marketing, but something related to something like that (for example psychology).
I think the psychology I could learn on my own with books n stuff, so it's not really something I want to go to uni for.

The only thing I recently thought of was on my trip. I train finswimming, so I have a diving license. I was at this huge aquarium in Valencia and I they had everything - seals, belugas, sharks, penguins, you name it. There was dolphin show, and I think they're rescues. Taking care of sea animals, cleaning shark tanks and training dolphins all the while rehabilitating them, saving and sending them back to the sea  is something I could see myself doing.

I also hate my country, I hate most of the people, their overreligious thoughts, politicians + we just lost 33 soldiers on a bombing run yesterday. We also lost 483 soldiers last year which is 24x higher then the avarage US death rate. So I am just bored of hearing rape and soldiers losts everytime I open the social media

I need some advice on how I should ask out my crush.I've had a crush on this girl since freshman year and its about time i went to ask her out.
I really don't know what to do.If i ask my parents about it, its going to be weird.If i ask about it to my friends i will be made fun of.Should i ask her by texting her or should I do it in person?If i text her,it would be a easy to do but,i don't think it wil have a big effect.If i told her in person it will be hard (because im a total wuss) but i know it will leave a big effect.Any advice is welcome and what should I tell her?

823,So I’m 19 and doing a year of community college before I go to university in the fall. Not a day goes by where I don’t go to school or work. I go to school mom-Thursday. Sub if people are sick on fridays if not I do chores around the house and Saturday and Sundays I work. In summer break I worked full time and overtime and winter break besides holidays I worked. And my parents are divorced so I usually go on vacation for 2 weeks out of the year one in summer with my dad and one in spring break with my mom. (I have 2 younger bro’s (2 younger sisters on my dads side)) they come along too. I try to enjoy as much as possible the time with my family but with how much I work and do school it’s been very hard for me to enjoy it. I don’t mean to sound spoiled or any of that like I greatful for everything I have I’m just wondering if anyone is like this how do you deal with this type of mindset,28Feb2020,1
824,"It was just a normal day of school but as the hours went by, I started to get tired and feeling really heavy. I laid my head down the table and covered my head to listen to music but then my chest tightened and tears started rolling. It felt like a thunderstorm raging in my heart. I tried to stop crying to not attract any attention but I wasn’t able to calm down.

My mind then recalled all the time my mother or father were being critical towards me or them berating or abusing me or me being a useless member of the family. I just feel like i’m a horrible disappointment to everyone.

The words they said back then, it didn’t fazed me at all but why did it hurt now? I usually don’t try to express any emotions while being home and I avoid any communication with my family because I feel like things will always go bad if I try to talk to them. Every time my parents talk to me, I feel a condescending tone to it and that makes me want to rip my ears off.

There are days that I speak less than 15 or 10 words because I feel like shutting my mouth would be a solution. I have always been quiet but being silent because i’m compelled to do so, is slowly turning me into something i’m not. It feels like i’m turning into a husk.

Every time I cross a busy road, I have a sudden urge to throw myself into the traffic. Every time i’m in the school rooftop, I would look down and  imagine my mangled, lifeless body on the concrete floor.

All the years of them screaming at me or hitting me, I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I know that there are people who are suffering much worse than me. I just want someone who I can trust and open up to but i’m too afraid to be vulnerable and too withdrawn to approach someone.

My joints are aching, my ugly body is weak and my mind is exhausted.

I just want to experience a normal life.
I just want to experience what it’s like to have friends.
I just want to experience the bliss of having a supportive family.
I just want to be accepted.

Since February of 2019, I've been trying to help my dad get on his feet after he and my mother got divorced. At first, he'd lay drunk for days on end, missing work to get drunk. He was fired from is 3rd job in a year for this. I was using my own money that I had saved back for my own place to keep him from losing his place. Fast forward a couple months, he has another job but continues to blow all his money on beer, and keeps getting payday loans and blowing it, leaving me responsible for rent and food. I talk to him stating that I am only here to help him get on his feet. He agreed and decided to take back over rent, with me providing 100 every 2 weeks to pull my weight. All good, right?

WRONG

I get a call from the landlord saying we are $2,000 behind on rent a month ago... I got off the phone and lost my shit at my dad. He said nothing to me. With my savings drained from before, and with my job laying me off, I have no f\*\*king clue what I'm going to do because the landlord wants his money now, not that I blame him.

Meanwhile my dad in the past month, has broken his back from falling off a balcony from a drunken stupor, has every lawyer in the state after him because he stopped paying on those payday loans, and bringing a bunch of f\*\*king meth heads into the apartment, and is probably doing it him self... I've tried and tried to help him. He just doesn't care...

And I'm starting hate him for it.

828,"BACKGROUND: Hi, so basically i’m a sophomore in HS and i’m registered to take the AP World History exam in May BUT i have multiple learning disorders (diagnosed) so there’s no way i could even get through a section of the exam in the total given time. So, in order to receive extra time, i have to apply for an SSD with the CollegeBoard. the problem w that is that i didn’t know that the CB provided accommodations and now i’ve missed the submission deadline but i’m still filing for it. However, i do not already have a 504 plan (makes it easier to get accommodations if the school has issued me a 504) so i have to apply for it.
Since there’s a chance that they could deny me a 504 based off of my academic performance. i had to tell all of my teachers about my LDs so that when the school psychologist is talking to my teachers, they are aware of the conditions i’ve been diagnosed with and maybe vouch for me. I’m considered high-functioning but it takes me at least 4 hours to get thru 1/3 of my hw, even tho i’m medicated. Ive been very good at masking my struggles but now i had to tell all my teachers about them. 
RISING ISSUE: I’m a very private person and i’m quiet at school. The best way I can describe how i feel about having to tell my teachers VERY personal things about me and my experiences is that it made me feel so violated. most of my teachers think that i’m a good student and having to tell them i’m struggling was awful. I had to tell my teachers about how I experience anxiety attacks, depressive episodes, etc. It was awful.
ISSUE: my apwh teacher gives me the heeby jeebies. he just has an uncomfortable and weird vibe. he’s always making eye contact with me for long periods of time during his lectures and smiling. his desk is on the opposite side of the classroom in relation to where my desk is (closest to the door and i sit in the 2nd row). when he lectures, he’s always walking over to my side of the class and hovering. he walks up and down the aisles to my sides multiple times. he just makes me feel very uncomfortable. but i had to tell him about my struggles. I had to be so vulnerable with someone who makes me feel very uncomfortable. I dont know if that teachers behavior is considered weird in general or if it’s just a me problem but my feelings of violation are valid because i DO feel them. 
when i told my apwh teacher, he told me that he thinks it’s amazing how well i’m doing considering the disadvantages i have to deal with. he was very nice. too nice. after i told him everything, i wanted to leave but i had to find the school psychologist so i could ask her about the process but i didn’t know where her room was, so i asked my teacher bec he was already talking about her.
mind you, this was AFTERSCHOOL, the halls were empty and we were outside the classroom because there was a kid making up a test. i’d gotten this uncomfortable vibe from him since the beginning of the school year and this all just happened this wednesday. i said to him, “speaking of dr. blah blah, do you know where her room is?” — to which he responded, “it’s in the counseling office ...blah..blah blah” and then i said “okay thank you” (!$!&amp;!&amp;!) —&gt;and then he said “do you want me to walk you there?” in a very weird way, to which i responded “oh no it’s fine, i’m going over to that hall to talk to my other teacher anyway”.
— like this teacher had already given me this creepy vibe and i was NOT about to risk anything so i walked over to the psychologists office (opposite side of the building). long story short, she wasn’t there so i had to exit that hallway. upon exiting, i saw my teacher on his way into that specific hallway. feeling very creeped out, i speed walked past him and asked my parents if they had reached the school yet to pick me up. to my luck, my dad was pulling up. and then i left school.

the next day (thurs), i was telling my meth teacher the same thing i had to tell my apwh teacher, so we were outside the classroom for like 35 minutes. my apwh teachers class is on the COMPLETE OPPOSITE side of the campus but as i was talking to my math teacher, i noticed him walking past me a few times, going in and out of the copy machine room (which doesn’t make sense bec his side of the school has a copy room too), and he was just looking and smiling at me the entire time he was walking towards my direction. this made me very uncomfortable.

QUESTION: is it odd that i feel so violated that my 40yr old apwh teacher that creeps me out now knows these super duper personal things about me? and that i feel so disgusting just thinking about having to be in his general presence, now more so than ever before? like just seeing these events play back in my head and seeing his face makes me feel violated and uncomfortable and it genuinely makes me sick to my stomach. 

Note: 
— thank you to whoever read the entire thing, it’s very long and i’m very sorry about that but i don’t know how else to explain it or how i feel. 
- any advice is VERY WELCOME!!
- any analysis is also VERY WELCOME!!
- PLEASE tell me why i feel this way, if it’s a me problem, how to deal with this, etc.",28Feb2020,2
829,"Ever since I was 13 my mother struggled with alcohol. Whilst my two sisters were practically grown and one of them was on the verge of moving out whilst the other was 18. They had had their developmental years without any of things I was put through and saw from a young age. When my sister and her fiance moved out everything took a then for the worst because she put on a show for him. One of the most horrible things I've ever seen was when she badly cut herself and I went downstairs and there was blood spread all over the kitchen walls and the floor and I, crying, had to clean it off. Or the time she slit up half her leg, or the time I decided to stay up late and she fell down the stairs and got a laceration. Then we had to got a taxi up to the hospital whilst I had to convince her not to fall asleep or pass out whilst holding a towel to her head, then when we were in A&amp;E she tried to go outside for a smoke and I had to repeatedly tell her to sit down. Then the next day she would tell us to stop making a big deal out of it and to not ""get on her case about it"" and that we, ""need to stop being so judgemental"" because ""nobody is perfect."" 

This was during my teenage years, I felt like I didn't want to go home at night but I felt I had to out of obligation and of fear that she would hurt herself. 

I got so used to sneakily pouring her alcohol down the sink and hiding the door keys that it almost became second nature. 

I love my mother don't get me wrong, she was great apart from the alcohol. She was great when she was sober and I always miss her sober. However, I do feel she's partly to blame for me being so emotional nowadays. My automatic reaction to most things bad is to silently cry, it's so she wouldn't hear me and try to comfort me when she was drunk. 

However to get to the point of all this. Recently I was talking to her about it and I wanna make this clear that this wasn't 10 years ago, this was a few months ago as she stopped drinking when she got hospitalised . She told me that I needed to ""get over it."" I understand the advice and I understand that I will need to at some point. But this made me so fucking angry, I walked away to go to the toilet and almost starting crying. But told myself to calm down and take deep breaths. Get over of being in fear for so long, fear that you would die if I slept over at someone's house? That I can't get that awful moment of you with your blood stained hair lying contorted at the bottom of the stairs out of my head? 

I know I should stop feeling sorry for myself, its ridiculous. I need to stop making a big deal out of everything and I know people suffer from a lot worse than me but I needed to vent and I need to get some advice on how to process these emotions of anger.

836,"Hi there, so I’ve been at my company almost 4 years now where I have been promoted up three times with three raises (no more than 10% each time). Almost a year ago, my team decided to hire another employee at the same level as me. I assumed then my salary was the base of what they’d offer this position. We ended up hiring a male for the role in a company that’s 95% women. I was excited for this as I thought it brought a new perspective to the team. 

Cut to a few days ago, I had to go looking for a file from an old manager that was recently let go and I stumbled upon another file that contained all the salaries for my department. This is where I found out his starting salary was 15k more than what I was currently making, and we’re the same level. He’s a year older than me but changed careers recently so I also technically have more experience in our field than him. Obviously I was a bit shocked. 

I first brought this to the attention to our hr department, so they could handle removing that file (it was public to our entire company). Which they did. But then I was told I would going to be questioned as to why I was looking at it. I found this strange, because I wasn’t searching for this information it just fell into my lap and I let them know. My company is very small, only 30 people so I think she was just nervous about this falling on their lack of keeping this information private. 

That being said, I had planned to bring up my salary without mentioning I know this. I was going to ask for more based on performance, and just note I thought it was fair based on market research I’ve done for this position. Well turns out I had to come clean to my manager about finding the file because my unprofessional hr department panicked and let my CFO know. My immediate manager is amazing (she is newer and not the one who hired this other employee) and was just apologetic for being put in this situation. She said I’m more than happy to ask for the same from our CFO who approves pay raises with her support, but I voiced concerns because I don’t want to have to address the elephant in the room which is that I know what everyone is making and that’s why I’m asking. 

Obviously I’m upset to be part of such a stereotypical man makes more situation, and if his salary was based on performance being better I’d understand. But this was his starting salary! We didn’t even know if he was good yet. He also had a previous relationship with my former manager. I just don’t want to look like I’m trying to be sneaky asking for what I want, since now obviously it’s known I know this information. But don’t feel comfortable working with people who know this and act like it’s okay. 

I know most of the advice will be leave, which I’m definitely considering. I’m just curious if there is a way for me to bring this to the attention without turning it around on me for knowing the salaries of the whole department.",28Feb2020,1

I also don’t know much about what happened to them after high school. But I told them if I hung out with him after school, I would not be smoking at all. 

He said that’s fine, he won’t pressure me to do it. And he’ll take my share. Knowing him, that could be a joke or completely serious. It’s hard to tell over text.

851,"So, we’re all young, in high school.

There’s a few key characters.

Friend = Friend of mine who is in trouble - the protagonist
Toxic Friend = Friend of friend who is the problem - the antagonist
Friend’s Cousin = Friend’s cousin
Toxic Lackeys = The friends of the Toxic Friend
Heroine = As in the female heroine, the girl that my Friend likes, and she likes him, and it’s confirmed.


Essentially, the gist of the problem is that my Friend got asked out by the girl he likes, the Heroine. However, this Heroine is the ‘ex’ of the Toxic Friend. In reality, the Toxic Friend has never had a relationship with the Heroine and they’ve only talked to each other about a year ago.

For some reason, the Toxic Friend thinks he is entitled to my Friend’s relationship rights. Toxic Friend stops Friend from having a relationship with anyone he has talked to in the past, like the Heroine.

And obviously, this isn’t much of a problem.

The problem is that Toxic Friend has a bunch of ‘lackeys’ from different schools, and they are all big beefy lads on rugby teams. If my Friend goes out with the Heroine, or has any problem with the Toxic Friend, the Toxic Friend calls on his Toxic Lackeys to have a talk with my Friend.

This has happened once before when Friend and Toxic Friend had an argument.

That’s still bearable.

But Friend’s Cousin, sits at a table with Toxic Friend and my Friend. So, it’s them three at lunch or whatever.

Friend’s Cousin always back my Friend, but Friend’s Cousin also is friends with the Toxic Friend.

Friend likes his cousin, but dislikes the toxic dude. But Friend’s Cousin, likes the toxic dude.

So, Friend doesn’t want to create beef with the toxic fiend, because not only will he probably get mushed into peas by 10 feet tall giants, (which isn’t terrible), but he would also be forcing his cousin to do something he doesn’t want to do, and Friend will most likely have to move off the table.

He would be a refugee with nowhere to go.

On the other hand, if he chose to reject the Heroine and disrespect her and his own wishes, it’d probably lead to them both falling out, and consequently, cause bad blood between them with no chances of reconciliation, because that’s their personalities.

I’ve asked him, and he’s apparently leaning towards going out with the Heroine despite all of this, so he clearly likes her.

Seems like typical school drama. It is.

I went to one once asking about my problems reaching climax with a real partner he kinda just made me feel silly and said that I should just not masturbate everyday. I’ve tried that but it still takes me a long time. And back with my ex girlfriend I wasn’t masturbating at all but she only got me to climax once. I wanna know what the hell is going on. Please help.",28Feb2020,1
853,"Ok so im in college and this is my 2nd semester, and I havent made any friends. I honestly and truly would love to have friends, my mental health would probably be a lot better if i did. Im not like socially awkward or anything, maybe just not the type to say something first, but once i do get talking im fine and a pretty good conversationalist.
Yet i still havent made friends yet. Until yesterday.

Yesterday, this girl in a class asked anyone in the group chat for the class if they needed a ride to a museum that i still needed to go to for a project. Since i dont have a car and hate taking the bus, i asked if i could go with her. Which is already a very weird thing for me to do, but im so glad i did it.

She was incredibly nice, and just fun to hang out with (which is honestly an understatement imo). Yknow when a person has an energy that you cant help but try and match, she was like that. I had never met anyone like her before. Not even in a romantic way necessarily, just in a way where i cant help but want to hang out with her again.

So I managed to ask her if we could hang out again and if i could text her again. And she said she yeah, she even gave me a compliment that i was fun to talk/hang with.

But why do I feel like i shouldn't. Why do i feel like she doesnt even like me at all. Like I was just a nobody to her. We talked about her friend/roommate, and now all i can think about why would she ever decide to hang out with me when she already has someone she could hang out with. Sorry if i seem melodramatic, stupid, or just an anxious worrywort (yes i did say worrywort what of it bruv). But ever since i woke up today and the energy and happiness of yesterday wore off a bit, i cant help but feel like maybe she doesnt really want to hang out again.

Sorry about the fuckin dissertation of an emotion spill this post turned out to be but just writing it does make me feel a little better, even if nobody responds.  I did manage to message her today, not about anything serious, but just a joke about yesterday. But i still dont know.

 Thanks and sorry again.",28Feb2020,1

I talked about was him. I liked him for 9 moths and if i still like him when this month ends it would be 10 months then. This is crazy. The reason I liked him so much is because we were really good friends, we got along, had the best sexual chemistry. It was amazing. But now he’s avoiding me and he don’t like me at all.

858,"Please give me a chance and let me explain my situation.

My background 
My education was rather poor as I began taking drugs and flunked school. Although I stayed in school for 6 years gaining as many qualifications as I could.

my qualifications are; 
level 6 Computer game design, 
Level 5 computer media and design.
NQ 5 Computer Maintenance and systems
City and Guilds certificate in vehicle Maintenance 
National 5 English, woodwork, laboratory science, computer science.
National 4, maths, geography, biology, engineering science .

For those that do not know of these qualifications These qualifications are not particularly great.

I am applying for jobs all day every day, it has been a horrible experience and terrible for my mental health.
I must apply for around 20 jobs a week.
My cv is quite good and I am constantly writing cover letters which consist of around 1000 words.

I have people check my applications,cvs and cover letters all the time and I am constantly improving.
I am 20 Years old and I have been unemployed my whole life. 
I only recently finished a Christmas temporary contract at a postal office warehouse that lasted 6 weeks.
I was never late and I loved every second of it.
But now I am back to being unemployed and it is HELL.

I go to a employment key worker to look for jobs but he is useless. I go to an apprenticeship place but they are useless.
I fully want to commit to a job but honestly it has to be something I'll enjoy.  I never hear back from jobs and when I do I am unsuccessful.
I am going between houses and on the brink of homelessness.and have been that way for for 4 years.
And my family think I'm lazy and dont want a job.

I want a job very much.
I admit I am a bit of a choosing beggar because I have avoided the construction trade like the plague.
 as I don't want to work with rough men that I believe would bully me and to drive like an hour to go to work each day then an hour back.
I think I would absolutely hate working in construction.

I was told to stay on at school and get qualifications but they have done nothing for me.
And because of the length of time between education and jobs I have no experience and have forgotten everything I had learned.
Now I am screwed.
Most of the time I am basically depressed.
I Volunteer sometimes but nowhere is busy and doesn't need my help.

What can I do.
I'd like to do something where I am left alone or kept busy.
I worked I the warehouse and i loved it because i was put with someone really cool to talk to and he showed me everything, I had a very basic job but very physically demanding. As lifting heavy parcels all day.

Should I join the army or navy, I don't want to get shot and I dont want to be in the ocean. I'd like to rappel from helicopters and shoot guns but for other basic things I am not very smart.
And I dont want to just be an ordinary soldier, I want to be able to tell cool stories of that I have done.

I could join the police, and abuse my powers, its probably pretty easy to join the police but I wouldn't want to be a police officer.

Sell drugs or something, why not but I'd rather not.

Or keep going and have no result from job applications for the next 10 years on benefits from the government.


Is life actually supposed to be working like a slave doing work you hate, for 8 to 12 hours a day,5days a week. If so I think I'd rather kill myself.

Should I just take the dead end job? And just keep surviving?
thats all it would be, surviving.

So this happened Thursday morning we were in class in the second class P was in a another class (bc she takes 2 of her Sapjacts with 1st year) and B did this petty thing again like she always do we didn't respond (bc she always does this), and instead started ranting about her , how much of a coward she is and how she can't do shit with out the back up of her friends and how she get easily scared, it was maybe a 15-30m rant, and some of her friends heard us and told B, and she started going around the class taking to girl and giving us looks, but by that time we had changed the rant to something else , and even P came to the class (bc she finished early), and suddenly B and the whole class was at the opposite side of us like we 4 are on our on in one side (expect 1 girl I don't know much about), and B started talking and asked us to quit down (we 4 were the only people talking) , and B started going about how there is a spy in our class and the spy should stop bc they know how they are, Of course she made it obvious that it's one of us 4 me, P, F1 or F2, so I asked where did she get that from and after a looong argument that maybe 6 or so girls talked against 2 (with around 15 or 20 backing them up) , CF said that she saw P going through a girls bag and kept saying laies, and then they backed off , F1 and F2 didn't do or say much bc they weren't really good with that stuff, so just me and P were the ones against 15-20 (they wanted it to be only P) , fair to say I was quite hurt some I thought were friends and I was close to crying , so to give them the win and to not stay there a scend more, I looked to P and told her come on we gonna report them, after more petty things from her friends we reported them, but thro the talk I started to cry so P and I were walking trying to clam down and  by the time we finished is was 10m in lunch time(breakfast here) , and wale walking to get our lunch the girl from our class kept following us with girls from another classs pointing to my friend and they even tried to harass us even more, of course it ended with the principal evolved, but I feel it I didn't say anything it wouldn't have ended this big my friend is now hated bc I couldn't just shut my mouth shut bc I thought if I said something B would back off, and I feel so bad I can't sleep.

866,"preface: i dont know what im supposed to do anymore. i already wrote a very long post before but i had to close it and i didnt save the draft because my parents were trying to snoop in my laptop. but i need help so here i go again. this post will be a lot of rambling, because i cant sort through any of this and cant think very straight recently. though i will try to sort everything in a list so i dont wall text.

frankly i feel like my life is falling apart. i may be depressed. i cant tell. i took a test and it said i had moderate to severe but i dont even know.

1. my parents are a big factor in this, i think. im not sure if im oversensitive or if theyre crazy. but theyre starting to fight a lot recently, which stresses me out, my dad has a very short fuse and can explode at small things, sometimes i feel like he doesnt care at all. he also doesnt listen to what i try to tell him or tells me im talking back. every time he has one of these exploding episodes he goes back and apologizes, saying he'll try to be a better dad, but this cycle keeps repeating. i feel like my mom actually cares about me, she says she wants to talk to me. ive talked to her before about this, but that didnt help. maybe they disregard what i say all the time. but in any case talking to my mom about things never helped me.  
EDIT: again about my dad, last night he took all the electronics in the house and shoved them in a box. he thinks that the only reason im depressed is because im having ""withdrawal symptoms"" from video games. i couldnt care less about them. but he tends to do this thing where he blames it all on video games and disregards everything else thats going on.
2. my school life is going to shit. my grades are bad, im lacking motivation, sometimes i dont see the point in working so hard. my parents force me to take as many rigorous classes as possible. thus school is like a juggling act. i cant find it in me to keep everything up. i cant tell if its justifiable or if im just lazy. and the school im in is just awful. it would take a long time to explain so just trust me when i say that its really bad. 
3. social life is going bad too. some of my friends are depressed too. the guys in the group are dicks a lot of the time, including me. its mostly our humor, we tend to just screw around like dumbasses all the time, and its fun when we laugh at each other kind of in a brotherly way, but we also dont really connect as much as i would want. its mostly just being dumbasses. the girls in the group have boyfriends and are busy with work/other stuff a lot of the time which also takes away being able to connect most of the time.
4. i feel completely trapped in all of this. i dont know where my life is going. i feel like i have to go to college, but im worried about my admissions because of my grades, im worried about being able to pay for it, my parents wont let me get a job to save for it, they want me to stay home through college which will probably end up in me getting stressed more. i just want out of this. i want to leave this house.

i feel like there's more to it than what ive written. ill probably edit the post soon. but this is what i can think of now. if anyone can help me figure out whats going wrong in my life, what could be the root of this, please help.",28Feb2020,1
867,"Hi everyone,

Hoping to find some career advice here. Currently unemployed although financially ok for the time being. My partner is making good money and supporting both of us. Living in Ontario, Canada. I'm turning 24 this year. I never went to university/college. I was all over the place between 2013-2014 due to some personal/religious reasons. I started working in door-to-door sales from 2015-2017(ish). I did pretty well in terms of my sales skills. Meanwhile, I was studying for a real estate license. Got my licence, joined a team, make some ok money but didn't see a future in it. My license expired at the end of 2018 shortly after finishing the majority of the deals I had lined up. After that, I started working at a small sales company selling IT hardware. Quickly learned it was not a good place to be. Abusive owners screaming and belittling my 2 other co-workers. Quit September of 2019. All the meanwhile I've been working on an app idea from scratch. I've been able to create a working prototype, completely front end, no back end. I haven't met any developers to partner with yet. Paying for development would be a decent chunk of money as well. In addition, I'm not well versed at all in with the legalities involved. After I quit the IT hardware sales, I started learning basic Javascript. I'm currently taking the Google Coursera Python course which is going well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really stumped on what path I want to take. My priority right now is to gain relevant skills to make progress on the app as well as making money to help support my partner and me in the meantime. I'm considering a few options at the moment while continuing the Python course:

* Taking a 3 month Diploma program at BrainStation for UX design ($15,000...) starting the beginning of this April
* Starting a business. I have a few ideas.
* Diving deep into programming, putting more pressure on my partner financially and banking on success with the app. Personally I think the app will be successful, but there is a lot of work needed to even create a minimum viable product.
* Focusing on creating a UX/UI design portfolio and website. Then looking for jobs in the field.
* In addition, I do have the opportunity to get into college this next September, but that's a pretty long ways away

&amp;#x200B;

One of my major problems is that I get demotivated when things don't go as expected. This hasn't been the case with the app as it's literally my dream and main goal for the future. April is coming up pretty quickly. I'm concerned that the UX course is not going to secure me a solid job and then I'll be 15k in debt. BrainStation also has a payment program that only starts being charged after securing a position paying $50k CAD gross a year. The catch is that they charge 1.5x the tuition fees, so $22.5k total.

Would appreciate any advice here. Thanks!",28Feb2020,1

there was no violence, no threats.

870,"A couple days ago I met a guy at a party, he approached me introduced himself and quickly became really flirty. We kissed several times during this night. Afterwards, his friend (who was busy with my friend) asked multiple times if they both could join us when me and my friend wanted to go home.

After a few days, I thought it was surprising he hadn't messaged me after that night, because he seemed really into me, so something felt off. Through a bit of stalking, I found his facebook, on which it said he has been in a relationship since 2015. I've considered messaging the girlfriend, and these are the major pros and cons for me:

Cons:

* This girl may not believe me, since I don't have any screenshots for proof (as ""evidence"", I only could say the full name of one of his friends, that he was there with his football team, which city and which party this took place at and on which day and time he was there)
* I risk getting hateful messages from him, his gf, or both
* I'm going to seem like a huge stalker and it's none of my business  


Pros:

* She's been with this guy for 5 years which is a long amount of time and it would be horrible if this relationship continued for years without this girl knowing, and her investing so much time and effort into a guy who cheats
* It's even more serious because I don't think they just wanted to make out but also have sex",28Feb2020,1
872,"We've been married for 7 years together for 12. My wife has never had friends other than two. We moved and now she barely speaks to them. Before our daughter was born she would go to the gym 3 times a week but now she can only go once a week because of work and daughter. We have equipment at home, treadmill, weights I tell her to do some here to compromise but she says it not the same. 

I used to have friends but because we moved, studies and work that dwindled. The last month or so I've come to realise   this incubation of family is part of the reason I'm bored. Same routine over again. Ive joined a few clubs and have been going out. Say once every two weeks. Every time I go out it's either a phone call like I'm doing something wrong, she hangs up or I get the cold shoulder for days.I love my wife and daughter so much but starting these clubs enforced the idea I need more than family, work, exercise and TV. 

She has been asked to go out with people but never goes. She has only ever gone to the gym or her work Xmas party. 

I would ask her why is she angry. The answer is silence. I ask again she says well she going to find her self (like me) and why did she give 100% of herself to me. Heres the thing I've been telling her for years not having interests outside of home is not healthy.

Well tonight I said a few things which are true but regret. I said she reminds me of my mum telling me off for everything. Who wants a wife who tells her husband of all the time. Now she is saying I'm a awful person and is thinking if leaving me.

874,"I'll probably regret this, but I'm at the end of my rope. And sorry if this is the wrong place to post. I'm in a very dark place, and I don't know how to explain to my sister.  I apologize for the ramblings that follow, it's really late and I'm in a lot of pain.

Bit of background:

I moved in with my sister this year, because her old flatmate moved out and she needed someone to help cover the rent, and also provide a fridge, microwave and washing machine.  I was ""convinced"" that this was the best option for the  both of us.  Basically I caved because I'm that kind of person.  My sister is a lot more assertive than I am, and wants things done her way.  She's good at manipulating conversations and rationalizing everything she does, i.e. she's never the one at fault because reasons a) b) and c).  Would have made a great lawyer. She has a way of turning things around and making things your fault.  So whenever she has an issue with something I did (often small things, like not immediately washing my coffee mug, or for temporarily leaving something on her desk) she would immediately tell me.  But this happens a lot, and it's started to wear me down to the point where I'm nervous whenever she gets back home or when I do anything around the flat because I'm worried that I did something wrong.  Basically I started to feel like I can't do anything right, and along with everything else going on in my life (like not getting paid by my part time employer for four months now).  And when I have an issue, like when she didn't clean the sink properly (I admit I'm a bit of a clean freak), I was too afraid to talk to her about it because I know she'll either somehow turn it on me, or make up some excuse for why she's right. And I hate conflict.

So most recently she kept going on about the internet usage.  She's almost never home, whereas I'm an introvert with little social life and get home by 4 pm, so naturally I use more data than she does.  The first time I used up 50% she sent me a very aggressive text demanding to know what I did and that I shouldn't use her half. I pay for the monthly costs and I paid for the installation.  Initially she agreed that she would pay half, but when the first bill came in January she didn't have the money so I covered the entire month.  Same thing for February.  And she complained about my internet usage again.  I got tired of her crapping on me over the internet, or over some small thing I did wrong, but since I'm too scared to talk to her in person, I left her a note saying that I will be paying for the internet myself from now on, because I know she can't afford it and that she shouldn't ask our dad to pay her half.  I also added that this means from now on I don't want to hear her crapping on me about the internet, my life is hell enough as it is, or I'll switch to a smaller package that's for my use only, since I signed the contract in the first place.

She stormed into the living room with the note and asked ""is this a threat"" and yelled at me that she couldn't help I overreacted to her reasonable requests and that she will start paying her half from the end of March. She's been making promises like this since December and I don't believe it anymore.   Oh and she's going through a tough time too and that everything isn't about me. I haven't been able to tell her that I haven't been paid since November and that my savings are just about done.

Maybe I did overreact, I don't know, my judgement's all weird and I can't think straight. This was the culmination of her treating me like shit while I'm not allowed to complain;  I'm struggling to pay my bills because I'm not getting paid and have no one to support me.   I don't know how to explain all this to her and that she's hurting me a lot, to the point where I'm considering that she's better off without me and that if I'm gone, at least my life insurance can cover the financial issues. I don't know/can't tell her that I'm actually, genuinely depressed and suicidal, and not just ""going through a tough time"".

Should I even try to talk to her or write her a note?

Here's the problem: they continually bring the kid over to social events that he wasn't invited to. They don't even ask if it's ok; they just show up with the kid. Watching a non kid friendly movie? They show up with the kid. Poker and drinks? Kid is there. Nephew is usually with a sitter during these events (because they aren't kid friendly), so 3yo is the only kid there. He is a terror and my house is NOT set up for kids. Breakable stuff everywhere. He drew on the walls once, broke something once. 

So, how do you politely tell someone to stop bringing their kid unless he is specifically invited? Isn't that rude to bring him when kids weren't specified in the invite?",28Feb2020,1

884,"Hi everyone,

Hoping to find some career advice here. Currently unemployed although financially ok for the time being. My partner is making good money and supporting both of us. Living in Ontario, Canada. I'm turning 24 this year. I never went to university/college. I was all over the place between 2013-2014 due to some personal/religious reasons. I started working in door-to-door sales from 2015-2017(ish). I did pretty well in terms of my sales skills. Meanwhile, I was studying for a real estate license. Got my license, joined a team, make some ok money but didn't see a future in it. My license expired at the end of 2018 shortly after finishing the majority of the deals I had lined up. After that, I started working at a small sales company selling IT hardware. Quickly learned it was not a good place to be. Abusive owners screaming and belittling my 2 other co-workers. Quit September of 2019. All the meanwhile I've been working on an app idea from scratch. I've been able to create a working prototype, only front end, no back end. I haven't met any developers to partner with yet. Paying for development would be a decent chunk of money as well. In addition, I'm not well versed at all in with the legalities involved. After I quit the IT hardware sales, I started learning basic Javascript. I'm currently taking the Google Coursera Python course which is going well.

I'm really stumped on what path I want to take. My priority right now is to gain relevant skills to make progress on the app as well as making money to help support my partner and me in the meantime. I'm considering a few options at the moment while continuing the Python course:

* Taking a 3-month Diploma program at BrainStation for UX design ($15,000...) starting the beginning of this April
* Starting a business. I have a few ideas.
* Diving deep into programming, putting more pressure on my partner financially and banking on success with the app. Personally I think the app will be successful, but there is a lot of work needed to even create a minimum viable product.
* Focusing on creating a UX/UI design portfolio and website. Then looking for jobs in the field.
* In addition, I do have the opportunity to get into college this next September, but that's a pretty long ways away

One of my major problems is that I get demotivated when things don't go as expected. This hasn't been the case with the app as it's literally my dream and the main goal for the future. April is coming up pretty quickly. I'm concerned that the UX course is not going to secure me a solid job and then I'll be 15k in debt. BrainStation also has a payment program that only starts being charged after securing a position paying $50k CAD gross a year. The catch is that they charge 1.5x the tuition fees, so $22.5k total.

Would appreciate any advice here. Thanks!",28Feb2020,1

I am 23F and am currently self-employed.

I’ve felt very uncomfortable every time – sort of like I was getting the vibe they weren’t really buying my products for the sake of the product and had different intentions. Do other self employed (partially or full) women have these encounters? Are they as often as they are with me. So far it’s been about 80% of my interactions with male customers.

890," I just had an old friend message me. I haven't hung out with him for 4 years and haven't heard from him in 5 months. The reason he disappeared for those 5 months was because he gave me a fake Steam account to add him and I tried asking him about it. He came back asking how I was doing and then bragged about how he has an ""opportunity"" that will allow him to retire at age 20. I told him that ""opportunity"" sounded shady, that we haven't hung out in years and haven't spoken in months, and then he disappeared again.  


Some backstory: He was kind of strange and quiet when we first met. He announced that he was a 30 year old virgin in a group of friends thinking that this was appropriate. He's ditched me and others for the first girl he thinks he's in love with (even if the feelings aren't reciprocated). A girl that he was interested in blocked him on social media because he wouldn't stop messaging her. He showed me the messages afterwards because he couldn't understand and wanted advice. Before he disappeared all he did was ask me advice about girls. He'd coax me into building his self esteem by telling him he was attractive. He usually did the whole ""Oh, woe is me. I'll be lonely forever and I don't understand why."" routine. Which I took as him being depressed and I'd have to build him up again. At the time I had a boyfriend (now husband) so after a while of this it began to make me feel uncomfortable. It got to the point where we didn't even hang out or talk as friends anymore. I did confront him about this because I felt like he was only around for me to build him up for others and that we weren't friends anymore. Of course, he disappeared after that too.  


I've tried to just move on when he disappears, but then he comes back and acts like nothing happened. It still kind of bothers me because we used to be pretty good friends before all this. I was always down for him when he needed me. I have no problems giving advice or helping someone work through a rough point in their life. I've helped him report a girl who sexually harassed him at work by following him into the bathroom and trying to watch him change. I've stayed with him when everyone else left when he locked his keys out of his car, didn't know what to do, and had a breakdown about it. We've told each other our past traumas and I've helped him work through a panic attack when he was triggered. I don't know if I should try to talk to him, leave him alone, stay friends with him, or block him on social media and just move on.",28Feb2020,1
892,"So I am finding out that I can't take care of this problem myself, so I am looking for advice. I apologize in advance, I am horrible at writing, but here we go.

I have been holding off on getting my wisdom teeth taken out for a while because for a long time I was either not covered by dental, or I could not afford to take the time off to get it done. A few moths ago I figured that it was time even though they hadn't all broken through the gum. I was a little nervous, but it is a normal thing to have done, and I got to hear so many stories from friends about their time with it. Some were Goofy, others were just consciously sedated and woke up, but quickly went back to sleep and never felt anything, so I didn't worry too much. I was excited to finally be done with it and get back to work.

I make the appointment after I find out the reason my jaw is popping is TMJ. I never got it looked at before, but I found that as long as I don't chew gum or eat a ton of jerky I'm usually fine and have no problems. I inform the person that will be doing the wisdom teeth removal and I am relieved to hear how common it is and how much experience he has with working around it. I am told that I will be under conscious sedation, which is no problem for me, and they put the needle in. The one funny part is that when I was fading out I remember saying something along the lines of ""Wow, they were really accurate in the movies..."" or something like that. 

After The first tooth I woke up. I was a little dizzy at first and I thought that they were done. They had a mask over my eyes so I wasn't sure what was happening around me. Unfortunately the procedure continued, and I was still very much awake. I felt him start drilling, trying to break another tooth apart and it was starting too feel dull and sharp at the same time. I started making some noise, and tried to tap him so he would realize that I was needing to be sedated again, but his only response was ""You might feel a little pressure"". Feeling came back rather quickly after that. I felt everything from the drilling, the pulling, and my only relief was when a piece of my tooth fell to the back of my throat and I was trying not to swallow it, so he had to try to fish it out before continuing. I like to think that I have a decent pain tolerance, but I was screaming and tears were rolling down my face. It feels like it lasted forever, and he even had someone hold my legs down because my response to that pain was bringing my legs toward my body. When the procedure was over they took the mask off of my face and i was so exhausted from the experience that I just wanted to go home. Someone brought me a wheelchair and I just said ""I've been awake the whole time, I can walk"". They looked really surprised (even after me screaming to please stop for who knows how long) and proceded to insint that I use it.

Now, after all of this I followed the directions. I even quit smoking for a month so I wouldn't get dry socket. I got an infection still, and ended up in the hospital because it was impacting my ability to breathe and I couldn't drink water or take my meds. Thankfully what they gave me helped and I was out by the next day. 

What has been happening over the last 4 months though is that my jaw isn't the same. I can't open my mouth enough to eat a burger and anything hard is painful to chew. The specialist that I have been seeing for my TMJ previously says that the MRI showed the disks being misplaced. Every month is the same checkup. it doesn't get any better, and he suggests that I only eat food that don't hurt and do some stretches, and he always adds in that he thinks surgery is the best option for me.

I have been doing the stretches, and I am so scared of having surgery now that I will not eat anything that makes it pop or hurt. I have been on this ""diet"" really hardcore this last week because it still isn't any better, resulting in me going from 139 to 131 in 9 days. I try to eat a lot, I bought a lot of protein drinks, and my SO makes food every day, but I can't seem to eat enough like this. It looks like my best option logically is surgery, but I am so terrified that I would rather starve myself than go through that again. 

What do I do? Am I overreacting to this? Please help.",28Feb2020,1

Lately tho things have changed well he changed in a bad way, he barley talks to me anymore which is fine but even in person when we chill he barley talks to me, I feel like he might be using me tbh with you. 

The reason I feel like he’s using me is because we would meet up to smoke, we usually would smoke outside by the side of the building. Right after we smoke tho he expects me to leave. He’s never once asked me to chill at his crib or anything at all which is weird considering we chill by his area, he also has asked me to hook him up with my friends in the past and he was willing to have them over and he’s never even met them.

908,"Some backstory first.  

I (18F) recently got accepted into college (yay!) but today I got my quote for how much aid I will get and how much everything will cost me... It wasn't very good and I'm really worried I won't be able to attend college or I will have to acquire massive amounts of debt.  

My dad (50sM) and my mom (50sF) divorced when I was really young. My dad is still very much in my life and pays child support and for my therapy. My mom is a teacher and while she did remarry to my stepdad (40sM) they don't have a lot of money and my younger brother (17M) is probably not going to college. I don't expect a lot from them for college. In fact, I will refuse most of their support.   

My dad makes a lot of money (well into the six figures) and has told me at the very least he would send me the child support he currently gives my mom while I'm in college.   There is also a divorce agreement that he will pay for my entire college as an exchange for no alimony.  

Now onto the present.   

My dad is really flakey when it comes to financial things. I knew this, don't know why I thought I could fully rely on him for college. Right now he is giving me absolutely nothing reliable in terms of aid. It's giving me a lot of anxiety and pissing me off. He told me straight up the loans I would have to take on would be ""good motivation to get a good paying job right out of college."" I hung up on him when he said that, I'll admit that was immature and I might sound like a spoiled brat but you have to understand this is the one thing he has consistently promised me so I never worried about it.  

I was stupid and never came up with a solid back up plan and right now it looks like I'm fucked. Here are a few options I can think of right now. (In all of these I plan to get a part time job at the very least before anyone asks.)  

Option A: Take my dad to court over the divorce agreement or at least threaten it. I have no idea where to even start with this and this is the last thing I want to do. This would permanently harm my relationship with my dad and as frustrating as this situation is he really does treat me well and I love him a lot.  

Option B: take on a lot of high interest loans from the government. I would have to probably get at least two jobs in college to stay sorta afloat but even then the debt when I graduate will be awful.  

Option C: Ask for a low interest loan from my grandparents. They are very well off but recently they gave my mom a lot of money to help us out so on top of it being an awkward conversation they might not even help and that would be completely fair.  

I'm just at a loss of what to do right now and I'm on the verge of a panic attack. I know I need to stop worrying so much but I need to figure this out soon.",28Feb2020,1
909,"Hello everyone.

For the past year my family and I have been dealing with a life destroying situation.

My father has owned a small business for the past 25 years that designed and installed fire protection systems that saved countless lives throughout New York.

Recently my father has been hit with a fraudulent lawsuit by one of his employees. His lawyer informed him that 98.6% of cases in New York are won by the person who initiates the lawsuit. The case just came to a close and sure enough my father lost the case even with proof to show the case is fraudulent, including depositions from the accuser that contradict his entire care. There is no justice in this system, no chance to defend yourself or your innocence.

This has thrown my familie's lives into chaos. We are going to be losing our home of 15 years in about 2 months. I am franticly trying to use what little money I have to get a small place for the 4 of us to live.

My brother has a mental disorder which all but makes him unemployable. My mother is disabled and other than working from home we don't see any other options, we are currently exploring this. I have a full time job but I barely make enough to support myself I can't imagine how I will support my entire family. Financially it would be easier to go our seperate ways and get my own place leaving my family on their own. I AM NOT DOING THIS. I would sooner die than abandon my family when they need me most.

The main issue comes down to my father. He has a life insurance policy that he wants us to have. He has been talking about killing himself for the past month. I told him that life insurance policies do not cover suicide and we would rather have him than any money in the world(which is the truth). He proved me wrong...his policy does cover suicide which is the scariest part. Last night he came to me and said ""This is my last day in this world"". This was the scariest thing I ever heard. 

I sat with him for hours talking about how we need him more than any money. We spoke about our options which are few. 

My father supported this family his entire life. He hasn't stopped working since he was 9 years old when he first came here from Italy. He's a good man that was given a bad hand in life. I don't want to lose my father. I don't want my family to be torn apart.

So I am asking you good people of Reddit. What do I do? What can I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I am posting this in a few places but I feel r/personalfinance may provide some unique insight into financial specific options. Thank you so much for all of your help.",28Feb2020,1

It's not like I'm sensitive, I'm okay with the roast if it's funny, but that's just unfunny and rude.

I'm not mad at him, I'm worrying his behavior did not changed since the school. He acts like 12 y.o. boy who just discovered porn. He bought iPhone and AirPods with his first money to attract women. With first money on $100 a month shitty job(they're underpaying him about 50% and he don't know that). I could've used that as a roast, but I'm not a bitch, Carl.

We've never left the state together and the furthest out we've gone is a 2hr Metro train ride to another district. I'm not too sure what we can do, but does anyone have any ideas? What are some of your favorite things to do with friends/families/significant other to create memories?   


Thank you so much! I'm sorry if my post is dumb aH.",28Feb2020,1
914,"I didn't realize a community like this existed, and I have been so terrified to talk about any of these thoughts in my life besides to my therapists, but I feel I am in an internal crisis lately that I just need to be able to ask someone else for help with. I have grown up always having intensely close relationships with my girl friends, with specific ones causing me to question if they were more than just friendships, or what was wrong with me in general. I was so afraid I was lesbian a few times, but I could never voice it to anyone and would just suppress it/ convince myself otherwise. I just never felt as interested in talking to men in most situations in general. Even though I grew up in a relatively progressive community, and all of my friends were accepting of people who are gay, none of my friends or even people in any of the larger group circles of friends in my high school or college experiences actually had any women who identified as gay or bi. I was in a greek life circle at a university where the hook up culture was always very much straight. My best girl friends and I have always been so close, and talk about everything, but these worries have never felt like something I could bring up. 

I now feel in a crisis because I am 25, and have been dating my current boyfriend for over 3.5 years, even now have moved across the country for him knowing absolutely no one else here, and now live with him- however in the past few months I met a female friend through work I feel almost obsessed with, and I am questioning everything. We spend almost all of our free time together now even though we just met a few months ago. She always says things about how happy she is that we met and are best friends, and that it's like we are soul mates. She will be complementary and I can just tell how much she loves spending time together, as do I.  Sometimes just the way she looks at me I get this feeling that she is questioning things and wondering maybe if she loves me or something. She has never been in a relationship, but has only hooked up with men as far as I know. I have only ever had straight relationships (two of which I have believed I felt truly in love at times) and I have never hooked up with a girl either.

She loves to get wasted and I have found myself wanting to drink with her all the time because it feels like we get to have more of an emotional connection. I have slept over at her house several times ""because its just easier after going out"" but every time I find myself feeling like I want to cuddle with her and sometimes have (which she hasn't objected to) but still I feel like this is a thing straight best friends could do.

I love my boyfriend so much and he is the most amazing person, and for the past year have thought we would be getting engaged in the next few years. I am so afraid this friendship is going to jeopardize my relationship and future with such an amazing man, but I just cannot get my friend out of my head and how much I like being around her, often feeling like Id rather be hanging with her than my bf, which just feels like a red flag.

I have been in therapy often over the years because of friendship relationships like this causing me severe anxiety, with bordering on obsession/ what I sometimes referred to as an ""attachment disorder"" to these certain girlfriends since I was about 10 years old. But now I am wondering if all along I was just in love with these different friends, and if they had been gay/bi as well, they would have turned into normal relationships rather than me just feeling obsessive.. My current therapist says my level of attachment to this friend is beyond what regular feelings for someone would be whether I am straight or gay or not, and that it is more like a pattern of addiction and high seeking I have had from these relationships all my life.. I just dont know.

I think I would be too afraid to be rejected/ to ruin my friendship and/or my relationship to ever act on these thoughts with my friend unless she did first, but I doubt she ever would because I am the one in a relationship. But I have been thinking about if at some point there is any possibility that she would try to kiss me or make some move.. and I am feeling like I want her to just to find out what I would feel. But it is driving me crazy thinking about it..  I think the right thing to do would be to distance myself from this friend so it doesn't end up feeling like I am emotionally cheating on my boyfriend or worse. But I just don't know if I have the will power to do that because truly every day I feel like I want to be around her. I don't know what to do. I don't know if anyone will actually read this and if you did I'm sorry it was so long. Thanks for listening, it feels good and terrible at the same time to get it out.",28Feb2020,1
