0,"I have so much going on right now. This whole quarantine thing isn’t good for me. I find myself excluded all time by people that say that they love me. I would literally die for them. I try to treat every person in my life as nice as possible. However all they do is exclude me. Just because I’m treating people nicely they think I don’t have any problems so they treat me like I don’t have any feelings, exclude me and play games with me/ take advantage of me. How can I stop and signalize that I have feelings too and sometimes also wanted to be treated nicely? (It’s like even my family treats me like shit even though I would do everything for them) My whole situation just makes me depressed I think. 
If someone wants to now the whole story (I guess nobody will) please pm me. I have nobody to talk to...
I would really appreciate any advice or explanations at why people would treat me bad even though I always treat them nicely.",25Mar2020,1
1,"Hello, this is another quarantine story, I [24, F] am feeling unwell and advice would be much appreciated. 
I'll try to be short - problem is my father, he has many problems without quarantine, temper and anger problems, has no friends, talks to no-one etc. Now I am stuck home with him and mom because of corona, I can't leave anywhere, police and the army are on the streets, my job and classes are online now so I have very little free time. I unfortunately can't leave, not until the virus situation is over, I plan to leave and because of the job I now have the money, but just can't do it now.

The problem - he talks to himself 24/7. Literally. Screaming, clicking his tongue, having fights with the TV, making undefined noises, just spreading his anger everywhere. Our rooms share a wall and I have to work online, have meetings, attend online classes and everything with him in the background. His noises wake me up every night and I am sleep deprived these days and very frustrated.

My question is - how to survive this quarantine situation and stay sane? When I hear him I have a very strong reaction, don't know how to describe it, like the rage overflows me and I just want to hurt myself, which I have done in the past, but am trying not to these days. I unfortunately had to cancel my therapy so no help there. I am trying to stay calm and breathe, but then he speaks again and the feeling reappears. And we don't even communicate, this is just him with himself, we don't ever talk during the day. 

It's very hard for me to do all my daily tasks I have to do, and stay sane. I have no outlet, right now I tried to read a book but not a minute has passed without him talking to himself and being angry at the world. And my schedule is very tight, I was almost loosing it even without this quarantine situation, and everything that has helped me is now gone. Also I can't get sleep and it's affecting everything else.

tl;dr How not to be affected by angry father speaking to himself 24/7 during quarantine",25Mar2020,1
2,"I’m only 15 and I already feel like I need to be going towards my goal, already being better than I already am. It’s crazy and dumb but being around so many young successful artists made me want to do that, so I’ve overtime drowned myself it high expectation. I’m an artist, a dancer, and singer. I don’t get good marks in school. I’ve never done well in school. To me it seems the only option for me to be happy or successful is to try and do it young and big, try to take a big leap but I never can.

4,"Girlfriend's dad is recently out of jail and still continues with small stuff while on parole, he smokes weed (which I don't mind since I was on probation for the past 2 years and smoked a majority of the time) and small fights and the sort. He asks to borrow money from her and when she doesn't have money he asks me which I always allow him whenever I do have the money. He hasn't failed to pay me back or anything aside from stalling a few days every once in a while which I can understand since he said he mixed up the days of his check. Only problem I have is that it's very often, usually about a 100$ or more every week and being only 17 and not having a job as I'm moving over there across states in few days, it's a good bit of my money.

I didnt think it would work, so I looked it up, and tons of people were doing it, so I tried it. I tried inserting my virtual credit card info on other sites, and they all saw it as valid, so I tried it on Netflix. After inserting my card number, experation, and CVV, Netflix said that, "" There appears to be a problem with the payment method you are trying to use."" As i already said, the credit card info worked perfectly on every other website I tried it on, so I looked up the problem, and other people had the same issue, exept they were using real credit cards.

9,"There’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now and it seems like the best course of actions. I think it’ll make me feel a lot better and just be an overall more content person. However, I’m still really nervous. There are some cons, like anything, but not very large. The only thing is that it would be a pretty major life decision for me, and could affect me for years to come. I don’t wanna get held back by fears of what might happen, and give up on what good could come from it. Have any of you been in a situation where you made a risky life decision you really wanted to? If you did, how did you get over any fears and anxieties you had?",25Mar2020,1
10,"This is a huge issue for me. It doesn't happen with everything, it only happens when I become really invested in something and that thing becomes my main focus. For instance: all my life I wanted to play guitar. I bought a guitar, found a teacher and started playing. I was infatuated with my guitar for a few months then I suddenly felt like a switch was flipped and I became uninterested in playing guitar. The next thing that happens - I'm going to force myself to play guitar hoping the good feelings will return but they never do. Instead, I start hating it with a burning passion and all it takes from that point is a few days until I start hating it completely. It's happened to me with many things. I used to love video games so much and lately just starting up a game is enough to make me anxious and physically nauseous. And I tried a lot of games but nothing has worked for me, I will be playing for maximum two minutes then I'll become so overwhelmed that I have to close the game. Another example - I used to love this band. I was like the biggest fucking fan. Until I felt that 'switch' flip and over the course of a few weeks I started hating this band. Like literally hating it, becoming repused everytime I hear someone talk about them and feeling physically repulsed every time their stuff is in my recommended on YouTube. And the worst thing is, these things never stop following me. I will always see someone playing guitar and it will remind me of how much I hate playing guitar. I will see a gaming post on reddit and I'll suddenly remember how much I hate games right now. Basically once I become obsessed with something I KNOW I'M FUCKED. It all starts with a very strong obsession and me being basically infatuated with whatever I've just found. Then I'll gradually become tired of it then I'll suddenly hate it. And if that wasn't enough, I spend months dwelling on those feelings of hate and wondering why I just suddenly become hateful towards the things I used to love so much. It's recently happened to me with my best friend. I used to have a MASSIVE crush on him then one day I noticed something about him that pissed me off (he made a joke that I didn't find funny) and the switch was flipped. I suddenly started to find more and more annoying things about him until simply his presence became a burden. It has become so bad that every time we talk I just resent him and I find everything about him annoying. I have come to resent the whole friendship and he doesn't even know it. I feel like a fucking bitch and don't know what to do. 

I have lost all motivation. I don't really want to do anymore because I know that whatever I find that I love, I'll eventually grow tired of it then I'll grow to hate it. There is no hope left in me. I don't know why this is happening to me and I feel so lost and confused. It's like everything I love has to turn into poison for some reason.",25Mar2020,1

28,"I (M) am now now 34 and my abuser is 39 (M) and he has two children. My entire life I've always thought it was consensual and that what happened was a dark secret I would never tell anyone. I have buried it so deep.

What's weird is that when the abuse stopped, we continued to be friends like everything was normal. Hang out. Go to parties.

I moved away when I was 18 and although we've kept in touch, I've only seen him a few times over the years. He's now married and has two kids.

Lately, I've been having dreams and feeling more disturbed by what happened. I'm not homosexual. Why did those things happen? After reading stories of abuse survivors, I noticed the same patterns. The grooming. Exposure to pornography. The acts themselves.

Now, at 34 years old I am realizing that it wasn't consensual. I know his family well, and there is history of abuse among his cousins, and his older sister was abused by his grandfather. I now suspect he too, was abused.

What should I do? Do I confront him? Go to police? Ignore him?

29,"Xpost from r/relationships, hoping to get advice, anecdotes, support in any form. 

Posting here bc the ex is on Reddit. I am dealing with insane amounts of stress and anxiety over my situation, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've considered seeing a doctor for anxiety medication, for anyone who has dealt with anxiety issues, is it worth it to do so? Sometimes I even worry that all this stress I have will affect my relationship with my husband, and honestly that scares me because I have a hard time containing all of this and I don't want to damage our relationship by being unable to cope, constantly unloading my anxiety on him, or taking things out on him. When I go to get my kids for my weekend time, I am full of fear and anxiety of what he might do or say this time, and I'm having GI issues as a result.

I gave up custody of my kids about 6 months ago. After almost a year of 50/50 split and a slew of issues with my ex, he approached me and told me he wanted full custody for various reasons. The anxiety part comes from many events of the past year, so I guess to give a better idea of that, I need to go into further detail. I split with my ex after a long time being together. He was unemployed collecting disability the entire time, and I motivated him to finish college and get a degree, which has allowed him to have a job now. I had tried to break things off several times, but somehow he always manipulated his way back and convinced me it was I who had the problems and should be grateful someone loved me as much as he did, given all of my issues.

Anyway, after splitting up with him, I found a new place to live and moved out. That was my first mistake, one major misstep in the loss of custody, as I should have made him leave and immediately hired an attorney. But what's done is done.. it's still deeply upsetting when I think about how stupid I've been.. how easily manipulated.. but I try not to think about it or I spiral into depression. 3 months later I met a man who I married a year later, and during this time my ex was still trying to reconcile and I just didn't know how to tell him that it wasn't happening and it was over, I was free. So it was a shock to him when he found out I was seeing someone. He bombarded me after I was leaving an appointment one day. Called me a whore, among other things, told me I cheated on him, and told me he was serving me papers for a legal custody agreement. At that time we decided 50/50 was best, and I wholeheartedly agreed and signed; I love my kids, they're amazing and I love being a mom.

Different arguments and issues arose over the next 6 months, and while my new relationship was blossoming into something wonderful, my ex had hired a private investigator unbeknownst to me, and revealed it during a conversation in which he told me he wanted full custody. I'll admit here, and freely, that I did not do anything during the time I was being spied on, and I have never put my kids into harms way. My son during this time pulled some dumb kid stuff involving photographing himself with my new stepson, which my ex knew about. So with that, in combination with the threats of whatever he thought he had with the PI, I was afraid of what would happen and I signed.

The nightmare after splitting with him just keeps getting worse and worse.. I made poor financial decisions when moving out, the rent was too high for what I could afford, my credit card debt kept rising, and now I am barely able to make payments each month, with very little left for food and gas. My weekends with my kids is spent eating cheap meals and going to free places like the park for fun. When we initially signed the paperwork, he also convinced me to sign under the pretense that I wouldn't be paying child support so that I could catch up on my growing debt, which he was aware of. And, the legal agreement does state that we opted not to do child support. Now, he is saying I need to pay him child support monthly. I DO feel a financial obligation to my kids, and as such I've been providing clothes, diapers, toys, etc monthly, as we initially agreed we would split the costs of everything. Now he's saying I should come up with a ""figure"" for what I think is fair, and honestly, I figure it's only a matter of time before I get served again.

I know my situation could be much much worse, but honestly this is the highest amount of stress and anxiety I have ever had in my life, and it is pressing me in directions I've never been in. I've had suicidal thoughts... I'd never go through with it, I love life and everything about it, but sometimes the anxiety of not knowing what the next day might be like, and the thought of not having to deal with this anymore sounds too good to be true. And I know that all stories have 2 sides to tell, but this is my story and how I've lived through it to this point surprises me how little I've learned about being so easily manipulated. I am constantly disrespected by the ex, he treats me like I'm not even the mother of my own kids. My daughter had an illness recently and I didn't even find out she had been to the emergency room until the next day. I've communicated in every possible way I can think of, but nothing seems to work or get through. I'm just at a point now of total hopelessness, I have no idea what to do and any advice would be appreciated.

Tldr: I'm having major issues with my ex, he's done everything he can to ruin my life and every day the nightmare gets worse. Any advice?",25Mar2020,1

31,"I’ll try to keep this short. Thank you in advance for reading this.  

I am 24F and my boyfriend is 25M. We have been dating for almost six years, and have been living together for three.  

When I was around 17, I went into a very dark and deep depression. At the time I thought it was mostly caused by chaos at home, but I also knew the depression was contributed by feelings of loneliness and my inability to make friendships.  Starting at age four (as early as I can remember) I had this strange phenomenon happen to me; I didn’t know what it was, but I knew something was wrong. When I was at home or with my immediate family/a select few close friends, I was normal and myself. I could speak and communicate fine. As soon as I was with anyone else though or at school I would “shut down.” My body would tense up, my mind would go blank, and I couldn’t speak. I would be silent for the WHOLE day at school (about eight hours without talking) until I got back home. I wanted to talk more than anything, but I couldn’t. Something was stopping me. 

The severity of this lasted until I was 12. I attended a band camp for two weeks in the summer. Being in a fun environment helped me come out of my shell, but the process was very gradual and it took several summers for me to feel somewhat normal. At 15 I felt better. I was in a new school and could actually hold a conversation, then at 16 I started to regress. Even though I was better than when I was younger, I still had bad anxiety when it came to being around others. I couldn’t keep friendships because I still couldn’t talk much. At 17 was when I started slipping into a dark place, and at age 18 I went on anti-depressants for two years. I stopped after two years because I thought I didn’t need them, because I believed my depression was brought on by living at home, and I had moved out a few months prior.  

I am now 24 and I am in a much better place than I was years ago. I am not depressed anymore, but I do struggle with talking and anxiety still. This has been affecting my daily life for a while, such as school and work. About eight months ago I stumbled across something online and the name “Selective Mutism” appeared. I started reading about it and everything clicked – I knew this is what I had suffered from! I couldn’t believe there were others like me out there, and I found some relief in knowing I am not completely crazy, that now I know there is a name to what I was/am experiencing.  

I have thought it over for many weeks and I think going back on an anti-depressant will help. Prozac in particular has been showed to help people with SM, and that wasn’t the one I was on before, although I’d talk it over with my Dr first. I just made an appointment for tomorrow, but I am terrified of telling my boyfriend. He doesn't really believe in anti-depressants and since I’m not depressed, I know he will object. However, they can help manage anxiety and also SM (which is a mental disorder), but still I am afraid to tell him. How do I go about this? What if he objects and tells me I’m making a mistake? I already made an appointment for tomorrow but I’m afraid he’ll get mad that I didn’t bring this up sooner. Would I be an asshole if I decide to go on them anyway even if he doesn’t approve? I know this sounds controlling but I also know he just wants the best for me. I am so lost and I need some guidance. Thank you so much.",25Mar2020,1

for further detail on the situation, every time there was a problem i’d just cry about it and not do anything about it. in return, he had to deal with me and the problem so he just stopped telling me things altogether. now he’s tired of my shit. he told me that he would stop trying and that he doesn’t care anymore. my friend says he still cares but i don’t know.

and since i’m not good at communication, he said he’d rather call other girls because they actually talk. last night he stayed up to 3am calling them and he’s never done that with me. 

i’m unsure on how he feels. i asked them if he was gonna break up with me but he said that he didn’t want to. i don’t understand why.

i want to know how to start a conversation that would last and in the end make him remember why we started dating. every time i do start the conversation, it ends in a few seconds, that’s how bad i am at talking.

39,"I need help.

I went to Urgent Care last week because I was feeling a little short of breath and had a slight dry cough. Now, it's allergy season and I tend to get some shortness of breath when my allergies act up, but I went to the doctor because I had used my inhaler and it didn't feel like things were improving.

He put me on 60mg of prednisone the first day, 50mg the second day, 40mg the third day, and so on. Well, I couldn't finish it after the third day of 40 mg. I was having, what I believe to be, an adverse reaction. I was having INTENSE hot flashes, sweats, bad headaches, rapid heart rate, and the water retention was bad. 

I called Urgent Care, told them what was going on, and so they told me to just quit cold turkey since I was having that reaction. So I stopped cold turkey at 40 mg. That was Saturday.

To say that withdrawal has been hell is an understatement. I feel hot and cold at the same time, sweaty/clammy, absolutely exhausted to the point where I often find I don't even want to move (and yes, sometimes honestly think I might die), yet my anxiety is off the charts so its making it so its hard to rest, very low appetite, and feel dehydrated because I can't even seem to stomach drinking water sometimes.

Has anyone else on here had prednisone withdrawal? Was your experience the same or similar? How long did it last? Is there anything to alleviate the symptoms, or at least how strong they seem to be?",25Mar2020,1

41,"So basically my sister doesn’t want to invite my dad to her wedding. He was only part of the “family” for half of our childhood and he decided to get a divorce from my mom and move 6 hours away with his new family. He doesn’t really talk to us and we never see him. I’ve been trying to convince my sister to invite him because I don’t want the relationship to be completely destroyed of point of no return. It might sound stupid but idk I just don’t want her to regret it if they end up making up in 5-10 years. I guess I’ve got some hope. My dad keeps asking me about the wedding and I keep telling him “Im not sure talk to her about it” but they keep kind of ignoring each other so I’m left as the messenger in between the two. It’s fucking annoying and I just wish that they would talk it out.

At the same time tho I understand my sisters point of view in the way that he caused her a lot of mental health issues, commitment issues and I’ve seen it first hand. I understand why she wouldn’t want him at the wedding because it’d be a reminder of the way he treated us. I’m having a hard time thinking it through and need some advice or input on the situation.

44,"(18M) I have a really messed up family. Basically what is happening is everyone is trying to convince the parents to live like misers so they can inherit as much money as possible when they die while everyone fights for the money in the process.

My brother tries to extract as much money as he can out of my father every month. He edits credit card statements in photoshop and lies about how much his rent is so he can convince him to wire him more money than what is needed. He is also spoilt rotten and is an AU on my father's card and he has a job so I don't understand why he needs my fathers card. He also tries to convince my father to write an irrevocable trust for him and him only. My mothers side is MUCH worse. My aunt has convinced my grandparents (who have Dementia) to make her son POA. After he became the POA, he would just withdraw thousands of dollars every month from their accounts to cover his expenses and to put money in his pocket. He would also transfer their social security benefits to his bank account. My grandparents have no idea he is doing this. They slander my mother and other aunt to try to convince my grandparents to cut them out of the will. He also added himself as POD, he will get all the money when my grandparenets die.

My life has completely changed because of this. It's not fair that someone like my aunt and cousin can just have money handed to them and not work for it because they know how to con people. I think about money all the time. I am so frugal because I want to save enough money to leave my family. I also do it out of fear of having no money one day. I always think about my father's will wondering if it has changed. I think about my inheritance everyday because I am all of a sudden obsessed with money now and I fear that it will be taken away by my brother or some gold digger he meets. My family has basically turned me into Ebenezer Scrooge.

45,"So a week or so ago, my kids (ages ,4 and 3) found what I thought was a kitten, maybe 12 weeks old I thought, while they were playing outside. I thought, great, another dumped cat (we have two cats already that were dumped in our neighborhood). I posted the cat on our local Facebook page, and I messaged the only neighbors I have contact info on, to try to find the owner. I fed the cat, which was super skinny and so happy to eat and to play with my little ones. I figured I was going to be stuck with the cat but I didn't mind too much because the kids fell in love immediately and she's a really pretty cat who didn't mind little kids.

Turns out the cat is an outside cat that belongs to this neighbor we sort of know. The neighbor came and picked it up. My four year old was heartbroken.

Well the darn cat comes over every day. If she can get in the house to eat our cat's food, she will. And my four year old will bring her in the house if he sees her in the window. I wouldn't care but I feel like we're sort of stealing this cat. So I messaged my neighbor to let her know, and I asked if she minded if I put flea protection on the cat. She said that's fine. She apologized and asked if the cat was bothering us, if so she would re-home it. I assured her that it wasn't a bother.

Now when she picked up the cat that first day, she mentioned that the cat was actually almost a year old (she's just a small cat I guess) and not fixed. So you know what is going to happen. I'm going to end up with kittens. Am I going to sound like a total loon if I offer to take her cat to the vet to get fixed? I'd rather spend $80 than get 4 new cats this summer.",25Mar2020,1
46,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.


Long story short I came across CP from a website I used to frequent. It was a forum website with posts from different people. I came across a thread that had legitimate CP and that forum was up since 2017. I reported it and gave all my info over to the FBI, IWF and I think the center for missing and exploited children. My concern is that I spent too long on the site and look at too many of the posts as I had originally planned to report each page individually but realized that wouldn’t look good. (Some pages had legal porn in it that’s why). I decided to just link and report the single forum itself. I then went to reddit to post about what I saw and the post got me perma banned. (I didn’t link the material). 

I have since then been worried about getting contacted by police or fbi over what I saw and getting myself put away for life and ending my career and everything that matters to me. I also worry about reddit itself reporting my post to authorities. Everyday I wake up and it’s the first thing I think about and the last thing I think about before bed and in between my day. 

How can I move past this?? Sometimes I am able to move forward and do other things without thinking about it, then a day comes like today where it is all I can think about.

There is also one other thing... I’ve been dealing with POCD I believe.... and after reporting the material I decided to see if it is something I would like. Being as I was already super aroused from previous porn searching, I decided to finish off to one of the thumbnails.... (not download). After doing so I almost broke down and cried. I almost threw up, and started shaking and hating myself since then. I realize now it was a mistake to do that, but ended my intrusive thoughts about ever being a pedo.

That said, I still feel like a monster and am CONSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT being thrown in jail over this. I hear sometimes it takes months before people know or even years before they get contacted for such material. Not sure how I can move forward without knowing if the next day brings a party bus to my place. How does one live life like that?...",25Mar2020,1

51,"So im asian, so of course, i am expected to get all a’s. however, i got a b in the first semester in my 9th grade year, and my mom was furious. i was able to maintain all a’s the next semester. now that i finished in the first half of my 10th grade year with 2 more b’s, my mom was even more furious, but she seemed to have gotten over it. my sister, in her last year of middle school, seems to be the perfect sibling, never had gotten a b. 

My moms birthday recently passed last month and since she is so stressed being a single mom to provide for 2 kids, she forgot. my younger sister did as well. i however did not, so i surprised her after school with a card saying how much i appreciate her. 

Sometime in the next week, i had to ask her for help on math as she majors in physics. she berated me for not knowing how to do some simple ap calculus when i’m in 10th grade and she did it when she was younger. she proceeded to say that if everything i had written in my card were true, then she doesn’t know how i turned out to become such a disappointment. she compares me to my perfect sister all the time. very recently, i thought i would ask her again for some help and i got the same reaction, saying how i should already know how to do my homework (online school) and this is so simple, and i should have learned it a long time ago. 

The next day, i brought it up to her, and she stood by her actions and i was defeated. i don’t like to bug my teachers with my questions either cause they already have so much work grading many classes papers and stuff and probably don’t have time to answer my 1 question with a solution. she also makes me do homework in her room so i don’t get distracted watching videos or reading on reddit (lmao), so if i were to search it up, she’ll ask what i’m doing, and i’ll say it’s for math, she’ll say that SHE can help me. so i’m stuck here

i don’t know what to do to get help on my homework. my mom treats me great outside of schoolwork and i truly appreciate everything she does for me, how she cooks, cleans, and does so much for me. just, i need help on my homework, otherwise, i will get more bad grades, and she’ll be mad at me more!",25Mar2020,1
52,"Im 20 F in my second year of community college. I have this deep and crushing feeling of “I failed everyone and myself I’m not where I should have been/be at right now.” 

It feels like this in every area of my life. 

I’m way too big, my skins too messed up beyond repair, I’m so negative and shy and closed off but I cant help that anymore. I cant keep or make friendships at all. I’m consistently craving a deep loving and understanding friendship but I wont reply to people that reach out to me from time to time because I dont feel like it or it takes too much work.

I go anxious stupid when I’m out in public, like my face tenses up, my back hunches up and all common sense goes out the window. I get scared out in public. Thinking everyones watching me. 

Its very easy for people to forget about me and I learned through my first job at mcdonalds that I can make people hate me very fast. I mean I was bullied all through my school years from k-12 but when I worked with actual adults I realized that the problem has been me the whole time. But I dont know how to fix it.

In my first relationship ever I ended up not liking the whole experience because of how my insecurities took over. Didnt feel like we had anything in common, that he was lying to me, using me, his place holder until he found something better. Someone to fill the emptiness so he could get over the last person he was with. 

I’ve slowly lost interest and energy and entertainment in everything. Reading, gaming, listening to music, sight seeing, laughing at things, watching movies. I feel like I always have this looming feeling that I’m not supposed to be here and its just getting worse. 

Because I live in a good situation- not broke, have a car, have two pet ferrets, both parents, education- and that Im mexican and young, Im supposed to be in the high clouds having the time of my life right now making memories and enjoying my time here. 

But it feels like I’m living in a box. And Im slowly rotting in it.

In the past there have been times where I was close to leaving but everytime I would just cry and tell myself that if I did that it would cause the same issues that Im having with my sister whos 16. And I cant imagine being the reason why my sister cant live her life.

I was thinking getting a morning job mopping floors or stocking food at a grocery store. If I do this I can stop couch surfing. Cons are my grades could suffer. I want to become an accountant.

Another option is to join a sports team/club for morning workouts. There is a feeling of excitement I get when im apart of team. This purpose makes me want to wake up early to workout with other teammates so we all can become better soccer players. Although I will be spending money on healthy food, I wont be able to move out.

55,"For some context, I'm a seventeen year old girl living in the UK. I live with my partner and his family. I work in a small office as an apprentice. It's important to mention I have asthma.

About a week ago, I woke up with a very tight chest and dry cough. I panicked and thought that I was developing symptoms of COVID-19. 

I called my boss and she advised me to self-isolate for two weeks and keep her updated on my condition.

I have been isolating for seven days already and I'm pretty sure that's its just my asthma that's acting up. I've had two asthma attacks over the weekend.

Recently, the UK has just went into full lockdown but my workplace is still open.

My self-isolation period is almost over and due to my asthma being more irritable than usual, I'm feeling nervous about going back into the world. 

Earlier tonight, my boss messaged everyone I work with, myself included. She had a discussion with our CEO and have given us all a choice. 

The office will remain open during lockdown however, we can choose to either travel to work as normal and be paid our usual wages or we can stay at home for the full duration of the lockdown and be given sick pay for the full time we are out of work. 

This is where I'm stuck. On one hand, I'm just an apprentice and I've only been working for the company for around six months. It's my first ever job and I want to prove that I'm motivated and willing. Plus, I've already had a lot of time off being in isolation.

On the other hand, I understand the seriousness of the virus. I live with my partner and his family, including his grandmother, who is over the age of sixty, so she is at high risk. I don't want to catch it due to my asthma and I don't want to bring it into the home.

So, I don't know what to do. Do I continue to go to work as normal? Or do I stay home during the lockdown?

I really need some outside perspective before I let my boss know my decision. I just want to do the right thing, you know?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",25Mar2020,1

60,"So let's get the broader scene out of the picture first. My father's side of the family couldn't give to shits about me. In contrast, my mother's side of the family is what really hits a nerve.

Unlike my father's side, of whom I only see like once or twice a year, my mother's side is consistent. I see them often. And over time, I began to realize that my mother's side of the family seems to see me as some 10 year old child no matter how old or mature I am. Granted, I am not of age yet, but I am almost of age, and I feel that I should be treated and respected as such. But I do not know how to ask them for such; they are simple people, and when they percieve something, their perspective is the correct perspective. 

Furthermore, there are two sets of cousins from my mother's side (who we will refer to as cousins A and cousins B) who have constantly ganged up on me, made fun of me and even excluded me during times where I needed support the most. I understand that some cousins will be jackasses, but everybody in the family gets along, and they can't just seem to make an acception for me (and even for my little brothers, who I believe have it harder than I do in the sense that they do not understand any of this.)

What makes this all hurt worse is that one particular cousin from the set of cousin A (this individual was the only one who ""made an acception for me"") has been fake all this time. He acts really immature when we play games and it irritates me beyond belief. Why can't he act normal? He is a year younger than me, and I have seen through this immaturity act of his. I see how he really acts in front of anyone else. But he puts up this act just for me (and my little brothers.) He also joined in with the other cousins whenever got together and excluded me. He even tried making himself the victim when I confronted him about it (he makes himself the victim very often btw)

My father (and, surprisingly, my youngest brother) are the only ones who listen and understand. My mother and two older sisters even get irritated whenever I try talking to them about it. They have this strange dilusion where we all must get along, and whenever I try to ask them about sleeping elsewhere whenever these cousins come to us, they'd rather me suffer through it than try to assist me in getting away from these freaks.

And my mother wonders why I want to stay away from family celebrations. She gets sad whenever I mention that when I become of age that I will not attend any of cousin A or Bs celebrations. She says family is needed, and even believes that I am learning this from my father (who also stays away from his family.) But this is not my father. This is my own conclusion that I have reached. 

I know that I have made it sound like my mother and sisters are nuts, but they are normally kind and loving. They just lose all of their thought towards me (even towards my brothers/father) whenever the other family is involved. 

TL;DR: I really want to avoid family at all costs, but my mother and sisters make it really difficult. I need advice.",25Mar2020,1
61,"This mental(s) suffers from severe bipolar disease. Its mood fluctuates from happiness to complete dejection by single word from any person. It doesn't seem to accept any criticism outside its own circle and it's mean-spirited and it flaunts its mean spirit in a rowdy way.

Like, if someone couldn't sleep for one night, it'll exaggerate the symptom like the someone suffers from severe insomnia. Then again, today, it posted things like, ""How can I apologize"" while posting those exaggerated things.

It's not just that. My parents are getting older and it posts things like my parents' death in 10 consecutive posts. It's completely crazy mental, and I cannot emphasize this enough that it's really really deranged, demented psycho.

And what is really ironic is, although it's rotten, disagreeable, nasty in every aspect of its existence, it always seems to pursue eye-pleasing beauty. It even did plastic surgery. Its taste in everything revolves around vain, vaporous, delirious type of things that are easy on the eye, and it's almost pathetic when something so disgusting is so obsessed with beautiful things. Of course, it shows no sympathy or mercy towards non eye pleasing things and it disdains ugly things existence proudly. Like, it's proud of itself that it can discern correct beauty better than other people. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but to something so self-centered, it's always objective when it's only subjective.

It always wishes the worst for all people other than itself, and it looks greedy, bad-tempered old shit. I think it's losing its hair and I don't want to see when its hair is completely gone.

As you can imagine with COVID-19 things have been busy. My boss and the two other members on my team are male (if that matters, you tell me) I am in a heavily male dominated segment of the bank. All of the top leadership is male. It has a bit of a “boys club” atmosphere but I never felt it held me back at all. 

Today something happened and I am struggling with understanding if I should view this as something I just have to deal with because I’m female or if it is actually a personal attack. 

There is a large project underway to help bring relief to our business clients during the COVID crisis (ex: deferring payments or interest etc) We need to determine these parameters quickly and stand them up in a matter of days. My colleague Bob was tasked with this originally from senior leaders and has worked 12 hour days and weekends to start the process for our middle level clients. They have asked him to simultaneously do this for our lower level and high level clients as well. This is too much work for Bob to handle on such a short deadline and he asked me to take over the side of the project handling smaller clients to open up some bandwidth for him. 

On the initial call for smaller clients with everybody present to kickstart the process- the senior leader (who has always seemed indifferent about me but never negative) heard I was taking over the project and immediately and angrily said “absolutely not”. He said I’m welcome to help “administratively” but that is all. In. Front. Of. Everyone. This included other senior leaders at my company who now believe I’m a total waste of space. He made me sound completely incompetent when I hadn’t even spoken a word. He claims the reason is he wants “consistency” but he knows it is impossible for one person to run all three projects so SOMEBODY else WILL HAVE TO be assigned. They even told him that going into this call. 

Part of me thinks in times of crisis- men in leadership seek out other men only to get things done. 

But a larger part of me feels absolutely crushed that our senior leadership feels I’m incapable and has now said so out loud in front of everyone. For context, I am one of less than 5 percent of people in the entire company who scored a perfect rating on my annual review. I am now running every scenario through my head wondering where I’ve proven to be incapable and why suggesting that I take over the project made this man instantly ANGRY. 

Bob felt awful and he is trying to find other ways to include me but I just want to honestly quit my job after today. Obviously I will stick around for now but leaders don’t realize that dedicated talent will leave when publicly humiliated. I’ve been with the company 13 years and promotion after promotion that occurred solely based on reputation. With that now in the toilet, I feel complete discouragement.

What should I do? How do I think about this in a way that stops imploding my confidence? I want to believe it’s just men being men and has nothing to do with my work ability but my brain won’t believe it. How do I get my confidence back or reset my frame of mind when I feel totally crushed?",25Mar2020,1

73,"When I was younger, say about 15 or 16, life was honestly so great. I was in high school living a semi-normal teenage life. Now, I’m 18 and a freshman in college. I’m in school getting decent grades with my goal being nursing. When I’m at home I end up just being in my room all day and watching Netflix or just listening to music. I don’t know how to explain any of this really it’s kind of difficult, but life feels kinda of bland... I see everyone else my age going to parties, traveling, driving around with their friends, spending time with their significant others, and I want that. I feel like these are my most important years, the years that will mold me into the person who I’m supposed to be, but I’m not having those experiences that will help mold me. Maybe it’s because when I was younger I wasn’t really allowed out of the house, if I was it was with my parents and if I was with friends my parents were there. It wasn’t until I was about 17 I started to have a little more freedom like: staying over at a friends house or getting a ride from them to school and back or a ride to get food. But now it’s like life went in reverse, since my schooling is online I’m at home working, but when I’m not working I’m still at home, because even though I’m 18 and a college student I have to ask to go out. I get interrogated before I can go out and even then it might be a no. I feel like my life isn’t the life of a 18 yr old college student, I don’t like it, I feel like I’m missing out on so much. As a result of me missing out life feels so boring to me. I used to have suicidal thoughts because I didn’t like how my life was and I felt that if I couldn’t live my life how I wanted then what was the point, but I think I may be back to that now. I just feel unfulfilled nothing is really catching my interest. I always hear from my parents that I should never dislike my life because “people have it way worse” but isn’t it wrong to dismiss my own feelings and problems just because mine may not seem as bad, maybe my problems are too much for me to handle and I’m not as strong as someone else with bigger problems, I don’t know. They always say I have what any kid could ask for basically, parents paying for schooling, meals everyday, caring family, parents who give me anything within reason, but for some reason it’s not enough for me? My cousin who is about 10 years older than me always says that I should be so grateful because I have an amazing life thanks to my parents and that I have everything and I take it for granted. I’m not sure how to explain it but in my mind I don’t have everything. I guess I don’t have the things I truly want deep down inside and I’m not sure I could get them.

74,"Howdy everyone, this is my first Reddit post and I’m on mobile so please take it easy on me. 

I’ve been real conflicted lately in regards to my relationship with a friend. This is gonna be a long post so I’ll leave the tldr up here for those of you who actually care. 

TLDR; friend wants to room in a hotel together again for a convention, but the year before she put me through so much stress to the point of tears. I don’t have the heart to risk loosing that friendship and breaking up my friend group, but I also can’t keep going pretending I’m okay with what happened. Multiple occasions of disrespect are just eating me up. 

For reference, my friends and I who have been mentioned are ages 17-20. 

So two years ago this friend (let’s call her Jude) and I got to know each other through a mutual friend. We’ll call the former mutual Mary, she doesn’t matter too much in this tale but Jude has the tendency to throw her name around. After Mary introduced us all and simultaneously blew up on all of us because of what I now know was a miscommunication, she left and our friend group grew to be close(we didn’t know each other beforehand outside of Mary mentioning us). At the time, the whole situation seemed to be Mary’s fault. She was supposed to room with Jude but complained she didn’t know them, she was staying for free, and was gonna be so unhappy. I had a room, so I said she could stay with me for free that weekend so long as she told Jude. Well, the con came and went. Mary never talked to Jude. Jude says Mary ignored her. Jude was asking for payment, Mary refused and said she didn’t have to. She blamed it on everyone, including me once I told her I couldn’t pick a side because I had just met everyone. So, she left a short while after threatening to kill herself because I offered my room to her. This backstory seems unimportant, but I can’t really continue unless you know how we all met. 

A year later we all had gotten close, and the convention was approaching. Jude got a hotel room again and this time asked my best friend, Poe and I, if we wanted to room with her. We said yes, she said she’d sort out payment. Jude had always talked of how moneys been tight, how art just doesn’t sell like it used to and that she can’t get a job. We talked on the side and we agreed that my part of payment for the hotel room would be doing some sewing for her, which I normally charge a few hundred dollars for. And Poe would just pay in cash. 

Jude sorted out how much everyone owed and messaged the group chat saying we all owed her average $150... to which I gently reminded her of our deal. She said money was tight and seemed to avoid it, and I’ve never been one to press grievances. So I said I’d pitch in a little, only about $20. I try not to let money dictate my actions, so I let it go. 

Jude had also messaged the group chat in the summer and asked if she could bring alcohol, and I immediately expressed how uncomfortable I would’ve been. I told her no, and even gave personal reasons why, of which shouldn’t be expected of me. A friend would know that no is enough. I shouldn’t need to explain myself. I said no, because we’re underage, Poe is a minor, and if we get busted, we all get in trouble, even if it’s just her alone drinking. She asked what if she kept it on the down low and kept it casual. She said we wouldn’t get in trouble as if to calm my anxieties. I told her my family has a history of addiction. I’ve been around drunk people and have never enjoyed myself. I wouldn’t be comfortable. She then backtracked and apologized and said she wouldn’t bring it, and I thanked her. Did I mention she asked if she could bring boys back to the room? Is that even something you do when you’re sharing a hotel room? Especially when one of your roommates is a minor (and you persist on constantly bringing that up).

Convention weekend rolls around. Poe comes to my place, we load up my car after I get home from work, and we hit the road. The convention was fortunately only 20 minutes away from me, but we decided rooming there would be more fun and would be easier since we planned to cosplay. We wait for Jude and she checks in, and we head up to our room. We walk up to where our room should be... oh no. It’s in a closed off section of the hallway, an ugly and tacky courtyard with three rooms (one of which is a business suite), that’s been used by the same people attending that con year after year for partying around the clock. Poe and I planned to go to bed early that night (10) so we could stay up late on Saturday night for the raves. The room  reeked of alcohol, the air felt moist, smelt faintly of tobacco, and was causing my mold allergy to flare. Poe and I immediately looked at eachother and said oh hell no. But before we could fully decide the room sucked and evaluate our options, Jude was running off to a room party... at 2 in the afternoon.

It brings me physical pain to write out and share to you this next part. It feels gross to think about, and I hated hearing her tell me and Poe about it. It enforces stereotypes about our fandom... I’m sure some of you unfortunately are clueing in. Please don’t badger and harass me about it. She spent almost all of Friday until midnight at these parties. Orgies, with random strangers. Whenever we’d voice our worries for her safety (she’s a small woman) she said it was okay because everyone had to be STD tested before going in to prevent the spread of anything. She did it using the costume I finished for her (of which she expressly said she wouldn’t use it for, as I don’t want that association), showboating to us how random people looked on and how she was so sweaty afterwards and blah blah blah... completely ignoring our concerns for her safety. Not because of STD’s, but because she’s hooking up in a room of random strangers for sex. That is TERRIFYING to me, not only as a woman, but as her friend. 

Back to what I was saying, Poe and I immediately realized that we wouldn’t get any sleep being in the party wing. This room sucked and all around was a bit overwhelming. It also only had one bed, Jude specially booked two. And didn’t care we only had one bed. So we knocked on the door of the main partiers and we agreed that us 3 needed to go. They expressly booked that room and have been for the past decade, but for some reason they got a two bed room elsewhere (of which, as initially stated, was the room we booked. The hotel was really disorganized, had 2 floors of rooms out of operation, etc, and con goers were mad. We weren’t the only ones getting a single bed when we requested two, but that’s irrelevant.). Problem is, the owner of their room also wasn’t around. Jude said for us to basically figure it out and when we needed her, to text her. Because, yknow, you keep your phone right nearby when there’s tons of naked strangers around you. Not to mention the fact that she was content with the hotel room we got, and saw no issue, but said if Poe and I weren’t happy then we can do the work. So we exchanged contact info with the partiers and went on our way. 

By time the owner of the party rooms finally came back to the venue it was 11pm and Poe and I were growing weary. We texted Jude and she came running, sweaty and all. We got everything set up properly, and Poe and I could finally sleep. By the time everyone was moved out, it was 11:30. Poe and I were agitated, but took our losses and went to bed after Jude told us about her adventures having sex with strangers after Poe and I asked her to stop because it was uncomfortable. This of course, was after she ran back off to her room party. It was a late night, much to Poe’s and my dismay. 

Saturday rolls around and we all wake up bright and early. I don’t remember that morning to be honest, I know Jude ran off eventually though. Our friend group had planned to buy takeout and eat it in our room. I bought sodas for the group, other people brought snacks. It had become a tradition for our friend group to do this, as we did do it with Mary and some other folk the year before. Jude finally met up with us again, but now with her new boy toy, let’s call him... James. I immediately did not like James. He put me off, and as the night wore on it became obvious he only hung around her for sex. She pulled Poe and I aside and asked if he could come to the party, and we gently expressed our discomfort. She had told us she would’ve been totally understanding if we said no... yet brought him anyways. She said he had no friends and was new to the fandom, but quite honestly that’s not my problem. Though, I’ve never been the confrontational type. All my life I grew up being left out, so I let it go and hoped perhaps I was just in a weird headspace because of the con so far (and the fact the hotel was falling apart and they treating con goers like shit. Our con has a good reputation so idk why they were. Maybe they knew the hotel would close a month later). Maybe all he needed was the chance to make a friend. 

Tom is another friend of ours who was attending the party. He had his complaints about his roommates, as per usual. I personally don’t think he’s allowed to complain because he rooms for free with random strangers he meets. He mentions how they had alcohol and Jude flies out of her seat like a bat out of hell, asking if he can bring her down a case. Poe and I just kinda shoot her a glare, because at this point more friends were showing up and we didn’t want to start the party on a bad note. (And let me clarify that when I say party, I mean a get together of maybe 10 people at most) Also, again, i can’t really confront people. He says he’ll see and eventually comes back down with a case. All our friends have arrived. We order the food. Then she slowly gets louder, and louder, and rowdier... and I come to realize this wasn’t the Jude I knew. Everyone’s getting louder and louder and I start disassociating. This wasn’t how I had expected the party to go, but I also hadn’t experienced a party with teenagers and alcohol. Poe notices and asks if I’m okay, and he takes me out into the hallway. We eventually move into the tacky courtyard in the party section, and I curl up and cry. Poe assures the passing drunks that I’m okay when they ask. I expressed my discomfort and Poe went to talk to Jude when i couldn’t/didn’t wanna see her at that moment. I only spent maybe 5-10 minutes before i went back (after Jude came in and apologized and told me she’d put it away and such. And probably pretended it was okay because “we aren’t Mary, we wouldn’t do that to you”). I came back and we ate our food. Tom was putting hot sauce and water in an unused condom he found. James was sitting on the floor being a social butterfly. Everyone seemed okay and I wish I had felt okay too. I just... didn’t. I couldn’t. Things weren’t going as I had imagined, but maybe I just needed to manage my expectations. 

We all laugh and talk, and head down to the con floor to try to get people to drink the condom full of taco bell hot sauce. She told us she’d spend the night with us and not party, but she told James they’d go back to his room once the party was over. So, that was the first time he kept trying to take her away from us. Then he tried a couple other times while we were out and about. Once we found someone who drank the hot sauce, she and James were gone. All our friends left and Poe and I were alone once the remaining stragglers left too. We went to the rave for all of five minutes and then walked around the moldy hotel, admiring how a building in that state could still be open per safety regulations(surprise surprise, they were violating tons of laws). We went back to the room and waited for Jude to come back. And waited. And waited. We didn’t want to go to bed until we knew she was okay. We all went to sleep around one and woke up Sunday feeling tired. We packed our shit up and that was mostly it for the weekend. James was hanging all over Jude Sunday morning.

Now of course, id be lying if this was the only thing she did that upset me. I drove an hour to a sleepover at her house where she confided into me the morning we woke up while I was petting her cat that her animals had fleas. And yes, that problem was not sorted out in her home by the time of the convention. This was a big problem for me as a pet owner. I wasn’t in the financial position back then to afford flea treatments for all the animals (my parents included since I live at home). Poe didn’t find out from her until after the con, but trust me when I say Poe heard about that bs immediately after the sleepover. I was fuming. My rabbit means the world to me and I cannot forget her endangering my pet. I couldn’t prepare a clean set of clothes, all of my stuff had been exposed to those fleas. At least for the convention I could plan ahead. Plus, bed bugs were a bigger threat than fleas in that hotel. 

I drove 40 minutes to meet her a month or so ago to hang out. She’d been badgering me for weeks, and quite honestly I had forgotten about most of what she did to make me angry. I had expressed that I didn’t trust James after she brought up hanging with him at a con again (of whom she’s not dating, as you would imagine the relationship barely lasted a week). She dismissed it and said he just has anxiety... I can tell when someone’s anxious, and when I don’t trust someone. But okay. The rest of the day was enjoyable. In my mind now, things were okay. I forgot she made me mad, I forgot how upset I was when I was crying outside a hotel room party. I forgot the fleas. That day she asked if I wanted to room with her again next year. I, regrettably, said sure. I know, at this point I’m just asking for trouble. But please understand that I genuinely forgot. I’ve never been known for my memory. Poe agreed to rooming together as well. The convention moved locations to a venue an hour away from me. I needed a hotel room, and legally I’m too young to book a room. She said she’d do it so whatever, I trust my friends. She asked if she could invite Tom and I immediately shot that down. He’s flakey, doesn’t have a job, and is a freeloader. She said “but money”... I have two jobs now. Money isn’t an issue for me. She didn’t listen until Poe came into the chat and reiterated what I said. We suggested other friends that would be a better choices. Only then did she listen, perhaps it’s because two people spoke against her. But then again, she didn’t care when she invited James to our room party against our expressed wishes. So I shouldn’t expect that to change. 

I messaged in a few days later, here’s how the chat went down:

“Hey guys, what if we got an Airbnb for the con? We’d all drive up together.”

“Idk man, if i plan on going to late night partys i dont wanna like. Call u up at 2am yknow”

“But we’ll have ammeneties and pricing isn’t bad”

“I kinda wanted to stay in the hotel but I guess I think on it”

“We could try to find one in walking distance. We could set a mutual curfew. ”

“Maybe”

So I took a jab at her, because your friend attending orgies for hours on end isn’t something you forget. 

“I know you like being fucked, but isn’t until midnight enough?” 

She took the joke and said I was just pulling her string and explained that Poe and I waited up for her to come back to make sure she was okay. I’ve travelled for many, many years of my life, and going alone isn’t something I would ever let a woman do. Or even anyone in a bad area. 

She said “aw I feel bad bb, don’t wait up for me” , so, that’s exactly what I intend to do. Poe and I told her a week later that we’re getting an Airbnb together. 

Here’s the message we sent;

“Hey, Jude

Poe and I have decided we’re just going to rent an air bnb together solely because it just works out better for us both. Sorry about any inconvenience this may cause for you.

I know money’s tight for you, but this just works a bit better for us. I hope you understand;;”

She begrudgingly accepted this. 

I understood Judes anxieties over not being in the main hotel as cosplayers and such, she said she didn’t want me to have to drive her back and forth whenever she needed it... as if that’s a realistic expectation. We go when we go, and we leave when we leave. It’s a lot to expect from someone, especially when you don’t pay gas. Ever. When Poe and I hang out, he at least buys me a meal or something. She doesn’t do anything, and there’s a couple occasions that I’ve left out. 

After telling her all this and growing a lil distant(though that could be attributed to real life stuff, you know how crazy everything’s been) she messages and says if she gets her drivers permit she could room with Poe and I. But we’ve begun planning our weekend together for the con. It’s not like she hung out with us at all last year. As of recent though it’s become obvious that we’re her only friends... because she said so. Poe and I agree that we like her as a friend but not a roommate. 

All that writing and disorganized brain fart of frustration brings me to reddit. Naturally. I need unbiased opinions from random strangers who may not see the effects of this. 

This all has been eating at me. Absolutely driving me crazy. It’s bouncing around my head all the time, whenever I see her post or message I loose my patience more and more. I’m gonna go crazy from how angry this makes me. My foolishness to agree to room with her again in the first place, my blindness to all that she did to stress me out, my willingness to trust someone who’s blatantly ignored my opinions and input, who’s seemingly pretended she cares about what I have to say just to turn around and ignore it, to say “OP, I would never do to you what Mary did to us. We’re friends, I care for you.” It feels so fake, it drives me crazy. Every time she says it I can feel more brain cells die.  my life upon hindsight it feels like I’ve befriended the shittiest people I could find, and to continually give them second chances time and time again. My blind forgiveness, while it has helped me cope with some things in my life, is causing me more and more stress to the point where I’m even questioning my own moralities. Am I wrong to hand out forgiveness? To me it means I’ve accepted what’s happened and moved on, but perhaps I haven’t accepted it. I mean, it’s been 6 months and I’m growing weary from stressing over Judes bullshit and real life matters. On one hand, I’ve never been confrontational. But I want to learn to stand up for myself and be true to how I feel. To treat myself with the respect I deserve and want from others. But on the other hand, I enjoy talking to her. We talk about conspiracy theories and she’s one of the few people I’ve met who sees and sympathizes with my perspective of things. I also don’t want to cause a rift in my friend group. I think I also just miss the Jude I used to know. But as days pass she slowly reminds me more and more of someone I cut out after she lost a very sentimental item to me and denied fault. I feel like I shouldn’t keep saying “okay, she’ll learn from this and we’ll all move on and be better for it” because nothing is changing. I feel like she’s becoming a bigger tramp with each passing day, and a bigger hypocrite. You’re not allowed to complain you’re broke, and can’t afford to take your dying pet to the emergency vet, and then the next day get an expensive perm and haircut. You’re not allowed to complain you’re broke and then impulsively buy tons of merchandise for a show you’re fawning over. Or how about getting a tattoo while you’re broke? And you can’t even chip in for gas whenever I drive you around, or even just buy my food when we eat at whatever dumpy fast food we choose that day. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to room with her, but how do I let her down gently? The next con is in 7 months. That’s more than enough time for her to get a job and scrape up the money, or to room with some of our other friends. I don’t want to loose our friendship or hurt our friend group, but this is driving me crazy. I’m so stressed, I’m snapping on people. This isn’t helping, especially with the added stress of working at a doctors office with the most paranoid man I’ve ever met. Am I wrong somewhere in this? I’ve grown up and have been left out so much. I know how it feels to be alone and left out. I don’t want to ever be the reason someone feels the way I did. But again, I can’t take this. The stress, whenever she messages me pretending I’m happy to hear from her. It’s come to the point where I’m considering just skipping the con, but it’s the only time I can see my other friends. Poe and I hang frequently, but I can’t take the con away from him since it’s his only local as well. I don’t know. Everyone’s giving me different advice and it’s come to the point of desperation where I’m asking a bunch of randoms for advice. I hope though, I can learn something g from you all. The internet sees people from all walks of life, perhaps some perspective is all I need? 

Oh, did I mention that when she called the hotel and complained about the service that she got a refund? Yeah. Poe got his money back and so did Jude, but what did I get? I spent hours sewing for her. Hours of manual labor. I got nothing, NOTHING. I’m glad she had a product she can enjoy but that was such a loss. She didn’t even offer to pay me. I took a jab at her and made a joke about it a few times and she shrugged it off. Again , I’m not confrontational.

Even just being with them makes me feel lonely. I want to be their friend but I don't think they do even though they say they do.

This holds true with women, friends or anyone else.
The moment I begin to make myself TOO available, everyone disperses or ignores me. If I am at home, lounging around....I will get no texts or messages. If I am having an amazing day at work and am taking a client out to dinner, laughing, conversing and losing track of time.....I will inevitably look at my phone after we are done eating and will notice over 20 messages, phone calls or texts. It just never ceases to amaze me. Its almost like the UNIVERSE can tell when I am enjoying my life and brings forth MORE surprises for me.
I posted a video of myself working out hard with a guy at the gym a few weeks back. We were pushing heavy weights, enjoying the workout and again, losing track of time...
Within 5 minutes of posting that video onto Instagram, a girl who I haven't seen in 2 YEARS sends me a message on Instagram saying, ""I miss you...""
Where the hell did that come from??? She was one of the many people who also contacted me that day.
It just boggles my mind. Is it just because people are drawn to things they can't have? They seem to want you whenever you are busy living your life and not caring about anything else. Has anyone else noticed this? 

I also had a neighbor who would always ask me to play basketball with him when I pulled up at home from work. I never had time because I had to make dinner and meet my friend at the gym. This kid would BEG me to play. I always told him ""I'll see. Maybe.."" as I proceeded into my house to get ready for the gym. I lost my job one month and had plenty of time on my hands.I began coming outside and playing with him quite often. He must've gotten annoyed because it got to a point where I would open my garage to go play with him and he would cease playing basketball and run inside the house. Then I began ignoring him again because I was heading to work at my new job and he began asking and inevitably BEGGING me to play with him again. People are interesting creatures, aren't they?",25Mar2020,1

79,"I (18F) was in a friend group where one of the guys (19M) admitted to me that he liked the other girl (18F) in the group while he was drunk, I eventually told the girl since we’re pretty close but she told me she doesn’t see him more then a friend. He never confessed to her, she started liking his cousin (18M) and was verbal with him about the fact that she liked him. She never told his cousin that she liked him but his friends apparently made it visible. The cousin knew of my existence but never tried speaking to me till recently, he had mentioned me to my friend and then got in contact with me through social media. 

My friend who has feelings for him was obviously upset but she knew she couldn’t really be upset with me since I’m not doing anything wrong. I obviously would never go for him and I think it’s shady of him for trying to talk to me, but it’s kind of hypocritical for her to be mad since she did the same thing to our friend in the beginning. I don’t know what to do, I feel guilty for keeping conversations up with the cousin but at the same time I feel rude if I don’t and he doesn’t really “flirt”.",25Mar2020,1

My employer has somehow been deemed essential (it is most definitely a stretch, without revealing too much).  Other essential businesses in the area seem to be making every attempt at widening the gap between customers and employees (grocery stores using barriers).  My employer has done no such thing.

84,"So today my job had me meet with another woman who works at the school I work at for an interview. I was not informed until hours later that this woman has a compromised immune system. I feel awful and disgusted that our employers chose her to come to the meeting even though there were probably other people who could’ve been safer doing so. Worse than that I expressed this worry to my employer on Sunday and asked for help switching over to a remote system. (This job is brand new, I lost mine and was rehired in a different position all in the same day so Sunday was the soonest I could express this concern). Due to deadlines and the nature of the project we’re working on I was asked to do this interview in person and to switch to a remote system after this week. They have yet to provide me with the resources I’ve asked for and I’m currently researching solutions myself. I do not have Covid-19 to my knowledge and have been self isolating as much as I possibly can and we tried to maintain a social distance throughout the meeting. But I can’t help but feel like I may have unintentionally and unknowingly infected someone who is most at risk of suffering the deadly complications of Covid-19. Basically I feel like I may have killed her. I live in America where testing rates are disgustingly abysmal and our healthcare system is absolute garbage. I personally haven’t been able to afford access to healthcare for years. I can’t get myself tested and I have no primary care provider to call to set my mind at ease, but my anxiety about this is through the roof. I’ve been fighting off a panic attack since finding out. Here’s the kicker, I’m also supposed to meet with her again tomorrow so that the project we were tasked with can be done for a website launch on Thursday. I feel absolutely sick about the situation. What can I do? I can’t risk loosing my job. My food access and housing depend on it. I don’t want to risk her life. How can I put myself at ease and also find a way to keep her safe.

87,"In my town there is someone who runs a local web site. It has classifieds, news, weather, homes for sale, etc. Local business advertise on it. It also has message boards.

Of course now that there is a pandemic they talk about how stupid we all are for doing what our governor tells us. I have a family member being tested as we speak in NY. I am not in NY nor am I in one of the hot spots but I am in MD and we are taking great measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

88,"28 M. 
So, a couple months ago, I had the flu and was in bed for 5 days trying not to infect my wife and kids. During this time, I added my best friends gf on Snapchat. We have been best friends since we were like 5. 
We started talking and kind of flirting. I actually told her we should just stop talking after like 2 days because my wife is the jealous type and her bf probably not liking it. she said something like “or we could just not tell them” and one time she said something about getting herself in trouble and I asked what she meant. She said because “I might say something like I want do to bad things to you”. I know, I should have never let it get to that point and shouldn’t have been flirty back but that kind of really started it.. however, I played it off and it didn’t really go further.
No sexual pictures were ever sent, nothing overly sexual was said. By that I mean no graphic details or sexting.  However, one time she sent a picture of her and I jokingly replied “MILF”. She said “you would not”.  I said probably not, I just want to grab your ass one time. She lives in the gym and is really fit...
I felt stupid immediately. Ashamed really. The next day I suggested we stop again and she agreed. She said we never really crossed any lines... we were just talking.. it was fine but we were stopping.  She basically said let’s just forget it, She wasn’t going to ruin a marriage and friendship or a couple days of talking and “harmless flirting”..
We stopped talking that day. We haven’t talked in like 3 months.
Tonight, I called my best friend for the first time since. He lives in another state now. I’ve been dreading talking to him, I just could sense he knew something.
So anyway he brought it up. Said I was sexually suggestive with his gf. And I owned it. I told him it was stupid and that I was very sorry. I value our friendship and it was a huge mistake. I didn’t say anything about what she said or how it went there or anything because it’s not important. I fucked up.
It was flirty and said some over the line things. But it didn’t go as far as to send Nudes or sext. Some flirty “jokes” were made and I said that about grabbing her ass.
NOW, he said, “I have no intentions in interfering with your marriage but I am going to have to reevaluate our friendship”

But what’s weird is, my wife and his gf are friends and have talked a few times since this all happened and it’s not been weird between them. 
I feel the need to tell my wife. But I also go back to telling myself “it’s not like you sexted or sent nudes it was just flirty convo”.
My wife and I have been through some shit in our marriage and have separated at one point. We have been in such a good place I don’t want to fuck that up now.
It was really honestly just conversation while I was stuck in the bed for 5 days. I haven’t talked to her since then or even cared to. But I do feel like shit over it all.
How would you go forward?",25Mar2020,1
89,"I (f/30) met this guy (m/31). 
When we met I didn’t know that he was still legally married. I was told after they they are in the middle of separating (truth was they had just began). Me, being weak and drawn to him, stayed for 7 months. Only emotional connection at first, but then we fell in love. It was a deep connection. 

When I would tell him I need to leave for my mental health and sanity, he agreed, and then he would take minimal actions then to move forward with the separation. He never truly moved out of the shared house (which he pays for). He only moved into temporary residences over the last 7 months.  He did throughout that time take small steps toward the separation, such as talk to the kids about it, talk to family, mediation services, plans for co-parenting etc.

He wanted to cut off romantic relationships with me so he can focus on “doing it right” and ending his first relationship and doesn’t want to keep hurting me. I agree. Cause this was getting out of control. 

The complications and Cons:
- The wife has never worked 
- He is sole income provider for her and 3...yes 3 young kids! He makes steady income for one person but definitely not enough. 
- Not financially stable to buy or rent on his own on top of his 1st mortgage and refuses to go live at his parents
- Because of pandemic he is living back with his legal wife and kids 

Pros: 
- most compassionate, empathetic and caring person and the relationship itself is amazing. It’s the kind of bond and communication with someone I’ve always hoped I could have. 
- His family and friends know about the separation and it was in process...slowly...til jerk covid came 
- He is my best friend at the moment. We have been out of a romantic relationship for a bit now. 

My question is: 
Should I still talk to him and keep that friendship that we both enjoy and benefit from while we both deal with our separate lives? (it’s still a bit hard for me because I love him)

Or cut all contact and move on? 
(I feel like this is going to be the right one. I don’t know how long it will take for him to be in his own place and settled)

It’s been a very complicated situation to say the least. I know separation/divorce can take a years. So please try not to judge. Now I would like some advice from people who aren’t biased (my friends). 

Thank you!",25Mar2020,1
90,"for most of my life i’ve been scared of death. at age 10 was when i started realizing that one day i would die. i didn’t understand it that well, but i was scared. this is partly because around when i was 7, my mom would threaten suicide constantly. it was a dark time in her life, but gladly she’s much better and happy. however, it has affected my view on life tremendously. at age 12 i started having panic attacks about death. it was bad, so bad, i’d pace around the room and cry for hours. this wasn’t very common, though. id have a bad week where death is all i think about, then i’d forget, then it’d return. i thought that maybe someday i’d just get over it. i didn’t. i haven’t been crying about it though, i’ve just been feeling empty and meaningless. almost every fucking waking hour i’m thinking about the fact that i will die. i tried to get into meditation and the idea of some type of happy ending but.. there is no happy ending. the idea of heaven overwhelms me because i dont understand it. how could you be happy in a fake world? what would it be like? i personally believe in the idea that you just cease existing, entirely, time is nonexistent, it’s an eternal sleep. no dreaming. which i guess, i wouldn’t really know it happened. but i’m not ready. i never want it to happen. oh my god i’m so scared. i’m so scared. i don’t even think there’s anything that anyone could say to comfort me. i’m disgusted. i’m scared. i’m shaking. please help. if anything, please at least talk to me, be my friend. i feel empty, so empty, I’m losing my mind.",25Mar2020,1

I am the type of guy where if something negative happens to me, it’s all I think about. I haven’t gotten an MRI, and I am waiting for doctors that specialize in echo readings to look at my echo I had taken today to see if I need to go get an MRI.

94,"So I have two younger siblings that live with me, the older one(6f) and the younger one (1m).  I love them a lot.  That's not to say that they make my life much more hectic.  However, I had basically eight years of being an only child, and I won't lie, sometimes I miss it.  I love my siblings so much, but it's really difficult to connect to the older one.  Whenever we play, it almost always leads to me getting hurt or having my stuff broken or fighting in general (no shouting or physical fighting on my end though).  I guess I just enjoy self-time and peace and quiet too much.

**The Conflict**: My mother was talking about how much she wanted another child, but most likely wouldn't have one.  I told her that to be honest, I wouldn't be too happy if she had one more.  We're starting to have some financial issues where both my father and her are considering declaring bankruptcy (we don't have to worry about there being no food on the table or not having a roof over our heads, it's not THAT bad though).  Plus, like I said, I enjoy the quiet and tame moments I can get.  I would never resent the child or be mean to it or my mother.  In fact, I didn't really care much for when she was pregnant with the youngest sibling, yet now I love him to shreds!  I just cannot imagine how busy and tiring to have another kid around. 

My mom brought up the fact that I struggle to bond with my sister and asked me if it was that hard to play with her.  I obviously said no.  She then said she thought I was a mean person because of this.  That... hurt.  She then accused me of thinking that my family is a burden to me.  Of course I don't think that, but I get really anxious when put this type of situation and was too shocked to respond.  I just left after that with her angry at me.

Am I mean for not wanting anymore siblings?",25Mar2020,1
95,"
This is probably going to be a little fucked up, mostly because I can’t decide how I feel about this.

I’ll start at the beginning. My former roommate moved out about 2 weeks ago. Since then I’ve been living with this new girl. I don’t know her, we’re still getting to know each other.

She had this troubled relationship with her ex and I heard a lot about it. I could sense it wasn’t over because she wouldn’t shut up about it. Classic behaviour. When we met the first time I did ask her if she was going to have boyfriends over and she told me that she liked to keep relationships separate. I agreed, seemed reasonable and she looked like a trustworthy girl.

Fast forward to now, the whole world went into the apocalypse. We are in London if that helps. 
Due to coronavirus we are in total lockdown. Nobody leaves their homes. 

Apparently she re connected with her ex boyfriend and they started seeing each other again (called it). One night he came and he never left. He’s been living with us for a couple days now. 

I never agreed to that. She never even asked me. And when I asked her how long he was going to stay with us she said “I don’t know, a bit”. 

But there is a little bit of context here. She told me that basically, his mom is a nurse, working at the hospital and he has been out a lot in the past days and doesn’t want to risk infecting her. Plus, apparently, some relatives came to visit him, and then lockdown went in place and they got stuck at his house, literally not leaving space for him.

My first thought was to devise a strategic plan to make him evacuate my property because I don’t want to share the house with the unknown boyfriend of a unknown roommate. Especially after we agreed that would be happen. I understand that the virus thing though is creating unfortunate situations everywhere in the world, and not only in my little world.

So I got thinking, maybe I should just endure. Until this passes. It’s the right thing to do. But what if after all of this goes away, what if he grows accustomed to staying here, and basically he just moved in with us? 

I spoke with him. Is a crazy nice guy. He’s taken interest in my life, he bought food without asking for anything in return. He plays call of duty.
At the same time, he has no right to cook in my kitchen. Or store food in my fridge. Or play with my PlayStation, occupying my tv when maybe I want to use it.

But the crazy part is this.

About a month ago a posted right here, on this sub asking for your help. I said that I didn’t have any friend. That I was feeling lonely and I couldn’t make new friends. I wrote about how difficult for me it is to make new relationships, and I couldn’t figure out a way to break that wall. I said that I was feeling sad, and lonely, and angry.
Felt like the world was literally rejecting me because si couldn’t find anyone I could enjoy time with.

What if, this is my chance? 

What if, this guy and my new roommate could be my friends? What I was presented with a chance to not spend a lot of my time alone trying to find new people to connect with? What if people like those are in my living room right now and I’m here devising a plan to get rid of them, but it could be nice?

It came to a point where I felt it was absolutely necessary to explain myself to her in writing, or I would’ve lost my mind. I wrote and organized my thoughts into a letter that I will never send.

I keep telling myself that I should move on because I know I should. But it’s like a mental prison. I’ve hated myself almost every single day because of my actions. Even though I know what I’ve learned from my mistake and have learned how to not make the same mistakes, I still can’t move on.

109,"There isn’t much backstory but about 3 years ago I was quite close with this girl we saw each other once a week for maybe a year. She had schizophrenia, depression, anxiety not really sure if that’s relevant and we basically talked about our problems together. At some point she stopped coming to the club and I never saw her. I remember this one time when she first gave me her number she wanted me to call but I was too scared so I never did and for the last two month or so I’ve been thinking about her everyday and I’m desperate to talk to her again but I’m not sure if I should call or if she still has the same number",25Mar2020,1
110,"So my Koi fish, Sasuke, jumps up out of the water kind of frequently but never super high just like part of his body at a time. i was saving up to get a bigger tank for him, (I had a 20 gallon for a Koi, Sasuke, and a Goldfish, Pat)  however while i was at work i got a haunting message from my roommate saying “where is sasuke” and i was stunned. i didn’t know how to answer so i told him to look around the tank and he was laying on the ground. My roommate said when he put him back in he was still for a while, then swam around really fast and frantically and tried to jump out again and hit my roommates hand. my roommate taped some cardboard boxes to the top of the tank and waited for me to get home. (it had no lid on it at the time) 

After i got off work i decided it was time to buy the big tank since i considered this a cry for attention so i got a big 40 gallon, set up the water and everything and transferred them to the new bigger tank with a lid and an LED and everything. i even got the fish a new big log toy for them to swim in and everything. 

However sasuke doesn’t want to eat and he doesn’t move too much. My friends are considering that he might be dead but Sasuke still moves around every now and then, reacts to me touching him with his net, and moves his mouth like normal. However he is very strange. He doesn’t eat, he stays in one spot for a very long time, and when he does move, he bumps into things often. 

I’m concerned he is blinded or brain damaged in some way. I don’t know how to tell if he is suffering or if he needs time to recover (it’s been 36 hours since he jumped out and he mostly just hides inside the log) and i’m just really sad and concerned and i have no idea what to do at this point other than wait to see him float at the top of the tank.",25Mar2020,1

115,"I don't know where else to turn to yet. As you know, many colleges and universities have been impacted by our social distancing measures.

Unfortunately, I'm stuck in a situation where I cannot get the support I've supposedly been offered.

The university announced that if you can work from home to start doing that. If not, unless you are ""essential"" do not go to work and you can get 10-days of paid leave to help out. Safety seems to be the priority, especially for students. I work for a dorm on-campus. Additionally, I'm in a state that is locked-down, so all ""non-essential"" places should be shut down (not sure if that's relevant here)

Our boss, let's say Michael, offered anyone the chance to change the schedule, so essentially you can take yourself off and stay at home. I immediately did that BUT he claims his boss, let's call him John, doesn't know if we fall into that criteria, meaning if you don't work you don't get paid. 

I contacted my HR department who told me specifically: ""Student workers who do not perform core functions and essential services, are not reporting to work, and are not working from home."" And they said you could get the leave starting immediately.

Michael comes back and says, ""it's not as simple as what HR said. We're still having meetings with John.""

Subsequent HR emails only loop back to Michael as he is the only one who can approve the leave.

I've also emailed our ethics/compliance office regarding this matter and awaiting a response. It's been a week and a half and: a) no answers, b) students are still actively working DAILY, and c) the students have even asked John who keeps stonewalling them by saying, ""I don't know.""

Finally, today the university president states ALL student workers will be paid throughout the rest of the semester.

Guess what? Nothing has changed after that. Michael said that John said we are technically not student workers (WHAT?!).

I am a student. I pay bills, including a high rent payment. Most of my staff (I'm senior) is poorer than other students. I feel that entities are taking advantage of loopholes, so they don't have to send home workers or pay workers who aren't working. Or they're gravely misinformed and not willing to do anything about it. I'm fearful that they're putting student workers at an unnecessary risk of exposure.

It's like we're not treated as students at all, but we have 15-25 student workers. Is there anything else I can do?",25Mar2020,1
116,"One of my best friends has been on and off cutting herself for the past year or so. It stopped for a few months, and by the time I knew about it she wasn't doing it anymore, so she never got professional help. She's finally going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist because her parents found out that she's really depressed and passively suicidal, but the self-harming has gotten worse in the past few weeks, to the point where it's almost a daily occurrence. All of her close friends know about it, but we don't know what to do. She thinks she's fine and doesn't need help, even though she could easily tell her therapist about it.

Her main issue with telling someone is that she doesn't want her parents to either hate her or stress out over her. With the COVID-19 pandemic happening, her parents are really freaked out because her younger brother has a chronic lung issue, and if he caught the virus would most likely be hospitalized at best.

I see this girl as a little sister, and I would do anything to help her. I'm just not sure how to go about getting her help, or respecting her wishes and waiting it out. She's due to get meds for depression in a week or so, but since both her therapist and psychiatrist have no clue about her self harm, she's (me too) worried that they could make things worse.

She really thinks she's fine and isn't worried about her cutting because it's not getting worse, and doesn't want her parents to know she's self harming. I've tried everything to get her to talk to her therapist or psychiatrist or family and let them know what's happening, but she adamantly refuses. I'm at the point where I'm super worried, I have no idea what to do, and none of the other people who know have any idea either. Thoughts?",25Mar2020,1

123,"So I have a ‘friend’ who is living/renting at my former place. I had bought this place with my now ex, but was living there on my own after he moved out. Paying the mortgage on my own was starting to get tough, when all of a sudden I have this friend who says they needs a place to stay and want to possibly rent a room. 

Long story short I ended up moving out 2 months later as I couldn’t stand the state they were leaving the house in. I can tell you it was BAD. To put that in context the house is under my mums name but I pay majority of the mortgage. I moved back in with her as my grandma had come from overseas to live with us. 

They said this was all fine, but what it has resulted in is a nightmare of late rent payments (didn’t pay for 5 weeks once) and overdue bills which I have to remind them to pay constantly. 

NOW, with the Coronavirus situation he most likely will be losing his job temporarily which makes the chances of him paying anything even LOWER. 

This was my first time leasing to someone and looking back I could’ve done a lot better but they were a friend who needed help at the time so I took the soft approach. 

Anyone’s advice would be very much appreciated Thank you!!!

There's about 5 adults living in this house, and being under quarentine means a lot more water usage than normal.† Area is northern Midwest if that helps.

Could it just be that everything is finally warming up and the ground is thawing, so there's already too much water for the tank to handle? It does the water gurgling from the kitchen sink (when sinks not in use) mean otherwise?

Now the haemorrhoid is worse than ever it hurts so much that I can't even move my legs from a 90 degree angle lying down in my bed nevertheless walking or going to the toilet.  The weird thing is when I put pressure on the haemorrhoid area with my hand the pain goes away until I release pressure which brings the pain back. I use a cream called Anusol which kinda makes it hurt more (maybe false correlation or a good hurt i.e. the cream breaking down the haemorrhoid).  I suspect this is a thrombosed haemorrhoid but it hurts so much that I fear it could be something worse. Having my leg stick up in the air to be in the optimal painless position is extremely tiring also. I take at least 10 painkillers a day but they barely fucking work.

154," I'm based out of Los Angeles county and have been working at my current job for the past two years. I've been working with new managers since the beginning of this month and during a personal conversation in the office where both of my new managers were present, one chimed in and said ""alright that's it we're not speaking Spanish anymore because it's rude"". The coworker I was speaking with speaks okay-ish English, but he is an older gentleman and he is far more comfortable speaking Spanish when he can. I had always spoken to him in Spanish in front of my supervisor and my past managers and never received that kind of treatment and I want to know what the best way to approach this would be. I felt very upset in the moment and already didn't feel comfortable working with them because of political comments made here and there and this was just the last straw. I would like to get my supervisor involved, but at the same time I am afraid that I could face some sort of retaliation. Any tips or personal experiences would be much appreciated, thanks a bunch.",25Mar2020,1
155,"Hello everyone                                    
I'm not really sure whether this is the right place to ask for help but here goes.
Background:                                    
The grade of one course I have to pass is made up of the grade of one project. The project is supposed to be done in groups of three. One of the members of the group said he wasn't good at coding (Project is to implement something) and said he would rather write the report for the project which we have to submit with the implementation. We'll call this person John for simplicity.                      
This was fine with me as I hate writing reports and really liked the subject matter so I had absolutely no problem doing some extra work.             
We had to do a presentation 4 weeks before the submission date to which John did not show up, offering some poor excuse instead. The presentation went well so we didn't really mind it. He said he would still work on the final report. It's important to note that the instructors took note of his absence.              
We had finished the implementation 4 - 5 days before the deadline and informed John. He said he was working on the report. A day later he said that he would not be helping with the report and that he would drop the course.
                       So I had to write the report myself under a bit of a time pressure. We also informed the instructors of John's behavior 3 days before the submission. I finished the report on time and wrapped everything up and we submitted our project's code and report.                            

Problem and current situation:                 
A month later we get our grades and it turns out that we get an F. According to the instructors the project itself was perfectly fine, however because we surpassed the number of pages (12 pages max) for the final report we get an F. Our report was 21 pages. What ended up happening is, that under the time pressure I did not notice the limitation on the number of pages.                     
I tried discussing this with the instructor and explaining that we were under a lot of pressure due to John's behavior and that we just did not notice the page limit. The instructor's response was that we informed him too late of John's behavior and that the grade will not change. His communication was also really impersonal and dismissed any arguments on my part relating to amount of work or time I put in this project. He just straight up did not address my points regarding these issues.                                                   
Needless to say I am incredibly frustrated and annoyed as I wasted a lot of time on this project and could have used that time for other courses. Other than that I feel that it's really unfair as I worked really hard and in the end I don't even get to pass the course due to formalities i.e. number of pages in the report.                     
I found the decision really unreasonable and asked the instructor to put me in to contact with the professor responsible for the course, basically his boss. He told me to contact the professor directly.

My questions:
1. Am I being unreasonable here?               
2. How do I navigate this situation? I asked the academic advisers for help but they basically told me to talk to the instructor which wasn't really helpful.          
3. How do I communicate this to the professor? I am really nervous and doubt that he will side with a student over his assistant.
               
I sense that the instructor is really annoyed by me but I really feel that an F does not reflect my work or the time I put in to this project whatsoever.                    
I would be really grateful for any advice on how to approach this.                 
Thanks in advance.",25Mar2020,1
156,"I work as a staff development nurse. In short, I train new nurses and provide education. My boss has asked me to travel to Washington (several states away) for a week to onboard new nurses and provide education. I feel that this work can be done remotely or that the facility could find someone internally to do this. Due to the current number of states in lockdown and with all of the social distancing for covid-19 I don't think I should be traveling through 4 airports over 10 hours and leaving a city that only has one confirmed case to a city that has 100's and a facility that has active cases. If I were to catch the virus there unknowingly I would be spreading it to my community and to people in the airports (there are a few layovers to get there).

157,"So I’m 18 and still in high school living with my parents.  I’m in a medical state.  I started smoking casually with some friends about 3 months ago; at first it was once every two weeks or so, then it became 1-2 times per week.  I smoked twice before school and right before spring break I was smoking every weekend.

I bought my own supply (about $70 worth of stuff off Amazon and $70 in bud and edibles).  I would never drive high myself, but I would ride in the car when the driver was high, which probably wasn’t too smart.

Anyways, I enjoyed it a lot and it kinda got me in with a new crowd of more popular people, gave me something fun and exciting to do on the weekends, and was all around just a nice change in my life.  But it did kinda fuck me up emotionally for a while because I kept on second guessing if it was the right thing to do or if I should quit.

I was worried, and still am, about how if I got caught I wouldn’t be able to go to college (and I’m pretty smart and am going to a really good college), or that I would smoke myself stupid.

Well word got around to my brother, and when he heard that I rode in cars with high people he said he was going to tell my parents.  I tried to negotiate but he ended up telling them and they got my entire stash.

They brought up some good points about how you can smoke yourself stupid, I wouldn’t go to college if I got caught, I could get addicted, or how it can be a gateway drug, and I at least partially agree with all of these points.  I haven’t smoked now for a little over a week and I don’t feel any physical signs of withdraw, and I don’t feel like “oh I need to get high.”  BUT I am pretty sad/frustrated over what I lost.

I used to go out all the time to hang out/party/smoke.  Now all of that’s gone.  I was looking forward to having some nice house parties and kick backs over the summer but now that’s all gone too.  And I’m back into my depressed/emotionally unstable state because I can’t decide if I should quit or just keep smoking.

Thing is, if I continue, it’ll be damn near impossible.  My brother can’t know I’ve started again, and there are certain friends that I see at school that’ll tell him; if anyone says anything to my brother or these friends, the whole thing goes up in flames.  And even if I did start again, what’s the point?  It’ll be a decade before I am allowed to spend the night at a friend’s house or have people over for more than a couple hours.  My parents have even permanently banned me from hanging out with certain people they deem to be “bad influences.”

So, with all that taken into consideration: should I stop smoking weed?",25Mar2020,1
158,"My car burned last month. I had no insurance on it (I know stupid move) I still owed 3,000 dollars on it at the bank because I kept refinancing it when I’d almost get it paid off. I have no idea how it burned. I talked to the bank and they came out and took pictures of it and said I “wouldn’t be in trouble” as long as I kept making my payments. Well I lost my job and I’m not going to be able to make the payment this month. The car is gone ( the bank told me to give it to a local towing company who hauled it off for free if I just let them have it.)

Now I’m afraid that since I’m not going to be able to pay this month and maybe next (I had missed payments before, I was behind when it burnt and they let me pay some interest and catch up) that they will try and say I burned the car and charge me with arson and destroying their collateral.

Sex with my bf is ok and he tries really hard, but he just isn’t as good as I’ve had and is not kinky at all, doesn’t last terribly long either. When I was a teenager I had a bf who was a very compatible match sexually, but not for a long term relationship, sometimes when I talk to my ex he gets on my nerves. He’s been in and out of my life for the last 25 years.

He said he was thinking about me the first time he got married (I ended our original relationship) and he never got over it. Well maybe he did. He got married again when we were out of touch for several years. He seems to be happy with her in most ways, except sexually. I refused to sleep with him when I was single the first time he was married, because I felt like it was wrong. He never loved her but married her because she got pregnant.

163,"So, i'm a 16 year old male and for basically my entire childhood I saw my dad as the mean judgmental guy with anger issues. He knew how to ruin any event by screaming at either me or my siblings. We went to south carolina when i was maybe 12 and within 5 minutes of getting in the cabin he put everyone in a bad mood, it's what he did best. He would also hit me with sticks, wiffle ball bats, his hand, paddles, etc. when I did something bad. He would make threats like ""if you dont shut up im you wont be able to sit for a week."" And i remember one incident where he was super fired up and my mom was holding him back and i heard him say to her ""oh my god im going to kill him."" Basically, I thought my dad hated me. Well, for the past year or so he has been kinda nice to me. It feels really fake though like he is almost forcing himself to be nice because that's what my mom wants him to do. Whenever he sees me he says in a high pitched sing song voice ""hi (my name)!!"" And im just like ""hey"". He hugs me before bed now and he claims a lot how he has ""gotten better and used to be worse"". He does still have his outbursts sometimes but they're less frequent, I anticipate another one will happen someday for sure. Also, as i'm writing this i'm making an observation, he stopped all his bullshit when I got extremely depressed and my mom took me to see a therapist. I feel like maybe he knows if he explodes and i tell my therapist about it he is fucked. So, maybe he is trying to be super nice to make me forget about it all. Idk what to do with this because i feel like maybe my dad does care about me and I feel really bad when i ignore him now even though its really hard for me to connect to him. I am also kinda scared to get really close to him because I know it will be very awkward when we get in a big fight again someday and then the relationship is broken again.",25Mar2020,1

A couple weeks ago I resolved to start eating healthier and going to the gym. I started “feeling the burn”, and it was honestly so good for my mental and physical health. I started to like my body somewhat. 

I have cripplingly low self esteem. I fucking hate myself with a passion, not to mention my physical aspects, which are arguably worse than my shit personality. 

Anyway, I was starting to feel good about myself when **boom** Covid-19 comes and fucks everything up. 

I have very little to do, and the sheer stress of the fact that I’m on mandatory lockdown *with my whole fucking family* until *at least* the 23rd of April is making me anxious as hell. 

I’ve started to eat a ton. A shit ton. I won’t stop. I try brushing my teeth and popping in my retainer to deter the urge, but it doesn’t help. I have eaten so much shit today, I feel so terrible about myself. My debilitating fear of vomiting prevents me from doing the obvious.

171,"My girlfriend has been living on her own for 4 years, and she has loves the independence that comes with it.

Her 2 sisters (23&amp;26) still live at home, and are very happy living with their parents. They have never experienced independence from their parents other than college, and don't know what it's like.

With the COVID-19 outbreak, my girlfriend got laid off, and her parents want her to move back into their house (they constantly try to find excuses for her to move back in), and are insulted when she tells them she wants to continue to live alone. She said that she would love to still search for a job and try to get by. They always reply with things such as ""you would rather suffer and pay your own bills than move in with us?"" They also call her careless for wanting to still work despite risking getting the virus (she wouldn't be living with any elderly or vulnerable people, so if she got sick she would quarantine.).

We have a few questions;

1. Should my girlfriend still try to find a job because she loves the city, doesn't want to live 40 mins away from her life in the city, and doesn't currently live with anyone who could be harmed by the virus?

1b. If so, how does my girlfriend convince them that she wants to live alone? Not because her family 'did' something to her or anything along those lines, but because she loves the challenge of independent life, and without that she gets bored. She loves city life and doesn't like the suburban lifestyle.

2. Should she give up her (ridiculously cheap and rare for the location) apartment to move back in with her parents until it all blows over? This would include her seeing me a hell of a lot less (every couple of weeks).",25Mar2020,1
172,"Context: 21F USA, in community college for nursing pre-reqs. I live with my dad and stepmom.

I can flip between apps (reddit, mobile games, instagram, snapchat) for 14 hours, multiple days in a row. Procrastinate on studying. I give into food impulses easily (typically \~25 BMI, which is fairly 'average', but it's not the life I want to lead). I'm in a nevermet LDR going on a year and always fail at breaking up (too many details will make this post unreadable), can't do what is required to lose feelings for someone. I eat the snacks from his care packages way too damn fast. I am lazy about washing my face, brushing teeth, and taking supplements. I take forever replying to certain texts. Never finish books. Generally, my head isn't on straight.

I have socially isolated myself since I was 8. It started as being silently nit picky about people and not inviting them over. As years progressed and I was behind my peers socially, it was too difficult to plunge back in. Cue paranoid social anxiety. Senior year, every single lunch was spend in the library/music room/roaming hallways because didn't even have acquaintances to sit with in the cafeteria. I was in a band for 8 years and we even rented a house together for a year, and I still don't feel confident in those relationships because I had this anxiety blocking me from being real the entire time.

I am too prideful, self-righteous, impulsive, lazy, sometimes pretentious. I want to be real. I want to be productive. Not Tai Lopez 'hustle porn' productive. Just, 'leading a true life' productive.

the feeling's even worse when she yells (which is often, african parents lol), and it honestly makes me just want to get up and break something. usually if i listen to something calming after she talks the feeling goes away, but the problem is that it comes back again immediately after she starts talking. i've noticed lately that when she's talking i can suppress the rage if i imagine myself being physically violent towards her, which is not something that i want to do at all. i mean, she gets on my nerves, but that's a line that shouldn't be crossed.

I'm a 23 year old that just moved back home. Hoping to be out of here soon. The room I'm in currently doesnt have a door because my 14 year old brother (well just call him 14) took it off to put it on his office. (Not sure why the shortage of doors I think he ended up breaking one.) Its my OG door with my lock on it. I asked for it to be put back on my bedroom so I could have privacy. My parent told me that they would just buy me another one. (That's what they tell me to get me to shut up for the moment. This is a constant deflection they use. I need to buy a door myself, I know this.) My parent has told 14 he has autism but hes never been tested. I think he has bipolar. He is constantly one extreme to another and cant not control his anger. This might also be from constant babying and be the youngest of three. Hes never been grounded, punished, had chores or responsibilities. He loves ceiling fans and that's what he gets for xmas and bdays. Hes always installing and taking them out of rooms around the house. Hes home schooled but has no set schedule of school of sleep. My parent is basically done parenting.

He will come in my room at all hours of the night taking my lights down and putting up fans. He wont leave, even if I act like I'm starting to change clothes.  He alwyas listens to my conversations or stands in the hallway right outside my door and talks to himself about me. He calls me all kinds of names, says things about me that I know my parent has said to him about me when I'm not around. Everyone keeps saying oh hes just a boy, and hes just being abhoy trying to bother you. But it's so much more than that.im miserable. He gets to do whatever he wants. Hes even thrown things at me and hit me in the face. I know if I hit him back my parent would kick me out or try to get me admitted or something. I'm at my wits end. I feel like I'm losing my God damn mind. What can I do? 
Like there was even a time he was in the living room and I was in my room and he started screaming and crying real tears telling my parent I was beating the shit out of him. I wasnt even around. When I'm not home he puts my dog in danger by putting it outside.
Hes always hiding and snooping. Please I need help.",25Mar2020,1
186,"About 6 months ago, two coworkers began harassing me regularly at work. This lead to an eventual attempted rape by both of them and I tried to go about things as if nothing had happened but eventually, after having to continue to work with them, one of them actually being a manager, I crumbled and had a breakdown and went on a medical leave of absence.
I have now been diagnosed with PTSD and take medication for it, I have anti depressants as well and therapy sessions. Despite all of the progress I have made, I am still not close to 100%. I never read about rape culture or feminist issues before. I faced so many stereotypical attitudes towards what happened to me once I came forward to my place of work with it. This included victim-blaming, slut-shaming and sexual objectification, trivializing my experience, and refusing to acknowledge the harm that was caused by the sexual violence against me. I will never be the same after this. I am being judged by the company because I did not press charges after I filed the police report. This wasn’t an easy decision and I could change my mind anytime. I am just trying to move forward from what happened.

Unfortunately, my sick benefits have run out. I am now forced to return to that place of work until I can find something else (I have been trying very hard!) Thankfully, both of the perpetrators have left the company, but a few of their close friends still work there and hate me now for accusing them of something so sinister. 

Tomorrow I have a call with my boss to discuss the plan for my return. My question for reddit is... do you have any advice on what I can do to make this process easier on me, especially now with my anxiety issues? Is there anything I can or should expect from the employer to make this an easier transition for me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",25Mar2020,1
189,"Trigger warning: abuse &amp; rape

Sorry for length and formatting but I can't really condense it and I'm on mobile

I (21f) am having trouble talking to my parents. I felt like we had been drifting apart for years now and have been trying to pinpoint what exactly my problems with them were. I finally figured it out...but I still don't know what to do with it...

I was in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship from age 14-16. My ex, T, constantly overstepped my boundaries, touched me sexually when I explicitly said I wasn't ready, told me he would kill himself if I ever left him, cheated on me, and cut himself in front of me. 

My parents didn't know everything but they knew something was wrong. They stopped allowing us to hangout unless we were at church or under direct supervision. I felt stifled so I didn't listen. We snuck around, and T leveraged that into making me think I'd get in trouble too if I told anyone about his abuse. He forced me to perform oral sex in his car, and would come pick me up from school (I was early enrolled in college so I could leave campus whenever).

Then one day I was sick and stayed home from church. When my family told T, he left and showed up to my house. I let him in thinking he would be there to take care of me, but he raped me while I was weak and sick...he took my virginity and it broke me. I kicked him out and cried for hours. I didn't tell my parents yet because I wasn't sure if it counted as being raped. I didn't stop him, I just said no but he kept going so eventually i just let it happen.

A few weeks later I broke up with him. Then I told my dad that T had forced himself on me. He asked me if he forced me to or just convinced me. I still didn't think it counted as rape so I said he convinced me. But I also opened up about the ongoing abuse. 

I of course blocked the memory because it all hurt too much to think about. But recently my current boyfriend asked me if i wanted to open up about what happened to me (he knew I'd been assaulted but no details).  So I told him all of this and he held me while I cried.

But I realized I have never trusted my parents since this because I feel like they didn't do anything to help me. They said I needed STD testing but never took me. When I started acting out sexually afterwards, they told me I was going to end up a teen mom (they never taught me about condoms or birth control). My dad said he'd beat up T, but never did. The church didn't kick T out and my family kept going....I stopped after a while...

I guess I just feel unsafe with my parents now. I have anxiety every time I stay with them and dont feel like I can approach them with my problems. I am still not sure if I'm at fault for any of this and I just don't know what to do. Talking to my boyfriend helped but I need more advice.",25Mar2020,1
190,"I met someone a years ago, though we didn't interact. Now, we're colleagues, and they have a grudge against me for some reason, I think related to a rumor I've never heard about until their friend told me. I told their friend the truth then that I wasn't even involved with the rumor and I asked who said it, but the friend didn't tell me. I messaged the colleague privately to talk out our differences, but they denied permission to DM them again and said talking wouldn't fix this issue. I feel like I'm out of options. The colleague frequently gets upset with me whenever I ask a question or disagree with them and it's getting increasingly hard to work alongside them whenever we get into arguments, and they keep trying to strongman me and rally others against me. I want to talk to our superior (there's no one above said superior) about this, but they're a self-admitted macromanager and I don't know how it would turn out. How should I settle this grudge?

192,"I’m insecure about my appearance. It’s not that I care about being “hot” or “attractive,” I just want to be thin. It’s a combination of wanting to be *told* I’m thin and petite and wanting to *feel* that way.

In spite of my thin desires, I’m incredibly confused about my feelings around thinness. Firstly, for some reason I equate being thin with being a girl? I have daydreams about being a a thin girl— specifically a short, petite girl.

I purposely post pictures of just my stomach or just my legs to hide the fact that I am a guy. I LOVE getting comments that think I’m a girl. My new favorite comment described my body exactly as a “petite little girl.”

Secondly, I really enjoy when I get sexualized by guys when I’m mistaken for a girl. It’s just SO validating and it makes me feel cute and thin. I desperately want someone to tell me to starve myself for them while demanding I send body check pics to for progress.

Unfortunately, I am nowhere near a “petite little girl” irl. I’m very much a tall boy that will never look like that no matter how thin I get. No one fetishizes guys not eating and even rational people don’t really care beyond a “that’s kind of sad” level.

I’ll probably never be as thin as I’d like to be. My BMI is currently in the 17-17.3 range (lowest 16.7) but I feel just as fat as when I was a ““““healthy weight.”””” Meanwhile, at least I can live out my fantasies of being a thin girl getting pressured not to eat online!

On a more serious note, I am stuck. I have compulsively lied about having any issues whatsoever when confronted by doctors about eating/weight because I’m too uncomfortable. I just don’t know what to do.",25Mar2020,1

Found in an old diary. Not sure what compelled me to write it as I've never considered myself a poet, but the bar was low so I'm happy with it tbh. I'm curious what people think, is it chilsish? Do you like it? Does it intruige you? How does it make you feel, if it makes you feel anything at all? Mainly I'm curious if is resonates or makes sense to anyone? Or can anyone guess what the story is here? I'd love an analysis on what you think each line means if anyone like random people's poetry enough to do that.

He has no symptoms either. Anyways, I have plans to drive down (which is about6 hours) in the next day or two to help him clean up house and buy some food/supplies for him.

He is my (19f) first ever crush - kinda hard to believe but  it is true - and I have no idea how to act around him.

204,"I was supposed to be student teaching this semester, that is, until the coronavirus hit and cancelled all of school. Now, I have months of nothing to do (since I intentionally quit my previous part time job to focus on school). I have applied at a grocery store and received a temporary part-time position. I currently live with my parents and have no large expenses like rent to worry about. However, I would like to use my time wisely and make money if I could. I was planning to move out after graduation.
Problem is: I am worried about putting my family at risk if I were to bring the virus home. Grocery store workers come into contact with many people every day. I live with three of my siblings and my two parents. No one has large underlying health issues, but my parents are 50 and 55. I do not live in an area that is being hit terribly hard with the virus (northern USA, metropolitan area); however, the number of cases are certainly rising. My parents are supportive of my decision to find a job, but I am having second thoughts, as much as I hate feeling unproductive at home.
Am I being selfish to take a temporary job to make some extra money? Or is this not a big deal, since many people still have to go to work (nurses, police, tradespeople) and interact with others?

205,"So...Here’s a bit of background/explanation. TL;DR at the bottom. Due to a certain virus that’s basically caused everything to close to prevent its spread. Me and my family have been stuck at home with not very much to do besides work from home for my parents and watch TV and play video games for me and my sister. Lately, I’ve been wanting to get into digital art and thought that now was the perfect time to start drawing digital art as a hobby so I could do something productive while stuck inside. My parents were very supportive of me and I told them that I would buy everything myself since it was gonna be my hobby the only thing they did themselves drive me to the local store to let me buy a drawing stylus (they also had errands to run, otherwise I would’ve drove myself). However, we had to order a drawing glove online through amazon as they didn’t have any in a physical store. My parents offered to buy amazon prime to have the glove be shipped faster while I would still buy the glove myself. I offered to buy both prime membership and the glove since I told them I would buy everything I would need myself, but they insisted on at least buying prime since they could use it to order things they needed. I reluctantly agreed and let them buy prime membership while I bought the glove myself but I felt bad because they bought a whole prime membership just to order a $7 drawing glove to draw with. After that my parents said I could use an older IPad we had as a drawing tablet since it rarely got used anymore. The fatal flaw however, was that the tablet was so old that it was still on a version of IOS that didn’t support the app/program I wanted to use (Ibis paint X for those wondering which is free). My parents and I tried everything to update the IPad to IOS 10.0 or higher to be compatible to run the program but nothing worked. We tried regular updating from the tablet, nothing, running the update from a computer, nothing, even wiping everything on the damn device (we backed up all pictures of course) but it just wouldn’t do anything. I overheard my parents talking tonight and they mentioned possibly ordering a new IPad or a laptop that has a touchscreen on it for me. This really bothers me because I don’t want them to spend any more money that they may need later due to what’s happening in the world just for a hobby of mine, but I don’t want to order a whole new tablet since Im currently saving up for a car to drive for myself and for college. I love so much how supportive they are of me and this hobby of mine and how they are willing to do this for me, but I really don’t want them to waste money they might need. What should I do!?

They kept it a secret for awhile but I heard when they were yelling. Nowadays I’m starting to focus in a little more. My family has fights, and then they pretend like nothing ever happened. My grandma has a drinking problem and is offensive, she has told me that when you get old nothing matters so she drinks it away. No one tells her to stop or tries to help her and we just laugh it off. My dad is selfish, and nobody tells him to stop. He yelled at me when I was young in a corner, I asked him to let me out of the corner, he didn’t let me out. He was way bigger than me, and physically forced me there. It was scary and I still dream about it. However no one got mad at him. They just pretended like it didn’t happen. I can tell my sister is depressed. My mom is also an alcoholic. We obviously have issues, so why don’t we be blunt about them? They all pretend that our problems aren’t here. And I can’t live to know that is what life is like. I am transparent. I tell it how it is, sometimes people think that makes me too tough or maybe an asshole, but I really don’t get why someone would hide their emotions. I get that their problems are their journeys, and I can’t solve them for them. But how do I get it to stop effecting me? 

I try to remain optimistic and active in the things I love, but not knowing if life is a genuine, stimulating thing makes me not even want to be alive.

I have thought about doing nice things for them. Like writing letters, making drawings, telling them why they matter to me. I have done this stuff before. But they don’t act thankful or happy that someone felt this way for them. They do a quick, shallow “thanks that’s sweet”. It’s like nothing means anything to these people

I just want to have a stimulating conversation with someone. I want the people around me to be happy and straight to the point. I don’t know why everyone just doesn’t say it how it is. I feel like that would stop the issues of bullying and abuse and loneliness. The world would be much more supportive and excepting. I may be tough and an ass around my family and friends, but my only goal is to see them smile for real. 

yes I get mad when my mom drinks, but that’s because I know it’s a tool she uses to hide her pain. Yes I get mad when my dad only thinks about himself, but that’s because I want him to be there for us. I get mad, I yell, I am a huge dick. I can’t even last in a relationship. Every relationship I have turned toxic because I myself cannot be true to my feelings outside of my family. Girls think I’m a toxic aggressive asshole. But really I’m a soft, caring person. I just can’t show that to people that are new to me.

Maybe people like this are hiding these feelings to protect their family, but what is the point of preserving a family that is dry to its core? What is the point of working for something that has no foreseeable target?

I guess my questions are:
Why do people hide their emotions?
And how do I unlock the genuine side of people? How do I take off their masks?
As well as, How do I open up to the people I want to care about? There is this girl, and I yelled at her because she tried to get in touch with my feelings. I feel really bad, but I am shit at opening up.

He's sort of been dragging his feet this entire time, going along with what I want to do and not offering an opinion of his own. 

The past year has been incredibly difficult. We lost our daughter to SIDS last year. Obviously that was really hard for both of us. I tried to stay really open about my feelings in hopes that it would make him feel comfortable sharing with me. It didn't. We still don't really talk about it. I've gone through her birthday and the anniversary of her death essentially alone because he won't talk to me. I understand that this is part of his personality that he can't help, I really do, but that doesn't make it hurt any less. This entire year, he's been so closed off, and I honestly wonder if he still loves me at times. I'm not getting any love or affection from him.

Recently, his family started talking to me about how they think something has been going on with him. I was kind of relieved that they had noticed, too, so I did something I shouldn't have--I looked through his phone. I saw that he had told a girl he was friends with that he had been really depressed because of relationship issues. When I confronted him about this, he told me he didn't even remember what the problem had been, and that he doesn't like to talk about his feelings. When I pointed out that he had clearly been talking to this other girl about his feelings, he said ""It's just easier to tell her than you."" What maybe hurts the most is that I've spent this past year asking him if he's okay, and he's just lied and said he is.

Here's where the title of the post comes in...this past year, I've had a guy friend online. He's been a bigger support to me throughout this awful year than my boyfriend has. I've started to develop feelings for him. I don't know if that's because I actually love him, or because he's been helping me through so many things and I can tell that he at least loves me platonically. 

Let me make this incredibly clear--I would NEVER act on anything while still in a relationship. I just don't even know where to begin when it comes to tackling this issue. I don't know if my relationship is salvageable. I don't know how I'd even begin to explain all this to my boyfriend. I feel so incredibly messed up inside. Any insight? Thanks.",25Mar2020,1
222,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I \[21F\] met him \[21M\] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",25Mar2020,1
223,"Hey, 

So my period is currently a week late. I took a pregnancy test two days ago and it was negative, but the test was really old and I question it's accuracy. My period is always on time with an average variance of 1 day, so very reliable (I use an app to track it). I haven't gone out to buy another pregnancy test yet because I'm afraid both of the outcome and going to the store right now. I've just been in my house for the past 10 days with my fiance. 

My question is this, if I am pregnant right now, how do I go about handling this? I'm gonna keep it, I just need to know what to do next. I'm terrified of being pregnant right now during these crazy times, but I have always wanted to be a mother. 

This could all just be in my head, but my period has never been this late before.",25Mar2020,1

I had an accidental (drunken) one night stand with partner A on November 1, 2019. It was also on or around the first day of my period. I than had sex with parter B (my boyfriend ) on November 11 and November 19, 2019. During the sex on November 19, my boyfriend ejaculated in me.

225,"Hi r/advice! I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to be posting this, so please direct me in the right direction if you know somewhere else I should be asking this.

I live in Butte Valley, CA. I work for an ""essential"" business as a Marketing Support Coordinator and Event Planner. Currently, I am scheduled to work two full-time days and three part time days. However, with schools and after school care being shut down I have had to pull out all of my resources and ask for TONS of help.

My son's father is helping out as much as he can, but he works for a Nursing home and his family is in the medical field. Needless to say they are overwhelmed with work and aren't able to be consistent care right now. Our usual schedule is week days with me, weekends with his Dad  - that isn't happening right now since his Dad has been working all weekends.

Last week the owner of the company I work for decided that it would be best to lay off my two other team members, and keep me on staff. He said because I mainly do our digital marketing, it's more beneficial for me to be kept on rather than to lay me off. Now, he did say that me bringing my son to work was not to be a daily option, but something that he was OK with. We also had a staff meeting last Friday, 3/20, where he pulled out the information about the FMLA Coronavirus Response Act ( [https://www.cda.org/Home/News-and-Events/Newsroom/Article-Details/coronavirus-response-act-takes-effect-april-2-expands-fmla-and-paid-sick-leave-requirements](https://www.cda.org/Home/News-and-Events/Newsroom/Article-Details/coronavirus-response-act-takes-effect-april-2-expands-fmla-and-paid-sick-leave-requirements) ). In this meeting he said that he is meeting with his Lawyers to file for an exemption to this law, basically letting us know that if that Law does take effect he can't abide by it and will just have to close the doors to the Company.

He has not provided an update to staff on this.

Yesterday, I had to say home with my son since I couldn't find anyone to watch him.

Today I get into the office and first thing he says is that he wants to meet with me today on what my week is going to look like. I let him know I can work today (3/24) and tomorrow (3/25). Thursday I will need to being my son in for the half day I'm scheduled and Friday is up in the air right now, but I'm working on it.

He responds with ""Nope. Can't have \[son\] in the office during business hours. I've done it before and it just doesn't work well. You'll need to stay home.""

Well.. That's different than what he told me last Friday.. I just respond with ""Ok, well then I'll let you know about Friday as soon as I know more.""

Fast forward to after my lunch break - he informs me that I need to sit in on a meeting with him and two of our other employee's because I need to be trained in their job so I can take over for them when they leave for Maternity in one month.

WHAT?! So now I have to handle the marketing coordination and now I have to be trained to handle all incoming phone calls, job leads, current job updates, etc.

I pull him aside and ask for a candid meeting. I let him know that I'm extremely overwhelmed with trying to figure out child care on a daily basis and I just don't know what my exact time commitment is at the moment. I ask if he would consider laying me off for the time being or letting me work from home some days..

Not possible. He needs me here for office/phone coverage, plus we have no systems in place for tracking online work from home.

Then he tells me that I need to either be here for the job I currently have, for the hours I'm expected to work OR I need to voluntarily quit my position. He told me the only reason he laid off my other team members is because technically he didn't have anything for them to do - I have work to do. So now, I either need to quit my job OR.... IDFK.

My son has sensory issues and ADD/ADHD, so he can be a challenge for people who don't know how to handle him - AKA my coworkers 17yr old daughter and/or 13yr old daughter like my boss suggested.

If this was for a week or maybe even two weeks I would be okay with them helping out, but this is at least for another month, probably longer.

I'm at a complete loss here. My Mom says to stick it out until he fires me (which he's already made it clear he's not going to do) and my Dad says I should walk away ""it's a sinking ship anyways"".

I want to have a purpose, have a consistent routine, be a part of something bigger, and plus free college and healthcare is nice. My worries are that I won't make it through basic or AIT. I haven't really worked out, because I'm pretty skinny and have always been happy with how my body looked, so I never really had any motivation. My recruiter tells me I'll be fine, but he's also somewhat paid to say that, right? Just looking for some honest advice.

233,"It's getting more and more challenging, battling the thoughts I am going through. My life seems to be slowly crumbling. I used to be a great manager of a restaurant for 6 years. I was paid well, and I was happy up until the final months of employment. I started when I was 15 and did so well, becoming a manager early into my career. I ended up falling in love with my bosses sister, who also worked for the company at 18. Flash forward, I am 22, my girlfriend and I break things off in November last year due to my inabilities to keep her happy. Work was hell. In January I attempted to win her back, but to find out she was now seeing someone from within the company. What hurts the most is this guy was a complete piece of shit, drunk, always late. Somehow due to his experience in the company I managed to always be second best to him, regardless of if I did everything and he was late, drunk, just a POS of a worker and person. At this point I went into a rage as I was second best in work, and relationships. Little mentions goes to this but I was squeezed out of my position after my girlfriend and I broke up, my boss (her brother) started fucking with my hours and just whole work experience, giving her my position and belittling and undermining all of my work. I ended up quitting February 7th after setting up a new job because I heard the guy my ex was seeing was coming into work and I unfortunately am small minded and would act on urges to ruin him, I had to leave for my sanity.

Due to this Corona activity, I am laid off from my new job! My life has taken a complete 180. And my mind is plaguing me everyday with negative thoughts, thoughts of my ex, I don't want to be in love with her anymore. I don't want to think about her anymore or the guy she's with. I'm actively trying to get a new job and I should be getting hired at a supermarket this week. Things have changed and I am just trying to be happy. The only advice I ask is how can I get her out of my head. She dropped me so easily and easily found this guy. Yet I'm stuck with my thoughts everyday, no matter how hard I try to get away from them. My only escape is talking to my few friends who relieve me for a temporary amount of time. I'm trying to meet someone new, no luck though.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading. Maybe I just needed to vent. I love helping people and if you would like to reach out to me I would love to hear from you. Thank you.",25Mar2020,1
234,"First of all I'm 18 (almost 19) and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Just to start off and say that I didn't think I'd ever say that I'm becoming depressed if you ask me 2 months ago. I want to say that I love my family and all but we don't talk about these stuff( asian family) My grandmother just passed away like 3 weeks ago and I didn't cry because we weren't close, but i cried like a baby watching movies. 

I think im just starting to realise everything and feelings that I've piled up and ignored. I'm studying a course which I don't give a shit about (software engineering) because I simply couldn't afford my dream career (pilot). I know that it's unrealistic and ridiculously expensive(100k usd, if directly converted from local money). This is why i chose a more realistic career path. Though my dad said he would support me no matter what I choose which is great to hear. But after almost 1 year into my college I'm becoming more unmotivated to study( which is fine coz at least i have ok results), my passion towards aviation has also slowly fading. I don't understand this. I used to believe that these 2 years of diploma will end so that I can start the ""real"" thing I want to do and currently I'm not sure what it is anymore, or if I even have any. What's worse is that I don't think I have any real close friend that i can share anything with anymore. I have a roommate which I can almost talk anything about, well, except this because it feels like he's too "" idk whats the word"" to talk about these stuff. He would dismiss it as ""oki"" ""k"" or a like, not that he doesn't care(ik he does), but he just doesn't know how. I had a friend from high school that I can share anything with, we still talk online but it's not the same anymore. Now, I think the main thing bothering me is relationship. I know that this sounds stupid but I haven't had any relationship at all up to all my life. I have always been too scared to ask women out because 1: Im a pusi, and 2 :my mum wouldn't like it. So, I've been watching some ROM COM lately because of the coronavirus and I'm a sucker for romance, after watching it I'd find clips on youtube about it which led to me watching a video about all the ROM COMs are fake and so it love. I've been able to hide my feelings all this time because I used to believe what relationships could be that is potrayed in some of this movies are too good( some are just ridiculous, Notting Hill). Hearing that all of it isn't real makes me realised there's absolutely nothing going on with my life. TLDR: idk if im becoming depressed bcoz of all the stuff thats happening around me",25Mar2020,1
235,"A few months ago, I alluded to the fact that I was qualified to have an ESA (emotional support animal) but my parents thought I was using it as an excuse to get a pet, since I have always had a great love for animals. So today I finally told my parents that I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety as I felt like they would like that I got a professional diagnosis, and explained how that qualifies me to have an ESA. They already knew I had been depressed and anxious for a while, but I felt better having medical confirmation. While at college, I had noticed my depression coming back full force and so decided to adopt a ball python for myself. This animal has helped me significantly, as it allows me to shift my focus from me to the animal, which then has me thinking ""maybe I should go help myself"". No, I have not violated any residence policies. 

I explained to my parents that my ESA was being taken care of by a friend for the time being, and that I would be bringing it home next week (considering my college has moved online the rest of the semester and I'm moving out). They said no. They said a snake would not be under their roof. They said they'd like me to see a counselor over the summer, and then they would be more open to it once I had moved back into my on-campus apartment. They also said my doctor's diagnosis wasn't the best as it was from my primary care doctor and not a psychologist, which just upset me more as the diagnosis still isn't ""validated"". 

So now I have my ball python and I don't know where it will be going for the next 5 months. I can't bring it back home. My parents felt like I was bullying them into saying yes, and that I had already made the decision for them (which is true, not the bullying part). However, I thought they would be more understanding considering the diagnosis, but they feel like I've jumped way too far from being diagnosed to getting a pet. I can't just leave him alone for 5 months. I don't know how else to tell my parents that I quite literally have him. They are under the impression that it is my friend's that I adopted it from.",25Mar2020,1

my mom is already very strict (i'm technically not allowed on the internet for recreational purposes at all, but i'm at a relative's house right now, and i've never been allowed to play video games at her house either) and she says it is to keep me focused on studies and life. peak performance is expected of me, and i'm expected to be helpful and above all never EVER complain (she gets very upset when i do). she's demonstrated her willingness to take even basic necessities away since i'm so restricted already. she's taken books i was reading away, my alarm clock (because it had access to the radio and music) and even forced me to sit in one room for hours on end with no stimulus after school until she got home. i'm even afraid to eat out of our fridge or pantry for fear of getting reprimanded.

it shouldn't have surprised me when she did this, but it did. when i got home from my dad's house this weekend, she'd installed an electronic keypad lock on my bedroom door. she says she won't let me in until i've gotten a job since my 17th birthday is around the corner.

240,"Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile. 

I was thinking of doing this on a throwaway, but fuck it. I'm 20 years old and I'm having trouble of how to be responsible and good in my life. I work full time and go to school full time online. I also moved into my own apartment with a girlfriend, who I plan on proposing when the time is right, and my dog. 

Now time for the negatives. I have adhd and I binge eat, especially with this quarantine. I know a lot people are going to think, ""just stop eating."" That's like telling an anorexic person to start eating, it just doesn't work like that. I did go to the gym, but I stopped being consistent because I was getting more and more self-conscious and I didn't know what I was doing. 

I've gained weight over the course of a couple months due to my lack of improper decisionmaking and binge eating. Adhd has also affected how I do in school. Before my semesters would start, I would go to the store to buy school supplies thinking I would be motivated to study, but as soon as school starts I'm turning work in late and half-assing assignments. Don't get me wrong, C's are passing, but I want to get good grades for the scholarships. 

I would love to be as good as my girlfriend. She is the complete opposite of me. She's very organized. She put all of her assignments on a calendar for each class, color coordinated, has turned in her assignments on time or early, and is usually ahead of the class schedule. She also has tunnel vision when she has a goal set. Physically shes the opposite of me too; she is underweight, due to anorexia, but we're dealing with it. 

I was barely doing schoolwork before the COVID-19 outbreak, but my school decided to have a 2 week ""break"" to let the students get sorted. During that time, I did get groceries, but I basically binged ate all of it. We're quarantined because my girlfriend had a fever and was sent home from work and we're waiting for the COVID-19 results. I also started playing my video games again, which has resulted in me sitting in my chair for hours at a time while I get up to eat ever half hour. 

Now school is back in session and I don't even want to think about doing schoolwork. I feel as if I have never had time to just sit down and do whatever I want. I grew up with a single mother who ended up having 3 kids with a deadbeat father, and I had to basically ""raise"" my brothers. I had no time to go out or play video games solely. I was the one to babysit while she was out working or even going out. Even during holidays or breaks. I've been working since I was 13, willingly, also under the table. I'd have a few hours to play games and do stuff, but I also had to babysit during those few hours. All I've ever done is work, school, and babysit. 

I have also never gotten to test medication for my adhd because the examination cost a little too much for my income. I did have a pre examination talk with a psychologist and he said I most definitely have it. I also heard that adderall does stop appetites, which I would definitely want to try. 
 
What do I do to get my life back on track? I want to start going to the gym, work out properly, eat healthy and not binge eat, start doing schoolwork responsibly and on time, and I want to be able to control my adhd. I also want to get back into reading, but every time I check out a book at my library I think I'm going to like I end up just putting it down until the due date. I've wanted to get everything back on track, but I have no clue how or where to start.",25Mar2020,1
241,"Alrighty. So about a week ago (March 13th) was the friday before I was going to go home for spring break. That Thursday, my college emailed me saying that spring break would be extended a week and that online classes would start on the 30th of March. I went home Saturday March 14th and spent the time expecting to go back to my apartment after about the 2 weeks they said we had off (my college is about 7 hours away from where my mom, dad, and step dad live) I was gonna come back to my apartment and then do my online classes while living about a 10 minute walk from campus. 

Unfortunately, as time passes my college sent an email saying the rest of the semester would be online, this means I can really be anywhere and finish the semester, I can be living at home with my mom and step dad (and see my real dad whenever I want) or I can stay at my apartment ~7 hours away.) on the 23rd of March my county (that my mom lives in) announced that the next day they would start a shelter in place for the coronavirus so I decided I'd drive back to my college apartment and get my desktop and the rest of my school supplies (I hadn't planned on staying home the semester so I didn't bring my school stuff back to my moms house) before anything got super super serious ie Marshall law. 

I am currently sitting in my college apartment bed realizing that I REALLY dont want to go back home. I've had some past issues with living I San Antonio mainly stemming from my life from 6th to 12th grade (finally cleared up senior year of highschool) and these issues kind of loom over my head whenever I'm back home. Anyways I've realized that with all these non essential business closures and shelter in places, my boredom when I'm in my college town, is FAR FAR different than my boredom in my hometown (where I live with my mom) in my college town it's just a general boredom where I feel that when my classes start back up online, I'll just do my classes, study, do homework and be on my way like normal. However, back home, I feel like this life before college kinda looms over my head and clouds it up even if I'm not thinking about it . This is one of the reasons I moved so far away to go to school in the first place.

Anyways I kinda don't know if I should go back home and tough it out or stay here and just tell my parents.... I'm not coming back home. The biggest issue with is that fact that if I'm in my college town, I don't have my own source of income, my mom had been giving me money to buy groceries and other necessary things. I could hope to get a job but with how things are going economy wise  I'm not sure if that would be easy

So yeah I'm basically stuck up on if I should tell my parents in not coming home or if I should go back home. The biggest issue being the fact that I have almost a looming depression over my head when I'm back home (that I went to therapy for 2 years for) Where's when I'm at my college town it's just a normal boredom.

Idk if this makes sense but I'm kinda just writing what comes to my head, sorry about that.",25Mar2020,1
242,"So I just moved into my first ever apartment. I've noticed poop/fart smell whenever I'm laying in my bed I mopped and clean the run and I keep smelling it.

I don't have anything under the bed. I also realized that the smell was only coming from the floor under my bed.I've mopped it and the smell is still there.

I just need advice on how to get rid of the smell or mask it so I don't smell it at all.

I planned to ask him to move out on April 1 and give him 90 days to move out. He would have till July 1st.
With the social distancing and everything else is it cold hearted to ask? He’s working from home makes good money, not going to lose his job from the virus outbreak. We also have no written lease and don’t have any agreements. Her lease is up in August.

245,"I apologize in advance because this is going to be really long and I am also really  bad at writing so buckle up. I am 16 years old right now and I live with my 18 year old brother, my mom half of the time, and my dad  and step-mom the other half of the time. My parents have been divorced for 7 years, and there have been a lot of problems since then. Im seeking for advice because I really don't know what to do at this point and I don’t know if I could live two more years with this so I know I need to do something.

This might be too much detail but I want you to understand as much as possible. My parents got divorced when I was in 2nd grade and we were living overseas because of my dads job. From what I understand, they got a divorced because my dad had an affair with a girl and my mom found out (or he admitted it to her, idk). Since then my dad had claimed problems had been coming up with my moms mental health, which affected their relationship, which led to his affair. My mom’s mental health has always been really bad, because of some family issues on her side of the family. This includes a lot of anxiety, depression, insecurities, and traces of what me and my dad firmly believe is bipolar disorder. Ever since the divorce she fell into a bad case of alcohol addiction and though at times it will mellow down, but most of the time, including now she will be drunk 75-100% of the time I am with her (its not like shes abusive or anything when shes drunk but it just sucks). My mom also has been mostly jobless after the divorce and has suffered big financial problems, and luckily (from what I know) my dad has been fairly well-off and pays for my moms house through child-support or something. The last bit of background I will give is that I think I trust my dad a little more than my mom because my mom has been known to assume illogical things and she has a lot of mental problems. For example one time when I was about 12, my dad was dropping me off at my mom’s house and before I got out of the car my mom stabbed herself in the area surrounding her eye with a piece of glass in hopes of calling the police and blaming it on my dad. Luckily I was in the car with my dad the whole time so I could testify that he did not do that. But I also do not want to not believe my mom because if she is being truthful in the things she just told me I need to do something and confront my dad. Ok, sorry this is super long but on to the current events.  

I have been staying at my moms house this week, and as usual, she has been getting drunk every night. She started complaining about my dad and I got annoyed and asked her what he has done that is so bad. She said that my dad has not been paying her mortgage for three months and she just found out through the mail (friendly reminder that through the divorce agreements he has to pay her mortgage.) She just found out in the mail and she is paranoid that he has been stealing past warnings about overdue mortgages for the past 3 months from our doorstep. Apparently when she tried to text and ask him about it he doesn’t respond, but she also said that he responded and made an excuse or something (she has told me multiple things.) Also, she says that when my dad was having an affair, he took out credit cards in her name in America. Other things she told me were that he threatened to take us (me and my brother) away from her, and I guess the girl that my dad was having an affair with tried to hack my moms Yahoo account. Like I said all of this could be her being delusional because my mom suffers severe paranoia and just today claimed her iPhone was getting a virus when her text did not send, but if these claims are actually true I need to do something. My dad is also a very well put together moral great guy and it is hard to believe these claims knowing him.

Side note I also want advice on how to help my moms mental health because she suffers through a lot of things and even is suicidal at times. I tried talking about her alcohol use just two weeks ago and she said she would try to stop but has not made any advancements.

Any advice is great. PM me if you want any extra info or something like that.

Thanks!",25Mar2020,1

250,"I need to do it now, I can't hold it anymore. I've known her since childhood, we lost touch for a minute and she showed up again during the hardest time of my life. She literally fixed me. It was her job but she really wen't above and beyond. I can't begin to explain how much she did for me before we even became close friends or started dating. I had some medical issues that bled me dry financially and I started saving for a ring the moment I got back to work. I knew she was the one from the go and I've been hiding that ring for 3 months now.

&amp;#x200B;

I started testing the water, we had an X-men marathon and I called her my wiferine. She responded amazingly at first and we mentioned marriage few more times but then she started changing. She was becoming withdrawn, lost in thought, I thought talking about the prospect of marriage freaked her out. Last night she came clean. She was withholding some things about her. I completely understood, it's not something you tell someone you've been dating for less than a year but she realized I would become her husband soon. She got in her head, she knew it was a nonissue but thought I would leave her cause she didn't tell me about it sooner. I assured her there's no way in hell I'm doing that. Also, quarantine. She instantly went back to her old self, I was reminded of who she is when she's completely, totally happy and now I want to make her even happier. So, how do you plan a surprise proposal to someone you're quarantined with? I want it to be big, special and memorable cause she deserves that.

251,"My dad [51M] recently lost his sister [43F] to a very quick and unexpected death after she started to go into multiple organ failure triggered by a chronic health problem she had for years.  There was about 24 hours between her going into the hospital with some abdominal pain and dizziness, and her passing away. 

It was a slow and painful death as she was gasping for air and wincing in pain for hours. Other than that she was unresponsive. She was not able to say goodbye to her kids [16M] and [10M] and it has completely devastated her loved ones. 

My dad, who is generally very guarded with emotions, and has never lost someone this close to him, is devastated and traumatized. He was with her when she died and it was incredibly painful for him to watch. He told my mom he has never experienced so much pain in his life than he has the last few days. 

Prior to this I had only seen him cry once in my life, but he has cried multiple times a day since her passing. He is completely heartbroken. 

He sometimes struggles with emotions in the sense that he doesn’t always know how to process heavy emotions, and I can tell this is torture for him trying to work through this. 

What are some good resources that maybe give some simple outlines/guidance on coping with grief and trauma? Maybe a book, or website. He definitely doesn’t like to be treated like a charity case, so I would probably keep it low key, but I do think he would like something to at least help him take a step in the right direction towards healing. He is not the type to want to go to therapy, but would maybe be open to smaller, less direct sources of information.

A colleague was also frustrated and asked why we couldn't do it online. My boss replied that if it was that important, he could set up the meeting online himself. But I feel this is my boss' responsibility to set up. And frankly, in this day and age, it's so easy.

Yesterday we were 8 people in a small office. Meetings cannot be held with proper distance. Even the desks are too close to each other. 

Yesterday he did the first online meeting, and decided to use Skype(?) and got pissed when the couldn't find two of us on it after 2 minutes. Instead of just calling on slack, that we already use, or hangouts. And he did this while the meeting was going on, instead of spending 5 minutes setting it up before hand.

260,"So this guy has been a family friend for years, since before my mom died. She died 9 years ago, so this man has been in my moms life probably since she was born. I don’t know too much details on it because he said he was a family friend, he named off my mom and my moms sister and my grandmother. Two of which are dead, my mom and my grandmother, I’m not too close to my aunt.

Initially how I got into contact with him was by accepting his friend request in Facebook. I just turned 18 March 23rd, I know terrible timing due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, this is an important detail because he flirted with me for months prior to my 18th birthday. I ghosted him most of the time, and only responded if he actually wanted to have a normal conversation because I didn’t want to make a big deal or start anything.

Below are the most recent text messages between us where he tried to pressure me into sending him a dick pic.

I wouldn’t have such a problem blocking him, or starting some kind of feud with him if he wasn’t a family friend.

What do I do? And with the messages, did I go too far?

I guess I can’t post a picture with this subreddit so I’ll just type everything.

Him: “you should send me a pic of it sometime.”
         “It’s your dick not his.”

(Prior to the start of the messages I told him I wouldn’t send a dick pic because I’m in a relationship and I would like to remain loyal to my boyfriend)

Me: “I’m going to refrain on that last one. I get what you mean. However to me personally, I would feel very unfaithful and very sad with myself if I did that.”

Him: “My friends and I send each other dick pictures all the time”
          “It's harmless”

Me: “It’s harmless but I’m going to have to decline.”

Him: “Actually kind of hot”
         “You need to loosen up a little and have some fun”
          “Your 18 now”

Me: “I will have that fun when I’m single.”

Him: “You are not married to this guy by next month or 2 he will history anyways watch”
“You are only young once”
“Have that fun”

Me: “You may be right, however that doesn’t mean I’m just gonna do it. I would hate myself if I did that right now, and when I date someone I kinda put the hoe stuff aside. I like being involved with 1 person, and feeling that it is mutual.”

Him: “Like you don't think he's not fucking around doing what he wants and it's not being a hoe it's called living life and having fun”

Me: “I don’t think he is because I trust him. You can live a life and not be a complete dick.”

Him: “You will see that I'm right”
         “I've been to this party and seen it many times”

Me: “I don’t care if you’re right or not. I’m not a slut.”
        “And that’s the end of it”

Him: “Why do you all ways think of everything  a how or slut”

Me: “And I’ve been cheated on before so you can act like I don’t know shit. Because I’ve been through shit that you don’t even know. And do I care if you are right or not, no because I’m doing my part and not being a hoe. I treat others the way I want to be treated, and if you want to continue to trying to pressure me go ahead. I’m not going to. If you cheat on your partner you’re a whore, period. I’ve been a hoe before, when I was single. So I’m not slut shaming unless you’re a taken person, which I am and therefore will not cheat. Ask me again when I’m single in 2 months as you claimed.”

Him: “Wow take a chill pill dude”

Me: “Okay boomer”

Him: “Relax holly shit so angry about nothing”

Me: “About nothing? Tell me more.”

Him: “What do you want to know”

Me: “nothing.” (I was kinda fed up with it.)

“AITA for sending my stepdad to jail? Hello strangers. If you haven’t seen how terrible of a person my stepdad is read the other post on my page first (Legal Advice). I’m writing on mobile and don’t know how to link stuff so don’t attack me.

I debated going to the police because my mom would probably never speak to me again. Have I mentioned that my stepdad is manipulative..no? Well he has my mom under sum kind of spell because she won’t believe anything I say. She went from my best friend to the last person I’d want to talk to.

Last week I got the guts to do it, knowing what would go down after. I wrote a letter to the DSS. Then just to be sure, I mailed the letter to the police department including the pictures. I’m not sure if I was suppose to do that.

Short story short, my stepdad was arrested Wednesday. I didn’t tell my mom what I did until last night at 9:00 (Friday) When he was arrested my mom almost went with him because she was screaming at the police officer and saying slurs. 😬 My worst fear was my mom hating me

My worst fear came true, she got REALLY mad at me. She kicked me out and I had to walk all the way to my grandmas house 4 miles away I’m still at my grandmas house right now. Someone said i should get a therapist, but considering the circumstances i don’t think my mom is going to pay for anything that includes me.

So, am I the asshole for putting my stepdad in jail? I mean I kinda see where my mom is coming from. She really loves him, and I would be mad if my husband was in jail too, but he NEEDS to be in jail. I felt uncomfortable with him in the house. And he was mentally abusing that girl by convincing her that a relationship between a 14yr and 42yr is okay when it’s not. I never want to see another person go through that Comment what you think   😔” 👉👈”

That’s what my post to AmITheAsshole looked like. I decided to stay with my grandma for 2 days after (Friday-Sunday). I went back to my house on Monday (yesterday) at 2:00 to get some of my things and try to speak to my mom.

When I got there my grandma had to convince my mom to open the door. I got in the house and I could barely recognize my mom. Her eyes were really red, and she had cut her hair into a terrible, really bad pixie cut. Just think captain marvel on heroine. She had really bad eyebags. Before I could really get a good look my grandma pushed me up the stairs to get my things. I got a toothbrush, most of my clothes, and 2 pairs of shoes, and my charger. Then I went to the bathroom to get my shampoo and my mom stomped up the stairs really aggressively. She came into the bathroom SPEWING threats like “im gonna f-ing kill you” “you ruined my relationship “ calling me wh*re and the b word. I started crying* my grandma came up the stair pulling my mom away from me. I got out of the bathroom started toward the stairs. I just remember falling and then black.

According to My grandma, my mom PUSHED ME down the hardwood stairs. My grandma ran down the stair trying to help me up but I was out cold . Idk how my grandma managed to get me out the house, but I can’t thank her enough. I’m pretty sure if I went in the house alone I would prob be dead and cut up. I woke up at 6:00 on Monday in the hospital. When I fell down the stairs I ended up with a broken leg and tons of bruises and a bump on my head. Hurts a hell of a lot. Still here.

So after that long story, here’s that part I need advice on. Can I press charges on my mom for pushing me down the stairs? What should I do?",25Mar2020,1

A few months ago I made a new google email for myself, and is the same email I used to verify this account on Reddit. I still have the password and login for this account saved, but I do not remember the password for my email. I have already tried recovery but I can not remember my password at all and it keeps coming up with ""Google could not verify this is you"" response. Does anyone here know if there is another way of recovering it or a way to find out what the password is?

A few more details: My computer's hard drive was replaced instantly and the entire system had to be reinstalled, meaning google probably doesn't realize that I have signed in on that account before on this computer, so it recognizing this as a familiar device where I signed into it is slim.

272,"My husband is 2000 miles away, dealing with a family member being deathly ill, and we're separated because of the crisis with Covid 19. 
I don't want to stress him out any more than he already is. But I feel so horrible. 

When I met my husband I was with another guy. A guy who took advantage of me in nearly every way possible. My husband helped me get out of that situation and he and I have been happy since. But, tonight my ex showed up out of the blue. 
Even though I remember how bad things were and the ways he would trick me, I still went out to talk to him. I feel so stupid. 

He started kissing me and touching me and I just froze up. I couldn't say anything. I felt like I wasn't controlling my body, and not even really in it. My mind just slipped off somewhere safe.
He ended up having sex with me. 

When it was over, my brain started working again, but it was like it never happened. I just talked to him for a minute and then he left. 

It seriously took until just know for it to sink in. I was just numb and acting like everything was fine. But, now my body feels so gross. I can't believe I let him to those things to me.

Because of the time difference, my husband is already asleep. I want to call him before he goes to work in a couple of hours, or when I get home from mine tomorrow night, but I don't know if I should. 

I feel so guilty and horrible and I want to tell him. But, I hate making him worry and stress. And I don't want the way he sees me to change because of this. 

I don't know what to do.",25Mar2020,1
273,"My mom is almost 60. Due to her heart issues, she’s considered a high risk person for the virus. Most of the people at her work have moved to working at home, and for some reason this convinced her that she should continue to work in her office building and continue with her normal day to day activities. The cases in my state are rising every day and me, my dad, and my brother keep pushing for her to stay home but she won’t under any circumstances. Her reasoning is that since most people in her office went home, that’s a better place for her to be. Wouldn’t this be more reason for her to stay home? 
I told her that there’s still a risk even with the little amount of people in her office. Her response was that “you’d have the same risk going to Walmart.” I reminded her that if she caught it she’d likely pass it unto me (20), my brother (20) and my dad (60) who has diabetes. It could also kill her. Her response: “it won’t happen to me”. Wtf? I love her a lot. She usually has great sense, but this situation has really thrown me for a loop and has me looking at her differently. The lack of awareness is disappointing. We don’t really know what else to say to her to make her snap out of this. She says she won’t move to home working unless the building shuts down. Her place of work has surrounding buildings shut down due to people testing positive, but I don’t think her specific workplace is planning on shutting down unless the governor gives orders to (which isn’t happening), or someone tests positive. We don’t want her to wait until that point. What are some things we could possibly bring up to her so that she stays home?",25Mar2020,1

277,"My mother is around 60 years old, and has COPD.  She is terrified that when she goes back to work that she will get the COVID Disease. She works in a children's hospital, where they are planning to put kids with COVID.  Currently there are less than 100 cases of Covid in the region I live in Canada.  The regional government is expecting around 15000 deaths.

She works the autoclave and sanitizes things at the hospital. She is wondering if she should go to work.

So the dillema is, to anyone who hasn't caught on yet -

1.  Does she go to work (""front line, yadda yadda), and almost certainly get COVID since the PPE is only allowed for doctors.  Her case would likely be severe, possibly fatal due to her age and pre-existing health condition.
2. Does she say fuck it all and stay home.

278,"Awhile ago my old friend told me that we had to stop talking to each other because of some personal stuff that I frankly don't want to go into here. They were really nice about it, and I'm in kind of a pickle because of it.

To make a long story short, they reached out to me to make sure I was okay, I'm not, and I told them that. They were, again, really nice, and helped me feel better.

After we talked I got worse, I'm better now, but I got worse. I asked them if they'd be ok talking over some more stuff I didn't tell them. They never really got back to me. More recently I posted some stuff that they somehow found. I'm not gonna get to specific, but it was enough for them to call our school, which lead to the school sending an officer to make sure I was okay. 

Now because of an officer talking to me, my entire family is pressuring me to tell them what's going on, and it's making me extremely uncomfortable. What I'm asking advice for is two things, what I should do about my horrible home situation, and if it's worth asking my friend to talk again, because I don't want to make them any more anxious than I already have.

279,"Ok, this is one long fucking story. Prepare yourself for whats to come. 
To start it off, I’m 16 years old, and I live with my dad and my little brother (he’s three). My dad moved to China when I was around 3 to earn some money; he had no custody of me and was required to pay child support. Anyway, he stayed in China for around 6 years. When I turned 9, he came back, and my mom let me live with him for the summer. While I was with him, she got charged and thrown in jail for substance abuse (she’s a lot better now; I see her every 2 weeks or so). While my dad was in China, he got married to some lady named Cindy. While he was back in the states, he was constantly working on getting her a permanent visa so she could stay here. He did this for around 2 years or so, and she finally arrived. Life was ok to my knowledge, and everything seemed to be doing better for me than any other time. But something shady was going on. My dad found pictures of some dude and her having sex in California (the photos had dates and location tracking). She had apparently been there for 2 weeks, meanwhile, we thought she was still in China. Not too great. When my dad found this out, his dad was dying. He didn’t want to get a divorce and go through a parent’s death at the same time, so he forgave her. Flash forward, she gives birth to my brother. When he was born, she demanded that we move to a bigger house to make room for her parents, threatening to leave if we didn’t. So we moved. Long story short, they hogged the baby. They wouldn’t let my dad do any of the parenting, meanwhile Cindy went out and did her own thing and hung out with her friends. They lived with us for 6 fucking months out of the year. For 2 years. They didn’t speak English, her mom was a bitch, and we could almost never do anything with Tommy (that’s my brothers name). One day, she said she had to go back to China to do some business (sell her house, cars, etc. This lady is mad rich). Tommy was not even 2 years old. They wanted to take him with, and my dad was ok with it because he didn’t want his other son to be disconnected from his culture. They left in March and were supposed to be gone for 2 months. April comes and goes, and we don’t know when she’s coming back. She ends up calling and saying that she’s not coming back and wants a divorce. After some calls with the 
FBI, her flight was intercepted and she was detained until her parents brought tommy back. They did, and it’s a huge mess. They went with the divorce, and she got rolled with custody every other weekend and holidays. It’s spring break. She has tommy. And to top that off, her friends (some rich doctors from Russia) are the first confirmed Coronavirus patients in my city. She’s never told the truth, she lives with another dude (it’s illegal to cohabitate with someone else while you have the kid), and I’m afraid that she’ll do something stupid. All I can do is sit and worry. I know, it’s not like she can go back to China, but say she moves across the country, or to another country, he’s gone. What should I do?",25Mar2020,1

So my entire states on lockdown, to the point that it feels like that even the city lights are duller, and it’s just weird. And I was bored, and so was everyone else. 

So my friends older sister and best friend are absolute mcrat bastards and I want nothing else but to fight them,  so I suggested we make a group chat, and we’d title it, “digital fight club” we both agreed. The rules were simple 

1. Don’t talk about digital fight club to anyone outside digital fight club. 
2. No overly and completely violent insults, like “I’m gonna kill yo, like a bird to a worm, mashing it’s brains out”

However she had insulted me many more times before that, so I didn’t think much of it because what could she prove besides us both getting in trouble.

Okay, so a bit of a backstory, I come from a very conservative and traditional family, headed mostly by a (religious) perfectionist mother. I'm not here to bash her, as I love her very much, but she is a very controlling and judgmental person. So being the only daughter in the family, I've always had what I say, do and think constantly observed from a close eye. My mother has offered to put me through university, and I'm eternally grateful. But I know that those years will constantly be filled with guilt-tripping, constant observation, and no freedom. I just want my FREEDOM. So, I want to switch over to an online university. It will cost 1/4 of the original tuition fees that we were about to go through and give me the freedom to pursue bartending (a path I always wanted to get into (btw drinking age is 18 in my country I just turned 20) and be able to support myself in a smaller town by the coast and away from my family. How should I go about this? I would give up anything just so I can take control of my life and pursue what I want.

“Here we go, first of all I’m really sorry for saying this message because I understand it isn’t my business at all and at the end of the day everything is your decision (as it should be) and I would never want you to feel pressured to do anything your not ready for or wouldn’t want to do. Basically, I think you should take it to the next level with (my crush). My reasoning behind this isn’t as simple as other people’s maybe. I think you guys should date because after you both have confessed your love for each other, things will NEVER be the same now that you know that both of you have feelings for each other. Things will just be really awkward because you’re not acting on your feelings. imagine if you won 10 million dollars from the lottery, you would never just leave it laying in your bank account, you would spend it or invest it right? Which is exactly what you should do for a relationship, invest in it and let it grow to something beautiful. My second reason why I think it would be a good idea is for the experience. Once you get to a certain age, a lot of people have already been in relationships and have already had experiences and learned from things that they might not be so comfortable to do with you as your first time. Many people aren’t even lucky enough to now that there crush likes them back, it is literally like winning the lottery. And I think we can agree that when you don’t act on things like that, you always asked yourself what COULD have happened if I HAD been in that relationship, what could I learn from that so that I have experience for a variety of things we only experience in relationships? I know this seems kind of ridiculous but we have to remember that these are important things to pick up as we grow as people and things that can influence us a lot in life. Lastly, I want to talk about the impact you can make to have a good relationship. Things are scary, especially love because we know it can make such a big Impact on our lives and our future. But, we have to remember that love is two sided, it’s not only about us but it’s also about the other person. Have you considered how (my crush) feels on the opinion of your relationship? Have you considered the benefits going forward? If your scared that people will judge you for your choices, don’t be. We are very lucky to have a supportive group of friends that has our back if anything goes wrong. And if your worried about ruining your friendship with (my crush)  don’t be. This is just the next natural step you should take, embrace the butterflies you feel in your stomach and let go of the future and instead, focus on the present and how your choices will impact your life RIGHT NOW. Embrace the feelings oh have for one another and be thankful you both feel this way for one another and grow on your relationship to grow closer to this person who is very dearly your close friend. For all of these reasons I think you should strongly consider taking the next step in your, at the moment, awkward but friendly relationship. Thank you for reading to the end if you have made it this far, I want you to now that I am NOT PRESSURING you to make these decisions, only suggesting what I think is BEST FOR YOU as a friend. Please consider my advances as I only wish but the best for you, and your future relationship with our close friend.

Sincerely,
-(my friend)”

For some context my crush and I have known about our mutual liking for each other for 4 months know. My friend has been super pushy about it. He’ll randomly send me texts saying “Hook up with him” and I’m not sure I’ve I’m comfortable with him commenting so much on my relationship with my crush. 

I can see why he would get annoyed because my crush and I haven’t talked about our relationship since we confessed but I don’t think it’s any of my friends business. I just don’t know what to do with my friend and my crush. So much has happened this past month and I’m not sure I can take much more change (even if it is positive) because I’m a person who has a hard time dealing with change.

293,"At my job, we're making video games. We could easily work from home with very little drawback. About 2/3 of us do. But we still get called into meetings twice a week. Meetings that could easily be done online.

Where I live, more than 10 people together is illegal. We should keep distance and stay home unless absolutely necessary. Work from home as far as possible. 

A colleague was also frustrated and asked why we couldn't do weekly meetings online. My boss replied that if it was that important, he could set up the meeting online himself. But isn't this my boss' responsibility to set up? And frankly, in this day and age, it's so easy.

Yesterday we were 8 people in a small office. Meetings cannot be held with proper distance. Even the desks are too close to each other. 

Yesterday he did the first online meeting, and decided to use Skype(?) and got pissed when the couldn't find two of us on it after 2 minutes. Instead of just calling on slack, that we already use, or hangouts. And he did this while the meeting was going on, instead of spending 5 minutes setting it up before hand. 

I want to talk to him about it, but unsure of my approach. Should I talk to him? How can I avoid being preachy or condescending? Should we try and group up before? Or would that come off as threatening?

295,"Full disclosure, I also asked on r/lonely. Hoping for as much feedback as possibe because this is really making me sad. She has been married with a kid for ten years now and she just keeps missing us and cryng all the time, wishing she could live closer. But she can't because they can't afford it.

I don't know what to tell her anymore and right now, honestly this pandemic is really intensifying emotions for her. I did remind her that stress can me her feel more lonely than usual and the feeling will decrease to a manageable level once the extra stress is over, but she just can't adjust.

**This is what I told her today and have before (but it keeps happening):**

1. When she misses us, reach out.
2. When the loneliness gets worse, try to figure out what made it worse and do something about it instead of ignoring it. For example if she misses her nieces and newphews, call them.
3. Once you figure out why it's worse, such as the stress of quarantine and worrying: realize that like most things in life, that this pandemic is temporary.
4. Ex: She worried about me because I'm starting a new job healthcare, and I assured her that I'm educating myself and taking precautions like eveyrone else, as best I can with the resources we have available. Another example: she worried about stress eating, weight gain, and running out of dairy free food for her daughter who has severe allergies to dairy. So I gave her some simple recipes to make it herself, with ingredients she already has. For the stress eating, I sent her an article.
5. Most of all, if she is extra lonely, then reach out even more, not less! Call the people you're concerned about. After all, we miss her too. It's extra hard for her because she had never been on her own before she got married, and she never adjusted. I told her we miss her too because she's the baby in this family. She was the last to leave home. So when she got married I missed her so much that I called more not less.

Did I miss anything? Can anyone advise or post some rescources, not sure where to look for info.

She had something personal go on about a half a year ago and ever since then she hasnt talked to me and her accounts went unactive, I figured she had reasons, but now her accounts active again.

I dont know why she chose not to hit me up anymore. I feel like I should reconnect for closure, so if theres something that went wrong that I didnt realize then I could find out. But I also feel like if she wanted to hit me up or talk she wouldve. 

another reason is I have a gf and I feel like it would be disrespectful to my gf if I were to go out of my way to reconnect with my ex, even if it was just to be friends or to talk about what happened. But she was a good friend of mine and she helped me out a lot. Any advice on what I should do",25Mar2020,1
297,Hii Im asking this on both r/bees and r/advice for some help about a wasp in my room light. Some time last week I had my window open and I think a wasp came in. I always get a one wasp in my room around summer/ spring so this is nothing new. I don't think I have a wasp nest but if it sounds like I do please tell me. My room is on the second floor and I been hearing a wasp fly around my room. I always call for my brother to get rid of the wasp while I wait outside of my room because I have a BIG fear of wasp. This time though when I heard the wasp I looked around my room from my bed because it sounded close by and i was to scared to move. AND THE WASP WAS INSIDE MY ROOM LIGHT! I don't know how it got there and Im scared. I told my brother and he was to scared to get it out because he thinks it would be easier for the wasp to attack him plus he also thinks he saw TWO INSIDE. The light in my room wasn't completely closed so that might be how the wasp got in. We closed it tight and just hoped the wasp couldn't escaped. Its been two days now and I've only ever seen one wasp but i don't know if there is another. The wasp is still in my light and I don't know if it could make a nest up there. Sometimes I see it move its back legs around like crazy. Im scared the wasp could come out of the light without me knowing or that I might have a wasp nest because every year I get at least one wasp stuck in my room. This is the first time a wasp have gotten stuck in my room light and I'm scared that it could make a nest up there. Some advise on what to do would be nice.,25Mar2020,1
298,"This is gonna sound weird, but I was really close with this college friend. Like we would literally see each other everyday and hangout. These few days, I just have this odd feelings and afraid that we’re not gonna be close anymore. Like the last week before we have to go home because of the virus, we didn’t hang much because she had a final. She was probably stressing out but she didn’t respond much to my texts and when I was leaving, she was on her phone a lot and wasn’t really paying attention (which is not what she usually does). For these past weeks on break, understandably she’s home so we won’t talk as much but she’d taking forever to text back or just not text back. Yesterday she said she missed me, and we called. I just don’t understand why you say things but don’t consistently prove it with your actions. Idk I just miss her a lot and don’t want to lose our connections. I got used to being with her a lot.

299,"He is the second guy I’ve slept with, after I lost my virginity at AGE 24. Before that, I was saving my virginity for marriage because I was really religious, and then I deconverted. 

I only had sex with one guy before him (my exbf). After I broke up with my bf, I hopped on Tinder and did something I never thought I’d do before — have a one night stand. I thought it would only be a ONS with this guy, however we ended up exclusively seeing each other during the past 1 month. 

One thing he always does is call me a “little slut.” When he says it, he says it in almost an endearing joking way. I usually laugh along but I also tell him it kinda bothers me, however he has not stopped. 

In fairness, I did sleep with him very easily. I literally matched with him on Tinder, went over to his place a few days later, and easily had sex with him. I didn’t care because again, I thought it’d be a one time hookup. However, he was the one who wanted more (we’ve talked about getting into a relationship). 

Overall, he treats me really well, like a girlfriend. He’s really sweet and considerate, etc. But he does continuously call me a slut. Last time we met, while we were cooking dinner, he said, “I didn’t even have to do anything” (alluding to how easy it was to sleep with me). 

I should also mention that we are very sexually compatible. Our sex drives are both very high and we have a lot of fun in the bedroom. Not sure if this somehow affects how he views me as a slut...? 

ALSO — I know his body count is very high. Lol 

Tldr: Guy I’m seeing repeatedly calls me a slut in an endearingly joking way, even though he knows it bothers me. But he also frequently talks about wanting a relationship with me. Any insight or advice? Should this be a dealbreaker?",25Mar2020,1

302,"For context, we are in the USA and our large city has been under a Shelter in Place order for COVID-19. My partner and I have been working from home for nearly two weeks. We haven't gone anywhere except to grocery stores, tracks to exercise, etc.

I am friends with a couple who went through a nasty breakup. They had been long term, like 10 years, and we've been friends for at least 8 years. Although we live in the same area, different job schedules and distance has kept us apart. We try to stay in touch, but of course have drifted apart somewhat. My partner and I still try to visit for holidays, and last saw them at Christmas, but we don't call or text all the time.

Jeff took the breakup very badly. I don't know the details but I know that he was in a bad place and had to be put on antidepressants. I only heard about this a month after the breakup, neither of them reached out to us for support so we were really blindsided by this. Jeff moved out and we offered to let him stay with us (this was before the big panic), but he insisted that he could find his own place and thanked us for the offer. My partner continued to see Jeff when he could and offer support, but Jeff is pretty introverted, and through either pride or embarrassment, he never really took much of our help.

Meanwhile, I tried to keep in touch with Nancy by texting to see if she was okay, but I never really got any responses. I figured she was busy (she worked multiple jobs) and thought that when she wanted to reach out, she would, and I wouldn't bother her. After all, she built up a good support system in her immediate area and probably now had closer friends that she worked with (this was my reasoning for not more aggressively trying to see if she was okay).

And now we're at the pandemic, our lives have totally been turned upside down and we've been isolating since mid-March. I texted Nancy last week to see if she was okay and had enough food since I knew she was living alone, but I didn't get a response. Today, Jeff called me out of the blue and asked if we would let him stay with us. He said that he rented a room from another couple but they told him to pack up and leave immediately. It was because his work was still calling him in, and he had to share office space with six other people. He even asked if he could work from home but they told him no, he would still have to physically come in. Legality aside, this is his income and in this time, I'm sure he felt no choice but to continue working.

My partner and I really debated on this. We thought long and hard about if we could really take in another person (who we haven't seen for a few weeks, yet cared deeply about). We live in a one bedroom apartment and work from home, as I mentioned. Eventually, we thought that the safest thing to do would to pay for a hotel for Jeff to stay at while he tried to arrange living expenses. I thought this was a fair compromise - helping him get shelter while reducing any risk of transmission since he still had to go to an office with other people.

Well, we called Jeff back and told him this is what we were thinking. He sounded a bit disappointed, but knew where we were coming from. He insisted that he couldn't take our money, that he had potential help from family on that, and that he thanked us for trying and that we'd meet up when the pandemic is over. I could tell that he sounded really sad - I knew that what he really needed was physical emotional support, but we thought it really would be safer if we stayed isolated. I offered to call him more often, but I don't know if he would pick up the phone anymore. He never really was great at reaching out for help before and is the kind of person that takes 2 weeks to respond to a text.

This evening, a week after I sent a text that was ignored to Nancy, she texted back, saying that she really hurt Jeff but that he needed our support and to please help him as we could. I explained our offer to help him find housing, but I got an unusually curt reply: ""He would have taken you in"". I tried explaining that we thought we were doing what was safest, but again: ""Whatever helps you sleep at night. He really needed you."" Etc. etc.

Honestly those comments really made me feel like shit. I already felt like the help we offered was inadequate but the safest thing. I don't know what to do or how to help my friend more, and now I'm struggling with the guilt of leaving him in the cold and the venomous words of someone I thought would understand.

Did I do the right thing? I could really use some advice on how to go forward with these two people that I care about.",25Mar2020,1

313,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I [21F] met him [21M] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",25Mar2020,1
314,"Hi, I’m sorry if my writing style sucks, I’m sort of new to reddit, this is my very first post, so please bare with me.

TL;DR: I wanna be a housewife and don’t know how to tell my family

I’m a college-aged female currently living with my grandparents while I go to community college. At the moment I’m studying to get an Associates Degree in Computer Aided Drafting, (to put it simply, making blueprints with the help of computers).
I have been dating a guy for about 3 years now, and in that time we’ve seriously talked about getting married. I’ll try not to be too corny, but he’s just incredible and supportive and seems perfect for me in every way, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that when we get married he’ll work his hands to the bone providing for me and our eventual family.
Because we’ve talked so seriously about marriage, the idea of me staying home and being a typical housewife is also something that’s come up and something both of us are totally on board with. This is something I’ve always liked the idea of, even before meeting my now-boyfriend.
Back to my degree for a second, where I live, an Associates is all you need to get a good paying job in my field, but my grandma and my dad are very seriously pushing me towards getting a Bachelors Degree because it’ll “open up so many doors”, and that’s great and all but I don’t think I need those doors opened because I don’t plan on making a career out of my degree. I plan on working as much as I can and saving as much money as I can until I have children, and then staying home with them. My boyfriend thinks this is a great idea and my grandpa thinks it’s just fine as long as I’m willing to take responsibility for my own actions.
I’m sorry this has been so long, but finally, here’s my dilemma
Am I doing the right thing? I really do want to be a housewife someday. I know it’s not the most popular thing in the world, but for personal reasons, I want to homeschool my kids, and I can’t very well do that if both my future husband and I are out in the workforce. Is betting future career opportunities on this dream a smart idea or is it just wishful thinking?
Is just getting an Associates and working as much as possible smart? Or should I spend another 2 years of college getting a Bachelors Degree I probably won’t end up really using?
If I am doing the right thing, how do I break it to my family? I love my grandma so much. Growing up with a single dad, she’s been more of a mom to me for essentially my entire life. That being said, since I moved in with her, she become rather controlling, or at the very least, insistent that she knows best. Every time I’ve brought up the idea of maybe not getting a Bachelors Degree, she shuts me down immediately and just tells me “you need it”. I’m scared to tell her my reasons behind my college plans because both of her children (my dad and my aunt) got married very young and both went through messy divorces. I’m worried she’ll think I’m going in the same direction. I don’t think she sees me as an adult yet, or at least doesn’t want to admit I’m an adult.
This is the same reason I’m scared to tell my dad. I mentioned something about it to him a while ago and he (supposedly) called my grandma and told her that I was “throwing away my future for some boy”
My boyfriend and I want to get married as soon as we, responsibly, can. Right now, that’s looking like it’ll be in the next 3-4 years, and I don’t plan on pushing that back any further. It’s either get an Associates and be able to work for at least 2 years before we get married and then however long until kids, or stay in school to get a bachelors degree and get married as soon as I graduate.
What do I do Reddit? This has kept me up at night for at least a year now, and as I finish up my second to last semester of my Associates, I know I have to do something about this soon.
I’m sorry if any of this was confusing, I’ll try to clear things up in the comments if people need that. Thank you for reading.",25Mar2020,1
316,"Using a throwaway and not being too specific as my bf uses Reddit too.

We met in college and have known each other for almost a year but been together for almost 6 months! I know we’ve not been together for a Long time but we are both serious about how we feel about each other and have never been so happy before in relationships. We don’t see a problem between us and we get along really well. To me, he is almost everything I’m looking for(in terms of personality) and we care for each other a lot.

Here’s where it all goes downhill :(

We have different goals in life AND I’ll be relocating to another country permanently after we finish college in about 2 years(Long and complicated story involving family matters which I don’t want to dive into but it’s very likely I won’t be staying in the current country we’re in). 

However, I feel that if our relationship continues to be very serious by the time we’re about to end college, I would want to try sacrificing moving to continue being with him in the country we’re in right now. But he has been also telling me that I should choose my career and future for myself and not base it on our relationship(which I agree to some extent). Meanwhile, my boyfriend has made it very clear that he has no desire of moving to another country :( 

We also share different goals in life. For instance, he does not want kids and want to focus only on building his career. Meanwhile, I probably want to start a family(later future? Still unsure about the idea of starting a family) and is not as work-centered. I’m more adventurous and I value living life fully, so I have many dreams and goals of travelling/backpacking across states and countries, which my bf has expressed disinterest in.

Am I thinking way too ahead? Should we just continue our relationship normally knowing we probably won’t work out in the future? Is there even a future for us? Hope to hear stories of people who have been in similar experiences and how it worked out for y’all/them! Thanks a lot in advance!",25Mar2020,1

And he told me he had liked me ever since we were young which was weird because the age difference and he had a girlfriend at the time he was still near me. They broke up after he moved.

I am so scared she will hurt herself and I bend over backwards to do anything I can in my power to help her. But nothing works. I can never seem to get her to be happy again and I can't even remember a time I was ever rude to her or tried to make her cry. I feel like I try so hard but can't do anything to make her feel better. I feel so helpless and all I want is for her to be happy. 

Today she has seemed happy all day and when I facetimed her she seemed to be extremely happy which in turn made me very happy and we had a joyful call. Toward the end of the night though she began to start being very quiet and distant. I was confused and tried to ask her what's wrong but she refused to say anything and she repeated ""I don't know."" It's hard to feel like it's not my fault, it just feels like everytime we talk she is unhappy. 

Now she has been texting me saying it's all her fault and she's done so many things wrong in our relationship and how we never used to have problems. This has taken such a toll on me. I cry a lot now and feel very helpless and depressed. I just want her to be happy. I can't say or do anything to change her mind. No matter what I do she is still sad and I apologize and it's just so hard to feel like I'm not at fault. I need help or advice or anything. I love her more than anything in this world right now. I am scared to death she will hurt herself. 

Thank you so much for reading, If you need more information, or have any questions, or have advice for me, please comment, I don't really know where to turn from here.",25Mar2020,1
332,"Hi all,
I was on Clindamycin (3 150mg tablets 3 times a day) for 5 days for an infection when I started developing a rash on my neck and face. I went to the doctor, they told me to stop the medication because the infection was gone, and said everything would go back to normal. 

Well. It’s been 5 days since I stopped taking the antibiotics and the rash (I’m pretty sure it’s hives, they almost look pimply) has gotten worse on one side of my neck and my face, and now has travelled down to my chest. 

I feel like the hives should be getting better instead of worse after 5 days. I haven’t changed detergent or body wash, or food. Has anyone had any experience with this?  Any idea how long this might last?

Thank you!",25Mar2020,1
333,"I dont know what it is. But I have a desire to have a horrible life. My life isn’t that great, but it isn’t terrible. I want someone to hurt me, whether it was physically or emotionally, i dont care. 

I do have depression, but if this weird thing was connected to it, I think I’d feel more like wanting things to get better. 

I think it might be from the fact I have a big imagination, and I write stories.. But then idk how that could make me wish I was abused. 

Should I go to a counselor? I’d feel awkward this bringing up to someone in person. Idk what to do with these weird thoughts. And it bothers me that I’m not getting what I feel like I want, but also the fact that its what I want. 

What should i do?",25Mar2020,1
334,"Before I ask, let me just clarify that I'm not asking anyone for permission, but rather, I was wondering if there was anyone willing to share their opinion about my situation.

I'm currently 17 and still in highschool, but I also work part-time at Walmart as a warehouse worker, though my main duties entail taking items to be stocked on the sales floor. I've been working around six months now, and while the job isn't awful, I've been thinking about quitting recently for a few reasons.

1. My job used to involve a lot more variety when I started out. I was sent to different areas of the store, and I would work the line while unloading the trucks, plus some other odd ends. However, ever since management re-reviewed their policies for minors after getting some more in, they put a stop to some of the stuff I used to do. Further more, I only work one aisle every single day. While this in itself isn't bad, it has only added to my frustrations of the work being incredibly repetitive. I started thinking about quitting at some point, but point number 2 has brought it up sooner than I expected.
2. One word: Coronavirus. Is this a big deal? Not for me. I'm young, and healthy. Unfortunately, I have a 60 year old father with quite a few pre-existing medical conditions. Furthermore, the virus can survive for a while on cardboard, which I am handling every day I work there, and since lots of people come to walmart, I'm at a fair risk of passing it along. This is probably the biggest factor right now.
3. The job itself is probably not the best for someone who's busy with school related work. They call employees in when they need us, but sometimes that can mean 5 days a week. Honestly, if I could choose I would do the work over homework and studying, but I've noticed a rather peculiar trend. My grades have dropped, albeit not a dramatic amount, ever since I started working. However, it's still signifcant. My grades are still good for the most part, but I'd like to get em back to previous levels. Doesn't help I'm not great with time management.

The truth is, this would be a lot easier of a decision to make if I didn't feel like a bitch for wanting to leave. Yeah, school's out, but soon enough schooling is probably going to go online for me, not to mention I've been looking into some online courses. My dad's okay with me at my job though. However, I can't help but think about how this reflects upon me as a person if I quit because I'm bored of the work. I've talked to the other employees, and quite a few of them need walmart to support themselves and/or their families. Once or twice I've dealt with fellow employees who got passive aggressive with me because they thought I have it easier, (Which honestly, isn't entirely wrong.) Despite what so many people say about walmart as a workplace, I've come to respect it so far as that real people work there who need the money, not just nameless cogs in a machine supplying people with food.

So, to end this off, am I justified enough to quit my job, or would it reflect badly on my character?",25Mar2020,1

For the past week or so I’ve had near constant chest tightness and pain while breathing in. It’s worse when I lay down. No fevers, very light cough.

I’ve been attributing it to the increased anxiety of adapting to social distancing and online classes, but I don’t know at what point I need to look into it further?

It’s not bad enough that it interferes with me living my life &amp; in normal circumstances I would never even think of going to the doctor over it, but now I wanna be responsible and do the right thing.

340,"I have liked this girl for about a year and a half. I just smile being around her, I love her personality and poetic way of looking at life. She is kind and caring and gives me back massages when we hang out because I get sore from the gym lmao. She is just considerate and remembers things. It’s just I’ve never felt like I can open up to her.

I grew up in a shitty environment. I loved my family, but they really had a way of ignoring mental health related issues. I got beaten up a little and a lot of mental abuse, but it was mainly from the influence of drugs/alcohol. For the most part I had fun with my family. Especially my siblings. However, I think my family hiding their feelings has been passed down to how I am around people that are new to me.

This past year or so with this girl has been fun. I’ve had lots of fun memories with her. She has told me about her family, but when she asks about mine I tense up. I can’t really talk about that stuff. One day last week she asked me why I didn’t drink (it’s because of my parents being alcoholics it feels good to say cuz it’s anonymous). However earlier that day I heard about my mom, she went to the hospital for liver damage. I don’t know why but I fucking exploded on this girl when she asked me. I yelled so much and I think I said something about how I didn’t want her in my life. Which is totally not true!

In all honesty I love her. I normally would rush into relationships, but this just felt natural to let happen slowly. I wanted to build this relationship and savor every moment I had of it. I just feel like I fucked up and she hasn’t called or anything. 

I just have a really hard time opening up irl. But I really like her. It’s just the little things that make her perfect in my eyes. I just want those little things back. 

Any advice?",25Mar2020,1
341,"W(30) and I(27) have been dating for close to 2 years and decided to get married this coming weekend. W's mom is currently out of the country, and the father passed away when W was very young. The older sister is like a mother to W so she took the role as the guardian. Since the sister and my mom were planning the wedding they got into alot of heated arguments which almost led to a fist fight. The wedding was canceled because of the coronavirus :) but we were gonna do a very small gathering with social distancing.

After the fight my mom gave me an ultimatum, either I marry W and cut all ties with the family. Or I don't marry. After days of constant arguing my mom finally came around and agreed to the wedding. A few days before the actual 'wedding', W's sister was now strongly against the wedding. She even called W's mom and they both agreed that we shouldn't get married because of the family drama. Both families are also not in communication, if they do talk it ends in arguments.

 W's family gave the same ultimatum my mom gave me. Either W and I get married and they abandon W, or we dont get married. After a few hours of talking to their family, W told me we shouldnt get married. I told W that I feel like I'm the only one fighting for the relationship. W told me they will continue talking to the family to convince them. 

I've already taken off vacation time, I have alot of gifts from guests, we had our apartment ready, I spent over $10,000 and W spent more than I did. I'm just at a loss for words, I don't know what to do. I'm ready to just give up on everything.",25Mar2020,1

344,"So.

We're currently 2 hours away from our country wide level four lockdown, here in New Zealand.

My wife is 2 weeks away from her due date for the birth of our second son and we are going to have a homebirth.

However, we're trying to plan ahead and organize ourselves to deal with having this baby in isolation (for 4 weeks, minimum). 
We have a midwife, of corse,  but we also have a 2 year old (weeks away from 3) who is very active but also a chilled out, awsome little boy. 
We're isolated from family and friends because of the restrictions during the lockdown and we live hours from family, so we are trying to decide how we'll deal with possibly having him during the day with our toddler up and about.
 We're not concerned about him witnessing the birth at all and she would welcome his comfort during the whole thing. Obviously we would adapt to the situation if he was uncomfortable or upset by the whole thing and I would step away into the other room with him, or outside. 

Has anyone else done this?

I regard my father as a particularly impatient man and I think growing up is where I failed to observe many examples of emotional intelligence and healthy communication.

This is something I want to correct in myself before I start a family of my own and instill into them examples of these behaviors. My girlfriend is the most amazing and thoughtful person in my life, though I feel I push her away when I get preoccupied and salty by her doing something as minor as leaving a cabinet door open (one of many examples where I do not act as chill, nor move on from it as quickly, as I as I would like).",25Mar2020,1

I know it didn't happen to me but I can't help but feel hatred towards her for what she did to her brother. At that age you know for sure that family is off limits sex wise.

348,"Three times in my life this has happened with guys, and I can't even count how many regular friends I've lost just from my stupid ways. So let me elaborate.

First guy was high school. He and I dated for 2 years. I lost my virginity to him, we hung out a lot, it was as serious as HS relationships can get. He was amazing in almost every way, great personality, hot, we had very similar interests and we just meshed on so many levels. After 2 years he dumped me because according to him I was too controlling, needy, and ""boring"". Like, I always wanted to just hang out and have sex and never do anything interesting. This is still true, I really have no hobbies. I just work, school, and sex (if I can get it).

Second guy was like from 19-22. We lived together and everything. Again, we had so many common interests. We had the most amazing sex life, and tried all sorts of stuff together that neither of us had ever done. My dad called him his son and we probably would have gotten married. If I hadn't totally fucked it up. Again, similar complaints when he dumped me. I'm too controlling, too needy, don't let him be himself, etc. 

Now to my current boyfriend. We've been together 8 long years. I'm 30 now. Recently we've had a lot of issues. Sex is infrequent and we fight a lot. He says it is because, you guessed it! I am too controlling, too needy, don't give him space, demand things he doesn't like (he doesn't like oral yet I keep asking for it). 

So... I know it's tempting to just insult me. But I really do want to change. I don't want to die alone and miserable. I have done this to 3 guys now. My current bf is still here, but he's hanging by a thread. I really need help. I can't fuck it up a third time, I won't be able to live with myself. I have tried committing suicide twice in the past and I have no friends or family to help me if he leaves me. Please help me fix this.",25Mar2020,1

My parents(who I still rely on) have decided that enough is enough and I'm being thrown out of my house once covid is on the downswing.

I'm not in my home state, and don't have any resources where I'm at now, or where I normally live. I only have my permit, and I soon won't have a car I can test for my license with.

I live in a &gt;300 sq foot motor home with my parents and two dogs. It's put a strain on everyone involved and it finally snapped with my ""careless and selfish action."" 

This is quite possibly the worst timing ever to be thrown out of the house, but at least I have a little time, however long it might be. 

I had a plan to move out asap when we got back to my home town, but I can't now because I more than likely won't be getting there on my own. There are lots of pieces that I need to put in place still before I can move out. The plan I had put together was going to be minimal, living in a tent in town for ~$600 a month(the job I have lined up pays well so this likely wouldn't be a problem). 

Now it's looking like I can't get there and get on my own, and that I may be living on the streets sooner than I'd be able to fix it.

350,"   We're all in the midst of a very tumultuous, confusing time. I'm seeking advice about my situation relating mainly to coronavirus and work.   
  For some context, I am a female living and working in a major city in Ontario, Canada. I work in a restaurant that serves take-out and offers delivery. Ontario recently declared a state of emergency and has released a list of essential businesses that will remain open, and my workplace has been deemed essential. They have also allowed for extra protections for employees and basically can't fire anyone for taking leave due to illness or childcare. The province has also added protections to rentals (I rent), banning evictions for several months. Public health officials are giving advice that conflicts with some of the government measures. I have taken a 14-day leave of absence from work as I have been in close contact with someone who is exhibiting symptoms.

  I live with my boyfriend of six years. He a hereditary predisposition to a weakened immune system and auto-immune disease (such as Multiple Sclerosis), but he has never been diagnosed with any immune issues. He's taken a very firm stance on coronavirus precautions. We haven't left our apartment at all in 7 days. **If I leave for anything, he says we have to start the 14-day quarantine process over again. He says if any of his loved ones die, many of whom are chronically ill and aging, he won't be able to forgive anyone not taking this seriously** (people still going out for true non-essentials)**.** I barely have one paycheque worth of vacation pay and I'm not eligible for EI (which would barely cover rent and bills anyway). We can cover rent and bills for April, but I'm worried about May. We live paycheque to paycheque and were already struggling before this crisis hit. **I'm not being held against my will by any means, but I feel like I'm stuck between two impossible choices: loss of livelihood and income, or loss of my greatest love who is the only home I've ever known.** I don't really have anyone in my life to go to for advice about this. 

**Now that all of that is out in the open, I will ask direct questions. Are we being overzealous with these precautions? Or are we doing the right thing? Is he being unfair toward me?**

TLDR; My boyfriend has implemented very strict precautionary rules for coronavirus. I'm faced with financial hardship, or potentially losing the trust and life I've built with my partner.",25Mar2020,1

Whenever something death related shows up on my feed or if im lying awake at night,even if i see the skirt or shirt on my wardrobe (cant get rid of them) i just want to curl up and die.I really want it to stop,i know it was wrong already but my brain keeps reminding me.



What should i do??is there a way to block these toughts?",25Mar2020,1
360,"I'm 15.  I've been dating this girl for a month now but haven't seen her in 2 weeks because of the corona virus.  We were supposed to go back to school on April 5th but today we found out that they are delaying that and we aren't going back to school at all this year, and will instead be doing online learning for the rest of the school year, meaning I won't be able to see her at all for a long time.  Honestly, I've started to lose feelings over the course of the last week, but I still like her.  My friends think I should break up with her considering the fact that I won't be able to see her for a while.  I can't come over to her house because she hasn't told her parents that she's dating anyone yet and she can't come over to my house because my house is very small and my mom would rather not have anyone come over.  I'm really stuck here and don't know what to do, I don't want to wait and break up with her for too long because I feel like it's a dick-move to date someone unless you truly love them.

I was told the result was negative. When I go online to my county’s judicial and court records I can still see the case. My name my moms name and the man in question. But it says status dismissed. I looked it up and got mixed answers. I’m wondering if anyone knows for certain that it means he was not my biological father? Could it possibly mean my mother refused the test, canceled it, asked for it to be dismissed herself or one of the them didn’t show up? Thanks.",25Mar2020,1

364,"First off, I don’t even know if this is the correct subreddit you post this to. If not, please point me in the correct direction. Thanks!! 

I am 18, and a senior in high school. There is this girl who is 17, a junior in high school. I’ll be honest, I’m in love with that girl, and I am doing everything I can to help her. All we talk about getting married and traveling the world after she turns 18. With that being said, something unthinkable has happen and I don’t know what to do. 

Her dad is very abusive, hits her, chokes her, when she was little he locked her in a box for days or handcuffed her to the shower. It’s truly heartbreaking. As of recently(yesterday), he choked her and kicked her, so badly she found it hard to walk. I had to help her, so I picked her up and we went straight to the emergency room. I convinced her to go, because I thought they would help her. Well they did not... 

The police got called and they showed up, as we expected. I was on FaceTime most of the time so I heard the entire conversation. I was not allowed to go into the hospital(with everything going on with corona).  The hospital was helpful to her, even had security with her until the police arrived, just in case her dad came.  The police then came, the police called her a delinquent who ran away, put her in handcuffs, and gave her back to her dad... ran away they said. I’m sorry, but I don’t consider going to the doctor for help because your scared your dad is going to kill you “running away”. They said that while she was begging not to be sent back, crying, saying she was scared for her life and her dad was going to beat her if she went back. When she was crying and told the cop her father choked her, I even got a video, the cop said: “there’s a difference between choking out and throwing someone up against a wall for being disobedient”.... both of which is illegal and abuse in of itself, regardless of everything else. The cop then asked if she had anything on her phone(I.e. filming them) and took the phone. Little did they know I heard the entire exchange.  Now she has contacted child protective services, and they are really no help at all. 

Now I called, while this was happening, trying to make a report, as I have heard the abuse her father has done. The police station said I would receive a call back from the cop dealing with this, a call I never received from the cop. However, she informed me that the cop told her that they have my name now and will be investigating me... now I am beyond worried. If they wouldn’t even help her out of an abusive household, can they pin anything illegal on me? 

So now she is back in an abusive home, can’t text me as the police took her phone(she can ft me from her laptop), and I know right now as of writing this she is getting hurt. She FaceTimed me, and hung up quick when her dad was coming. She would always call me back, so now I know he’s beating her again, exactly what she said was going to happen. 

Any advice on what we should both do would be greatly appreciated. Also is there also any way to request the police officers body camera, as I believe that is public record, and this is beyond unbelievable. Thank you all very much!

To;dr: This girl I love is getting abused. I tried to get her help and take her to the hospital, by once the police came, they made it worse. They called her a delinquent who ran away(yes... ran away to a hospital), and gave her right back to her dad. Whom I know is abusing her as I’m writing this.

My credit score has dropped to 464 in just one year and both of my personal checking accounts were closed due to overdraw fees I couldn't keep up with after leaving a job I had last year. Lost my apartment and owe them $6000 for having to leave the lease early. We are living with my soon to be ex-husband's family currently. I have no savings, I've mostly been a stay at home mom. My family is toxic and I don't trust them to be around my child more than short spurts of time when I'm present (there was a gunshot in their home the last time she spent the night. It's a long story, but a hell nah from me). His parents can't help as much as they offer. The other day I had a therapist appointment and ended up almost missing it because the person who was supposed to watch her wouldn't wake up (still drunk from the night before). I have no friends here. Family isnt an option. How do I get a job? What do I do for childcare (Can't afford options and my kiddo is too young for public school). I also have 2 dogs (less of an issue but adds to the stress in my brain because I don't know where I'm going to be living). Long story short, I'm in a shitty place. I don't know what to do.

368,"Let’s get right to it. I requested to work from home temporarily due to the coronavirus pandemic (US). I work in a radiology office working with insurance. I sit by myself and do not have direct contact to patients. However, I am in direct contact of the technicians and other employees that do have direct contact with patients. I do not see anyone in my office taking any precautions other than spraying Lysol on a few of the doorknobs and around the front lobby. I am wiping down everything- the copy machine, time clock, staff kitchen (which I don’t even use!!!!) and of course my work area. Aside from working with insurance companies, I was asked to help with the mail, but that is all my job consists of.  

Yesterday, I emailed my manager inquiring about working from home. He called me into his office and here is where I am fuming. I’m going to list every excuse he gave me for why he refused my request:

1. If I work from home, then everyone else is going to want to work from home. I explained to him that others cannot do their job without being in the office. My job consists of me on the computer all day making the occasional phone call.

2. “You don’t have direct contact with patients, I have more contact with patients than you do”

3. I do not have health insurance. This company has a high turnover rate so insurance doesn’t kick in after 3 months of employment. I brought this up to him and he said “if something were to happen, I feel like they (the company) would do something to help out” You FEEL like it?!

4. “You’re young, you’re not at risk”

5. “Most people who have coronavirus don’t even have any symptoms and don’t feel sick!”

6. “Who is gonna do the mail”. This part pissed me off the most. I’m sorry, but the MAIL is a valid reason to deny my request?

He does not know my status of health, nor does he need to. I have genuine concerns over getting sick, and the less volume of people, the better. He said I have the option to not work but I can’t work from home, which I know if I do that they will retaliate and use different reasons as their excuse.

Does anyone have any advice for what I can do or say? The mail thing just showed how little they care. Am I thinking too much into this? Are my feelings and issues towards this justified?",25Mar2020,1

She's in high school, and this guy had been showing up around her out of nowhere, following her to her car. It wasn't bad at first, but then he started showing up at her work. Asking inappropriate questions. Spreading rumors when she ignored him. She went to the teachers at her school, and they basically did nothing except say that they would be watching him. Since they had been friends for a little bit before he slipped into creeper mode, they saw those texts and wrote it off. Meanwhile, he's told his friends that they've had sex, spread all kinds of crap, etc. A little while back, she was talking to one of his friends, and the friend told her he dropped him off at her house one night. She never knew. You can see why that's an issue. She has issues at home and her parents don't seem to care about the situation, and the school is doing nothing. She was in an abusive relationship before, apparently, and she's terrified to do anything that might make him mad. I want to help, but I'm not sure what ground I have to do anything.

I’ve just started a new job going from permanent at my last company to casual at this one. I work in an essential service as a medical scientist running diagnostic tests on patient samples from the local public hospital as well as surrounding private clinics. 

I don’t work in virology so chances of COVID19 through work is extremely minimal however two weeks ago I was at a bar and I have been to the grocery store twice since then, other than that from work to home and back. No one known to me in the last 2 weeks has developed symptoms and all I have is a slight cough (no fever, no sore throat, no fatigue, no muscle soreness, no headache) . My partner has been working from home and has only been in contact with me for a minimum of 10 day’s, she has no symptoms.

My question is: is it my duty of care as a scientist to call in sick to my brand new job and tarnish my reputation from day one? I have landed a really good job in a great company and would really prefer not to ruin my name, but on the long term I guess transmitting COVID to new colleagues would probably be worse.

377,"So I have this friend who is not a bad person but there is always something off about her. After a while i kinda catch on why. 

She's the type of person who has and makes a LOT of friends and i know there isn't anything bad about that. At some point I did have a really good friendship with her but after a while we started growing apart since I'm making new friends as well as her. We have common interests but all in all we didn't really match I guess. She's an outgoing and spontaneous person that likes to go out all night and stuff and me on the other hand is an introvert, likes being alone but at the same time I do like hanging out but only with really close friends. There isn't any bad blood or anything but part of the reason why we don't hangout as much bcos I'm actually trying to avoid her.

The reason why I've been avoiding her is that she always has this facade of a ""happy and easy going"" person. She knows that and she's always been open about it to me and some friends. She has this going on bcos she has a reputation to keep for her parents and i get that but sometimes it just gets too much for me. I feel like she lies about a lot things which makes her very hard but at the same time easy to read (I know that makes no sense but idk it feels like that like you know they're lying but you don't know why and what for). Sometimes I just notice when she's laughing that she's actually very sad inside. She's also somewhat of a people pleaser and she humble brags a lot especially on social media. 

Another thing is that she's living that ""I have a perfect life on instagram"" bcos when I hang out with her or when I see her hanging out with her other friends, I find that she's on the phone a LOT like 70% she's on her phone 20% you're talking to her and 10% she's taking photos or videos and posting it on her socials which has been bothering me for such a long time because I hate when I hang out with people and they're just on their phones bcos when I hangout with someone I like to have a good convo with no distractions. And that's kind of one of the bigger reasons why I avoid hanging out with her. Even though I'm an introvert, I really like talking to ppl more in person bcos it feels real. Normally when I'm talking with just one person, I tend to start a convo and keep the convo going because I don't really like dead air but when I'm with her I sorta run out of things to say which barely happens.

But at the same time though, I've seen her cry a lot of times. She even went to me because she had an anxiety attack. She's also open to me and some friends about her relationships, friendships, heartbreaks, family and all that jazz which makes me feel very pleased because I get to see this side of her.

So what I hope is that I get to see her real side more when I hangout her because I can't seem to catch up with her with all these sides of her that I can't deal with.",25Mar2020,1
378,"I feel so dumb and would appreciate any advice.

Monday I was driving to get lysol wipes. I came to an intersection I had never been to before. My GPS told me to make a left as I went to make the left I was confused by the number of stop lights pointing at me. There were two facing me. One was red, one was green. The intersection wasn't a cross, it had a really strange layout. To not bore you with the details as I was and still am unclear as which light I was suppose to be following. There was no traffic in LA because of the safer at home order. I waited behind the line and looked behind me and waited to see if any cars were coming/knew which direction to go/if we could go. A car came up behind me but immediately got in the lane next to me and continued forward. The guy looked at me funny and I apologized through my car shrugging trying to tell him I was confused. Because he had went, I check to see if cars were coming in the other direction and proceeded to follow the path the car I apologized to had went. This wasn't even the way I wanted to go. But I just wanted to not run a red light. This all happened fast and I was really nervous about doing something wrong. When I continued past the light I saw that the intersection was camera enforced. I'm devastated. I've never had anything like this happen before and now I will probably have an infraction. I want to go to law school in the future, I don't intentionally break rules. I would never ever run a red light. Can I reach out to anyone and explain what happened? In advance that way they know that I know it was a mistake. I hope they can see the full video. I hope they see it as confusion and not recklessness. I was being as safe as I could while still being very unsure which light was mine. I don't know if I even ran a red light.

I cant afford the up to $490 cost of the violation. I'm immunosuppressed living on very little before the pandemic. I'm 1099 so I lost my income and don't qualify for unemployment.

I can't tell you how dumb and guilty I feel over this.

379,"Hello! I’m currently helping out a friend to study calculus for college and although I give her materials, and information to study, she always says “I’m too stupid for this.” What irritates me the most is, I’m trying to help her succeed in the class by working through the problems with her, but she always keeps going to a problem solver website so she can complete the homework quickly.

I’ve tried talking to her about how a lot of people who are smart, worked their asses off to get there. I also try to give her encouragement to incentivize her to do the homework on her own without using a website to quickly find the solution without doing any work.

I’m pretty much at wits end. I want her to succeed in the class, but I feel like my efforts are useless. Is there anything that I could do to help her get out of this mindset? I’m not trying to forcefully get her out of this, but I’m worried for her future in college.

I guess my question is, how do I approach her to strive for success? Should I even talk to her about it?",25Mar2020,1
380,"Hi! So I’m not sure what steps I need to take next and honestly I’m not sure I’m even valid, so any opinions or thoughts would be helpful.

I love with one roommate, let’s say Sarah, I’m a small 2 bedroom apartment. About a week and a half ago her boyfriend found out his senior year of college had been canceled, and he would not be returning from after his spring break in Florida.

She mentions to me that he is going to visit. Now this is maybe a day before things with covid got intense. She never asks, just drops it into conversation. 

He shows up and then next day we are being told to start social distancing and whatnot. He starts coughing and is clearly sick and just came from a spring break environment. At this point, I can’t return home to my parents house in fear that he has Covid. He refuses to call his doctor and says it’s just a cold.

Anyway, they have little consideration for me. He walks around with no shirt on, they only stay in our living room and they have some beliefs that I just don’t gel with (intense fat shaming for example).

I’m not a very assertive person and that’s my problem. I asked my roommate (without him there) to think about him chipping in for rent and utilities. She got very defensive and said that he still had to pay for his college apartment and he’s not making any income. Keep in mind I work for City Year so I’m barely making ends meet. 

Am I crazy for requesting this? It’s not so much about the money but about the principle in my mind. The worst part is that my apartments so tiny they can hear everything I say so I haven’t really had a place to vent to anyone. Should I pursue this? Do I just Venmo request her rent and utilities like normal? Do I make adjustments for him and just go for it? Is that even legal for me to request more?

382,"I've known my friend since I was maybe 12 or 13. She was my high school Maths teacher and year advisor, who was also like a second mother to me, and has been for a fair chunk of my life.

I noticed the last few times we spoke that she's been getting a bit forgetful and hard to contact. I was surprised when she didn't make contact on my birthday, since she's always reached out, and felt hurt that she didn't remember when we did manage to get in contact eventually, after I texted her, called her mobile, then left a message on her home phone, all across a month or so span.

As a last resort I sent her a message on Whatsapp since I hardly use it and forgot she had it too. She called me back and started talking about what was going on for her, and very briefly asked how things were going for me, before going back to talking about what was going on for her again (something she's never done before)

Normally we talk every few months and make plans to catch up at some point, but I made the move to reluctantly contact her again a few months back now, and she did the same thing where she went on about her life and family and what was going on, and thanked me for calling and was about to end the call, before I jumped in and told her I'd give her an update on my life, which I felt kind of taken aback that she hadn't asked me about, since several months ago she'd have inquired as to how I was going, and my family and everything else about my life, as one would expect to do during a conversation with a long-term friend.

I decided then that I was going to take a step back from our friendship and that possibly it was just her just being forgetful (she was like that back in school days, but not as bad) and caught up in her own life, but I want a friendship where it's equal, not her taking up 90% of the call, before ending it.

Now that the virus is happening, I'm wondering whether it's worth me moving this boundary of sorts and reaching out to her since she's over 60 and lives by herself, with family scattered around the country. I know she's capable of taking care of herself and has been going to the local church fairly regularly, so I'd assume that between that community and her friends and family, she's managing well enough, since every time there's bushfires and I check in, she said she's gotten messages of support from lots of people.

I feel like our friendship might have turned a massive page or possibly even run it's course, at least for now, since it's not the kind of friendship dynamic I want to have or put further energy into maintaining, but am I just being petty about it, or is it about me honouring my own feelings and doing what's best for me right now?",25Mar2020,1
384,"Let me preface this by saying that no one involved ended up getting physically hurt. Everyone involved is around 18-19 years old (except for the parents).

An important piece of context here is that this friend (let's call him Mark) doesn't have a very good relationship with his parents. They aren't the best parents in the world, but they still try IMO and they care a lot about him.

So Mark and I were up late talking with 2 of our other friends (let's call them Steve and John) on Discord. Mark and John were both quite drunk, but Steve and I were completely sober. Everything was going fine until Mark shifts the tone of the conversation.

He starts saying things like: ""what's even the point of living?"", ""if you think about it we're all going to die, so what's the point?"" Then, he starts saying stuff like: ""I'm gonna kill myself,"" ""Can I borrow your car?"" (heavily implied that he was going to use it to kill himself), and ""Where's the nearest cliff?""

Given that Mark has a history of suicidal tendencies (including one failed attempt), this scared the shit out of us. Throughout all of this, I am asking Mark if everything is okay, and if he's been feeling down, etc.

In hindsight, these could have definitely just been jokes, especially given that he was drunk. However, given Mark's history of suicidal tendencies, we were probably too scared to see if this was the case.

Eventually, Mark says ""You know what, I'm going to bed,"" then the abruptly leaves the call. This scared us even more, so we each try to call him to make the that everything is alright. He doesn't pick up. We keep trying to reach him but he doesn't respond. Eventually, he picks up and says ""Stop calling me, I'm fine,"" in an unconvincing tone IMO (I could be wrong about this though). I say something like ""please don't hang up, we're worried about you, please don't hang up,"" but he hangs up anyways. We keep trying to contact him via text, but all he says is ""I'm fine.""

We interpreted his hanging up as him not actually being fine, but it's also entirely possible that he just hung up because he was mad and wanted to go to sleep. He was also probably still drunk at this point, which would further support this.

So we kept to call him again, but they all instantly go to voicemail. The last thing that we could do would be to call his parents. We didn't want to call the 911 in case he really was fine. We debated it, given that he doesn't have the best relationship with them. We eventually decided that it was better to be safe, so we ended up calling them.

They pick up, and the sound concerned, but not upset with us. They say that they'll call him, then call us back. When they do they say something like ""Mark does this kind of stuff sometimes and he knows the consequences."" (IDK what that last part about consequences means). They also said something like ""you did the right thing and you made a judgement call."" The point is, they didn't seem mad that we called them.

While we were all relieved, we were also kind of pissed since he's done this kind of stuff before to us. Later, Mark texts each one of us, saying how angry he is at us, saying that he doesn't want to be friends with us anymore, and saying ""please don't bother me or my family again.""

Maybe we shouldn't have contacted his parents, especially since he doesn't have the best relationship with them. I feel like I just lost a close friend and it's my fault. But at the same time, I'm still pissed that he's mad at us, when we were just concerned about him. I'm also worried that we might have made things even worse and made him even more depressed. I don't know what to do right now.",25Mar2020,1

The problem is, with no income (and now no home because my landlord already made plans apparently for after this Friday) I'm screwed with a tiny savings. But my understanding is the government is issuing emergency unemployment so my coworkers and I would not even being receiving payment from the company, but from the government? This means it shouldnt hurt him to keep me on to allow me to collect money from the government? But he refuses to keep me.

389,"My aunt is pretty financially well off for the most part and a very lovely lady, but she is my uncle in law’s wife and they live far away so I’m not super close with her. 

Anyways, I make a variety of colorful abstract paintings in my free time as a sort of stress relief. Nothing serious, I don’t really sell them, but I do enjoy making them and they have a lot of emotional value. The supplies though are a bit of a financial investment that I don’t take lightly.

my grandmother comes to visit sometimes and decides to take a few home. She gave me $50 for a painting and while I’d sell for more normally, she’s very close with me so I’m not really bothered by giving it to her for that cheap. That being said, she sent a picture of one to my aunt and my aunt decided she wanted it and my grandma, without consulting me, agreed. Well, grandma ships painting to aunt, aunt tells grandma that she will be sending a check for $50 (a price I’m not too happy about but whatever) in the mail for me.

Weeks go by. Now here we are. I’m quarantined, unemployed, and kinda broke. I still live with my parents and I’m in high school so that’s not the end of the world but I’m tryna save money for college. Should I bother asking my aunt for the money?

392,"Let me preface this by saying that no one involved ended up getting physically hurt. Everyone involved is around 18-19 years old (except for the parents).

An important piece of context here is that this friend (let's call him Mark) doesn't have a very good relationship with his parents. They aren't the best parents in the world, but they still try IMO and they care a lot about him.

So Mark and I were up late talking with 2 of our other friends (let's call them Steve and John) on Discord. Mark and John were both quite drunk, but Steve and I were completely sober. Everything was going fine until Mark shifts the tone of the conversation.

He starts saying things like: ""what's even the point of living?"", ""if you think about it we're all going to die, so what's the point?"" Then, he starts saying stuff like: ""I'm gonna kill myself,"" ""Can I borrow your car?"" (heavily implied that he was going to use it to kill himself), and ""Where's the nearest cliff?""

Given that Mark has a history of suicidal tendencies (including one failed attempt), this scared the shit out of us. Throughout all of this, I am asking Mark if everything is okay, and if he's been feeling down, etc.

In hindsight, these could have definitely just been jokes, especially given that he was drunk. However, given Mark's history of suicidal tendencies, we were probably too scared to see if this was the case.

Eventually, Mark says ""You know what, I'm going to bed,"" then abruptly leaves the call. This scared us even more, so we each try to call him to make the that everything is alright. He doesn't pick up. We keep trying to reach him but he doesn't respond. Eventually, he picks up and says ""Stop calling me, I'm fine,"" in an unconvincing tone IMO (I could be wrong about this though). I say something like ""please don't hang up, we're worried about you, please don't hang up,"" but he hangs up anyways. We keep trying to contact him via text, but all he says is ""I'm fine.""

We interpreted his hanging up as him not actually being fine, but it's also entirely possible that he just hung up because he was mad and wanted to go to sleep. He was also probably still drunk at this point, which would further support this.

So we kept to call him again, but they all instantly go to voicemail. The last thing that we could do would be to call his parents. We didn't want to call the 911 in case he really was fine. We debated it, given that he doesn't have the best relationship with them. We eventually decided that it was better to be safe, so we ended up calling them.

They pick up, and the sound concerned, but not upset with us. They say that they'll call him, then call us back. When they do they say something like ""Mark does this kind of stuff sometimes and he knows the consequences."" (IDK what that last part about consequences means). They also said something like ""you did the right thing and you made a judgement call."" The point is, they didn't seem mad that we called them.

While we were all relieved, we were also kind of pissed since he's done this kind of stuff before to us. Later, Mark texts each one of us, saying how angry he is at us, saying that he doesn't want to be friends with us anymore, and saying ""please don't bother me or my family again.""

I feel like maybe we overreacted, but also we were just concerned about him and wanted to be safe. Are we in the wrong?",25Mar2020,1
393,"Will try to keep this short. (TLDR at end)I am a PM for an commercial construction company that does corporate interiors in NYC.   I commute in daily from CT to the city.  Cuomo has deemed construction as an essential service and my company (and many others) have translated this as we keep working and our clients are expecting the same.  95% of my office is now working from home but the company ""line"" has been that PMs must maintain on site presence to properly perform our functions.  
  After watching the WH update last night and hearing the VP and others say ""if you have visited NYC recently you must self quarantine for 14 days"" I am emotionally torn about what I should do.  Here are some ""facts"" for clarity
 - I am an empty nester with no kids of my own within 1,000 miles and I do not have any elderly parents I come in contact with. 
- My wife and I are in our early 50's and are generally healthy.  I do get seasonal asthma and allergies and we are both prone to bronchitis yearly. 
 - I can effectively do about 75% of my job from home.  Only drawback is inability to walk around projects in progress to monitor progress, safety and workmanship.
 - driving is not really an option as my car is a beater and not really capable of making a 150+ mile round trip daily.
 - wife is currently furloughed as of yesterday
Here is the question: I feel it is my moral, ethical and civil responsibility to self quarantine for 14 days immediately to help stop the spread.  Am I over reacting?  I am afraid of potential ramifications from my office for doing this not only ""officially"" from my company but potential ridicule from my peers and direct reports.  I should also note my 2 direct reports have been working from home.  Only people in office have been PMs and Partners.  

TLDR: should I continue to report into NYC from CT or heed White House directive to self quarantine?",25Mar2020,1
394,"Hi all, here's another post relating Covid-19. I am just after some advice if possible.

At the moment me and my partner are dreading shopping, partly for the part that we wont be able to get what needed but mostly due to being at risk of getting corona. Before this all kicked off we used to do our weekly shop every sat 6am. And now that the shops dont open till 6am everyone is there at the same time as you all probably know. We are both key workers so getting essentials after work is impossible. We were thinking of ordering online just so we dont come in contact with any risks but all slots all booked off. This now means that we have to go out to the shops are risk getting this virus. None of us have any health conditions but you never know at this point. 

Our main worry is being in contact with Corona... I am just so scared of getting it or anyone that I care about getting it. I am naturally an anxious person so this just breaks me. 

I suppose the reason for this post is to get some advice to see what the rest of you are doing to prevent going out  to the shops as little as possible. I know we are all in the same boat and I'm aware others are worse off than me but if anyone have any tips or advice on this itll be greatly appreciated.

400,"Hey folks,   
So to start this off i want to give you a little briefing about me and my mother for better understanding.  
My mother is pretty biased about people with tattoos, piercings and body modification as a whole.  
She thinks that people with many piercings or tattoos have these cause they got some kind of problem in their life. (mentally, bad parenting etc.)

I myself don't have any piercings or tattoos at all, just cause i don't like em on me.   
but i don't mind about other peoples tats or piercings, i even think it is quite beautiful. but just not on my body.

I've been single for two years now after breaking up with my abusive and manipulative ex girlfriend.  
And now I met this beauty of a women online and she has like 4 piercings in her face, a couple tats on her body and pink and black hair. We talk to each other every day all day for the last 4 weeks now and i'm pretty sure it is getting a little more serious now. we can't meet bc of corona but we will as soon as we can.

I'm very close to my mom so i didn't mind telling her about this women i met. and she immediatly told me that something must be wrong with her and that she speaks out of experience and she met so many people with piercings and always something went wrong in their lives. 

and takes my abusive ex girlfriend as an example. which doesn't make any sense cause my ex didn't have any tattoos or piercings. she was just super manipulative and abusive towards me and her child.  


And it makes me so angry, not because she won't like the women i met. but more because she is so biased and always tries to disarm me with a simple, i'm older and i met more people than you did. 

and the worst is, i somehow feel guilty now, cause i know she's downstairs being dissapointed of me cause i can't get a normal girlfriend.  


what should i do now?  
why is it so important for me that my mom likes her?   


hope you understand everything i'm not a native speaker.

Thanks in advance folks!",25Mar2020,1

I currently work at a restaurant that has been deemed 'essential' during the Covid19 crisis. We are currently offering delivery only, no longer accepting takeout nor dining in. While I am lucky to have a job, I just want you to know that things I've been dealing with.

Before the health crisis started, I was salary, I'm an assistant manager bat a cafe. I've received 2 big pay cuts and laid off more than half of our staff. I'm still scheduled to work full time, but paid hourly. Our one server went from full time down to one shift a week, he sometimes helps with the deliveries. I've asked my bosses to give him one of my shifts. Just doesn't seem right that I have 5 and he as 1. My bosses brushed it off and said ""his English isn't as good as yours."" And that was the end of the conversation. 

Look, I don't feel comfortable being at work. My employees don't practice social distancing and are not the most hygienic people. I've had flu-like complications that have put me in the hospital in the past. I just quit smoking, I have asthma, they want me running around town making deliveries which puts me at risk. I told my boss I have asthma and he sorta shrugged his shoulders. On a daily basis, I come home after work and strip my clothes off, place them in the washer, go take a shower, and bawl my eyes out.my friends and family are urging me to stay home but I really can't do anything about it.

My health and the health of others is important to me right now. I feel much more comfortable being quarantined in the house then hopping around town making deliveries to some of the rudest people. I have money put away for savings just in case shit gets worse and my husband has the option of working from home. Even if I'm working 3-4 days / week, I'm ok with that.

The United States that presents itself in Hollywood movies is only a fiction.

American cities are built for cars and not for pedestrians so technically you can live your life with very limited social interaction.

427,"so lots of context is required here; growing up, i had this 'uncle' who we'll call Alex. Alex is Mexican and is one of those unofficial, not blood related relatives but we still consider him part of the family. he is also my godfather. growing up i would always visit him and when i was 5, i began living with him for a few years while my parents sorted out some things regarding their relationship. from the age of 6 to 8 (so nearly the entire time i lived with him) i spoke Mexican only. i am now nearly fluent at the age of 17. now Alex has a family of his own, too and when i saw them, we would converse in Mexican only and i am proud to call them family. 

when i was 8, i moved back in with my mum and she was super happy that i learnt a new language but it would take some time for me to get back to the English speaking groove as my mum only knew the basics. one thing that always stuck with me was sometimes i would curse or say words in Mexican rather than English for example instead of saying 'oh my god' i know say 'dios mio' (forgive the lack of accents, it's hard to get them on a laptop keyboard). i do this with other words, too. 

well when i started secondary school, i kind of left most of my Mexican behind except when i was in Spanish class (i know they're slightly different but knowing Mexican definitely helped) . I didn't really tell people about my past because it's personal but my close friends know. I frequently get people asking if i'm Spanish but i just avoid the question. 

now here's the issue: I still say 'dios mio' and other words in Mexican. i can't help it, it's become natural now but i have had multiple people (including teachers) tell me i'm appropriating the culture by speaking Mexican. at first i thought they had sticks up their asses but now it's happened so much i'm beginning to doubt myself. am i being racist? 

note: the words that i say in Mexican, i do sometimes say in English. the words are: dios mio, si, amigo/a, que, bueno and gracias (i say more but these are the most common",25Mar2020,1
428,"Okay, three years ago I cheated on my girlfriend, got caught and we broke up. I’m not asking her to date me again, I won’t do that because I don’t have any right to make a commitment to her anymore, but I have some things on my chest that if I don’t tell her, will crush me.
How I cheated: went off on vacation, lied about being single to a girl my age, by the end of the week I lost my virginity to her. When she asked why I “broke up” with my ex I lied to her and claimed that the ex had turned to drugs and had pushed me away (complete lie, the girl I said this about is one of the greatest girls in the world - now that I’m a little more mature I see how big I fucked up).
The end result: my girlfriend of 3.5 years told me to go fuck myself (i had only ever HEARD her say “shit” once and she had been startled greatly for it) and broke it off with me. At a later date she opened up some to me and let me see some poems she wrote about how she felt, but after that our communication stopped.
This letter I want to send isn’t an apology, because I can’t apologize for what I did. Instead, I want to thank her for showing me genuine love and I want to encourage her to give that love to someone who will really give it right back.

When we went to work on Saturday, with what the world is experiencing right now, I got sent home because I wasn’t well. After 20-30 minutes after I got home thanks to my partner dropping me off due to me not driving, one of the managers called up and said because it couldn’t be “confirmed” that I had tonsillitis I got told my fiancé and I needed to self isolate. 

On Monday I called my doctors for advice on my anxiety issues I had been having in the past week, and also explained my tonsillitis. The doctor agreed that it probably was just tonsillitis and to take antibiotics, but it was nothing but tonsillitis. 

I called work yesterday to try to explain it, but whilst explaining it I was cut off. Today I got a call saying to pick something up in a certain time frame, and it could only be done today.  due to the high possibility of not being open after today. With everyone knowing we were both off isolating, I thought they would have thought about and considered about that before they called us. 

When we turned up to collect it, which they had designated bays for collecting item, we got scolded so much and told that it was unacceptable that we turned up to collect the item by a different manager. We were both wearing gloves and didn’t exit our car until they left the area. 

We are both off until the 5th, and we have tried to called the manager who originally called us to tell us to self isolate, however when she answered she hung up on us straight away. It’s been eating away at me because of my anxiety and causing me to feel extremely stressed out about the situation. 

How do we explain it to them and not get into anymore trouble with the managers?

I’ve got an interesting electronic problem that I’ve never had before and have no idea if there is a resolution for:

A few days ago, I went to turn down the volume on my tv (Seiki - SE43FYP4). I couldn’t find the remote control, so I got up from my couch, walked over to the tv, and went to turn the volume down the old fashioned way. As I pressed the volume down button, I got a nice static shock in my finger that felt like it went up my entire arm, and the spark was visible. I stood there and stared at my finger for a moment before pressing the same button again. After the second press, the tv screen turned on.. which was weird because I didn’t actually notice the fact that when I got shocked, the tv turned off. I ended up eventually finding the remote but now basically the volume down button on my tv functions as a power button and the actual power button doesn’t appear to do anything. The remote control still functions as usual. I unplugged the tv for a substantial period of time, hoping to maybe reset the tv? But that didn’t change anything. Is there a solution for this, or did the shock change my tv for good? Thanks in advance and if anyone knows of a better sub for this, please let me know!",25Mar2020,1

450,"So here's relevant backstory: My girlfriend and I have lived together for about three years here in Michigan. I work part-time in a PetSmart grooming salon as a dog bather. She is a nurse at our local hospital.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Now, I have several mental health problems that I've been trying to work on with therapists, medication, and such but I am on the edge of being considered legally disabled and unable to work. Before the pandemic began I'd been on the edge of quitting my job as bathing dogs has gotten nearly impossible for me to do (I have contamination-based OCD). Management was also talking about giving dog bathers extra hours ""out on the floor"" which is something I've adamantly refused to do in the past. I used to work retail elsewhere. On a good day it makes me miserable. On a bad day, well, I've had several failed suicide attempts from bad days. I've been in worse shape mentally lately than I was back when that happened and was actively looking for a new job before the pandemic reached the states. I was even working with a supported employment program through community mental health to try and find one that would work but we hadn't found anything yet. If it didn't work out, I was about a month away from applying for disability. A few days ago our salon was shut down due to the coronavirus.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Yesterday I found out that PetSmart wants all of the salon staff to come back and work out on the floor or take a leave of absence. All of us. People have been using PetSmart as makeshift entertainment now that the state is shut down. Can't go to the movies or anything? Might as well take the family to PetSmart! They can still go to ""essential businesses"" so they think it's fine. It's been packed in there, busier than ever, and seemingly no one even tries at social distancing.  
My girlfriend and I had a fight this morning because I told her I probably wasn't going back. I essentially said, ""Even before this began I told you I'd never, ever work retail again. Hell, I was working on finding a new job and on the edge of outright quitting! Now that there's a pandemic, you think I go back in there and risk my health to work in a position I said I would never, ever do again for a company I was on the edge of quitting anyway? You think my life is worth $10.30 an hour!?""  
She responded with, ""I do think you should go back."" and got mad when I disagreed, said I was oppressing her and not letting her have an opinion (she's been on a kick of saying that any time I disagree with her lately).

453,"So, 

My head is spinning really and all over the place - I’m struggling to understand my thoughts and where they are coming from and how to deal and process them effectively. If anything I am hoping that typing them out will be a way for me to organise them and think a bit more rationally.

As the title suggests, on Saturday night / Sunday morning a girl I have been dating told me that she has an incurable STI, Herpes HSV2. Now I can already imagine the comments telling me that yes while it is an STI it’s not the end of the world etc etc and I completely understand that. A mix of taking the medication effectively and use of condoms can reduce the transmission rate significantly until it’s basically non existent. Cool. I get that. 

My issue however is the fact she simply did not tell me. And more to the point, allowed me to sleep with her without a condom - as I usually can be a bit overkill when using them when with a girl, it was her idea not to.

The fact she didn’t mention it to me before we got intimate is a huge red flag to me and quite frankly something I don’t think I can get over - trust is the pinnacle of any relationship to me really, and to have that destroyed I really don’t think I can get over it. 

However she appears to be really sorry about the whole thing - understandably really. When we spoke first about it on Sunday, she was in what seemed to be floods of tears to say the least on the phone. This was when I was just asking her “why did she not tell me?” “Was she ever going to tell me?” etc - I was not rude by any means , but I certainly wasn’t happy but did keep it calm. 

Anyway Monday I went and got tested, and was able to get my mind put to ease by the doctor - who basically solidified everything I read online that it wasn’t a life threatening thing, low transmission rates etc etc , and got the tests all done. 

I didn’t speak to her for since Sunday , as just trying to understand my thoughts and where my head was at. In the mean time she was bombarding my phone with messages and calls that I left unanswered - some more passive aggressive, others pleading me to respond.

It was this evening I noticed she had me blocked on all social media (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram) a bit of curiosity was I blocked on WhatsApp also, mixed with my conscience kicking in prompted me to message her, which she replied to almost immediately so I decided to call her. 

We were on the phone for nearly 3 and a half hours - the first chunk (2 hours or so) was just the general conversation we usually have , talking about sorts of things. I really do love talking with her as conversations flow so easily etc.

After a while and a few attempts of silence at my end (by just not speaking, she was filling them with anything that came into her head it seemed), she asked was there any reason why I called. To which I said just haven’t been speaking with you the last couple days, any reason for the blocks? And then the conversation went another direction.

We had a more honest conversation tonight, where she explained that the main reason she didn’t tell me was because “I didn’t want you to look at me differently, like I was dirty or something”. I explained to her that I know understand that the STI itself is not exactly as dangerous as I originally thought, but it was the fact that she didn’t say anything that really disappointed / hurt me. 

To my surprise she agreed with everything I was saying and continuously asked is there anything I can do ? She continued on saying that she really likes me and would absolutely hate to lose me from her life over something she didn’t have the balls to tell me, but if that was my decision that I didn’t want to see her anymore she would completely understand why. Also she said that didn’t want to try guilt / make me feel guilty or anything but she doesn’t have many good things in her life, but a thing she always did and always will love / cherish is her relationship and time with me to date along with a few other things.

I’m just completely at a loss. In the past I have put up with certain shit in relationships only to have it thrown back in my face and completely regret it - so I’m a bit cautious if being honest. 

My head is telling me that that is well and truly a bridge burnt - complete lack of respect on her part for me for not disclosing that information that potentially could of directly affected me for the rest of my life. I don’t know if I could ever truly trust her after that.

But on the flip side and for lack of a better term because I hate how cheesy it is, my heart is telling me to give another chance - people make mistakes, lord knows I’ve made my fair share. It’s really not that often I find a connection with someone like this, and she did appear to be genuinely sorry about the whole thing.

But I’m not sure , I told her I need time to think and she told me to take as much as I needed. 

Basically, what would you do? And I’m not asking as a random guy on the internet. Pretend you are in my shoes - is it a thing you could forgive? 

TLDR: girl didn’t tell me she has an STI. Don’t know what to do.",25Mar2020,1

Now later on I was in between homes, she felt bad and begged me to just crash there a night instead of having an uncertain home, we went back and forth about it to which i ultimately caved. My stupid self got caught again but he confronted me that time. He yelled and said get out to which i began to do so. Upon reaching the door however he blocked me. Now my now wife is 5”4 I’m 5”6-5”7 at that time I was a little malnourished because of my situation, he is 5”10 I believe and is about 200lbs maybe more. I asked him if he could move so that I could leave his home, he replied no so I got some short man strength and pushed him into the door frame so that I could leave. Later that night he and my SO who was only my gf at the time got into an argument and he called her a bunch of names one including a whore multiple times. Now fast forward almost three years, we are now married and we just had a baby girl. Her family is back in the picture after not being present for that span of time. Her father never looks me in the eye, acknowledges me or speaks to me, now I don’t care, I’m actually happy about that given how he handled his daughter on account of me. Now recently he told my wife that he wanted me to apologize for disrespecting him, except he wants to tell her so that she can tell me and so that I can go to him instead of him just telling me himself. Im a man and I have always taken it upon myself to apologize or tell a person when I have been offended. I have never been in a situation where a man wants me to apologize and won’t make it known himself. Also if she spends time over there to visit with our daughter I’m not with them, he doesn’t like me all that much and there is that tension in the air. Since I’m not there with them I don’t really get to talk to her much since her parents want to watch movies and play cards with her and all. I’m just wondering what you guys think about all of this and if you can offer any advice.",25Mar2020,1
458,"Has anyone successfully ""divorced"" their parents? I'm 6 months pregnant and have Sjourgens, with the Covid-19 outbreak, I am essentially quarantined until my due date in July. My Mother has been a Trump supporter from the get-go, parroting every Fox News phrase and conspiracy theory they have touted. Yet, I think this is my last straw with maintaining any type of relationship with her; she has not only sent me various pieces on how this virus was produced in a Chinese lab to hurt Americans, but she is in favor of the Trump's push to reopen the country by Easter...which will prevent the flattening of the curve, and cause at least one more wave of this shit.

I sent her articles on how NY hospitals are now refusing to allow anyone to support women during labor because of the lack of PPE, and she came back by saying, ""That's not going to happen and is a hoax."" This is my first child and the idea of not having my husband with me is unbearable to think about, and I have even started to worry about the hospitals being completely overrun by that time, forcing home births...etc. I did not plan on attempting that, in my wildest dreams, for my first. The rage and hatred I have for this cult that has overtaken the WH is relentless, and we haven't even reached the worst of it here in the US.

459,"One month ago my grandmother passed away due to complications from cancer. My grandfather has been alone in the house ever since, and I am honestly worried about him. He took the death very hard, and has been constantly saying he feels so lonely. I feel very sad for him and visit as often as I can, usually just on the weekends. Or when he calls and needs something, I get it done for him. 

Anyway, yesterday he called me and said he has a serious question for me, would I be willing to move in with him. He said rent free, just pay my part of the utilities, and most importantly keep him company. I would absolutely love to be there for him, but I have a husband and a 2-year old son. Our lifestyles are completely different and I feel it would cause a lot of tension and arguments if we were to move in with him. I would not want to just stay there myself and be away from my husband and son either.

I have been talking to my husband since, and he feels like moving in with him wouldn't be the best. My issue is how do I tell my grandpa that we can't? Or what other options could there be? I love my grandpa so much and hate seeing him this way, but I really feel like there's nothing I can do besides visiting him when I can.",25Mar2020,1

464,"hi, i'm in a filipino family that owns two dogs. one a mini pinscher and the other one is a hybrid chihuahua-pug. during two years of college, i was only able to see them for the holidays and unsure about the drastic changes they've gained. the pinscher has gone overweight and sleeps a lot while the pug has grown a tumor inside his mouth. they're not sick, since they're still active but the state of the pug concerns me more than a little bit.

the pug is roughly six years old and was given to us at a month old. his main object of affection is my mother since despite his condition he still rushes up to see her. these days he stays near her in any capacity but is forced away due to the tumor in his mouth. the tumor makes it so that his tongue has no room to stay inside. because of this, the pug's mouth emits a terrible smell. he also releases mucus and saliva more often with it having to be cleaned by someone. my mother rejects his affection because of the smell, but she shows affection when she's in the mood. 

seeing that the tumor has bloated close to his eye, i can't help but wonder if he's going to be okay. i know, ""why don't you remove the tumor from him?"" it's not like my mother didn't do anything. the pug is noted to be sensitive to anesthesia so even if we remove the tumor, he might not make it through the operation. so he lives life as if nothing's wrong which really bothers me. there's nothing i can do. there's nothing my mother wants to do. but the pug is content as long as he gets to be with my mother it seems. i know the inevitable will just happen whether i like it or not, but i don't know how to deal with the emotional build up to it.",25Mar2020,1
465,"Hello Reddit. I need your help/wisdom/opinion.

My name is James (a pseudonym - not real name). 10 years ago I came to the US from a country in South America to stay 7 months and do research at a government institute.

I arrived with broken English and little to no knowledge on the subject of race and racism in America, besides knowing that, in the past, people from Africa was enslaved, and so they were in my home country (but the history of people of African descent is very different in my country compared to in America afterthought that). For context, I am male, at the time I was 25 years old, and in my country I would be considered white, but in America I would be considered a Latino of a fair complexion. 

During my time at this institute I had a coworker named John (black man, late 30s). John is a really nice gentleman and we got along really well. 

Now let me explain what happened. On at least three occasions I made comments to John or in front of John that were Inappropriate considering the subject of race. 

1- Me, John, and another co-worker were in a car driving somewhere. The subject of dancing came up. I asked Aaron if he sang or danced, and added ... because aren't black people supposed to be funky and groovy? They all know how to sing. 

2- Me, John and a different co-worker (a lady) were taking during a break and the conversation turned to squirrels. The co-worker mentioned that she had black squirrels living in her front yars. I asked her if black squirrels moved or acted different than the normal squirrels, like black people are different than white people. The lady got really uncomfortable.  At that point I realized I might have said something inappropriate. I did not see a reaction from John and did not think much of it at the time. 

3- John and I were having lunch and I asked him if it was true that people black eat really like fried chicken. (I know - it it was allowed I would insert a facepalm emoji here). 

After 7 months in the US I returned to my home country. After changing careers I landed a job that transferred me to the US. I've been living in the US for 7 years now. During this time I have learned a lot about what is considered racist and about means to be black people in America, their history, and the Injustice they endure. (civil war, black wall street massacre, Rosa Parks, Eric Garner, etc.). I see now that the interactions I described above were extremely inappropriate, and some people would call them even racist. I think of those interactions often and cringe every time I recall my comments.

My question is: should I write to John apologizing for saying what I said before?

Or doing that would be self-serving, and I am just being selfish trying to write to him so I can feel better?

Also, it is possible that John doesn't even remember those interactions and it would be best not to bring them up. 

If you're are a black person in John's place, how would you feel about me reaching out to apologize?",25Mar2020,1

473,"So I moved out with my best friend from high school about 9 months ago, he's basically family and kinda adopted into mine, hes been there in the best and the worst of times and ive done the same, we've been talking about moving out for a while and I lost my job due to some bullshit and have 1 check and no car, my friend had a car and knew someone for cheap rent, we said fuck it and moved, first few months were good, we both got a dog and jobs, my roommate got a girlfriend and about after 4 months of dating and 1 breakup she was kicked out on short notice and had nowhere to go, my roommate lost his job and she had one, struggling to pay rent I was kinda forced into it and she moved in temporarily, when we first moved in my roommate took the actual room and I was stuck with the living room/ kitchen that was next to the bathroom and led to the front door and having dogs there was just no privacy, when my roommates girl moved in she had a dog and took in another cause it was abused, my room not having a door except the front door the dogs are always in my room tearing shit up cause their puppies so my shit gets destroyed and not his, ive gone through 2 beds and a couch and my current one is a little chewed up and that's just where I sleep, so we got 4 dogs and 3 people in a small ass place, their whole relationship is either fighting, yelling and having sex, its not a good relationship and not long ago it got really bad like borderline domestic abuse, not far enough to call police but could of easily escalated to it, that day I worked 10 hours and had a breakup at work and come home to them fighting, they burst into my room/kitchen and start to get a little physical, they trashed my room and spilt a half of a half gal of vodka on the floor but the next day made up, they never bothered to say anything about it to me, about a month ago I met this girl, as someone who has a hard time with women and haven't had many relationships and all of them were like really bad situations and no one on dating apps really hold a conversation or whatever and I met this one and we hit it off pretty well, we have alot in common and she's a nerd like me who watches anime does cosplays and dnd and video games and pretty cute, its pretty hard to come by girls like those and ones that actually like me back and one I feel like I can trust or be with for a while and actually have a decent relationship for once, she's just perfect but we are very alike and been through some shit as well, about a week ago some shit happened and she got kicked out of her house, she's been on the streets since and with the quarantine its rough out there and its been cold and rainy and I feel bad for her cause I'm sorta in a tweaker town and shes not like that but unfortunately has nowhere to go and has managed to get by, wanting to hangout since at this point we both like each other and she was about 10 minutes out and it was my last day off that week and she was trying to get a ride out here, while video chatting she said her ride might be there and hung up, me thinking her ride was there but her phone died I wasnt sure, on a whim I walked to our meeting point about 2 maybe 3 miles one way, I got there and she wasnt there, she never got a ride from her friend and it was for nothing but I needed go get out the house anyway, after working almost 4 10 hour days at work we finally hangout at my house after bribing my roommate 20 bucks I luckily found on the ground since im broke as well and the only one working due to my roommate not finding a job after months and his girl losing hers to the virus and can barely get by as it was, she comes over and of course in love with my puppy, they maul her at the door all playfully and one barking cause its a new person, they calm down and she's just focused on my dog still, my roommate takes all the dogs in his room and kinda stays in there like a bro, then my girl wanted to pet my dog so I asked if they could let her out and they said no, confused on why I couldnt see my own dog I thought there must be a good reason then my roommate said that my girl had to leave in like 2 hours all of a sudden when she was suppose to stay the night, we were both very sad in the fact he was kicking her out on the streets and that she had to leave and that she had to be in the cold and rain and possibly get arrested because of the quarantine and that she couldnt have a night with shelter, food and cuddles and she cried, we drop her off where we picked her up and crying on her way out and down the street and in the car my roommate finally speaks on the situation, this guy said that she couldn't stay because him and his girl thought she was hurting the dogs and that the dog's dont like her when in reality they heard a yip from their room when there was no yip, I was in the room and would of known if something happened to the dogs, my dog was playing with her and my roommates dog didn't mind her but she mostly wanted to pet my dog and that was why I could see my dog, I explained this to my roommate but he didnt care, he said she was crazy based off of like 1 conversation with her, his one red flag he mentioned was the fact she would look at me all cutely and say meow or grr and he referred to it as furry crap which it really isn't and she does it because she has anxiety and its calms her down a little, he even compared her to my toxic ex who is just a horrible person honestly and did some shit and still currently trying to ruin my life and trying to get me fired from my job for no reason pretty much, for something I didnt even do, he said she couldnt come over and that I had to go to her house, I told him she got kicked out a week ago and its been rough and he laughed and said get fucked I dont give a shit, my girls not crazy but someone u gotta get to know maybe, she's got depression, anxiety and adhd and maybe a little bipolar but who isn't a little depressed and has some anxiety and I grew up not to judge people off the bat, I can tell she's not gonna be fucked up like my past relationships, this ones different and I really do like her so this situation pains me more, since she left I havent been able to sleep at all, its 5am and inside a nice warm place but I'm missing something important my girl and while I'm sitting here I look outside and worry about her and her safety and comfort and I just know its rough out there for her, I told my friend from back home about the whole situation and he knows everything that's been happening since ive moved and he thinks its fucked up and he's in the wrong, he offered later in the summer to drive down and pick me up and my girl if everything goes well to move in with him near where I use to live and I know i could live with him cause I basically did at one point and he's a respectful and loyal person and a good guy and I know I won't have as many problems if any but I also dont wanna abandon my friend as much as I'm mad at him rn and its rough thinking about moving because I dont have much cash due to the virus and the only one here with a job and I dont have a car so ill have to get one before or soon after I move, ive had to pay my roommates ticket he got and insurance and registration since he drives me to work and he doesnt have money and I'm in a little debt with him that I need to pay back, the debt is from the move here and he helped me build a kick ass magic the gathering deck, I wanna move and maybe it will be better but i don't wanna lose a close friend and a brother pretty much, I just want us to all be friends because I know they can get along because shes so much like me and me and my roommate enjoy doing nerd stuff and so does she, I honestly have no clue what to do, life's been rough since I moved and I feel like I'm always getting the shit end of the stick especially since I spent all night after a 9 hour shift at 12am cleaning the house cause dogs reck it and just other stuff and spent all morning till like 5 after little sleep to clean more and fix a door my roommates broke when I was at work to make the house nice for her and to impress her a little and on top of things of unfairness my roommate and his girl are adding another girl I dont know into their relationship and spending the night after they kick out my girl over bullshit and I know I'm gonna spend all day sad and depressed about everything while all 3 of them lock themselves in their room and fuck all day like several hours, I have paper thin walls and its alot louder than my tv turned the fuck up, I never get sleep in my house in general cause of either dogs, sunlight, me being a natural night owl or them waking me up by talking because their loud people so I'm just tired from work and them and her living here and lack of sleep and the bullshit, my friend from home said that in getting pushed around and have no say at the house and its just some fucked shit, does anyone have any advice on what to do, I dont see things getting too much better and Idk how to see this girl that I really like and spend time with her anymore, I dont want to lose her and I want it to work and hes not making it easy at all, I just cant seem to catch a break or be with someone who actually makes me happy for once and I know i make her happy too",25Mar2020,1
474,"SO i hope this post doesn't get to long, but here goes. I work in retail at a time where only essential buisinesses are to stay open during this covid-19 crisis. I work overnights so i am aware that my risk of exposure is fairly low but i still am worried sick of bringing the virus home to my aging parents. I dont live at home but I live in the same neighborhood as they do and try to see them daily as we are very close. One of my parents recenly got over a battle with cancer a year and a half ago and they are both at the age range where they are in the at risk demo. I have asked around my place of work about what we are doing in any attempt to mitigate the risk of exposure that my employees who work with the general public face and i have not felt confident in my companys plans to protect its employees. I have heard that we are not permited to where gloves or masks as it makes the store apear unclean and may offend our customers. 

I recenly asked my store manager if we are planing on puting plexiglass sneeze guards on the registers as a way to atleast pretend to give a shit. ( I am aware that isnt a magic bullet and also didnt word it exacly like that) and she told me that it is no more dangerous than the flu and she has no plans on putting the guards up. on top of that other department managers have said there is no plan on what would happen if one employee does get sick as far as monitoring entire departments. Only shutting down the store for AT MOST 24 hours and cleaning everything.  

It has become more and more aware that my company has no plan to deal with this from a ""protect your employees"" standpoint. Im tired of constanly worrying when i going to get the old dry cough that will no doubt be a devastating illness to people that i care about. I love my job but as of right now i convinced that i will get this flu and Im not confortable with that. I have four months rent saved up and i am willing to qurantine myself to see what happens in the coming months but im scared.

My step dad works at a restaurant and was just put out of work as well due to the place closing for the time being.

I took my Macbook Pro for repair on Friday because its battery is buggered.  I'm a school teacher and haven't been able to get it repaired for months because I use it every single day for work; even without the coronavirus situation Friday was the end of term, so I'd planned this for ages.

Monday afternoon I get a call saying it's fixed.  There was only just a short space of time for me to go in and pick it up, and unfortunately I didn't have my wallet with me to pay for the repair and was away from home - so we agreed I'd pick it up on Tuesday morning.  Except the government closed all electronics shops on Monday night.  I have been in touch with the shop twice and they have confirmed that they cannot staff the shop and so there is absolutely no way to get the laptop back to me.

I am in a total mess about this and it's not really rational.

\- I feel incredibly guilty and stupid for taking the chance not only on handing in the repair on Friday given the pandemic situation but also for not having my wallet with me on Monday to pick it up that night - if I had, none of this would be an issue.  I actually spent five minutes earlier today repeatedly saying ""You shouldn't have done it"" under my breath.  I know this is not healthy but it is literally all I can think about.

\- My laptop is theoretically backed up to an external hard drive with Time Machine, and virtually everything critical is in the cloud.  However, I don't have any other Macs just lying around that I can get the files off it with, and my desktop PC refuses to recognise that the external hard drive even has a volume on - so now I'm worried that nothing has actually backed up at all.

\- I am in a mess over what to do in the interim.  I have the cash to just buy a new Macbook - but that is an enormous waste of money for something that in three weeks *could* be completely superfluous, although the uncertainty over the length of the lockdown means I don't have a clue how long this will be.  I was preparing for remote teaching by buying other new kit (mic/webcam/monitor) for working at home, but I can't use any of it properly without the laptop.  I can work from my desktop PC (which I am typing this on), but that's hooked up to the living room TV - my sofa is not a space to work from productively.  I have an iPad, but it's not really the same...

Essentially I think I just need a virtual slap round the face... I live on my own and know rationally that this is a pointless, nerdy moment of anxiety rather than anything that matters.  However, Redditors - if you have a sensible course of action I'm all ears.",25Mar2020,1

 first few months were good, we both got a dog and jobs, my roommate got a girlfriend and about after 4 months of dating and 1 breakup she was kicked out on short notice and had nowhere to go, my roommate lost his job and she had one, struggling to pay rent I was kinda forced into it and she moved in temporarily, when we first moved in my roommate took the actual room and I was stuck with the living room/ kitchen that was next to the bathroom and led to the front door and having dogs there was just no privacy

when my roommates girl moved in she had a dog and took in another cause it was abused, my room not having a door except the front door the dogs are always in my room tearing shit up cause their puppies so my shit gets destroyed and not his, ive gone through 2 beds and a couch and my current one is a little chewed up and that's just where I sleep, so we got 4 dogs and 3 people in a small ass place, their whole relationship is either fighting, yelling and having sex 

its not a good relationship and not long ago it got really bad like borderline domestic abuse, not far enough to call police but could of easily escalated to it, that day I worked 10 hours and had a breakup at work and come home to them fighting, they burst into my room/kitchen and start to get a little physical, they trashed my room and spilt a half of a half gal of vodka on the floor but the next day made up, they never bothered to say anything about it to me

 about a month ago I met this girl, as someone who has a hard time with women and haven't had many relationships and all of them were like really bad situations and no one on dating apps really hold a conversation or whatever and I met this one and we hit it off pretty well, we have alot in common and she's a nerd like me who watches anime does cosplays and dnd and video games and pretty cute, its pretty hard to come by girls like those and ones that actually like me back and one I feel like I can trust or be with for a while and actually have a decent relationship for once

 she's just perfect but we are very alike and been through some shit as well, about a week ago some shit happened and she got kicked out of her house, she's been on the streets since and with the quarantine its rough out there and its been cold and rainy and I feel bad for her cause I'm sorta in a tweaker town and shes not like that but unfortunately has nowhere to go and has managed to get by, wanting to hangout since at this point we both like each other and she was about 10 minutes out and it was my last day off that week and she was trying to get a ride out here

while video chatting she said her ride might be there and hung up, me thinking her ride was there but her phone died I wasnt sure, on a whim I walked to our meeting point about 2 maybe 3 miles one way, I got there and she wasnt there, she never got a ride from her friend and it was for nothing but I needed go get out the house anyway

 after working almost 4 10 hour days at work we finally hangout at my house after bribing my roommate 20 bucks I luckily found on the ground since im broke as well and the only one working due to my roommate not finding a job after months and his girl losing hers to the virus and can barely get by as it was, she comes over and of course in love with my puppy, they maul her at the door all playfully and one barking cause its a new person, they calm down and she's just focused on my dog still

 my roommate takes all the dogs in his room and kinda stays in there like a bro, then my girl wanted to pet my dog so I asked if they could let her out and they said no, confused on why I couldnt see my own dog I thought there must be a good reason then my roommate said that my girl had to leave in like 2 hours all of a sudden when she was suppose to stay the night

we were both very sad in the fact he was kicking her out on the streets and that she had to leave and that she had to be in the cold and rain and possibly get arrested because of the quarantine and that she couldnt have a night with shelter, food and cuddles and she cried, we drop her off where we picked her up and crying on her way out and down the street and in the car my roommate finally speaks on the situation

 this guy said that she couldn't stay because him and his girl thought she was hurting the dogs and that the dog's dont like her when in reality they heard a yip from their room when there was no yip, I was in the room and would of known if something happened to the dogs, my dog was playing with her and my roommates dog didn't mind her but she mostly wanted to pet my dog and that was why I could see my dog, I explained this to my roommate but he didnt care, he said she was crazy based off of like 1 conversation with her

 his one red flag he mentioned was the fact she would look at me all cutely and say meow or grr and he referred to it as furry crap which it really isn't and she does it because she has anxiety and its calms her down a little, he even compared her to my toxic ex who is just a horrible person honestly and did some shit and still currently trying to ruin my life and trying to get me fired from my job for no reason pretty much, for something I didnt even do

he said she couldnt come over and that I had to go to her house, I told him she got kicked out a week ago and its been rough and he laughed and said get fucked I dont give a shit, my girls not crazy but someone u gotta get to know maybe, she's got depression, anxiety and adhd and maybe a little bipolar but who isn't a little depressed and has some anxiety and I grew up not to judge people off the bat

I can tell she's not gonna be fucked up like my past relationships, this ones different and I really do like her so this situation pains me more, since she left I havent been able to sleep at all, its 5am and inside a nice warm place but I'm missing something important my girl and while I'm sitting here I look outside and worry about her and her safety and comfort and I just know its rough out there for her

I told my friend from back home about the whole situation and he knows everything that's been happening since ive moved and he thinks its fucked up and he's in the wrong, he offered later in the summer to drive down and pick me up and my girl if everything goes well to move in with him near where I use to live and I know i could live with him cause I basically did at one point and he's a respectful and loyal person and a good guy

I know I won't have as many problems if any but I also dont wanna abandon my friend as much as I'm mad at him rn and its rough thinking about moving because I dont have much cash due to the virus and the only one here with a job and I dont have a car so ill have to get one before or soon after I move

 ive had to pay my roommates ticket he got and insurance and registration since he drives me to work and he doesnt have money and I'm in a little debt with him that I need to pay back, the debt is from the move here and he helped me build a kick ass magic the gathering deck, I wanna move and maybe it will be better but i don't wanna lose a close friend and a brother pretty much

 I just want us to all be friends because I know they can get along because shes so much like me and me and my roommate enjoy doing nerd stuff and so does she, I honestly have no clue what to do, life's been rough since I moved and I feel like I'm always getting the shit end of the stick especially since I spent all night after a 9 hour shift at 12am cleaning the house cause dogs reck it and just other stuff and spent all morning till like 5 after little sleep to clean more and fix a door my roommates broke when I was at work to make the house nice for her and to impress her a little

on top of things of unfairness my roommate and his girl are adding another girl I dont know into their relationship and spending the night after they kick out my girl over bullshit and I know I'm gonna spend all day sad and depressed about everything while all 3 of them lock themselves in their room and fuck all day like several hours

 I have paper thin walls and its alot louder than my tv turned the fuck up, I never get sleep in my house in general cause of either dogs, sunlight, me being a natural night owl or them waking me up by talking because their loud people so I'm just tired from work and them and her living here and lack of sleep and the bullshit, my friend from home said that in getting pushed around and have no say at the house and its just some fucked shit

 does anyone have any advice on what to do, I dont see things getting too much better and Idk how to see this girl that I really like and spend time with her anymore, I dont want to lose her and I want it to work and hes not making it easy at all, I just cant seem to catch a break or be with someone who actually makes me happy for once and I know i make her happy too",25Mar2020,1
487,"My sister is a nurse and she came home crying last night. She was off work for about five days and then went back to work yesterday thinking there would be a lot of precautions in place, y'know with COVID and all...ever heard of it? Anyways, she went back to work and no one was practicing social distancing and nurses had absolutely no protection on. In fact, another hospital worker was wearing a mask (that they brought from home) and was told to either take it off or go home because they were increasing their risk of getting an infection by touching their mask (aka their faces). My sister has really bad asthma and I'm so worried about her getting sick. My mom hasn't slept in days. 

Is this normal for nurses to not have protection? We live in Canada and I know a lot of other hospitals have gear for the nurses to protect themselves. For instance, my cousin who works in Vancouver has a mask that is about as heavy-duty as a Darth Vader mask. Why do some hospitals have protection and others don't? Is there anything I can do (as a 22-year-old) to help my sister, perhaps there is someone I can call to address this issue?",25Mar2020,1

490,"I (20sF) met this boy (20sM) online and we started chatting. Honestly, it's only been 4 days, but we do talk for hours due to this quarantine (like yesterday we spoke from 12pm until 2.30am).

I really like him. I think he's so handsome and funny and cute and he's just so nice. He's not like a lot of boys that when you talk to them online they're really pushy for talking about sex and asking for nudes; he's really respectful and if things do get a bit sexual it feels natural rather than forced. It's safe to say that if there was no quarantine we would have met up by now.

We talk about a lot of stuff and I have a big crush on him (childish term, I know, but I didn't know how else to put it). And yes, I am well aware that the fact that I'm stuck in my flat all day every day with no one else around is definitely a factor in how much I like him.

The thing is, it feels a bit one sided. Like I ask him a lot of questions and he doesn't reciprocate? He's happy to talk, he loves answering questions and he will always make the effort to begin the conversation. But he never asks me about myself? He definitely seems interested in me, and if it is just a sex thing then, hey that's fine, but I'd like to know so I can get this crush under control.

Like I said, it's only been 4 days (we started talking on Saturday night at 8pm and it is now Wednesday at 1.30pm), so I'd feel weird talking to him about it.

So I guess what I'm asking is - does it seem like he's not interested? And if he does, is this an issue? Am I just waaaaay overthinking because I have nothing else to do all day? 

But any advice is appreciated - I really have no experience with this. I've always met people face to face before, so this is new to me. I wonder if quarantine dating is a thing or has a name?

TL;DR - been speaking to a guy online for 4 days and I like him but it seems a bit one sided.",25Mar2020,1
491,"Sorry for how the title sounds I promise it’s not like that. 

I have a cat that turns 3 next month, I got her as a kitten. And she followed everywhere, slept in my arms, and even is clingy to me to this day. 
Whenever I leave the house she screams and cries at the door. 
I have never had anxiety but whenever I leave her alone I get so anxious, and she had anxiety when I’m not here either. She will stress eat, sit at the window, and scream. We can hear her from outside. My boyfriend and I want to go on vacation but I get horribly anxious and sick thinking about leaving her. 

I don’t trust anyone with her, it’s even hard for me to let my boyfriend be with her when I’m gone, and we live together. We got her together. She is our baby together. It’s just because if something were to happen to her in their care I would go ape shit and never forgive them. 

Anyway, I keep seeing stories about cats dying. Or going missing. And my grandma recently got a kitten, and my uncles dog killed it. So I’ve been extra anxious lately. 

I love my cat so much and I honestly think when she dies I’ll consider killing myself too. I don’t think I’ll recover?

Anyway, I will just be having a normal day and then see her and think about the future and how she won’t be here with me. 

Our apartment had a fire awhile back and if I wasn’t home at the time she would’ve died. 
I’m not sure why but now my everyday life is full of anxiety because I’m scared of losing her.

492,"I’ve always grown up being a little sensitive and sometimes a little too caring about things. I’ve always cared very much about what people think of me and always want to have a positive image. I don’t like confrontation and sometimes people take advantage of the fact that I’m nice. I’ve been really struggling with my anxiety and depression and every little thing or “mistake” is making me very upset. At work I had a customer get upset about something and I literally had to take a break because I was crying so bad. It weighed on me the entire night and I couldn’t sleep thinking about how I didn’t do something good and worried about getting in trouble with my boss. 

It’s honestly exhausting. I’ve become super emotional to the point that any little comment or thing that happens sets me off and ruins my day. I wish I could let things be and not worry about everything but it’s very hard. I feel silly when my husband asks why I’m upset and it’s over something that’s really stupid or not worth getting upset about. 


How can I let these fears leave my mind? I want to leave work and not worry about taking my work stress home and want to be a more confident person but don’t know how to gain that confidence. I’m honestly very lost and broken down.",25Mar2020,1
493,"I[19M] live at home in the UK with my mum and about a year or two ago she opened up a catalogue in my name without my permission.

Coming up today she has 3 catalogues with a remainder of £1000 debt between them. I’ve paid around £400 of my own money to try and save my credit abit which obviously didn’t work. Because of COVID-19, my already part-time hours at work are being cut.

She claims she doesn’t have the money to repay them at the moment. This has been going on for a good few months claiming she has no money but yet always buying new non-essentials for the house. So it’s pretty clear that if she was to pay it back it would be in the next 10 years minimum as of the interest that gets added.

Most of my monthly wage is going on to this and it’s ruining me. I can’t afford driving lessons, I can’t save up for anything, I literally have no money at all. I’m going off to uni next year and I don’t feel comfortable leaving her to buy stuff for the house without me on her back.

About one year later I stop going to my therapist, but I still have anxiety and some days I suffer form depression symptoms. But all in all I have worked a lot on I feel way better.

After all this I depend a lot on my friends and school to get me out of the house. This became crucial for me to feel good most days.

I did do a good job cleaning.

498,"So some explaining - I currently live in Alaska, and although it’s my home state, I have not lived here for a while. I was sent here unexpectedly, so I ended up being forced to house with my grandparents, which is not fair on them. 

Alaska is expensive, fat from everything, and so hard to actually see people. College is expensive and not the best, and I have no money really at all, so it’s hard enough as is.

However, I thought of a plan. My best friend of 8 years lives in Utah, and will be going to college soon. Utah is easy to find a job in, at least compared to here, and the colleges are both cheaper and better. I would be on way less of a depressed suicidal spiral because I would actually have friends to hang with, and we could easily go and do crap together. We would also be able to split rent, which takes a huge burden of life away, at least a little.

I plan on working here for a bit and saving up what I can, then using that to move to Utah with all like 5 of my things, renting, and looking for a job. This would be in the future by a bit, so hopefully coronavirus would be less of an issue, but yea, that’s my theoretical plan.

The advice I’m seeking is this - how stupid is it? Advice for making it actually work? People from Utah able to help at all (around Provo I believe). And advice at all is helpful so thank you :)

tl;dr: I have no life here, and it would be healthier mentally and a lot easier to get into things like college in Utah than in Alaska. Any advice is appreciated :)",25Mar2020,1
499,"Okay, this is a mess, and I need help. I am F 18

I was good friends the boy (17) He is known for being.. I guess Horny. He does not seem like the type of guy to be in a relationship right of the bat. 

The girl (also 17) is in my grade, we talked quite a lot at that point, but not the 'good friend' type talk (not as much anymore). They didn't know each other - she got his snap though me. 

Long story short: They started talking, hit it off very well. They didn't date though, he asked she said no. I would think they were exclusive at that point, as they kept talking, and went on 'dates'. 

As with any other cheater, he... cheated. A lot. At new years, he kissed multiple people, I think he even got a blowjob from one. At the time they were still not 'boyfriend-girlfriend', but again - seemed exclusive. 

I am not the proudest to admit this, but I told her right away. She said very vividly to 'never talk to her again'. They did. Of course. His explanation was: 'We were drunk, so he 'didn't think straight'.' 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I had lost most (or all) respect I had for this guy. I declined a party invitation, I did not want to see him. The party happened, I didn't hear much about it. 

Until I met up with my friend that went to the party, about 3 weeks ago. She (another friend - let's call her X), and him had sex. For real. My only thought at the time was that X shouldn't have done that, but it was the guys' fault. But that's just him. He did stuff like that. 

I didn't tell her this time, I didn't have anything to do with it. And besides, as far as I knew, they weren't 'really exclusive.' 

&amp;#x200B;

 But well... today, I found out they were. He had sex with another girl while they were dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

**And here comes the actual question: Should I tell my friend that her boyfriend cheated. I don't talk to the guy anymore. At all. She knows he 'cheated' before, and still talked to him. But I feel like it's my responsibility, as I am the only mutual 'friend' that could tell her if he hasn't or won't do it. PLEASE HELP. I'm sure many people have had a problem like this.**

505,"Hello fellow people of reddit! I rarely make my own posts on here, but I'm really struggling right now.    

Some general information before we get down to the nitty gritty. I currently work at a residential facility for duel diagnosed kids, as a behavioral health tech. This means that I interfere if the kids are having behaviors. I do work overnights so I don't see all of the kids for the full 10 hour shift, but behaviors happen more often than you'd expect. Tonight there was a girl up at 1am and was wreaking havoc until the morning staff showed up. 

This was a job I was proud to take on (it being the first job I've had in my future career field), and I've been doing my best for the past 7 months that I've worked there. However, I struggle with anxiety. It was naive of me to believe I would be able to handle it the stress of this work. I had been improving so so much over the last few months, but then the last few weeks almost feels like a relapse. I feel like I've taken 1 big step forward and 2 steps back. 

It's just become too much. I've been bit, spit on, hit, kicked, called names, been told I'm hated, etc. Whenever I think about going to work, my mind just repeats 'i can't do this, I can't do this'. I understand it's a struggle with my mental health that's making me feel this way, and I'm currently trying to find a therapist, but I really can't get it out of my head that I need to switch jobs and that I really can't do it anymore, not even for 2 more weeks. I almost cried at work last night out of pure frustration and haven't shook the feeling since and this isn't the first time that's happened.

I feel guilty for even considering a job switch at a time like this, where people are getting laid off and can't find work. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. Absolutely everyone. I do have a backup plan for work, as Walmart is currently hiring overnights for a dollar less than I make now. They would want me to start almost immediately, according to someone I know who works there.

 Is it ok for me to quit for the sake of my mental health? Is this a case where I can quit without giving my 2 weeks notice? I've been very back and forth on it because it's something i would usually never consider doing because it's seen as unprofessional and I don't want to leave them hanging, but again, I'm having a really difficult time with this now and I feel like I just need to let go.

Tldr: I struggle with anxiety and my job is taking a toll on me mentally. Is it ok, even in a time like this with the virus, for me to quit and switch jobs? If so, is this a case where I can skip my 2 week notice?",25Mar2020,1

I live with my girlfriend and two others (a man and a woman, not a couple). For context, we live in BC, Canada. 

My gf and I have been doing our best to stay isolated in these weird times. We have foregone all social activities, all of our sports and the vast majority of outdoors time. The male roommate of ours has taken similar steps. The three of us have all had work cancelled.

Our female roommate, however, has not been taking things so seriously. She returned from an international trip on March 17 and went to work the next day, where she handles cash in multiple restaurants. She has been hanging out in groups of people (outside of work) on a daily basis.

A couple of nights ago I told her I thought she was being irresponsible when she was heading out to go skateboarding with friends. She rolled her eyes at me and gave me some reply about not lecturing her. Then her friend fell off their board and had to go to the hospital. Naturally (/s), my roommate felt it was critical for her to be there at the hospital with them.  I figured this would’ve been a wake up call, but she was with other people again the next day.

Yesterday, I had a conversation that turned into her screaming at me. Long story short: She doesn’t think she’s doing anything wrong. She accused me of being the one putting us at risk because we’ve been going for walks in a secluded area, and said that if she didn’t hang out with her friends she’d go crazy. Not a good conversation for the household dynamic.

They come home trying to give me hugs and I don't see them washing their hands.

my boyfriend of a year (we can call him john) lives in the UK. i live in the united states, and we have never met but are very much in love. i am 19 and he is 20, and he lives with his mother and step father. we are usually very happy, but something rubbed me the wrong way. 

we were texting one night and he tells me his sister (we can call her lily) comes home crying from their dad’s house. 

now, a little backstory about his father, he’s a drug addict and a bit crazy, they haven’t spoken much in 10 years and john sometimes gets texts from his father threatening to hurt his mother. 

i ask why, and he tells me that his father had kicked his own dog for a small, harmless bite on lily. then, he gets his shoes on and kicks the dog again until the dog starts crying. 

i tell him that it’s horrible, and he should do anything that he can to get the dog away from his father, or call animal control, or at least try to tell his mother to do something. his father is NOT fit to own an animal if he thinks that’s okay. 

after a bit of prompting, he tells me “sorry i’m not doing anything about it, but it’s not really our business. i don’t like that the dog is getting abused but i don’t know what you want me to do” he also told me his family is doing nothing as well. i asked him multiple times to ask his mother why she’s not doing anything, and he said “i’m sure she has a good reason” and keeps “forgetting” to ask. 

eventually he just says “it’s fine, you’re right, are we over this?”

524,"Hello everyone.

I'm 19, and I'm currently studying Civil Engineering. However, I had no desire to study this and I was forced to do so by my parents. I've studied the course for a year so far, and the second year of this 5 year course started this year.

However, I finally managed to convince my parents to allow me to let me do what I want. But the problem is, my university doesn't allow a course transfer to commence until next year. Basically, if I want to study Software Engineering, I have to study Civil Engineering for this year as well before I can start next year. 

So to sum things up, last year and this year's Civil Engineering will be thrown away if I transfer. Hence why I ask, do I continue and not let these two years go to waste? Or pursue what I want?

I'm very unsure about my life at the moment and where I'll be heading, but I know that throwing those 2 years away could be a grave mistake and maybe I should be sticking to it.

I'm thinking about starting to obtain a college level education for something in computers. All my life my whole family comes to me for tech questions and I try to give them the best advice I can.

528,"Hello r/Advice,

**Right now I feel that my life absolutely sucks.** I'm 28 and still live with my parents, I know this isn't the worst thing but it feels shitty/embarassing. I feel that I ruined every opportunity I've had and I blame myself for everything.  **I know that this is a bad mindset, and I'm trying to change it.** I've struggled with anxiety and depression all my life. **I've driven away the only happiness in my life.** I have a shit job, no degree. Only have a few friends, and I've been so depressed that I haven't talked to them in weeks. **I have a few goals**, that to me seem unattainable, but I still have them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get a new mental health professional(s)
2. Go back to university and finish my degree
3. Improve myself physically
4. **Be happy again**

Goal 1. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic finding help has been much more difficult, but I have been looking constantly, I hope to find someone soon. Finding someone has proven more difficult than I had imagined, but I'm working on it.

Goal 2. I went to university for mechanical engineering, made it about half way through and then had to drop due to mental health. There are no ABET accredited online courses so I have to find a way to both work full time and finish my degree. To be honest I'm not entirely sure this is possible due to the workload required for school. Also, with essentially zero free time I imagine it will be more difficult to achieve goal 3.

Goal 3. I want to work on myself physically as I feel it will help me mentally. I'm a 28yo man, 6'3"" \~175lbs. I'm not in bad shape, but I feel so ugly. I feel that I'm too thin, my cardio is shit and I want to feel confident about myself. I imagine it would do wonders for my self esteem. Unfortunately COVID-19 strikes again and all the gyms are closed right when I want to start on this self transformation journey.

Goal 4. Sounds easy enough, but damn. I had gone 28 years without being truly happy. I didn't realize that until I made the most wonderful friend in the world (through reddit amazingly enough) and was genuinely, truly, happy for once; but I feel that I drove them away and now I feel maybe even worse than I have all my life. Losing them made me want to start this life transformation process. It probably sounds dumb, but I want to change myself to be worthy of them lol. Yeah, yeah ""don't put people on a pedestal,"" I got ya, but wow it's hard not to when they change your life for the better for once.

Note: I am not suicidal, don't worry. I love my family too much to do that.

Anyhow, I appreciate any advice, similar experiences, stories or input you all have. Thanks a bunch, love - Voodoo",25Mar2020,1
529,"i’m really sorry how long and disorganized this is. 

so i got sick at the beginning of march with a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. my work announced employees could only call out if we had a positive test for coronavirus. at the same time, they were saying don’t come in if you are sick, but we are understaffed so we really need you to come in. to me, this is sending very mixed messages. in the end, we had many people coming to work very sick, traveling internationally, etc, all during february and march during the coronavirus pandemic. 

i am now isolating, but for this past month, it has been very hard on me, physically because i am sick, and mentally because i have so much guilt. (i already have a guilt-complex, and the state of things makes it worse.)

i don’t use social media a lot. i’m a female in my 20s. i never really talked to anyone on the phone or texted every day. i have friends and stuff, but somehow i’m a little socially different and don’t pick up on things or read between the lines on social media. it makes me feel dumb or it hurts my feelings when people respond on social media, but not to me directly. so i stay away from it. lately though (past 6 months), i put in effort to regularly respond to messages, reach out to people, etc. it’s overwhelming for me. my heart races and i sweat to the point i have to shower when i look at my phone. (i lock my phone in my cabinet while working or doing chores and when i’m done for the day, i don’t feel like looking at a screen anymore, so i never use it except to watch funny videos in the middle of the night when i don’t feel right responding to texts).

during march, i put in extra effort. it’s hard times and i wanna be there for my friends and family. when a friend asked how it was where i live, i sent a series of texts about my work situation and stress. they never answered which is okay. 

i haven’t been able to get any groceries and it hurt my physical/mental more. i couldn’t sleep and started getting shortness of breath and it felt like someone was holding and pressing my rib cage. i’ve never been through something like this and i was really scared. i feel bad that i scared my mom. there was a couple days i thought i was gonna die. i feel a lot better now but am still recovering. i am a chronic smoker (weed). i haven’t smoked in weeks and i am pretty sure i will never be able to smoke again. it’s hard idk

i was forced to go to work last friday, and almost got a bit by a car. i was standing on the sidewalk and the car just came plowing through the sidewalk, fence, and onto someone’s yard. i was in shock and just took a picture. everyone was ok and everyone at the scene was just acting dead inside, like emotionless 

the next day, there was a fire in the apartment below mine. my apartment was full of smoke for 3 days. it made my breathing worse again and gave me a migraine (i get them once a month).

a day or so after that, i was attacked in my parking garage. i was by myself so i defended myself using a knife i always carry. the man bent my thumb back and my knife broke when we fell directly on it. my thumb is sprained. other than that, i’m bruised up and i already have a new knife. 

things like this keep happening. it feels like i have bad luck or maybe that the state of the world makes things seem this way. 

i’m hard on myself and an over thinker. i feel like if i tell anyone what i’ve been dealing with this past month, they wouldn’t believe me or care. and i feel like i’ve caused everything. every day i am in some type of conflict. 

i have the sense that i have friends who are upset with me and i don’t want to communicate what i’m dealing with. i feel like saying “i’m in crisis, i need space” is not good because it seems i’m literally always in crisis. but i see it as i’m literally always trying to survive. a year ago at this time, i had bed bugs, and 6 months before that, my ceiling fell down on my in my apartment. my former company closed last year and it was a lot of pressure on me for about 6 months. 

i forgot to say a “viral infection” gave me pink eye during march. i haven’t touched my face or eyes or been around people but still blame myself. 

apparently my friends have been sharing good news online, which i obviously didn’t see. they texted me about it and i was supportive. i didn’t send paragraphs but i was happy for them. i noticed friends are also complaining about staying inside, that it’s unfair, that they don’t want to cancel things. i really can’t deal with that but try to remind myself everyone’s struggles are valid. 

i feel socially drained in a way, and at the same time, feel like i have no one. my feelings are hurt that people don’t respond to me but expect me to be 100% and attentive for them all the time regardless of what i go through. no one confronted me, i just feel this way, and am reconsidering how i handle relationships going forward.

i feel like i’m the friend constantly going away for a month to get my shit together.

i guess i’m trying to figure out is it reasonable for me to expect my friends to care? should i cut off all relationships until i get to a place where bad things don’t happen in my life? should i expect friends to deal with all of me, not just the thriving, funny side of me? 

i don’t think getting sick, having my neighbors catch their place on fire, or being attacked is my fault. 

i’m trying to be in the mindset, “if you don’t care, you are not my friend.”

i’m not expecting people to be attentive to me and i don’t need to vent my problems to people as everyone is dealing with a hard time right now. but if one friend said, “hey, hang in there.” or “hope you’re doing okay” would make a big difference to me. 

am i unreasonable for rather being alone/having no friends than dealing with this? as time goes on i just feel so hurt.

534,"The company I work for arrange IN HOME television installations for high street electrical retailers and Amazon. We are based in the U.K.

On Monday the PM announced we are going into lockdown measures, and people were only to go out for shopping’s for groceries, to the pharmacy and for a singular daily exercise activity...

and work, only where it cannot be done from home.

Which is where the problems begin. This was vague.

The company I work for initially did what I consider The Right Thing, by suspending all installations until restrictions are lifted, however today on my day off, I have been told by a colleague that one of the high street retailers we work with are still taking bookings from them (and only them), so we still need to find installers to go from their homes, into customers homes (mostly in London, the epicentre of COVID 19 in the U.K.), and repeat for potentially up to 10 installs a day... and then back home to where they live (outside of London)

I think this is socially, and morally, wrong. It’s putting public health at risk. I know my immediate line manager hasn’t pushed against this but wasn’t able to fight it, so I’m happy he’s tried, but our company’s CEO has accepted this order from the high street retailer in question, and I find that unacceptable.

537,"This is a weird and sad story. My father got divorced from my mother around seven years ago and it hit him hard. He started hoarding, got into debt, and became really involved in a evangelical church that he has been giving money to. I got to see this happen as I became a teenager and an adult. I'm however the child that still seems to care. I call him, visit him, and helped him clean his house.

However recently things changed. He called me to tell me about his new fibre optic internet which he is very proud of. The conversation went well at first until he told me. ""(My name) the dating world it's scary."" Which then started the weird and sad part of the conversation. He told me that after the divorce he learned that you can't be the nice person who just lets your wife do anything. Apparently you have to treat women like dogs and restrict them. This was a full heel turn on my dad's part as he always raised me to be empathetic and not an incel. He then went on to describe his dating life in his 60's while I blanked out and accidentally said ""I probably won't treat the next man or woman I date like a dog."" This stopped him in his tracks and he asked me if I was gay. I then explained to him that I'm bisexual (maybe pan). He then told me he loved me and hung up.

539,"I don’t really know where to start. I’ll try to keep it brief.

My girlfriend cheated on me. It sucked, I went through the emotions, I’ve had to time process it. This was a little over a month ago. I decided to stick with her and work things out.

When I found out she cheated on me, it was with a kid that she’d met maybe a month or two after her and I had started what was supposed to be a “casual” relationship. We ended up falling in love with each other. I know she loves me, I know I love her, we’ve spent countless hours talking and getting to the bottom of the situation. 

The problem is that the guy she cheated on me with was one of the most evil individuals I’ve ever heard of in my days on this planet. I spoke to him personally through Instagram messages, at first things were civil. I just wanted to ask him some things to get closure, and he wanted to know some things on my end (to his knowledge, he and my girlfriend were exclusive. I knew about this kid and that she was fucking him when her and I were a casual thing. We started dating, and she led me to believe she was done talking the the kid, but she apparently wasn’t.) 

The kid starts to send me stuff that I took personally. Messages between her and him, messages of her saying sexually infused things. He starts telling me that I was always second best behind him. A whole bunch of shit.

He then tells me how he once laid hands on her. He threatens to send a video of him fucking her to me and to her brother. Says all of these horrible things about her like that she’s essentially just a “hole” for him to put his dick in, and that he never cared about her. He told me he deserved an explanation for what she did to him, and that he was going to get it. Meanwhile I’m with her trying to work things out and this kid is telling me that it’s his time to see her and that he’s coming to pick her up from her dorm.

I knew the kid was a serious danger—he literally told her that if he gets the chance to talk to her, he’ll “hit her just like her dad used to”. I didn’t give her the opportunity to meet with him to give him any sort of closure about the situation. 

He continued talking shit to me, I talked shit to him, he sent me his address, told me to pull up on him so we could “settle it like men”. I didn’t do that because it was pointless. The conversation I was having with him was supposed to be us settling it “like men” but this abusive, manipulative psychopath just wanted to fight.

Him and I went back and forth on IG DMs for hours that day. I said some things I wish I didn’t, but I said them in retaliation to what he was saying to me—I reacted out of emotion; anger and serious frustration. But I never incriminated myself in any way. I never have, and never would lay a hand on ANY woman, especially the only woman I’ve ever truly been in love with. But this sick fuck? The messages he sent me were disgustingly misogynistic, abusive, and harassing. 

I was by my girlfriends side while all of this was happening out of a genuine fear for her LIFE. This guy admitted that he does the same thing to all the freshman girls at our university. He manipulates them and abuses them, he tells them he’s in love with them, and then asks for their sympathy after he fucks something up. Example—He laid hands on her, and afterwards, he made HIMSELF seem like the victim. He said he just felt “so bad” about what he did, that he told her he was going to kill himself minutes after he hit her. That’s what he said. He gave her an ultimatum of “you’re going to forgive me for choking you and hitting you, otherwise I’m going to kill myself.” 

After this entire situation unfolded, I deleted the Instagram messages because I didn’t want to see the DMs any longer when I logged on to Instagram. I was frustrated, deeply hurt by what happened, and just wanted to do anything to forget about it.

I now regret that.

These messages were damning evidence of the harm and abuse this shitty excuse of a “man” caused not only to my girlfriend, but to MANY other girls.

So yes, while I was traumatized about the fact that my girlfriend cheated on me, the person she was “in love” with was this guy’s fake persona, and he knew it. From the very beginning his plan was to masterfully manipulate this poor girl, and she completely fell for it. She opened up to him about a lot of things, and he took it and used it against her.

I tried to report to Instagram about the situation and how I deleted those messages, and asked if there was any possible way to retrieve them again, because they are super incriminating (which I didn’t realize at the time I deleted them). She still has screenshots of some text messages and snap messages from him that prove how sick he really is. But the IG messages include him admitting to laying hands on her, threatening to send videos of him fucking her, him expressing his deeply held misogynistic views, etc etc.

Instagram never got back to me, and I tried to bring this to their attention a month ago.

Is there any way I can try to retrieve these messages? And in the event we do retrieve them, how do we go about reporting his crimes to the local police? She feels no attachment of any kind to him, she feels like she was crushed and used. I feel crushed because my girlfriend cheated on me, but also because she’s a victim of serious torment. So while I can be upset at her for being in love with something else while we were together, I love her too dearly to just allow this guy to get away empty handed. She’s not his only victim. This piece of shit needs to be brought to justice.

Any advice on this situation would be outstandingly appreciated. Thank you.",25Mar2020,1

543,"I have been doing a lot of research around the web and I got into the idea of building a PC. I do own a Xbox and I play on it frequently but there are a lot of games that I cannot play on Xbox that I could on PC. Now because I own a Xbox, my parents don't understand my want for a PC as my Xbox works just fine. I try to tell them it is for games that I cannot access on my Xbox but they do not seem to understand. They also back up their answer of ""No"" by saying that PC gaming was the alternative option to console gaming back when they were kids. I don't want to call them old or anything but that is the exact opposite of what it is today. I also have told them that I will pay for everything as I have a job this summer and I have plenty of money in my bank account from the last summer to be able to support this build. I will probably spend around $850 on the whole set-up but no matter what I tell them they say things like, ""You are only 15, you are not old enough to make big decisions like that"", ""You have an Xbox, what is the point"", ""When I was younger PC gaming was worse than console gaming"", etc. My dad does not seem to mind as much as my mum but when my mum is around he seems to join her on reasons to say ""No"". Also, my dad is not fully in on the idea of it, he just tells me some things that he knows about computers as he enjoys my interest in the idea, just not the money spending part. I have decided if I am to build the PC, I will probably build it in the middle to late summer time. I just wanted to know if anyone has any experiences like this and if anyone has tips on how to convince them.

It ruins a lot of my free time, I constantly feel like I could be doing something better with my time which leads me to not enjoy the thing I am currently doing, this applys to every sort of entertainment for me, video games, books, movies, you name it.

549,"I've seen studies which showed women consider 80% men below-average, whereas men were a lot fairer when it came to rating female attractiveness. This would back up my own experiences. Women won't look twice at you unless you have male model good looks. Women are naturally hypergamous,  which means it's in their makeup to ""date/marry up"" be it in terms of looks or social status. Personality matters too, of course, but not in the way most people think. I'll come to that in a mo.

Let's get a few things out the way:

&gt;Change your attitude

See this one a lot. Changing one's attitude won't change the fact that the genetic and social lottery determines a person's looks, charisma, and status. Now there might be guys who have dry spells but are perfectly capable of attracting a woman if they make an effort. That's not the same as guys who are literally lost causes because they lack the physical characteristics, charisma or social intelligence to play the game.

&gt;Just be nice

Men are attracted to ""nice"" women, but women are not attracted to ""nice"" men. Studies have shown that women are the most attracted to narcissistic, manipulative and psychopathic men (also known as the dark triad personality). Men like this are superficially charming, hypermasculine and emotionally unavailable. Women would rather risk getting into toxic or abusive relationship with a badboy than be bored to death by a nice guy.

&gt;Go to the gym

I already work out every other day. Obviously, fitness is beneficial for health reasons but gymmaxxing won't improve your chances of attracting a woman if you aren't naturally good-looking (attractive face, tall stature, good frame). There are plenty of scrawny male-models who have never lifted a weight in their life.",25Mar2020,1
550,"I worked in hr for about five weeks before I was laid off for a hotel. One week before I was laid off I was temporarily laid off for two weeks however, I mentioned that I expected this because before the two week temporary lay-off, we were told that everyone would have their hours cut.

I received a phone call from the director and they told me that it wasn’t a good fit for either of us. I ask if it’s a lay-off or termination but they don’t give me a direct answer except that I was withing the 90 period.

I go in to collect my stuff and have a deeper conversation. My position is being eliminated, she did not say this before over the phone. She feels that I was too advanced for position, it was very entry level - Im working towards my mba part-time. I realized that I was overpaid for the position. She said they had high expectations for me starting out as if I disappointed them but I did everything I was asked and worked well with the team. There were maybe incidents where it would take me a bit longer to complete a task but I was still training and didn’t think it was a big deal. 

She recommended that I file for unemployment and I did but I still feel wierd about the conversation. Has anyone else been laid off like that? Any advice? Thanks in advance!",25Mar2020,1

555,"When my friend (Lana) started dating a guy (Mitch) over a year ago, she was showing me pictures of him like most girl friends do.

When I met him I jokingly said something along the lines of ""you look better than on Facebook"", I have a deprecating sense of humour and I also use it on myself very frequently as well and this was me being me and joking around. 
I often do this with people when I meet then because I'm a person who jokes around a lot, I thought of it as a way to call him attractive but apparently he didn't take it that way.

The other day Lana told me that Mitch was insistent that he was ugly and as an example of people who find him unattractive he used me and said ""when luckycrocodile met me she said that I was unattractive"" and my friend explained to him that I was joking, he wasn't buying it.

556,"About a month ago, I had my dental crown redone because I didn't like the shade of it. It was quite dark and it was affecting my self-esteem. My dentist and I picked out a shade together for the new crown, and I was sure I was going to like it because the temporary crown was my ideal shade. 

When the permanent crown was ready, I went in to see it, and I found that it was yellower than the temporary. I notified my dentist of this and that I wanted it to be lighter, and she was upset, saying that it was the best possible shade and had me actually sign a statement saying this. I told her that I wanted the crown lighter, but she said that if it was made any lighter then it would look bad. I disagreed, but asked if it could be ""toned down,"" by which I really meant lighter, and didn't want her to say it would look bad again. I also asked for the crown to be ""in between"" the temporary and the permanent crown shades, so I figured the lab could only make it lighter.

I went in about a week later to see the new crown, and I immediately noticed it was less yellow, so I approved it. However when I saw it at home in different lighting, I found that it was darker and greyer than both the temporary and first permanent crown. I was upset. One week later, I gathered up the courage to call my dentist and tell her I didn't like it, and that I preferred the 1st permanent crown. When I went in to her office to discuss this, she told me that my tooth underneath the crown is weak from cementing the crowns and having a previous root canal, and that it could possibly break if it is redone again. My dad went in a couple weeks later for a hygiene appointment and told her that I really didn't like the crown and wanted it redone, and the dental hygienist said, ""We want her to be happy. The dentist will have a discussion with her when she comes in for her next appointment."" Should I continue to pursue this with my dentist or try to live with this crown?",25Mar2020,1
557,"Let's see.... how would I explain this? This is gonna take awhile. I'm sorry.

To summarize, I feel my mental condition growing worse and worse as the weeks go by (sort of). Most of this is due to school, which is a vicious cycle of despair, and the other is because of a person, which I will explain later.

A little bit about me first. I am 16, male, and as some people say, smart. I am a jazz pianist. I take classes at a local community college because I was able to place into them two years ago because I'm ""smart."" (I'm not trying to sound like I am bragging. This was my decision, and it had a detrimental effect on me later on). I greatly enjoy these college classes actually, I am learning so much and it is way more fun than the educational environment which I am used to. You see, I was homeschooled all my life. This wasn't much of an issue until I got older. I think the great thing about me having been homeschooled at a young age was that it really taught me how to think, not necessarily \*what\* to think, as a traditional public school would teach. I hate to say it like this because I feel like I am bragging, but I noticed that most people around my age did not quite have this ability. I was able to figure things out in minutes when other people took hours to do it while constantly having to refer to their textbooks. But this is where the first issue comes in. With this ability came laziness. I never really felt the need to study for anything because  1) I was homeschooled, and  2) I could usually just figure everything out when I got to it, it's not that hard. This issue really came into play when I started taking these college classes. I was fourteen, I had never been to an actual high school. I thought it would be the same old story: figure the shit out when I get to it. Fatal mistake. It started out just like I was used to. My first two semesters were easy; simply English composition, and engineering. I am very familiar with engineering, so it was a breeze. But the summer after my second semester, my grandfather passed away. I had to go to Spain for his funeral, and I got back too late to do the classes I normally would have taken for engineering. Instead, I decided to take business, communications (I fucking hated that class with a passion), and marketing because they were shorter hybrid courses, and they started a little later into the semester. That semester made me realize what I really wanted to be. Not an engineer, but an entrepreneur (it sounds ridiculous, I know). The problem is that I was unfamiliar with these concepts, so I actually had to study like a normal person. I was very unfamiliar with sitting my ass down at a desk and actually studying for specific intervals of time, because I I was so used to just figuring things out. I would just sit at my desk, getting distracted with my thoughts and stare at the textbook without actually taking in information. My grades worsened, this made my mom mad (I can't blame her), which made me hate school more, and thus try to avoid studying  in the form of excessive procrastination. My grades in business and communications were alright, and I had barely passed marketing (to be fair, I had one of the highest scores in the class, the professor was not very good. My classmates and I all agreed on this). Now, it is my fourth semester, I take chemistry, AutoCAD, and calculus. Don't get me wrong, I still love the classes, it's just that my test scores are not exactly up to par. I am learning a lot though. Studying is the worst part, as it is complete torture for me. I get distracted, my test grades are bad, my mom gets mad at me, thus I hate studying even more, and the cycle just repeats itself. I got a 56 on my last calc test, and now I don't have the willpower to really study anything anymore. Now with the COVID-19 outbreak, I have more responsibility on my back, now that all the classes are online. I really do not know what to do about it, and I  just keeps getting worse and worse. I feel like a huge mess (I know there are people in worse situations out there). I just want to graduate and be done with school, but I know that the real world is just as difficult, if not more so.

The other, completely unrelated issue, is with a person. I've known her for quite awhile actually, and she is an amazing person, and I grew to really like her. A lot. I hate to admit this because I'm always afraid people will ridicule me for it. Now, I only see her for three months every year (wow, now that I put it like that it doesn't seem so bad), because we perform in this professional ballet together every Christmas time ( I'm not a dancer, they just need boys to perform). We did get pretty close though, there WAS some attraction between us (again, it feels awkward saying this). It felt like she was the one. Then the New Year came and we haven't seen each other or talked since. I really miss her. I don't want to really message her in fear that I might bother her, and I have a feeling it may be the same with her. I'm sure most of you guys out there know the feeling of missing someone badly, so I won't go much into detail. But, of course, it has made me sort of irritable and cranky. Now, I like to sit at the piano more than ever just pouring my heart and soul out (I actually learned a jazz cover of the song Heart and Soul, haha). It helps me cope. I don't know what else to say about this so I'll end this part here.

So yeah, uhhhh, that. that was more of a rant than anything else, and I deeply apologize for it. Thank you for your patience and advice. You guys are awesome.

I can't risk of opening the laptop myself because I'm not a pc hardware kind of person myself. What I did before going to sleep last night was spray on a piece of cloth then placed my laptop on top of it. This has happened to me but on my modem. I did the same fabric trick and a few hours later, all the ants were dead. But it wasn't the same for my laptop. This morning, only very few ants were dead. Probably around 3. The whole day, I played on my laptop to keep it hot and some ants started to go out. I'm afraid that there are still ants inside but I don't know what to do and my anxiety has been high ever since.

Basically, I have the tiny bedroom in the house and it's right in the middle so I hear a lot of stuff like someone using the bathroom right beside my room which is a little awkward so I usually keep the TV on to counter this.

My son is just finally getting over a cold he’s had for almost two weeks (not COVID based on symptoms, but he hasn’t been tested and is feeling okay). My ex is insisting that our son fly up to be with him for Spring Break, or as soon as he’s no longer coughing, despite both of our states being under a Stay-At-Home order.

This left me in a bad situation: I thought I was unemployed by both jobs. So, I rang both of my bosses and asked them am I on the payroll, because otherwise I think I'm getting no income for the foreseeable future. They both said they would get back to me. 

Basically, they both rang back 2 days ago to tell me they will both keep me on the payroll. I was feeling a bit wobbly about this ethically, but since they both decided that I was entitled to it I was okay. Until today, my new job rang to inform me that I'm now in furlough, and said to make sure I'm not on any other pay roll, because when the government scheme which agrees to pay 80% of peoples wages begins, they will notice I'm on both pay schemes, and it might cause problems.

They left a day before my country urged everyone to return and spent a week in a resort not caring what was happening back home. They spent 6 days on notice to get ready and go as soon as the airline called with available seats for them. My dad sent me pictures of his vacation while I was working my ass off to help keep my store open while everyone was leaving to isolate. I responded back demanding that he isolate when/if he got home because people are not taking it as seriously as they should, telling him that things will get back to normal faster if everyone does their part.

At first I was scared for him, thinking about how he can't handle being shuffled through airports and checkpoints because he's kind of old and honestly naive, but then he sent me a picture of a cancer victim with my dad's distinctive beard drawn on. The family member he was with told my brother that my dad was sick as a dog and then sent that picture. So obviously they think it's a joke. I had choice words for them.

They just arrived last night and now are planning to travel, either by plane or car, to go to their hometown and they want my brother to come (he lives with my dad still).

578,"Here for help no matter what political party! I want everyone's advice!

My mom and I are very close. I'm very passionate about politics because it heavily influences my (22M) future. We've had so many productive political conversations and agreed on EVERYTHING. If I had to give myself a label (I try not to) I'd lean liberal.

About 3 weeks ago my mom got a TV in her office lobby (she works as a financial advisor who is considered essential to the economy therefore her work wont close during this lockdown). She leaves it on the news 8 hours a day for ""white noise"" while she works. Everybody knows what that can do to a person, especially this day in age, and out of nowhere last night she said to me: ""Have you heard how the Democrats are trying to sneak legislatures and bills by Trump while this pandemic has everyone's attention?""

WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF MARIO KART DOUBLE DASH AND I IMMEDIATELY DROPPED MY CONTROLLER AND FUCKING FROZE. That sentence shell shocked me to hear from the most selfless, open minded, accepting, kind-hearted woman I've ever known. It'd be different if she asked for my opinion in a casual manner and was just curious per usual, but knowing my beliefs and stance? I was so taken back by the aggressive way she worded it because that's not her at all. 

I wound up saying I dont know and she kept going on about more extreme right beliefs which are SO out of character for her but I wasnt paying attention at that point. We proceeded to go to bed and I didnt sleep at all. I'm not one to be easily offended but this is the last thing I expected to hear her say.

I get some people might think I'm blowing this out of proportion but me and my future children's future is something I'm going to fight for now and after this situation I dont know how to talk about it or how to even act normal around her right now.

 He just posted a spotify song on his insta story saying he was depressed basically and hes been this way for a few days.
I'm not too close to him because we met online and irl like 2 times but i really want to call him and ask if hes ok.

Whats stopping me : 
1) i had to initiate our next date after he couldnt make the last one  
2) i have asked if he wanted to talk abt it on text 2x but he replied w maybe later both times

I'm scared that he may think im being too clingy or nosy bc of my attempts and i just really dont want to fuck it up.

should i just call n ask if hes ok or give him space and ask him on our next date?

yes im an overthinker n i rlly like him oop",25Mar2020,1

Anyways we only spoke occasionally over Instagram or snapchat and that turned into only texting when some occation occured like a birthday or graduation. I've always had a feeling he had a crush on me but I had a crush on his brother who was 2 years older then me so I never gave it mind. 

suddenly a year and a half ago he texted me our ages were 16 and 19 and we stayed texting for awhile which grew into calls. He has always been dubbed as the ""nice"" or ""good"" brother of his family. . and it was true he was always really nice. I started to grow feelings for him due to that fact and how he spoke to me. And he told me he had liked me ever since we were young which was weird because the age difference and he had a girlfriend at the time he was still near me. They broke up after he moved. 

Our relationship began to grow quickly because I liked him too. He would always facetime me and talk about visiting me which he did at one point until he just stopped. Ghosted. Never replied to me again after one day we hadn't even had an argument or anything. I cried for months about this because I like to be told reasons like it wouldnt have hurt so bad if he had told me. And since then I got a bf but I still think about it. He didn't block me on anything so I could see his post still but he just never talked to me again.

we hung out one day where he asked to kiss me. i said i don’t know, and he kissed me anyway. 

after that, i stopped responding. he kept texting me inappropriate stuff. “you couldn’t handle my cock. drool on it like your mouthpiece.” (i play saxophone so he constantly makes references) “you couldn’t handle my shit. i’ll make you gush. fuck.” 

after advice from my employer, i told him i didn’t want to talk to him and he left me alone for a few months. then, he texted me again, “your pussy wet? just tell me. can you still deepthroat that sax? i’ll make you gush.” he also called me three times. my boyfriend told him if he ever got near me he would beat the shit out of him, and the guy said okay. 

a month later, he adds me on facebook. he also has a girlfriend, and i haven’t added him, but at first i thought that would be a good sign. apparently, though, he texted me that stuff a month ago while they were together.

So i live in a state that is not being impacted really hard by COVID-19 &gt;100 case and none in the county i work in. But my work place is getting ready to roll out a plan where they are going to bring showers and trailers on site and ""sequester"" us to come on site and stay for 14 days, no leaving or going home we live on site for 14 days. As of now no one know what the pay would look like IF they would even pay us any more, I am salary. This would cause my wife to have to stop working her job where she is getting paid hazard pay and drive time and mileage to work since she is needed that much. We could lose out on thousands, on top of that it would put her at home for 14 days with the kids without any help or break. I have never heard of this happening before but can they really force this? Could i lose my job if i tell them no? It has us really stressed.

Another point is they are not testing people, they just think if we get them on site they cant leave, they can't get COVID-19 but if someone comes in with it and no sign of it then we are more prone to it there vs just staying at home and working from home which is what we are doing now.",25Mar2020,1

Today, the mayor of Los Angeles threatened to shut off water and power to businesses that remain open.

Sure, I don't want the coronavirus. I dont want to sprrad it. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not grouping up with others. But I'm much more scared of losing my livelihood, the immense debt we're sinking further into, and the government infringing on our rights.

It frustrates me to the point of nausea that people are so afraid of this virus, they're willing to lock themselves in for months to get the virus. The original goal was to flatten the curve but now people seem to think the virus will just go away if we wait long enough. If we wait past April our economy will be in shambles. Almost nobody will have a job. Our government can't print enough magic money to make that go away. People won't be able to feed their families. Quality of life will plummet. People will die.

593,"Hi everyone

So I've been in the market for  a new gaming laptop, and I've run aground somewhat. I'm hoping that the ever-wise users of r/advice can give me some advice on what to do.

I bought a Razer Blade 2018 model through Amazon Warehouse for £1,000, which I understand is their way of selling returned or used goods. The laptop runs extremely hot, and so I have a strong suspicion it is near the end of its life. On this basis, I did not think keeping it would be a   sensible choice.

While deciding what to do about the Razer laptop I went ahead and bought a £1,000 Acer  Predator  laptop from a third-party seller fulfilled by Amazon. This laptop, while better in many ways, has a very loud fan, and I am not sure if it is working correctly. This, coupled with the obnoxious 'gamer' styling of the laptop, has led me to no longer want the laptop.

Normally I would take solace in Amazon's excellent customer service, but unfortunately I have a high number of returns on my account, and I have previously received an email saying that if my high number of returns continued my account would be cancelled. From some research, it seems it is very hard to continue using Amazon if the account is cancelled, if at all. I use Amazon a lot, and it would be a huge pain if I were no longer able to use the system.

As I was worrying about all this I spoke to a customer service representative at Amazon through chat, who told me that because of the high number of returns on my account there was a good chance that the returns would be reviewed, and if there were large faults found with the item the account would not be closed, but if there were not large faults found, the  account would be closed. When I expressed my concern to the representative he told me that he would annotate my concern on the account, and he reassured me that the account would not be closed. However I remain concerned - there are a lot of years left of my life, and not having an Amazon account would be a huge annoyance!

So I would like to ask your help: Which of the following actions should I pursue:

a) Return both laptops to Amazon and take my chances with their customer service team

b)   Sell the laptops through eBay and get as high a price for them as I can, accepting that I will lose some money in the process, but hopefully will keep my Amazon account

c) Some other option I have not yet thought of?

Many thanks in advance for your help!",25Mar2020,1

I’m currently at the end of my master’s, I’m 28, female, have good grades and did some internships and jobs next to uni.

I lived off a student loan and any job I found which means I have a nice 50k student loan debt after six years of uni. My parents didn’t support me (financially or otherwise). Not that I’d expect it now but when I started in 2013 it would have been nice.

Anyhow due to Corona a lot of my job prospects are gone, both full-time and part-time. I just got rid of my apartment (currently living with boyfriend) so I’d say I need 500 a month to pay for food, insurance. I’d need 1000 to pay off my loan.

I’m in a pretty bad place mentally due to a lot of things and I’m basically asking - help, what can I do?

By the way, all kinds of small jobs in the area are gone due to corona, as well.

597,"The title pretty much explains the problem. I live in an area where a stay at home order has recently been put into effect. Cases in my city are increasing exponentially, and I'm pretty worried about it. My roommate and I are both pretty healthy 20-year-olds, except I have respiratory issues, which greatly increase my chances of having serious symptoms if I get COVID-19.

The stay at home order was put into effect yesterday, but for the past week, we weren't really supposed to go places for nonessential travel. She hasn't been following it, but I hoped since the stay at home order has been issued, she'd actually start social distancing now. If anything, it seems like she's being more social. She invited her friend to stay with us for a week, she has plans to hang out with other people pretty much every day, she's meeting up with groups of people to go hiking, another one of her friends is coming over tomorrow to cook dinner for her.

I've brought up a lot of times the past week that I'd like her to not see as many people outside of our ""household"" during this time, given both my elevated risk and also just to follow social distancing that everyone is supposed to be practicing right now. She always brushes it off and says even if she gets it nothing would happen, we'd be fine, and I keep reminding her I have health problems that would make it much worse for me. She keeps ignoring my requests for her to stay in.

Last night, I straight up told her I don't want her to keep seeing people and that I am especially not comfortable with someone else coming into our apartment, but she once again just brushes it off and says we'll be fine. I've told her the fatality rate for people with my health issues, told her I am not comfortable with her choosing to risk my life to keep hanging out with people, but she won't listen. I do not have the option to go home to stay with my parents right now, and there's no one here I can stay with that would be more accommodating to my health.

My friend is temporarily living in his mothers house because an appliance caught on fire so he’s staying in his mother’s guest room while the other section of the house is being repaired by the insurance company. Instead of having the insurance company pay for his mother to stay in a hotel for an undetermined amount of time he offered his mom to stay at his home which has 3bdr and 3ba. Now his sister and her boyfriend also moved in because they live with mom. So these 3 people have been the only ones in the house as far as I know. The owner of the house, my friend, has not been home since I last worked on the bike for a fact. 

As soon as I noticed the damage on the bike I texted my friend and let him know I was leaving his house right away because I didn’t want to do anything irrational. I took pictures and sent it to him. He said he’ll investigate. I was wondering if there’s anything insurance wise I can claim just in case nothing comes of it. I suspect the boyfriend big time because I said hello quickly not trying to interrupt him and the gf. I stayed in the garage and did not go I. The house because I don’t know them. He looked a bit tense now thinking back. Didn’t say much and just went back inside. 

Worst part is that I know I left my bike clean. I had just installed some new freshly powder coated crash bars. However there is what looks like dried up wet dirt and leaves. Not to mention that the crash bar is dirty and deeply scratched on one side. There’s multiple things damaged like my ram mount, levers, mirrors, new crash bar that was freshly powder coated, bent fender eliminator, and scratched bar end. Worst part is that I was rebuilding the front calipers. I was waiting on new seals so there are NO FRONT BRAKES as the calipers are sitting on the work bench. 

Idk I’m just really pissed right now and I’m not sure if any of this makes sense. I can clarify anything if needed. Just really need advice on how to go about this. Thanks.",25Mar2020,1
616,"I feel like I can't relax at home. I live with my parents and sister. During my off days, I like to stay home and keep to myself all day. However my dad is almost always at home on weekdays. He usually does his own thing and doesn't disturb me much, but somehow I don't really feel comfortable until he leaves the house which is usually late afternoon/evening or sometimes not at all.

During this time, I try to stay in my room and just use my phone. I can't even concentrate on my homework many times. I feel like I'm wasting so much of my life away by hiding away like this doing nothing worthwhile. 

I've been thinking about some possible reasons why I'm avoiding my dad, 
1) He has put down or dissuaded many of my interests that I thought about pursuing before. I don't think it was intentional, he was just being realistic, but I think this could be the reason why I have no interests/hobbies/passions now.
2) When I was younger, he would scold and punish my sister and I for the littlest things, such that I would feel nervous sometimes even when I didn't do anything. (An asian parent thing?) He doesn't do that now.

I have a pretty normal family and my parents love me. But I honestly feel more myself at work than I am with my parents. Is that normal?

I was thinking of moving out to live on my own, but rent is super expensive here and I would have to spend much more time on chores, so I don't think I am willing to do that.",25Mar2020,1
617,"I am a student, and employed by the government part time, but I worked full time last summer. 
I have to fill out my taxes and have no idea how so I signed up for a website that would help me out. It automatically fetched my credit report (didn’t know I had one). 

It started asking me about my mortgage loan and credit card debt (I don’t have a credit card). 
It appears I have 20k+ in credit card debt, but I know my parents have told me that THEY have 20k+ in credit card debt. 
The only loans I know of, and that I took out myself are federal student loans, which I have been paying on. 

Is it possible that my parents took out loans and credit cards in my name and have paying on it as if it was theirs? 

Every time I ask to do something involving my tax information or bank information, my dad says he’ll do it. Which I thought made sense because he had all of the tax information for the forms.

618,"Hi all . I'm (M19) generally quite fit as I usually am involved in sports and on and off gyming routines at university . However , recently I've been more focused on gaining muscle mass over losing body weight . I'm currently 59 kg / 130 pounds so I don't want to lose anymore but I want to gain more (healthy gains of course not fat) . 

I've been doing a variety of dumbbell routines at home , sit ups , crunches , squats etc over the past 3 weeks , with only a day off in the week . After my workout , I take the recommended amount of Whey Protein depending on my weight (+- 40g) . I've changed my diet from high fats and sweets to a diet high in fibre , protein and healthy carbs (fish , avocado , eggs etc) .

My problem is that I don't know if what I doing is right as I still have a bit of a flabby stomach despite seeing growth in forearm and leg muscle . As stated I want to lose that flab but not more weight , I want to gain mass and be overall fit . Am I on the right path ?

627,"So I have this one Friend. Lets call him F


F likes to do much online shopping. However, he has no way of paying online. This means whenever he sees something that he wants on the internet, he hits me up and ask me if can buy it for him. In most cases he comes over the next day and hands me the ammout I spent in cash.



But in the most cases we just use gift cards.
For example one time F's controller broke down and he had to order a new one. So F messages me and says he needs ""amazon money"" (yes, thats how he calls it.) So I buy a 50€ amazon gift card online, send the code to F and he orders it. Then F came over and gave me 50€ in cash.

This isn't relevant to the story. Just so you understand how our ""system"" works.




Well, one day F called me and said he needed a 20€ PSN Gift Card. So, I got him one. But he didn't show up at my house the next day. Or the day after. Or the day after that. I waited a whole week. After that I messaged him: ""Hey, what about the 20€? When do I get my money back?
F just replied: ""Never. I got scammed""
After I asked ""How?"" he told me that he looked at some Fortnite-Accouts on eBay and found a ""really good deal"" It also had the option to pay with PSN codes. So F messaged the seller, who Im gonna call S.


S told F to drop the code and he would have eMail and Password of the account right away. So F gave him the Code but instead of giving him eMail and password like promised S just blocked and ghosted F. Also, S really used that code. When visiting another friend I asked him if I could use his PS4 to see if the code worked. It didn't. Also, F couldn't use the code himself as he only has an Xbox.



So yeah, F got scammed and sees this as a reason not to pay me back. 

What do I do now? How do I get my money back?",25Mar2020,1
628,"Hello there guys! Here I am once again, venting to each and every one of you. So, here it goes:

My fiance and I have been together for 4 years now. We’ve been engaged for 2. He was in the military at the time when we started planning for our wedding in the Summer of 2019. We had booked the church, made a deposit on a venue, announced it to all our families. Boom. One month later he tells me he isn’t ready and that I’m not ready either and that we will postpone the wedding. I felt like such a fool. Because he had just recently got out the military, he was still looking for a job. He was worried on how we would be able to afford a house? An apartment? How would we afford bills? He also wanted to go straight into College and expressed how it would be better to focus on school first, graduate, get married, and then focus on our marriage. Rather than having to juggle focusing on school and our marriage at the same time. I was completely devastated. So devastated, I made a game plan on how we will get through it together. He did not change his mind. I felt like he didn’t want to be with me anymore. His parents even asked him if he still loved me. Which he does, there’s no doubt about that. Just the fact that we went through all that for nothing. Just felt like he was running away. We’re still together today. He lives at his parent’s house and I live in my parents house. He is 26 and I am 22. A little bit of an age gap. Since he got out the military, he went straight into college. He is currently going to a private university. He is crazy stupid smart. I love it lol! Everything has been fine since that time that he decided to postpone the wedding. In the back of my mind I knew I didn’t have a stable job and neither did he. He had a point so I slowly began to let it go. We both are in school. Full-time students. We each have about 1 year and half left to 2 years max. All of our friends are either married, starting their lives, having kids, or living together. Some of these friends didn’t even go to school! (Absolutely nothing wrong with that!) but my question is... HOW? How were they able to do that? Our friends of the same age if not younger, are already living together. Not married or engaged but living TOGETHER in their own apartment. Our other friends who aren’t married, aren’t even engaged, live together in one of their parents house and recently just had a baby! I feel stuck. I feel like I have been in school for FOREVER now. And I still have more to go. I just want to get my life started already. Graduate, get my career, get married, and own a home with my significant other. (I’m sure that has its problems of its own lol) Not to be mean or anything but my fiancé is 26. Still living at his parents house. He is saving money of course and drowns me with tons of nice and expensive gifts but gosh, I just feel like we’re behind doing this whole thing called life. 
He expresses how I need to be patient. That our time will come. He’s all about planning things and doing things at their given time. We just need to get school done so we can get both of our dream jobs. Afford a wedding, then get married, and own the house of our dreams. Patience, patience, patience is all he tells me. I’m just running out of it! Most of the time I am fine. I’m happy for all my friends! It’s just there are times where we go over to our friends house for get-togethers or any kind of party. Once the party is over, our friends drive back to their homes together, and my fiancé and I? We have to drive separately, or he has to drop me off home or I have to drop him off at his house. Or when we’re out shopping together for our friends baby shower gifts. Which we’ve done MANY times already and it’s just a constant reminder of how stuck I feel. Especially since my fiancé always gets everyone really nice and expensive gifts. I wonder if he’ll do the same for our future kids? If we even have any!?! (There I go again lol) oh gosh.


Of course, I may sound pretty selfish right now but I just wanted to get that out. I feel better about it already. It’s funny because all of our friends who are living together or have kids come to me with all their problems. (You would think that would make me realize things more but I’m just really hard headed) Feel free to say anything in your responses, I am 100% here for it! Thanks guys for hearing me vent lol! If y’all have any advice on having patience, I’m here for that too! Thank you!! :)",25Mar2020,1

634,"Hey, everyone.

I’ve had a pretty serious dispute with my two roommates over the past few days. We're in our early thirties. I want us to be strict about social distancing and COVID precautions. I’ve totally given up seeing my friends, notably my brother who lives across town and whom I’m very close with. My female roommate, L, agrees in principle, but refuses to stop seeing the guy she recently met. My male roommate, J, is mostly continuing as normal, having friends over and going to their places. He says he’s “not going to put his life on hold.”

I consider myself a pretty flexible guy on most issues, but to me this one thing that is binary. Either you’re following public health guidelines or you’re not. There are exceptions, but not very many. Social distancing means no one comes in to our place, and you don’t go to anyone else’s place. Period.

I realize that I’m probably better set up to handle COVID than most. I’m very much an introvert, and I served in Peace Corps Health sector. I understand public health pretty well, and I believe strongly in public health systems. On top of that, I believe in sacrificing for causes larger than myself. To me it seems perfectly rational that we should sacrifice social interactions for the benefit of society as a whole right now.

The three of us had a roommate meeting yesterday that got pretty heated. I was on the verge of yelling, denouncing them as selfish and small-minded. Thankfully I kept control.

I realize probably nothing I say is going to change their minds. Instead, how do I cultivate flexibility so this conflict doesn’t turn into long-standing resentment?",25Mar2020,1

641,"TLDR; suddenly not sure if what I've studied 1/3 of my life for is what I really want to do, or just to satisfy the inner child in me

\--

I'm turning 23(F) and thought most of my life that I knew what I wanted to do: work in the media industry. I've always been certain of this path, and all the decisions I made leading up to where I am now have always been to ensure I was getting to where I wanted to go. I worked hard and it paid off, I've been working as a producer and video editor for about 3 years.

Recently I was editing a video for work, and whilst scrolling through Facebook I came across a throwback video of some old nickelodeon shows that I love watching back in the day. I remember loving the glamorous lives of these characters on screen. I loved the amazingly funny iCarly web shows, the gorgeous performances of the Victorious cast, the quirky adventures that Big Time Rush had.

It suddenly struck me that part of the reason why I had decided to study communications and film at 16 was the fact that I loved the fun all these people had on screen. I wanted to live out that fun life (minus being on screen, thus being on the production crew path). Suddenly, I felt sickened by myself. Have I really been chasing a childhood dream based on a stereotypical and exaggerated teenage tv series? I thought back, if I had another chance, would I study to be something else? But no, I don't regret choosing this path, I thoroughly enjoyed my journey to where I am now, even though it was rough. I love creating things and bringing them to life. What I'm doing now is my dream job.

But to think that all this happened because teenage me wanted to rub shoulders with celebrities, and lead a fun, drama filled life. Even now to motivate myself, I think of who I might get a chance to work with in future, maybe a singer or actor that I like. And this makes me feel guilty.

How do I get over this feeling? I definitely had objective reasons for going down this path, and I count myself very lucky that I got to where I wanted, but I can't shake off feeling lost upon realising my inner reasons for where I am right now. It's affecting my concentration and my work so I'd like some advice to get over it more quickly.",25Mar2020,1

A few weeks later I asked her if she wanted to hang out one day and she didn't respond until 2 days later telling me she was sick, but then when I didn't respond she sent me a second text 2 hours later saying yes. I thought she was lying about being sick so I asked her if she didn't want to be in contact anymore. She insisted that she was so I apologized profusely.

The next day she posted on instagram and snapchat and she was at her cousins birthday party and she acted quite energetic. I told her I knew she lied about not wanting to be in contact and that I wouldn't contact her anymore. Then I blocked her on everything.

We just took a vacation and I was always the one to pump the gas and have to dive up the costs and get payments from everyone. Every. Single. Time. We got gas.  I always offer to get them something from the store when I go if they need anything. I’ve never been asked if I ever needed anything.  I always offer food when I make it, yet I’m rarely offered anything when they make stuff.  I’m not saying they’re obligated to share with me, but returning the favor every once in a while would be nice.  I ask them if they want to game, and most of the time it’s “nah not right now” only to see that they’re in a party playing like 10-15 minutes later without saying anything to me.  Often time I feel like I have to invite myself to hangout with them, then I feel like I’m intruding.  Times have been tough lately and I’ve felt so distanced from the people I thought I knew the best.  I know these are minor things, but a lot of minor things add up over time and I can’t help but realize all the things I do for them that really get zero acknowledgement.  How do I go about talking to them about this without accusations and pointing fingers? My goal isn’t to make them feel bad or anything like that, I’m just frustrated and don’t know what to do to get things to change.  Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.  

Thanks in advance y’all.",25Mar2020,1
648,"Hi
I’m a teen in an awful situation. I have an alcoholic dad and let’s just say my mom isn’t completely stable. I’m not gonna go into detail about what happened in the past, but it resulted in me having multiple serious mental illnesses. My parents are now going through a divorce and my dad is moving out really soon. He is still abusive though. My mom and I need to move as she can’t afford the house rent. There are no apartments available, so we may risk getting kicked out on the street. There is a possibility to move far away, but then I’ll need to change school and that’s the only thing keeping me alive. 

As I wrote before my mom has her own issues, as she also grew up in a deeply abusive home. She never gave me security in my life, and since  around the age of  11-12 years I take care of pretty much everything myself (Not laundry, cooking etc.) From my point of view she just can’t be a normal mother. There are times where I see how disordered she really is. The thing is I don’t feel good or safe around her. My mental illnesses especially Depression and self harm always worsen because of her. 

To be honest I only live for school, where I can see normal people. She keeps putting this pressure on me and expects me to giver her advice or something and then when I do she screams at me how I’m overreacting, that my feelings aren’t true, how spoiled I am, how I hate her etc. you get the idea. I just can’t stand the idea of living with such a disordered person any longer. 

What really enraged me is, that she presumably found this guy and they are chatting. I was fine with it, but then I Googled his name and there were all these articles about how he gambled with money and stole money from his costumers. She also read some of his messages to her to me, and even though they have only written with each other for 2 weeks they share such intimate stuff. He also seems to care way too much, basically all red flags (She has a history of finding sick men probably because of her childhood) I told her this, but she ended telling I’m the disordered one having issues etc. I’m just so lost because it is fine sometimes and then the other times (Often) it’s just so awful. It really tears me down. 

I don’t want to be home anymore and when I am I’m depressed and only think about school. I don’t know what to do anymore.... Should I reach out to someone? Tell my teachers so they can do something? Or am I just overreacting? I mean it is ok sometimes. Maybe I’m the disordered one and not my mom? Even if I told my teachers what should I tell them? It’s not like she’s beating me up.",25Mar2020,1
649,"Apologies for the long post but I’m in a very tough situation and legitimately scared for my SO’s well-being.

I’ve been dating this girl for about two months and I’m extremely worried about her. She’s currently extremely intoxicated in a hotel room by herself without a phone or computer and keeps making comments about ending her life or getting heroin (which she’s apparently overdosed on in the past).

Last night she was staying with me and got very drunk to the point where she got extremely paranoid. She has a history of substance abuse (alcohol, opioids, and apparently heroin). She started freaking out on my that she suspected me of cheating and then, after I calmed her down) that I was conspiring with neighbors to film her. I’ve never seen someone get so paranoid off of just alcohol (which is all she had last night), but after a Google search alcohol paranoia is apparently a thing. 

She felt unsafe at my place so we compromised on taking her to a hotel. I unfortunately had to leave her to go to work as I’m in a brand new job.

I am legitimately at a loss of what to do. She has no family (both parents have passed away and her and her brother do not talk) and doesn’t seem to have any friends in town. Up until very recently she lived in my city but had a huge falling out with her roommate so she moved back to her hometown about five hours away. She was visiting me for a long weekend. To add some additional context to her life, her roommate was also her employer so she’s now out of work and her best friend from her hometown passed away last week.

I feel like if I call the police or take her to the hospital she will just get put in detox then put on the street as she doesn’t have anywhere else to stay. I really want to help her and she’s made it seem like I’m her “lifeline” right now, but we’ve only known each other for two months. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",25Mar2020,1

664,"Hello, new to this subreddit. Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile.

I go by Honey, and I’m a 14 y/o female just barely on the spectrum along with mental issues. I’m currently locked in my room contemplating running, but only haven’t because of my poor pet rabbit.

I’m a homeschool student, so the caronavirus thing hasn’t affected me much and I’m on my normal schedule of working, eating lunch, finishing work, and then doing what I want with my day. My mother comes outside to where I’m eating and remind me of stuff to do for the day, then includes that since I haven’t been sticking to a routine she was me to “draw up yourself a schedule so you understand discipline and how to manage your life”. Which I’m originally like ‘okay fine I don’t like it but I can make myself a chart’. Normal teenager stuff. End of my lunch break my parents are pissed I didn’t make anything yet (wtf I was on break) and show me this.

I don’t know how to share pictures, but it’s a spreadsheet of every hour of the day and what I have to do for how long. 

7 AM -
Wake up/ 10 min
Feed &amp; clean rabbit/ 15 min
Shower/ 20 min

Etc, for the entire day until you reach 9:30 PM - bedtime.

It’s the same way for the weekends. It’s like I’m some prisoner, forced into a specific line. They spend an hour yelling at me and telling me how it’s good for me, how I couldn’t get my life together without them etc etc. I messaged my mom the following (copy and pasteing the text, I have a screenshot of I figure this out though.):

Me: Do you remember the mother from ‘The Little Prince’?

Her: I do. I have not planned your schedule through college graduation. I’m trying to show you what my expectations are on what you should be accomplishing each day. The same way they do with a school schedule. The same way I have a schedule at work. 

What I printed out was a SAMPLE. To be discussed and agreed upon. To open lines of communication. 

To improve communication so that when I don’t have to constantly be reminding you guys of DAILY activities that aren’t getting done. 

I haven’t replied, and I’m not planning to. The best idea I’ve got is to sneak down there tonight, tear up the chart and leave a sticky with a quote my dad said while yelling at me:

“We don’t care about the times.”

666,"So my dad has always had a cough and cleared his throat frequently, but over the years it has gotten noticeably worse.

He used to be a HEAVY chain smoker in his 20’s but he quit smoking when he was around 30 and is in his 50’s now.

667,"I am posting here on a throwaway account. I'm sorry this is a long post. Please see a TL;DR at the end.

To give some background, my husband and I are currently working through the COVID-19 pandemic as essential employees. He works at a grocery store, and I work at a research lab linked to a hospital. We had been feeling pretty grateful to be able to work, and pay our rent and bills at this time, considering that so many people are not so lucky.

Our workplaces are taking measures to try to limit the number of people we come in contact with, but it's definitely a lot easier at my job than my husband's. That being said, my husband does have gloves at work, he washes his hands as often as he can, and does his best to not touch his face. At my job, on top of all this, we're rotating personnel, we have lab coats/PPE, and I have my own little box of face masks that I use for certain lab procedures (we work with a lot of lab mice and currently have ongoing experiments that we need to finish, and these require masks). These masks are the blue/white surgical masks with ear loops.

So I have been concerned about my husband catching the virus. There are still lots of people entering the store. We also only have one car which I drive to work because my commute is further from home. My husband takes taxis to and from work. We live in a state with lots of COVID-19 cases, and I am just afraid he is at risk of catching this virus, if he hasn't already. Plus, his seasonal allergies are kicking in.

I figured it might be a good idea to give my husband a few of my masks from work that he can wear. I even spoke to my lab's Postdoc (who is also my supervisor), and asked if it would be okay to give my husband some masks. I listed my reasons and she agreed with me. My husband knows the proper way to put on and remove the masks. Before this grocery job, he used to work in a care facility. Not once did we think it would be a problem if he just wore his own mask.

This week on Monday, we both went to work. He wore the face mask I gave him, and the managers at his store basically cornered him for it. They put him in a room, and they ordered him to remove the mask as the customers should not see him wearing it. In their point of view it will ""scare"" the customers. Then, they cited a memo they had received from their corporate office stating that the CDC and OSHA do not recommend masks for individuals that work in retail, as these masks do not prevent these individuals from catching coronavirus. I find this to be some sort of half-truth. A mask isn't a catch all shield, or course, but it does cover your nose and mouth, and even keeps you from accidentally touching your face. On top of that, this memo also stated that use of the masks would impact availability for healthcare workers who need them. Mind you, my husband was never told any of this information regarding face masks in the store. He had never even seen the memo. After this was relayed to him, he was told he either needs to take the face mask off and work, or if he has issues with working right now, he can take a leave of absence without pay. At this point, we are strongly considering the leave, but what keeps him working is that we really do need his income.

There is no doubt that there is a shortage of face masks in the country, but we feel as though there is some weird mentality, mindset, whatever you may call it, that wearing your own face mask out in public is wrong because of this shortage. I understand that many people were, and are, stealing face masks from hospitals, but this face mask was produced from my own supply after I was given permission to do so. It's not like my husband asked the store to provide the face mask either. He even explained where he got the mask from. That his wife, who works at the institution, had given it to him and asked him to wear it. When he asked if he could give me a quick call about this, his managers instead acted as if he's being whipped by his wife (Which I think is REALLY immature). He called me because he literally didn't know what to do and just needed to talk to someone. He's never really been in trouble at work, and definitely has never been confronted like this. There was really nothing I could do on my end except just talk him through it. And honestly, the position he has been put in has left a really bad taste in our mouths. He has decided to play ball and not wear the mask, but we've been discussing what to do now, and how we could manage him taking leave, if it comes down to it. Though we are young and healthy, and would beat this virus if we caught it, I think we are struggling with the morality of catching this virus and inadvertently passing it to someone else. Yes, we are staying away from our family members. Our parents are in their late 50s and my grandfather has late stage pancreatic cancer. But there is always the possibility we could get someone else sick be it at work, or when we make our own ""essential"" grocery run.

Long story short, I made this post because for the past two days, this whole situation has been on my mind, and I was wondering if we should complain to corporate, or should we just let this go?  To further add to my concern, yesterday I found out that a family member of mine, who also works in a grocery store, is out of work for the rest of the week because someone who tested positive for the virus entered their store about two weeks ago while they were infected. I feel as though we are forgetting that our grocery workers are still to some degree coming into contact with people. People who may not know they are sick; and in my honest opinion, if these workers can bring in their own face masks to further protect themselves, then why not? Sure, they're not doctors and nurses, out directly saving lives, and this isn't to downplay the extreme and important work our healthcare workers are doing, but our grocery workers are also risking themselves to a degree. I feel as though the store is setting a bad precedent by just flat out banning masks all together. Is this wrong?

TL;DR: Husband works at a grocery store and wore a face mask I gave him from my own work supply after it was okayed by my supervisor. His managers told him he couldn't wear it at work because it could scare customers, it isn't recommended by the CDC and OSHA to prevent catching coronavirus, and would impact availability for healthcare workers. He had no idea. He was told to take it off and work, or take leave of absence without pay, if he has issues working right now because of the pandemic. We are strongly considering the leave. BUT I think he and all other employees should be allowed to wear a mask if they themselves can supply it at this time. Should we complain about this to corporate, or should we just let this go?",25Mar2020,1
668,"Hey guys thanks for trying and give me some help on a very big issue that I am dealing with in my family. Now I know the title may be very broad this problem I'm having tackles a lot of major issues in life.  Currently I'm a 18 year old male living in the US and I ran into a huge problem with my parents.  They are the typical boomers who hate video games and any of the hobbies that I enjoy like DnD and MTG.  Now we ran into an issue about me playing too many video games and them thinking that's all I do but I feel like they don't even care about the other stuff I do like play sports and work a part time job because that's how much they hate video games.  Since I noticed some tension in my household I thought I would address the issue in a formal way.  As I started making my case my dad who now I think hates me started bad mouthing at me basically telling how I am a disappointment to him and how I do absolutely nothing with my life.  But as I was trying to argue in a calm matter about how that's not who I am he had none of it and proceeded to tell my mom ""Let him fail in life and middle school because he obviously  doesn't want our help and he will eventually fall on his face"". Now I immediately left the conversation because I was about to cry and then I went to my room and began crying for an hour because I have never felt so alone in my family.  The next day I get up and start doing homework and my mom (who I thought was with me on this issue) begins to start yelling at me and telling me anything that I need help with I am going to need to ask because she is done helping me with my career or college and that after I graduate high school I will need to start paying rent and the phone bill.  So after you have read what's going on I need some advice.

670,"So a bit of background before I begin, I've had several dead end jobs in the past, and my current job is the first full time + benefits position I've had. I'm working at the front desk for a small low income housing agency.  I like the WORK I do, the tasks are simple enough, plenty to do to keep busy. I have 3 day weekends and all the bells and whistles of a full time job, like PTO and sick leave. I like my co-worker/office manager, my big boss is a sexist/racist asshole and I do not like 90% of what comes out of his mouth, but I can handle that, not a huge deal.

Now to get onto what IS bothering me. I don't think my personality is cut out for this position. My office manager is constantly telling me I need to be stricter, more demanding, more stern, more this or more that, and it's just not me. I'm a quiet, soft spoken person, I don't like asking intrusive questions, I feel wrong assuming everyone is lying until they can prove what they say, and that is required in my position. I'm still living paycheck to paycheck myself and I understand the struggles applicants are going through, and I would hate to be criticized and treated badly when looking for help and yet my manager keeps pushing me to do exactly that. 

I really don't know what to do, I can't possibly find another job (especially right now) that can offer me a comparable salary. I live in a tiny town, so jobs are hard to come by on a good day, let alone during this coronavirus chaos. I'm getting so overwhelmed and fed up with my workplace that I dread going in. I feel like I'm losing my mind because all of a sudden I'll start sobbing and have to excuse myself to the bathroom so no-one sees. 

I have so many goals and dreams that I want to accomplish, but when I get off work, all I can think about is doing NOTHING. It takes me days to decompress and de-stress and by the time I'm feeling better and more clear headed, it's time to go back to work and the cycle continues.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What helped?",25Mar2020,1
671,"Hi! 

Basically I’m looking for some advice.

I’m in the UK and we’ve been put in lockdown (sort of). Not sure if ‘lockdown’ was actually mentioned in the pm’s update but the rules are very clear. You can go out to get groceries/medication etc, you can go to work if there’s absolutely no way you can work from home, you can go outside once a day for exercise and fresh air. You absolutely should not be visiting friends/family/partners that you don’t live with. 

And yet, my flatmate continues to go back and forth between our flat and her boyfriends. 

I told her that the more she goes out the more at risk she is, and she just shrugged it off saying it was a ghost town out there. Obviously that’s the point and she’s not special, nor is she more important than anyone else. Everyone else is following the rules so why should she get to do whatever she wants? 

She’s been out twice today so far. Once this morning for ‘healthy snacks’ (unnecessary, really) and then for a run. 

I live with her and he also has a flatmate. It pisses me off that she doesn’t seem to understand other people are at more risk too because she can’t just call the guy instead of having to see him. I even told her about a 21 year old girl who sadly passed away in the UK from the virus and she didn’t have underlying health issues. All my flatmate said was “they’ll do an autopsy and probably find an underlying health condition”. She’s largely of the opinion that it’s just a bad flu.

So, yeah. This has really riled me up. I just can’t believe she’s be so blasé and selfish. Yes, for most people it’s not deadly and neither of us are in the higher risk categories, but that doesn’t give her the right to do what she wants and put other people at risk. She could catch it anywhere and spread it to me or to our neighbours or anyone else if she visited a supermarket. 

Obviously though we might be cooped up together for months, so how do I bring this up without causing a huge argument? 

Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",25Mar2020,1

(A little background story)

As the title says, I have had and still have this longing feeling of getting back some of my old friends(Axel and Elias). These mainly being my two bestfriends from childhood that I had through like 6-14. Our lives were pretty much unchanging for 8 years straight. We went to school, we went home togheter, played some kind of dungeons and dragons with our imagination togheter, for hours on end, we could go on talking/playing for 5 hours straight without breaking a sweat. Then we went to sleep, went to school again. Had sleepovers every weekend. We where so much with each other my parent thought one of my friends was gay xD. 

But then life changed. First it started with on of them(Axel) who got into a big fight with his mother(I think, he never wanted to talk about it) and then just stopped living or talking with her and moved into his fathers house(they were divorced). I think this was one of the reasons Axel changed so much in the coming years. This change made him get new friends and it made us drift apart. Then I started being less and less with my other friend(Elias) as we were in different classes. But I and Elias stayed close for many more years. Up until around 10th grade. 

At 9th grade everyone went to upper-secondary school and went to new schools. So I stopped going to the same school as most of my friends and our friend group split. We kept seeing each other for like 1 and half years after that but then people where preoccupied with their new friends(and I with mine). I did not speak to Elias anymore and Ivan had under these 1,5 years started to  talk to me less and less. 

Much of this has surely been my fault as I probably reached out to them to little, but in my defense they never tried to reach out to me. 

(end of background story)

Now since like the winter of 10th grade a feeling of longing to reunite with these Elias and Axel again, but the problem is that they don't seem to care. Axel now probably sees me as a stranger and has made no effort to keep in touch since 3 years back(He cried a river though when we had the ending cermony and he realised we would split schools). And Elias seems to still see me as a friend, I am the only person he still keeps in touch with from our old school and he invited me into his class party(you can invite max 2 people) that is in April. But he rarely reaches out and talks to me. It is always I who has to start the conversation. 

Now even though these people seem like long gone, this feeling of wanting to regain that friendship has stuck with me for 3 years. I thought it would go away with time as I have new friends but it won't. It just comes and goes. Sometimes disappearing for a month. To then come back and appear almost everyday for a few days to whole months. The feeling makes my chest tighten and  I'm filled with a feeling of nostalgia and a little sadness. 

Now I don' know how to get rid of the feeling for good. Reviving the friendships seems impossible as both have little or no interest in me. Just trying to ignore it and push it down has been my go to strategy for 2 years but it has stayed the same. Some months even gotten stronger. At the start I thought it was a feeling of loneliness but as I have gotten a bunch of new friends that doesn't seem to be the answer. 

What should I do? The feeling does not impede my everyday life much, it's a bit like having a sore throat, it is just draining and annoying. Should I seek help? Should I try even harder to revive our friendship? Should I try to replace the relationships with new, stronger ones?",25Mar2020,1

I’ve been talking to this guy online for a little while. He listens to all my problems and is so nice to me. I had a crush on him for a while. But he kept asking me for these pictures and videos and I wouldn’t send them by now I did and I regret it. I’d don’t really want to but he said he would stop talking to me if I didn’t and he’s the only person who cares about me

I’m afraid to get in trouble and I don’t want my caretakers(kind of like foster parents but not at the same time?) to find out. I’m embarrassed and mad at myself, but I’ve told him things nobody else knows. And now that he has all these pictures too I don’t know what to do. He says he’s in charge and with all this stuff on me he basically is.

I didn’t reply to one of his messages in time and he said he was going to call the cops because he was so worried about me. I feel so bad. But at the same time I feel trapped.

I don’t know what to do and if you guys have any ideas on what I should do please tell me.

I was a great student in school, but this year its all been a weird time for me. I sometimes laugh uncontrollably, sometimes cry for no reason whatsoever, laying there due to this I have broken up with some of my friends which I made in my class this year, (I'm taking classes for this exam).

I am tensed for this exam, switched off my phone, cut out from my friends, everything i can. Due to the stress i cant sleep early at night and just wake up randomly in my sleep, just today i slept 12 and woke up at 2 and then i couldn't sleep, my heartbeat got fast, my hands were shaking and i wanted to cry but the tears won't come out. 

I'm stressed that i don't want to take one more year for this, i don't have that strength to take it, i am afraid that even after all this, that what if my paper goes all shit, and all my hard-work goes in vain. I know its a general feeling, but i have taken my 12th exams, and have never felt like this before ever in my life.

In class at starting i was a great student teachers had high hopes from me that i would have a good ranking in this exam, but the thing is that in exams i don't do that well. That made my confidence go like lowest of level.  Now even after taking self online test im doing better and better i dont have that confidence in me.

I know it sounds confusing, messed up, because even i cant understand what i am feeling right now, Some times i want to cry, other times just lay down do nothing, then my heartbeats go so fast and loud, then next moment i wanna relax.

In between i had suicidal thoughts which i shook away but its getting weird day after day, i have tried everything, but nothing is working.

Developed feelings for a close friend of mine, now we have a weird friendship but just friends and it works fine. At some point, ive become bitter because I have no dating life, Im on trek to get a computer science degree with no debt, Im in amazing shape, and my family is set to potentially make alot of money that would get me off to an early start, I have a great group of friends, But i constantly feel angry and I like I can't appreciate anything in my life as much, the joy I feel for what I love most is fading a little bit, and I feel like somwhere in my life im living a giant lie.

Im a aspiring software engineer that works out, So i constantly have that Identity, which i dont see as somebody who works out, fight my identity that I developed as a gym beast who is constantly complemented for how much hard work I put into the goals i want, without the gym I wouldn't be nearly as good as setting the goals that I am now, But isn't that the goal of a big project its just a big goal, and I have the work ethic from busting my ass to build a body that i can feel proud of every morning, and the knowledge from software development to do what they need me to do, to achieve that goal.

Then I have a close friend that is married and probaly is not able to see her husband for most of the year because of this virus, and it is straining their relationship. This makes me sad for her, but happy because I have feelings for her, and in turn I feel like an awful person.

What I need is a therapist of some sort, but again I feel like im living a giant lie, Ive always had a problem being dishonest.

For work I put makeup on and it’s usually a good way to make myself not touch my face. But lately that hasn’t been working bc if makeup gets in my eye or anything I get annoyed and start picking just a little. Then when I start growing back eyelashes- it is so incredibly uncomfortable that I end up ripping them all out.

However I just had the weirdest encounter with a mouse I was wondering if anyone had any insight... 

So it was 4pm. My entire living room wall is a window, which is open with the sun blazing through. Basically it's incredibly bright. I was also listening to music quite loudly as I was unpacking an online order. 

A mouse casually walks into the centre of the lounge. I start yelling at it and waving at it but it doesnt seem to move or care. Its hobbling and seems to be shaking. It walks under a table and I can see it, it sits still for ten minutes, takes a long look at me and walks out the room. I follow it into the hallway and it crawls under my fridge, slow as hell, no rush whatsoever. Now I cant get it to come out, not with food or flashing a torch at it, it just looks at me like I'm boring it.

So a little background here, i have a fear of the military. Not going to go to details about it but i am Scared shitless of the military, even looking at their uniform makes me anxious and panicky. But the thing is, my high school has a compulsory military program.

Around a month before the program happens, i started feeling anxious and my grades went bad, like, horribly bad. I couldn't focus in class and everytime i try to sleep, i'll get reminded that if i do that then the program will come closer and then i started losing sleep, started spacing out and not doing homeworks, etc etc. I know it's stupid but i was so scared back then.

Anyway, the program happened around the time COVID-19 started happening to my country. I was sent home earlier from the program because it was impossible for me to participate (duh) but ever since i got home, i've been feeling like i was left out from my class, you know?

I thought my motivation to study will come back after the program is over but i kept feeling this weird sensation of having done something guilty because my classmates went through that hellish program while i was spoiled and sent home early...

And then the virus situation got worse and school started online classes, but i keep losing motivation to submit my assignments. I feel like i don't deserve to continue going to this class because i didn't go through what my classmates experienced. I just feel left-behind...

Maybe i'm just lazy and looking for excuses lol but i really don't want to repeat a year? My parents are panicking enough from the virus because they're vulnerable, i don't want them to worry about me too... i really could use some advice to bring up my motivation to study again, or just anything, really.

699,"So basically I'm an 19 yo guy that has absolutely no idea what I want to do with my future. My parents has taken the liberty to just send me to law school because that will ""benefit the whole family in the future if one of us is a lawyer"" and help keep things afloat. Know here's the thing, I absolutely hate reading and I have an attention span of a Chihuahua. It's a well known fact that in order to do well in law you have got to love reading long boring cases and I already know I'm not going to have the will power to force my way to read it. 

Ever since I was younger I've always wanted to learn something more on the *electrical* side if u know what I mean. It's just I think I would have a higher chance of getting a job with those kind of qualifications rather than just waste 6 figures on a law degree without any guarantees of a job in the future.

This problem all started when I was 13 my parents felt the need to send me to a religious school where we learned absolutely nothing about academics. We only just really learned the history of our religion and memorizing the holy book ( don't wanna say which religion due to fear of being recognized by the few family members that do browse Reddit). So after 4 years finally finished with religious school, I was left in a tight spot when I was 17 and was going to enter high school. Absolutely no knowledge in regards to basic math or science. The only option I had during my only year of high school is to just take the art stream where there was only regular and the general maths, science and English and our national language. No add maths or the three sciences ( chemistry, physics and biology ). I struggled really hard to just keep up with the current classes. Had to take multiple tuition classes just to learn the basics in maths ( which I have forgotten already tbh ) and the past years history syllabus. But after countless nights of just reading, studying and encouragement from family members I was able to pull through with 3As and 4 Bs ( I still have no idea how I got a B+ in maths ). And now thinking back I really don't wanna be in that spot anymore with the additional stress of spending a fortune for my education.

The thing is my family is well off but not to the point where we're at a spot to be throwing money around without expecting some form of pay back. But my family are willing to put everything down the line for the sake of my education and I just can't stand the pressure. I haven't even started the course yet and I already can't bear the stress of me having one day just coming back with the bad news that I failed to catch up with the course to my dad. The thought of  having wasted thousands of dollars on me for absolutely nothing in return except crippling debt is just giving so much anxiety that I had countless sleepless nights of just thinking of what's the best option to go through.

I love my family and would absolutely do everything in my power to help and provide for our future. It's just that I know myself better than anyone else and asking me to bear the burden that might put my family under due to my inability to study is really pushing me off the edge.

I really need some advice on how to proceed with this. 

I think I should add that my parents are really adamant on me going to law school. They already paid for my first semester and I'm not even sure if we can even get a refund. Without me coming back to them with a better alternative they're really going to make me do this.",25Mar2020,1

My work was informed last Friday that a parent of one of our children was diagnosed with coronavirus. We closed down classes this week, but they have been trying to make us come in this week to do deep cleaning. We should technically all be self-isolating until this Friday, which will be 2 weeks from when we had contact with the parent, but my work is pressuring me heavily to come in to clean if I want to be paid for this week (plus I’m worried I will get fired).

I work with many older women and I live with a nurse—I’m concerned that I will contract coronavirus and spread it to my coworkers or the kids. I know that kids tend to be carriers of coronavirus rather than victims—so I worry a child will be an unknown carrier and infect my whole workplace and their families. I am also just concerned in general about getting coronavirus at work due to coming into contact with so many children and their parents. We haven’t been having as many kids come in lately because parents are out of work. Due to having such few children, we have already deep-cleaned the areas frequented by kids (and obviously we can’t clean 24/7 so once they come back I’m not sure what we’ll do).

Is it right for my work to stay open under these circumstances and require us to come in this week for cleaning? Is there anything I can/should do?",25Mar2020,1
706,"Hi, 

I need some advice on how to remove *this girl* out of my life. She is literally a magnet for drama and she doesn't have a positive impact on my life.

Small list of things she has done: 

\- She told the guy I was sleeping with that I was gay. She also told him that she wanted to have a threesome with the three of us.

\- She told some important person at the university that I knew who is infected with the cover-19 virus in my course. 

\- I was sitting on the sofa and she picked up my skirt to look at my crotch area. (Thankful I was wearing black shorts underneath).

\- She touches my boobs without my permissions, and shoves her boobs into my face. (IEWL)

\- She almost stalks me about everything, it is almost like I feel her breathing in my neck.

\- She always makes up face 'prices' and we use an application to calculate who needs to pay who. And she puts made up prices in the app. (So she steals from us). 

\- She removed all of my expenses out of the app, when I didn't react to her messages (I was sleeping) (So she stole from me again). 

\- Not really something bad but: She is lactose intolerant, always eats lactose and has the most awful farts. And then she blames the farts on someone else. 

\- She always says that she doesn't want any of the food, so she doesn't want to pay for it, but then she ends up eating all the food. 

\- She lies a lot and manipulates people. 

\- For some reason her parents are also kinda obsessed with me (????) 

\- She bothers me till I trust her with my password, but then she was reading my personal emails.

\- She did a board year but faked a concussion, so she told everyone that she couldn't work because computer screens gave her headaches. She left every meeting early, when to a bar and had an onenightstand (occurred regularly). I found out and told the board. Some people at the board were overworked because of the extra workload due to her 'fake' concussion. 

\+ a **lot** of little things. 

So yeah. She is a pretty shitty person. She usually gives me a headache due to all the crap she has to say. I really want to cut her out of her life, it feels like she is everywhere. The problem is that: 

A) She is in the same friend group as I am. We are both part of the same sorority and are in the same friend group in the sorority. 

I considered leaving the sorority because of her. 

B). She does the same study major as me. (But she is a year below me). The thing is, she knows all the people I know. 

I know I am too naive. Every time she comes up with some lame excuse and my mind goes like: 'Oh she is a nice person, its just her parents who raised her like this. I should help her"". 

NO. I don't have to help her. 

The corona thing really helps because now I don't have to see her. But she is still sending me messages everyday and it feels rude to ignore her. I kinda try to ignore her. 

But okay, help me out. How can I make sure she doesn't bother me anymore, without removing myself from our matching social groups.",25Mar2020,1

708,"(Originally posted in r/relationships)

We have been together for a bit more than a year.

Where I live isn't in official, legally enforced lockdown yet, but I suspect it soon will be. Currently we are all being told to ""stay home and practise social distancing"" in an effort to curb the spread, but the numbers of infected people are rising daily.

My boyfriend and I do not live together. In fact, we both live with our respective families. My parents are  in their fifties and sixties and have hypertension, which puts them at high risk. My boyfriend's mother smokes, and he himself is asthmatic, which I'm pretty sure makes both of them high risk.

I am not happy that I probably won't be able to see my boyfriend in person for months, especially as the last time I saw him I had no idea that we would soon be in this situation where everyone is being asked to stay at home to prevent the spread. The situation with Covid 19 got very fucking real very suddenly. We had no preparation, no warning that suddenly we would just be separated for the better part of a year.

And obviously this sucks, but what's worse is that he DOES NOT UNDERSTAND that this social distancing stuff applies to him and I. He isn't actively fighting me on it anymore, but he seems to think that I could just come over whenever I want if I really wanted to. It's like he thinks I'm just being anxious and paranoid and stubborn. 

I've tried sending him links to articles explaining the seriousness of the illness. I've tried telling him that even if in general young people can handle it better, there are plenty of young, perfectly healthy people who have had serious cases and even died from it. He waves it off as doom and gloom and me focusing on the worst possibilities - and it's true, I can be over anxious about stuff. But I'm pretty sure this isn't the case this time.

He's not totally flippant. He understands the concept of ""flattening the curb"" and I believe he is taking relevant precautions when running necessary errands. He isn't meeting in person with friends and from what I understand he is only taking occasional, necessary trips to the grocery store when he leaves his house. He was laid off from his job just as shit was starting to get real here, because the industry he works in was very hard hit and basically ordered to shut down entirely.

So it's not like he doesn't get it at all, but as far as he's concerned, if I'm not socially distancing from my parents (whom I live with), there's no reason I have to socially distance myself from him. I really think he believes that I can just consider him a ""house member accessory"" or something, but I can't. 

We don't live together. We both individually still have to interact, minimally, with the public by going grocery shopping (though I do have n95 masks that I got for work ages ago, which I have been using). It sounds like his mother is still visiting friends and family, which is not something that is my place to protest, but it adds to the fact that my household and his household are not and could never be considered a ""closed unit"".

If I unknowingly pass the disease to him or his family, or take it from his household and pass it on to my own, and they have a serious case or die, I could never forgive myself. I have actually broken down crying on the phone explaining my concern to him, and I believe that is why he has stopped fighting me about it, but it doesn't mean he really understands.

Just today he asked me when I will come see him again, and I told him it might be awhile. He said ""come onnnnn"". I dread the likelihood that we will get into a fight about it again. It's hard enough coming to terms with the reality that I'm not going to see him in person for almost a year, possibly, or several months at the least - and face the hopefully unnecessary worry that because his mother isn't being very cautious, he could well die anyway and I'd never see him again at all - without him being on the same page as me.

So if you have any advice on how to get through to him, and really get him to understand that this is serious, longterm, and not just me acting out an anxious whim... please give it to me.

TL;DR: How do I get my boyfriend to understand that I won't be able to see him for quite awhile due to lockdown and social distancing because of Covid 19, and that I can't just ""make an exception"" for him because that isn't how social distancing WORKS?",25Mar2020,1
709," I would like to warn anyone reading this to know i might talk about sensitive topics and a messed up view on rape. So please stop reading now. 

I know rape is bad but i dont fully understand why. I mean ive seen it before and i dont see the whole big thing about it. Ive had it described to me. My instant response to hearing someone was raped is either to have them try to talk about it in full detail. Even if i know i shouldnt. I usually try to stop myself when i relize i am. ( I dont get off to it sexually ofc, that would be gross, its just entertaining) Ive done this 3 times, relatives and friends. Why are people so traumatized over it. I sort of view it as someone putting their hand in your mouth. Its unpleasant and unwanted and you don't want that. Maybe im just thinking about it logically not emotionally, idk. My friends have tried to explain why its bad to me before but i still dont get it. I get why someone would be sad about it for the first day or week but after that, like years or months. Why even care at that point its over with? Like my friends tell me that people who are raped feel worthless. Like why would you be? I just dont get it. I want to understand but i also dont want to make my friends uncomfortable. I thought someone here could help. 

I know it is 100% bad and i would never and i could never support rape. I just want some advice where to understand this or how to understand, and i was directed to this subreddit",25Mar2020,1

714,"Hello, my father passed away in 2018 (suddenly) and left all his money to his then girlfriend. We were to split the money (me, her, and my sister) but she decided to keep it in investments because something about making more money in the long run and that it would cost money to take out early (I think my father had put around 300k in there initially not sure how much is there now). She had given a check two years ago on Christmas (which kind of felt like a settlement) and a check this year for college (which was obligated because my father was going to pay for my college) but has never asked if we needed or offered money. Unfortunately with COVID I lost two job opportunities and I definitely have rent and bills to pay. So I told her about my job loss but she didn’t really show care for the situation and kinda brushed it off. I had an emergency vet situation with my cat that cost over 3k but I was so scared I had only asked her for $500 which put me in a hole. I’m nervous about straight up asking for money during this time because I’m afraid it will give reason for her to not give me a check for college next year or any money for anything. I know if my father were alive I wouldn’t have such a hard time asking but considering she’s kind of like that “step-mother” figure I could never really tell if she has wanted to do good by us. If it gets down to the wire I know I will have to ask eventually but I just wanted to know if I’m entitled to ask for some money since it was my fathers and she didn’t end up giving us that lump sum. I don’t know if I am overthinking it but I just feel like I’m a moocher or crackhead asking for money, let alone feeling like she’s going to think I’m taking HER money, but it technically is her money?? Still confused on that part but Im just worried about her keeping all the money for herself despite saying she was going to give us money whenever we need it. I feel like she just said that to get us out of her hair or that she just said it for my father since she literally just kept all the money. I know she has her own life and such but without my father a good chunk would not be there. 
I wasnt even going to do this because i was counting on the stimulus check but I read that they aren’t being dispersed until May which is too late. I’m sorry if this was a mush I am just very scared.

tl;dr: late fathers girlfriend inherited money and hasn’t offered any despite knowing I have lost two job opportunities and have bills/rent to pay. Am I entitled to ask for some of it? She said we can ask whenever but I get that “not welcome” feeling when asking and very uncomfortable overall.",25Mar2020,1

721,"Hi everyone, posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Some background: My boyfriend comes from a family that repeatedly tore him down, mooched off him, abused him; the list goes on and I’ve seen it personally. I grew up middle class with a family that wasn’t perfect but supported me through my childhood into college. Because of support they’ve given me, I was able to get a decent paying job after college while he had to drop out after his mom stopped working and lost their house to foreclosure. Both of us deal with mental illness but because of his insurance, he hasn’t been able to see a counselor regularly to address his self esteem and depression. He just can’t afford the $200 out of pocket.

To put it briefly, the amount of money that he’s currently making in retail is barely enough for him to pay the bills leaving me to pick up the slack during emergencies. We’ve worked on budgeting, cutting expenses, ect. and it has helped but, at the end of the day, life still throws you curveballs. I’m so worried that something will happen to him medically and that the little money I have to spare won’t be able to cover it.

The major issue is that he deeply dreads the job search and believes that it’s a waste of time because 1. He’s working on getting a raise (this has been going on for a year now despite the fact that he’s paid less than his coworkers who haven’t been there as long) 2. He’s a “loser” who has no skills that would make him hirable outside a minimum wage retail setting (I don’t believe is true because he’s been performing manager level duties for years now). I know for a fact he's capable of more but he just can't see it.

Whenever I try to discuss this with him or offer to help, he clams up and gets emotional (won’t look at me, tearing up) to the point that we can’t have a conversation. He just calls himself a loser, dropout, deadbeat, and says that he’s been thrown so much hardship in life that there’s no point in trying since “everything he does turns to shit”. I am very intentional in how I speak to him about these things (“I feel” language) and do my best to pump his self esteem up rather than nag him about getting a better job. I know he’s not saying these things to deflect, I genuinely think he’s resigned himself to fate and only expects failure if he tries something new. He’s not someone who does well outside of his comfort zone.

How can I help build his self esteem/motivation to the point that we can work toward our goals? I just feel like I keep having to pick up the pieces and put my needs last (like now that some of his family is quarentening in our one bedroom apartment). I’m also doing my best to find a better job too since I want to build a life with this guy but now I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks guys",25Mar2020,1
722,"It started 2.5 years ago when I started emailing a boy I liked at the time; my emails would consist of me talking about various miscellaneous topics and events in my life. After a few brief replies he stopped talking to me altogether, ending with a message about being too busy to respond. It was clear that he did not want to talk to me, and I took that personally, then proceeded to send him hundreds of emails out of irrational spite. After I sent over 50 blank messages in a day, he ended up reporting me to the school administration for harassment and making him uncomfortable. 

I had no friends and was already mildly depressed; once the incident was over I realized how unlikable I was and started developing suicidal thoughts. A few months later I messaged a friend of that boy who knew about the emails and disliked me as a consequence; this sounds dumb but I asked him to murder me. Obviously he ended up refusing to do so, and contacted a hotline once I told him more. That person still disliked me but kept contact over the summer in order to ensure I was doing ok. Looking back I see how thoughtful that was, but at the time I took that as an opportunity to constantly complain about my life, to the point where he started ignoring me. I spammed him as well, starting with nagging messages and then, after a brief pause I found his reddit and sent a rude message (he guessed it was me). 

Two weeks into my school being shut down over Covid-19, I have had plenty of time to overthink my past choices and conclude that I am a terrible person. I recently sent the 2nd boy 138 blank emails through an anonymous gmail account, but there's no doubt that he knows it's me. I also managed to find the first guy's phone number and send ""ur a h\*e :("" via sms. 

I'm not sure why I do this; it seems like it gives me a kind of almost pleasure or excitement to send messages to people I'm supposed to leave alone. I have also noticed that I do it compulsively, usually when I am in a depressive state.

I doubt it is possible to make amends with either of these people, and I know it would be best to leave them alone. This is difficult to do, as I often find myself using the guilt of being rude and annoying to them as a way to criticize and hate myself. It's obvious that nothing can be done  except leaving them alone. I just want to stop feeling bad about this.",25Mar2020,1

725,"So this happened about a week and a half ago, and because I've been sitting at home in quarantine since, I've had quite a bit of time to think about this. So I work at a frozen yogurt shop and I'm a white teenage girl. A large group of I believe possibly Southern Asian ethnicity come in, there's a couple of adults and at least 5 elementary school age children (maybe more, I didn't count.) They get their yogurt and sit down at some couches and chairs we have in the store and they stay for at least half an hour. After the children had finished their yogurt, they start to get rambunctious, climbing all over the furniture, standing on the coffee stables, climbing on barstools (which are pretty high btw and can easily tip over), one little girl threw her shoes off and was running in and out of the bathrooms with bare feet. I've never been comfortable telling kids what to do, especially if their parents are present so I didn't say anything, I just kept a close eye on the kids because I knew if one of them fell and hurt themselves, the store would probably be the one to blame. I'm getting irritated at this point that these parents aren't doing anything so I go into the back kitchen to do something else. As I'm heading back I turn around and one of the men from the group had followed me into the back (where customers are absolutely not allowed to go) and gets quite close to me, almost in my face, and asks ""Are we doing something wrong?'' of course I'm kind of in shock so I'm like ""huh?"" and continues and says ""You keep staring at us and it's making us extremely uncomfortable and I need you to stop right now"" I was still dumbfounded by what's happening that I was like ""uh ok, ok, I didn't mean to"" and he gave me like this huff and then stormed out.

How can he ask for a raise? How should he word it? Should he ask his boss (who says they have no say over his pay) or go above boss? What's a fair amount? Should he just say ""I have a job, better than some people right now"" and forget about it?",25Mar2020,1
742,"Hello, I hope I’m right to post here. I really need advice to get back on my life, I’m destroyed and keep destroying myself, thats how i am feeling, at least.

My problem: Ive been trying to recover in 3-4 years (since i was 15) from my porn addiction I’ve had since i was 12. Ive tried it goddamn all, i tried 12-step programs several times, I’ve tried nofap, I’ve tried noporn, I’ve tried having sex, going to the doctor, going to these forums, changing my lifestyle. I’ve tried it all! I still keep falling back, and about a month ago i went back to the suicidal tendencies i used to have, and i contacted the suicidal prevention center, now I’m speaking to a specialized doctor there. My life is just not in order, i keep relapsing into my porn addiction. even though i meditate, the tendency and feeling and urge is just so strong that all my life falls every time, I don’t understand this. i am beginning to become suicidal again because i am so hopeless, i dont know how anything can help me, maybe this addiction never goes? And i just gotta cut it down as much as i can during my life? I dont know, thank you!",25Mar2020,1
743,"My first post on reddit actually. I don’t quite feel like I’m ready to kms so decided to post here rather than on r/suicidewatch. If there are any grammar mistakes in text you’ll have to forgive me as I’m not fluent (yet ;) ). Now let’s begin.

Every evening to late night(3-5 am) i feel like crap. It’s happening every day. Doesn’t matter the events happening throughout the day. I only have a couple of friends and all of them are online ones. I’ve spent most of my life in my room and that’s killing me I think. Self development doesn’t work. I still workout, do my hobby(drawing) read and study. It’s just that none of it helps the issue. When the time comes my mind just starts self-destructing. I like to think of myself as quite a wise fellow but I’m only good enough in persuading and helping others. My own tricks don’t work on me. I feel complete lack of motivation and literally have no goal in life whatsoever. I don’t even know if any of my feeling are real. Maybe it’s all hormones and I’m just a spoiled brat that doesn’t appreciate what he has. I drink energy drinks quite often (somewhat of a coping mechanism I guess), but lately it’s like one per couple of days, which is pretty bad for someone who is already stressing it’s body by workout. Other than energy drinks I have no bad habits. Nofap thing also doesn’t work for me, I don’t feel any benefits no matter how long I hold, it’s even a challenge for me tbh. Every day is completely similar. Wake up, workout, wash face, study, draw until mental breakdown kicks in. 

So, any advices? If you require any additional info about me or smth - just ask.",25Mar2020,1

750,"Extremely long story short, I (25M) am an engineering graduate with my bachelor's in computer engineering.  I was able to keep my GPA up and maintain my scholarship, but I constantly struggled to find the joy in my work the way my classmates seemed to.  I did what I needed to do, but to me a lot of it was just frustrating.  My high school wasn't exactly STEM central, so I didn't really have any clue as to the world of engineering (electrical work, programming, designing, etc.), whereas my peers would spend their free time tinkering with things.  I never really had that ""natural curiosity"" growing up as I could probably be classified as my generation's version of the kid who is constantly on their iPad (for me it would've been my game boy advance, Nintendo 64, etc.).  I'm wondering if its a legitimate problem with me or if I'm just ""wired"" differently.  In kindergarten, I was informally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, if that helps add any context to how I think.

I am currently in grad school as part of a special program where my tuition is paid and I'm starting to wonder if I made the right career choice.  Specifically, I am struggling with my capstone project because I'm not really an ""inventor"" type, which is kind of what this project is all about.  I'm good at following directions and going the distance that some others probably wouldn't in terms of details, but doing something completely from scratch is something I struggle with since I don't like dealing with overly complicated things.

Outside of school, I'm struggling with my career goals.  I'm having a hard time seeing this grad school stuff as significant because to me its just a self-imposed obstacle I placed in my way because I thought it would be a good investment to get my master's degree in this program where I can focus solely on school and have tuition paid in full.  What I want is to learn and grow in the context of my actual job, but I don't feel like ANYTHING I'm studying in grad school is helping but it technically counts towards that precious precious master's degree, so I can at least aim for that, I guess?  I hate when people ask me where I want to be in 10 years because I'm sure people asked that in 2010 and now we're all being quarantined because of a new incurable virus or whatever.  Instead of having big grandiose dreams of my future accomplishments, I tend to just adapt to whatever is going on.  To be brutally honest, my biggest dream is to just move out of the house that I've lived in for the last 20 years.  Doesn't have to be a big house, just somewhere to call my own.

Outside of my job I don't have any particular attachment to engineering as a profession.    
At my job I'll work stupid hard to do a good job and make efficient use of my time, but when I come home, I'm coming home to pop figure collecting, practicing guitar, video games, working out, or any other hobby I want to invest in (though yes I do need to do a better job investing in the more productive hobbies in that list).  I don't have a particular affinity toward SpaceX, Google, Apple, IBM, etc.  I'll do what I need to do for the job but for better or worse I tend to not go crazy for new tech unless the names, Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft are attached.

I guess what I want to know is, am I a bad person for having such a pragmatic view of my profession?  Am I a bad person because I mostly see my job as a paycheck but one I'm willing to work hard for?  Am I a bad person because I don't feel absolutely over the moon enthusiastic about grad school so long as I'm putting in the effort to make the grades?   Am I a bad person because I want to work hard at my job but then come home to my figurines, stuffed animals, video games, guitar, aspiring writing profession, or any other right-side-of-the-brain activities?  Am I the kind of person past generations would look at as a failure in terms of personal development?",25Mar2020,1

755,"(17, almost 18F) So the lockdown has defeated my purpose in life by ending school prematurely while I was in my final year. My mom likes to say the lockdown allowed the day to slow down, but for me it feels like the opposite.

My mom works for the police, so she still has to go to work. Meanwhile I have to live with my grandmother (Mother’s mother) and 6 year old autistic brother. (I’m autistic too but alas)

My brother is a brat, he cannot process the word “no” and the smallest inconvenience leads him to a meltdown. My grandma doesn’t help because she screams and swears at him. I can  manage to calm my brother down in less traumatising ways, but I have my own limits.

Until now, school and studying was my only distraction and valid excuse to lock myself in my room and live my day at my own pace, and while I’d have other things to do now, they are hardly considered valid to my grandma (Granted I also feel guilty leaving her to stress about). 

I’m already seeing myself starting to cope in unhealthy ways, binge-eating (I do low-ish impact exercise for like 2-3 hours a day to try to keep active but binging is binging) and sometimes just screaming, which then leads to my grandma screaming at me too. I’m noticing i’m getting chest burns from the stress.

I could try to make a routine, but my parents and brother will find every way to ruin it. For example, I like to have lunch at noon sharp, planning it in advance, making my own food, that’s the way I work. Now my parents make a shit ton a food and make up have family dinners that times that heavily conflict my mental schedule. And I do not have enough innate self control to be intuitive or spontaneous with my eating while trying to be healthy.

So now I just want to try some ways I can cope that will have less of a negative impact over the long term. Decaffeinated coffee is my go-to comfort drink, and i’ve been considering putting the jar of instant decaf in a more visible place so I can consider it more often, but my parents will probably put it back and question me. I’ve also considered a “curfew” where after a certain time, I’ll lock myself in my room and they cannot ask me for anything as I recharge my batteries, but I am still able to hear my brother’s and my grandma’s screaming that just hearing that stresses me out. I cannot listen to music to drown it either because i’ll have to keep on being on the lookout if they call me downstairs.

I’m already falling into a depression and being unable to enjoy any little things or hating things I used to enjoy, and I just don’t wanna decay away and make it worse for myself. Don’t get me wrong, I love my brother and family, but the inability of having a routine or a purpose absolutely tears me apart.

I will have to find a job but I’m not tied to my currently city/job and in my field, work isn’t super challenging to find. I work in public health and my niche is in homelessness and health management and policy. I have my MPH. I’m currently in Wilmington, NC.

What are some good places/cities to live considering the following criteria:

1. 28F, single
2. Enjoy going out to bars, breweries, restaurants, etc. love hiking, parks, trails, biking. not huge on club life but I can get down every so often.
3. Would like to buy a house - salary estimation would be somewhere in the 60s 
4. General affordability as well
5. Would like to be either 1 day (7-8 hours) drive or a cheap flight away from Baltimore, MD
6. Goodish job market for career growth or other opportunities
7. Nice weather - not a fan of snow but don’t mind going through spring summer fall. 


Thing I don’t like about ILM:
1. Small town, not progressive in terms of healthcare, affordable housing, homeless engagement, etc 
2. Not always a lot of events on the weekends - maybe 3-5 options 
3. Very difficult to fly in/out - find good flights 
4. Not a good age bracket - everyone is either super old or super young (still in college) not a lot of young professionals - dating is horrible
5. No job opportunities, career growth and low incomes 

Thing I like:
1. Can drive to different cities but closest one is 2 hours (Raleigh/durham)
2. Cute downtown area - has older vibe with the cobblestones and unique buildings 
3. Driving to necessary service’s like grocery stores is only 10 min away
4. Good restaurants/food
5. Weather - typically nice from March to October

770,"Hello everyone, I don't know what to do here. Or what to feel about this situation.

I've been working at a gas station for about three months now. My girlfriend has been looking for a job, and since two people quit at my job she thought it was a good idea to apply. I was feeling iffy about it at first, because personally, I just need my space. I love her to bits but sometimes we just need time away from each other. (not in a bad way, we've been happily together for two years). 

I think having time away from each other is necessary, and work was the place I wouldn't see her, given the fact that we're always with each other on my off days from work and school. (we're both college students.)

I tell her to apply anyways, since I figured she would work morning shifts. I assumed this because there is only a certain group of people that can work afternoon shifts, and we're fully staffed in the afternoon part of the day.

She goes to the interview, and gets hired on the spot. I congratulate her and ask how it went. She said me and my manager really clicked, and I mentioned that she is a good manager who treats people fairly.

The one part that bothered me, was the fact that she was offered a higher starting pay than me. Gf told me that manager asked how much she got paid at her previous job, which was 8/hr. So the manager offered 8.50/hr. I was offered a job on the spot when i interviewed with the same manager, and was offered 8.25. I told my gf I make 8.25, and she said something a long the lines of ""I just started and I am already making more than you"", which i didnt react to, because I felt that it was uncalled for, and my gf instantly asked what was wrong.

So I tell her, its not the fact that she got a job, im happy she did, shes been looking for one for a couple weeks now. It's the fact that she got a higher starting pay when everyone who has been hired in the past 3 months got 8.25, the same pay as i did. My girlfriend told me it was probably an experience thing. (more experience = higher starting pay). Which might be true, but I was making 11/hr at my last job, and I have more work experience than my gf. So I couldn't narrow it down to an experience based decision.

I have mixed feelings on this issue. I told my brother who has been a store manager for a large retail company for 10 years, and he didn't like it one bit. I'm not bothered because my gf got hired, or the fact that it was HER that got a higher stating pay, im bothered by the fact that my manager made that decision based off of a job she had almost a year ago. I would've felt the same way if it happened to anyone else.

I just dont think it is fair. To me, or to anyone who started within the last 3 months. My gf suggested I ask for a raise, but it is impossible simply because we can only get raises at every end of the year, and since I started working a little after Jan 1st, I need to wait until the year is over. 

Any thoughts?",25Mar2020,1

Hi,  I'm in desperate need in a place outside of my apartment to do work.  The usual places like the library, Starbucks, or McDonald are a no go. I  know there are many people like me that can't focus or work in their  own homes or rooms. And my last resort of going over to a friends house  doesn't seem like a viable option during the self quarantine.

Also  being stuck inside has driven me to be quite anxious now that im tired  of relaxing and binging tv shows. Plus now its a really good time to do  my taxes, apply for unemployment (my workplace closed), and come up with  a daily budget.

So I'm looking  for advice for what to do while social distancing and/or compile a list  of viable options for everyone that needs a place to do work. Please and  thanks!

Some info: I'm currently  in Maryland in the greater metropolitan region of DC. Our current  restrictions include school closures, non-essential businesses and  dine-in restaurants as of currently.

772,"Apologies for the long post...

Am looking for advice on the best strategy to approach the company that manufactured this product and what should I expect from this company.

On Dec 24, 2019 I ordered the iron neck pro.     
I was apprehensive at first as I read about horror stories about purchasing items from black friday sales so decided to purchase it after black friday but the item was still on sale.

When it arrived, it arrived very snuggly fit in a cardboard box.

I went to fit the iron neck to head as instructed.          
[ https://www.iron-neck.com/pages/iron-neck-setup-and-fit ]

I saw that the velcro attached to the front of the Iron Neck Pro is not securely affixed onto the ring itself.   ( Can see the
white adhesive / velcro coming off on one side of the Iron Neck Pro. )

I researched their company website and found the following information...

&gt; Iron Neck is fully warranted against manufacturing defects for a period of one year after purchase. Costs for shipping, material and labor are covered under first year warranty. After 1 year, Iron Neck will repair damage to Iron Neck at customer's expense. If for any reason you experience mechanical failure during intended use, reach out to us at support@iron-neck.com.

&gt; https://www.iron-neck.com/pages/faq-page

I emailed their customer support stating what was written above which was responded to with the following:

&gt; Couple things to do to get that fixed. The velcro is adhesive backed, so the quickest and easiest fix would be to pull it up starting at one of the ends and then lay it back down centered. You shouldn't have any issue getting it to stick again, the adhesive is really good. 

&gt; I could also send you another male velcro strip that you could use if you were worried about being able to replace the velcro strip.

&gt; Lastly, I could get you a return label and we could replace the unit. 

I paid $500 for this and it is being being shared with someone else, we have to switch the front pad to accommodate our different head sizes... 

I told them I would personally feel more comfortable with a replacement. 

On 02/14/2020 I received the replacement unit and saw that they sent the replacement unit in the exact same box that was originally shipped.

Needless to write that the box.. the original box... arrived with more small dents / even more dinged up than originially shipped. 

The slider’s attachment end was scratched.  I felt the scratch with my finger and you can definitely feel a dent. The slider and the Iron Neck are made of plastic.

There are quite a few cosmetic scratches on the replacement unit.

Once again, the corner of the velcro strip easily rolls off with very little effort!

While readjusting the front foam to get a proper fit...  The corner of the velcro was peeling off when removing the front pad from the ring.

I pressed down on the rolled up corner with my thumb to reattach the corner and it does, “stick again.”

The problem is as soon as you even gently pull on the corner it rolls off again!

This is being shared with someone else and we have to switch the front pad to accommodate our different head sizes. 

With time and the repeated pulling and switching of the front pads, the velcro gets pulled more and more.

The adhesive is not that good.

I do not want to be a problem customer, nor am I trying to get more than I paid for.

I just want to get a quality product for the price paid.

$500 is not cheap !  Am I paying $500 for a product that will only last a year ?   If lucky ?

Shipping the replacement in the original box, the cosmetic scratches on the replacement, the small dent / scratch on the slider all leads me to believe that the only thing they did was take out the original unit and put whichever first “replacement unit” they saw in the originally shipped box...  without checking the quality of the replacement unit.

What is the likelihood that the replacement unit that was sent to me was either defective, or previously owned?

I would hope to receive a product that doesnt have problems such as this.

Some time has passed since receiving the replacement due to current events but I have not used the replacement since receiving it and have not been able to address this due to the current global situation.


What should my next step be with this company / product ?

What should I expect from this company ?

I’m a very introverted person, and can spend days alone and be perfectly content. My roommate is extroverted and she just wants to talk all the time about everything, especially now when there’s no where to go. I know this must be very hard for her since she’s used to constantly being around others, so I try to keep that in mind even when I’d rather be alone. But sometimes, I can’t force it. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even leave my room without feeling obligated to engage. I wait until she goes for her daily run to get food. Last night I even waited until 3am to cook just so I can have some peace and quiet. It feels pretty ridiculous even typing.

I get it, everyone is different. I enjoy conversation at time too, but the thought of talking to someone all day everyday like she wants is so exhausting. Last week wasn’t so bad because we had another roommate she could talk to, but she went home, so now it’s just me and the extrovert so she looks to me to entertain her.

I even made it clear at one point that I don’t want to talk about the coronavirus or anything quarantine related especially because it drives my anxiety into overdrive. But she didn’t listen, and I ended up having a panic attack later that night. I don’t blame her, because I think talking it out is just how she manages her anxiety.

I’m not sure what to do here. I know that compromise is important in any relationship. It’s not like she’s a bad roommate; she’s a very good friend but I’m starting to resent her a little. It’s frankly annoying.",25Mar2020,1

My family live in London, I live abroad in another major European city. Both have high COVID infection rates. I found out about two weeks ago that my mother has lung cancer, and needs to be operated next week. At the time, my country had a much higher infection rate, so I made the decision to travel back to my family for the foreseeable future, however I would self-isolate in a different house in order to prevent any risk to my mother. The plan was to relocate to her home 2 days before her surgery appointment, which was 11 days after my aeroplane journey. (Also - I've had no symptoms over the past month, up to time of writing). I would then take care of her during her (8+ week) recovery, as post-op, she's a very vulnerable person. 

She's just now discovered that the hospital will be unable to conduct a coronavirus test on her before the surgery next week, which was always our assumption. Because of this, she's now suggested that I do not see her before she goes into hospital, on the grounds that we should be minimising any additional risk to her health before they remove a section of her lung. 

She's not wrong, however, I hate this situation. I don't see her much at the best of times, due to living abroad, and now I might not see her at all before she goes into a hospital in central London, and remains in a high-risk environment for the week of her surgery.

However, he proceeded to roar at me saying along the lines of ""come outside with me and ill kick your head in, no amount of Muay Thai will help you"", not once in this situation did I mention martial arts and it wasn't even a part of the situation prior. BTW Im Scottish so it sounded fucking worse than that, that's English translation. He proceeded to roar more and say that if I ever fought him and won he would kick me out the house. He's said that multiple times since.

Since then there's obviously been more abuse verbally and mentally.

Tonight me and my brother were play fighting mucking around doing Jiu Jitsu back control bs and having a laugh, he gets home comes upstairs since he heard us and starts roaring at us again, as in he went off his head, roaring threatening to break my brothers jaw and at me as well.

He's pretty smart, but expects to be worshiped for his intelligence, and treats everybody else like they're worthless and deserving of being absolutely degraded because they aren't at his intelligence level. He talks down to everybody as if they're 2. He claims to do stuff, like being the only one to ever take care of the toilet paper and soap in the upstairs bathroom. He's not. When I notice the towel closet in the bathroom is low on toilet paper, I restock. When the soap dispenser is empty, I fill it and if there's not a big container of soap upstairs, I get one. He treats me as if I'm incapable of thinking in any type of logical, reasonable way, which isn't true.

He wanted to kill my dog by bashing her head in with a rock, he talks about killing our youngest brother's fish and turtle. He brags about having far less empathy than autistic people, and is adamant that university dorms shouldn't provide anonymity for students who accidentally set off the fire alarms - ""We should be allowed to drag them outside and beat them.""

He goes around telling lies to his friends about me. He tells them that I hate people I don't know, and that I do not like it when anybody touches me. Neither of these are true, but I had an interaction with one of his friends that he lied to about me, and she was afraid of me, even though she had never met me.

822,"My family never calls out anything. if siblings argue it doesn’t matter whose right and whose wrong. My brothers girlfriend has bullied me a lot calling me names or laughing at my big nose and telling me I look like a man etc ( am female) No one calls her out. They laugh, act like it’s a joke and my mom will tell me to “ stop being so sensitive” “calm down and don’t get mad at her because it’ll ruin the day!!!” 

After years of this, I got upset and my brother called his girlfriend out on it. She still does it to me anyway. He gives her an annoyed “please stop” and she stops for five minutes. Doesn’t take it seriously at all.l and continues. 

I’ve asked them not to come over our family home bc it upsets me and no one cares, she comes as she pleases etc. my mother (a serial people pleaser) is happy as long as the public (brothers girlfriend) is happy.

No one sticks up for me in these situations and they’re excuse is always:

“_______ was not rude to me, so idk”

“he/she doesn’t treat me that way so I’m fine with that person being around”

As long as it doesn’t directly affect them, they don’t mind. My boyfriend would never behave that way towards my brother... and if he ever did we would have a serious conversation and he would respect me enough to stop (which I still couldn’t imagine behaving that way in the first place)

 How can I deal living with people like this? Is it fair for me to not want to be with my family anymore? I find their attitude really lame.... I mean, I wouldn’t be friends with a bully. If my friends treated anyone like that (which I couldn’t imagine) I would call them out and distance myself if their behavior didn’t change.

I’m tired that this behavior is normalized in my home and that everyone is fine with it because it’s not happening to them. It has hurt my feelings for years. Me and my sisters girlfriend get along ok when she’s NOT bullying me but even when we’re hanging out and laughing she’ll randomly look at me and be like “omg u look more like a man/ugly when you do that lollll” and it’s hard to even try to be kind and present anymore.

I’m going to cut to the chase here so basically,   I’m 16 and my parents want to put all of these restrictions and monitors on my phone (they removed FaceTime, I’m not capable of web-browsing, I cannot download or remove apps, they can monitor my location even though I’m not allowed out of the house without them and people are constantly “checking in” on me, I have an online curfew of 7:00 Pm and I can’t access my phone again until 9:00 Am. There’s much more but I don’t want to loose your attention. Anyway I see other teens that have so much freedom and leeway to hang with friends and stuff, it makes me feel different. I asked my parents if I was diagnosed with anything, they say “no” and show my proof so I know that’s not the issue, I’m doing really well in school (I always have) and I’m taking good courses. I’ve never voided my parents trust, other than normal kid things, like lying about who kicked the soccer ball into the flowerbed, but I grew out of that faze a while ago. Then I asked my parents if they could be a bit less restrictive and they made up a whole bunch of arguments like “you’re only 16” and “it’s better to be safe than sorry” and my favorite “Our parents didn’t do us this favor”. After I heard them say that enough times I lost it and I grumbled and shut and locked my door. I was mad so I limited my communication with them and I just flat out avoided them. Keep in mind, I have never been this upset with them, so they reacted in a way that literally makes me want to kill myself. (Not actually) THEY THINK I WANT TO KILL THEM OR DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE!! ITS FUCKING RIDICULOUS (excuse my language I never use foul language usually but this is insane) Now they keep distance from me and they’re scared to talk to me.

833,"First off, I don’t even know if this is the correct subreddit you post this to. If not, please point me in the correct direction. Thanks!!
I am 18, and a senior in high school. There is this girl who is 17, a junior in high school. I’ll be honest, I’m in love with that girl, and I am doing everything I can to help her. All we talk about getting married and traveling the world after she turns 18. With that being said, something unthinkable has happen and I don’t know what to do.
Her dad is very abusive, hits her, chokes her, when she was little he locked her in a box for days or handcuffed her to the shower. It’s truly heartbreaking. As of recently(yesterday), he choked her and kicked her, so badly she found it hard to walk. I had to help her, so I picked her up and we went straight to the emergency room. I convinced her to go, because I thought they would help her. Well they did not...
The police got called and they showed up, as we expected. I was on FaceTime most of the time so I heard the entire conversation. I was not allowed to go into the hospital(with everything going on with corona). The hospital was helpful to her, even had security with her until the police arrived, just in case her dad came. The police then came, the police called her a delinquent who ran away, put her in handcuffs, and gave her back to her dad... ran away they said. I’m sorry, but I don’t consider going to the doctor for help because your scared your dad is going to kill you “running away”. They said that while she was begging not to be sent back, crying, saying she was scared for her life and her dad was going to beat her if she went back. When she was crying and told the cop her father choked her, I even got a video, the cop said: “there’s a difference between choking out and throwing someone up against a wall for being disobedient”.... both of which is illegal and abuse in of itself, regardless of everything else. The cop then asked if she had anything on her phone(I.e. filming them) and took the phone. Little did they know I heard the entire exchange. Now she has contacted child protective services, and they are really no help at all.
Now I called, while this was happening, trying to make a report, as I have heard the abuse her father has done. The police station said I would receive a call back from the cop dealing with this, a call I never received from the cop. However, she informed me that the cop told her that they have my name now and will be investigating me... now I am beyond worried. If they wouldn’t even help her out of an abusive household, can they pin anything illegal on me?
So now she is back in an abusive home, can’t text me as the police took her phone(she can ft me from her laptop), and I know right now as of writing this she is getting hurt. She FaceTimed me, and hung up quick when her dad was coming. She would always call me back, so now I know he’s beating her again, exactly what she said was going to happen.
Any advice on what we should both do would be greatly appreciated. Also is there also any way to request the police officers body camera, as I believe that is public record, and this is beyond unbelievable. Thank you all very much!
To;dr: This girl I love is getting abused. I tried to get her help and take her to the hospital, by once the police came, they made it worse. They called her a delinquent who ran away(yes... ran away to a hospital), and gave her right back to her dad. Whom I know is abusing her as I’m writing this.

Unfortunately two of them are insanely timid and they flip my house upside down no matter how much I try to cat proof. They refused to be petted by us, they only come out at night and when they do, the break glass, they flip their water bowl, and just anything you could think of. They are walking demons.

843,"I met them (they are a Non Binary) 7 months ago on a jojo discord, we were all chilling on a NSFW talk and at that moment, we were invited for a random server with 6 people... We all became besties there. I guess talking about +18 and... Horny stuff kinda took the shyness away, and we were able to be... Us. They suffered and still deal with abuse, they aways think that they matter less than other people and have other mental problems. We have been through so fucking much. We had a close as hell relationship, we opened about things we never did to anyone, helped ourselves grow. We looked forward to meeting each other, and they said that me and another homie of mine were their savior, because the night they were going to kill theirselves, we saved them. We had problems along the way like in any friendship, and i aways spent nights, and stopped going going to some events just so i could help them when they needed. We would cry along with each other and we aways would... ""Nonk"" around lmao. We had a misunderstanding 4 days ago. They made a piece of art for me, and instead of thanking them, i said that they drew some thingies wrong, but that it was fine. I don't really understand art, so i didn't know it was a huge deal. They got mad at me for not being appreciative enough. Then they invited another person to our personal server, and our other close homie left because he didn't like him. He told me to be a better owner and do something about it. I didn't want to cause any more problems, so i just said that they should have warned us first before inviting someone. They were still mad at me and called me a dick, and made a huge message, saying that i was a manipulator that just enjoyed playing with their feelings, that i was a absolute cunt and that i had just lost a close friend because i was a absolute dick. I tried explaining to them, tried reaching to them to explain what really happened, i even tried reaching to their friend to talk to them. They said that trying to reach to them in such a desperate way and trying to ""use"" their friend like that was hardcore manipulation. I value loyalty and friendship over everything, and they just blocked me like nothing, like all of our moments of sadness and happines were nothing. I just can't see to move on, even tho it were just 7 months, and i have some homies that i know and i trust for years, i had never been so close to someone... We never judged each other, i aways said to them that it was right to be different, to be gothy, to be non binary... I told them that it was okay to say weird stuff with us, that it was okay to be a nympho and liking kinky stuff (yes they are one and yes we were that close), because thats what makes you... You. Even tho they could be very mature, they were innocent when it came to some stuff. I told them society aways hates the different ones since the beginning, and for them to ignore the mean judgemental stuff people would say. I remember when their DID (Dissossiative Identity Disorder) manifested the first time and i broke down because i had lost a friend, and i was the one that explained to them what was going on and calmed them down. When they got into a romantic relationship with another homie of ours, the first thing i did was ask him if he did really love them because some months before, they had told me they liked me, but i didn't like them back. They became really depressed, and i was totally comprehensive and tried my best to not make them sad. I asked him if he really loved them because i didn't want to see them sad again like that. I feel beyond betrayed after them blocking me and i just don't know what to do, at this point I'm just going through suicidal tendencies and... I even used my alternative account today, so i could explain to them what happened... I spent 3 hours thinking of the words and reciting it irl. Even saved screenshots from our moments from the past. It was a gigantic message, i spoke my true feelings that i loved them (not romantically) and that they were so important to me, how i regreted not being a good friend to them... How i didn't want to lose them. They didn't answer, just blocked my alt. I know that im just repeating myself, but i just don't know what to do.

Hi everyone,

I'm currently working in a job for a company that I have wanted to work for a long time. I've been there nearly a year, which is originally how long my contract was to last. So I currently have one month left.

I've been applying for jobs with the same company (it's a big place) for the last few months now, being aware that my contract would soon be up. So far, I've had no luck with even getting an interview - I'm hoping to change this by changing my applications style, I've been looking for advice online and may contact a recruitment agency to help with this.

With the coronavirus situation, I'm really worried more about being unemployed soon (we currently are working from home) because I know a lot of people will be out of a job and there may be a recession.

I did enquire with my boss whether my contract could be extended recently but was told this was not financially possible currently.

Do you think I should ask again in a couple of weeks and ask whether they would maybe be able to keep me on even for 1 day a week? Or do you think this will look desperate (I am desperate though!)?

I'm worried about having too long a gap on my CV, and I think it will be harder for me to find a job when unemployed? Whereas if they could offer me 1 day a week, I stay employed, possibly build up more contacts with the company and improve my chances of getting a new full time job in another area of the company?

I keep thinking I should just go ahead and ask, I have nothing to lose. But I don't want to come across desperate? What do you think?

Thank you all.",25Mar2020,1
845,"I've been struggling about what to do in this situation for the past few months so I thought I might as well turn to Reddit for some advice. This is a long one.

It all starts earlier back at the beginning of the school year when I noticed I had a small crush on my friend's friend. Let's call her Mary. I started talking to Mary through Snapchat and we soon after became good friends. This small crush I had on Mary began to grow larger and larger. I've recently got out of a 6-month relationship before I started talking to Mary and I never felt how I felt about Mary with my ex. I started to think about Mary all the time. 

Eventually, I realized I was in love with Mary. I told her friend about my feelings for her and she said she didn't know for sure how Mary felt and I would have to ask her myself. I knew the best way to tell her was in person but I was way too nervous to do so.
Over winter break while I was on vacation I decided to just text her. This is how it went.

Me: I have to get something off my chest, I have feelings for you

(10 minutes later...)
Mary: This is unexpected I'm really happy you felt comfortable coming to me about this but I don't feel that way you are a best friend to me.

The last time I admitted how I felt to someone and they didn't feel the same way I asked for some space so I could clear my head and that ended up ruining our friendship (other reasons involved but not important) and I was so scared of that happening with Mary that I decided to just brush past it like it was nothing. I changed the conversation and we never brought it up again.

Because I did that though I never really had the chance to get over her, and fast-forwarding to now, I am completely in love with her. 
It has gotten to the point where I have actually gotten stressed out and an almost mini-anxiety attack when I think about her sometimes. It's not like it's her fault or anything but I feel like being so close to her is bad for me, but at the same time I can't imagine her not being in my life. 

On top of all of this, Mary's dad has leukemia, so her life has been very hectic, and while I want to talk to her again I'd feel awful by adding any more stress into her life.

 I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm running in circles.

I work for a small discount store in NE Ohio.

Partially because I don't know me, but its like everyone i know only talks games or kids or crude jokes and drinking. None of which is any interest at all.  Unfortunately a lot of them rely on me.

Thanks to isolating and the fact me leaving would cause harm... Means I'm left with no one. Not a single sole I can talk to and no way to find people or myself.

Any tips? During isolation or after? There's no groups i can join and no volunteering that fits around work...",25Mar2020,1
852,"True Happiness and the real meaning of life is creativity.

Most people are stuck in the lowest form of creativity, which is sex. Their urge to create is momentarily satisfied when they have sex or masturbate because it releases the creative energy we all posse. They cave to the their lowest self and never reach true happiness or enlightenment because they are stuck in this never ending loop. Always chasing the urge for sexual pleasure, everything you do is controlled by sex. From the way you dress, the cars you want to drive, the money you want to make, the skills you want to improve. Your life energy is consumed by this desire. Even those who claim to be happy with the family life of being a parent is controlled by this energy.

For those who attempt to divert from this energy indulge in alcohol, religion, gluttony, dangerous behavior, opiates, addiction to their useless hobby, or any other form of activities that keeps you docile. Always looking to consume from those who CREATE.

Those who are even weaker turn to incel, neets and mgtow. They become nihilistic and their creative energy are completely suppressed.

In the end, in order to achieve true happiness you have to create because that is the ONLY way you can control the energy. It's just like a muscle that must be worked on every single day or you will lose it. Creation comes in all forms, shapes and sizes. It's long journey of self discovery and self expression. You will awaken your spirit through creativity because you are building a connection to this world. Your true love and happiness will emerge once you become the master of the reality that you built. This alchemical process is not fast nor easy. Most people avoid their true calling because they are weak and spellbound by those who do create. This world is full of people who are using and manipulating this energy to their benefits. While you are stuck consuming everything they create. You have two choices, harness your energy and create or stay submissive to your lower self and willing give your life energy to those who create.",25Mar2020,1
853,"So even before everyone was in isolation I was looking for a new hobby, but now more than ever... I grew up playing sports like football, basketball, and track, but now that playing competitively isn’t really an option I don’t have much to do. I do things like watch sports and play video games but I feel lazy/get bored when I’m not doing something active/making something. I do still play pickup games and what not of the sports I like, but I get a little bored with them now! Does anyone have any ideas on hobbies I could pick up? 

For what it’s worth I’m going to be crunched for time here shortly, I’m starting a pretty demanding graduate school program soon. So I have been factoring that into potential hobbies, so I am not sure something like learning an instrument would be the best thing to pick up because I wouldn’t be able to play enough for the next few years to learn much I think, but I’m still open to all ideas!",25Mar2020,1

859,"Am I out of moves with male friend?

This is a rather convoluted situation, I will be as brief as possible given the details involved. In late 2018 I (35f) became pen pals with a family friend (38m) who is in jail for drug charges. Him and I did not previously know each other, our parents were long time friends in their younger years though and I knew of him by name. So I wrote him an impromptu letter of support and we began a 4 month friendship of exchanging letters. I do not believe he had any feelings for me outside of friendship, but I feel given enough time that could have changed. Possibly, no guarantee. I do have interest in him beyond a friend, though I kept the letters only friendly and never let on.   Suddenly in Fall of 2018 he stops writing without warning. Also the prison returned cards that I had mailed him without a reason as to why. Up until that point him and I had no issues. It was still a new friendship and somewhat surfacey. He repeatedly-including in the last letter I have-thanked me for writing him and said how much value letters have when you are in prison. So I didn’t see any signs that he wanted to quit writing me. Yet I never heard from him again.  

This is where things get confusing.....about a month or so later, shortly after my cards were returned, it hits the paper that him and a group of other people are being indicted for selling drugs inside the prison. He gave me no inkling of any trouble, but likely he wouldn’t have. Due to him knowing my dad, it is possible he didn’t want to involve me in anything like this. Idk, it’s just one theory. Obviously the timing is very coincidental for me not to believe his indictment has something to do with why he stopped writing. Yet another coincidence, as this all happened at the same time, there was some silly Facebook rumor about me and my ex and the fact that my ex found out I was writing my penpal. It’s far fetched but part of me wonders if he heard about this and got turned off because he knows my ex personally,  but I had never told him who my ex was before because we didn’t discuss that type of thing as the friendship was new. Or maybe he got mad I told people that I write him. 

His trial will not happen until this summer and they moved him to another facility. During 2019 I sent him two letters. One was a support poem I wrote and the other was a letter where I acknowledged who my ex was, which in retrospect was kinda dumb but whatever. Most importantly, is the gist of my final letter to him in summer of 19. I basically left the ball in his court, and said “I want you to know I am here to support you as a friend, but since I don’t know for sure the reason why you haven’t written me, if you aren’t able to for some reason or just don’t want to, I want to respect that and leave you alone until I would hear from you again.”  

SO and if you have read this far thanks a million—but what do I do? Or what CAN I do? This friendship is clearly very important to me, but I don’t want to look desperate and like a psycho so am I completely out of moves here? Can or should I contact him again when his trial is over? I am worried that it will look stupid because due to my last letter saying I probably won’t write again unless I would hear from him first, well then why exactly am I contradicting what I said and contacting him yet again? Also sucks because his trial is taking so long that I feel like by the time it’s done he won’t even bother contacting me again. If indeed the charges were the reason he stopped. I also gave my new address and phone number in the letter in case he “needed anything”. I should add that these are life devastating charges—he will likely get another 15 or more years added to his sentence. Please PM me if you can help me with this dilemma. I really miss talking to him and want to be friends. Do you think it is out of my hands now? Any ideas on what to do, why you think he stopped writing, or if he will write again are appreciated. Thank you.",25Mar2020,1
860,"My family and I have been isolating since (and including) the 16th of March, excepting grocery store/convenience store trips (very few) where the family members going out are wearing gloves, and shower the moment they come home. We’ve also been disinfecting surfaces as often as possible, as well as taking other measures to remain hygienic. 

Would it be too risky for my girlfriend to drive over after two weeks of isolation, if her family has done the same? Her family has been keeping up a similar regimen. I figure that after two weeks for both of us we would more than likely know if we had the virus as I would not expect everyone in our families to be asymptomatic. Definitely understand the need to isolate, but trying to figure out if this is a safe move or if I am missing something and risking us all getting sick.

Well I told my wife that I could be let go because of this and I was very stressed. We still have enough for 4 months of rent, we would just have to stop luxury purchases. My wife lost it and said I was being idiotic and that I was the only one supporting the family. She said I need to continue to go to work and stop arguing with my bosses. That her and our two children depend on me and I need to give them a good life. 

We started arguing, I let her know that she cant put this much pressure on me and in 4 months she could also help support us.

863,"Hello,

After years of struggling to get my family out of debt and rebuilding credit - we are finally getting into position to build our very first home in 2021 (yay no more renting).

We are building because of the following:
1. Gifted 10 acres of lake front property
2. Don't want to live in the city
3. If we did want to buy a home- there is an extremely limited availability of homes to buy in the area.
4. Black Gumbo dirt makes buying older homes scary.

My husband and I are unable to and don't want kids so we dont need a huge Texas sized home. Its extremely hard to find floor plans that fit what we are looking for and no builder wants to talk to us until we are 6 months out from building (we've spoken to ones that service our area).

So my question is this- are there any floor plan building software's that you would recommend or should we consider hiring an architect to create one for us? I'd really like to try and get an idea of building material costs so I can properly budget and put money back.

Thank you for your help in advance and have a wonderful week 😊",25Mar2020,1
864,"Let me start with an introduction of myself. I am a 19-year-old college student who lives at home. My mom is a stay at home mom for my 2 brothers and my real father is not in the picture. My stepdad is the family's provider, my boss, and pays for my school, car, etc. 

I am a pretty average student, I don't get in trouble and I make decent grades. However, last September I made a poor decision to take magic mushrooms, which did not go well. I was arrested with a felony charge and the legal fees came out to be around 25k. 

Last month I had the pleasure of finding out my stepdad was cheating and confronted him about it. That's when he threatened me with not only physical violence but with the fact that he would stop paying for my lawyer, car, school and everything else and also fire me. He controls literally every aspect of my life right now and I just feel trapped. I work in the oilfield and live in an oil town, with Covid-19 and the oil prices going down it is going to be essentially impossible to find a new job especially one that pays well enough to pay my legal fees on my own, which is my greatest concern since I am facing a felony charge and could go to jail/ be a convicted felon without my lawyer.

My main concern is keeping my lawyer. I don't have any extended family with the financial ability to help me out and I'm afraid I might just have to accept the fact that I have no other option than to keep my stepdads cheating a secret until my trial is over, but that could be a year if not longer with Covid-19 going on right now. I am not sure if I can go that long with not telling my mom and also pretending to like my stepdad. I understand that there are more important things going on in the world right now and I am trying to remember that my problems are not that bad when compared to the thousands dying. But my situation is really tearing me apart.  I'm very confused and could really use some advice.

Many many many thanks in advance to anyone who responds!

So here’s the situation... my fiancé lives about 90 minutes away in a county that currently has 4 cases. Her family is paying almost no mind to the pandemic - ordering food from out, visiting with neighbors occasionally, seeing their daughter and niece who are often out as well - while mine is FREAKED over what’s going on. 

My mother has asthma (50) and my father has had lymphoma and does not have a spleen. Also, he has recently been diagnosed with diabetes (51). Otherwise, they’re reasonable active early 50 year old people. 

We are in NC, where the case count for our counties has remained relatively low. Though, my family and I have stayed inside/on our property since the 11th. We ordered groceries once, and Lysol’d everything extremely piece by piece as we brought  it in.

My question is, if she comes here and washes her clothes immediately upon entry and showered as well,  is there really a risk? She is around people who aren’t taking it very serious, so I guess she could carry it.

It may seem like I know the answer but guys I really don’t. Am I overreacting thinking she’s a risk to my fam’s health or am I in the right frame of mind?

I hate to be so separated. We’ve just recently got engaged and I never get time off work like I have now.

For the last 5 months or so, my girlfriend has been going through this huge fight with her parents, who she currently lives with. I don't want to discuss details since these are personal. But it has gotten to the point where they argue everyday, her parents got physically abusive twice, practically kicked her out of the house, and she attempted suicide twice (which made them even more mad and the situation even worse).

I've been there trying to support her since the whole thing started but I am so emotionally drained right now. There is no time to recover between one incident and the next, and it doesn't help that her parents hate me for not taking their side  and keep insulting her by saying crap about me. 

Problem is, I have nobody to talk about this to. Of course I can't talk to her - her situation is obviously far worse than mine, and I'd be an asshole if i basically told that her suffering makes me suffer and expect her to do something about it. Can't talk to my friends, cause all of them either know her or are mutual friends with her, and I don't want to expose her situation to them without permission.

906,"I found my ex on Grindr while we were living together. I had already felt something was up and was crying a lot before finding out, my intuition knew he was sneaking around.

He left that night and I heard his car speed off to a Grindr date at 3 in the morning. I texted him saying he cannot disrespect me and walk all over me, and he said something along the lines of “I know, I’m fucked, this is fucked”

We had a convo the next day and I explained to him that he probably has an avoidant attachment style (he has been shady like this before), and I showed him a video about anxious and avoidant types. I told him I was moving out all my stuff. He gave me a long hug and cried. 

I went through and currently am going through some shit. First I felt nothing, then I felt very sad and lonely, then I felt angry at him for not disclosing this to me. I sent him a long text about how he did not handle the situation well by sleeping with somebody else, and he said he didn’t want to hurt me but was sexually confused and that I didn’t know what it was like. I sent him some more texts like an article about the common psychological impacts of our specific situation, and a text that I haven’t told a soul that he cheated or that he is bisexual, and that this information is his to disclose.

909,"this post might be a bit long so sorry in advance, but if you can please read.

For a long time, I’ve felt as though no one likes me and such. Recently I gained a massive group of friends and I was so happy because they all told me that they liked me etc. However the dynamic of the group is quite strange. There’s a leader, we’ll call him Harvey, who controls the group, like everything he says goes and the others won’t speak up against him. I was cool with him until recently but I always thought that the dynamic was odd. 

Anyway, I’m friends with two people Harvey hates, his ex boyfriend and a girl who stood up to him. Harvey demanded I stop being friends with them and I refused so Harvey had a problem with me after that. 

In January, we all were at a party and I’m going to be honest I got stupidly drunk. I went around and I was kissing everyone on the cheek and telling everyone that I loved them and they were beautiful etc. Anyway there was one girl, we’ll call her Fiona, who turned her head at the wrong time and I accidentally kissed on the corner of the mouth. I was friends with her boyfriend (who’s about 6’3 and super muscular, I’m 5’5) so I was mortified. I tried to make a joke about him eating me for breakfast or something stupid like that but she said took it seriously.

So I wake up the next day and I have a message of one of my closest friends in the group, we’ll call him Stephen, asking me if anything happened between me and Fiona the night before and I say what happened and don’t think anything of it. I apologise to the group in case I made anyone uncomfortable and thought that would be it but I was very very wrong. I get a call of Stephen that night telling me to apologise to Fiona directly so I do and she tells me I’m not taking responsibility for my actions etc so I leave her on read. Stephen becomes all high and mighty and acting so moral but that will be important later.

To cut to the chase, Fiona was telling everyone I forced myself on her. I was horrified when I learnt this because 
1. I’m not attracted to her 
2. I was friends with her boyfriend 
3. I was kissing everyone on the cheek so I was worried everyone thought that.

I decided to avoid them all for a week or so and to let the dust settle and when I returned it was if nothing happened, they were all fine with me expect Fiona, who had a massive fucking problem with me.

So it’s February half term and Stephen invites me to his house out of nowhere so I’m getting the bus and I get a message of my best friend in the group, Mike, basically screaming at me. There was a rumour going around that he was creepy to a girl at a party and I was next to the girl and it didn’t happen how she was saying it did so I would clear it up when it was brought up to me. I swore on my mother’s grave I didn’t spread it (which I still do because I didn’t fucking do it) and I asked who said it to him. He refused and said that they didn’t want to cause beef. 

I’m in town with some of them a couple of days later and I mention printing pictures with all of them because I loved them all and I wanted to have the memories, and then one of the girls says ‘that’s a bit permanent don’t you think’ and that’s stuck with me ever since because they were probably all in on this the entire time.

Anyways, Harvey insists we go bowling but I’m not really feeling it but Mike really wants me to go. I said something like I can’t be arsed with Fiona because she was being funny with me and he says ‘I know bro, she was the one who spread that rumour about you’. Safe to say I was fucking livid but I decided to go for Mike but everyone was ignoring me and I walked out of the restaurant. 

The next day I get a full page of messages of Harvey calling me names and shit about how I acted the day before and I tried to explain my side but he wouldn’t listen. I told Mike about the whole thing and he decided to argue my case in the group chat (they made a fucking group chat about it and just chatted shit about me)

I stay away from them again until there’s another party (people literally told me I was brave for coming lmao) I talk to one of Harvey’s closest friends about the whole situation and she sees it from my side and says they all just believed what Fiona told them and she apologised and told me she’d help me sort it. 

TW for sexual assault from here on in 

So when Mike and I both joined the group, I thought we were both straight and he’d joke about being the two straight guys in a group of girls and gay guys. Anyway, Harvey is gay and him and Mike start to become more close. I think nothing of it but there’s clear sexual tension and when Mike and Harvey were together, he’d make jokes about them being a couple which made Mike uncomfortable. My friend Dan, who was also mates with Mike, told me that Harvey asked him out and Mike said no. 

One day Mike messages me and says ‘Are you onto the thing with me and Harvey?’ so I’m like ‘vaguely’ turns out Harvey asked him out about 3 times and forcibly made out with him. I thought that was wrong but I couldn’t really do anything about it.

Skip to that party, and I’m talking to some girls there and Mike comes in and asks to talk to me. He tells me that Harvey forced him to do stuff before coming and he wanted to kill himself. I was drunk so I didn’t really understand what was going on.

Anyway at like 1am theres a huge bang from the other room. It’s Mike slapping Harvey. Harvey tried something again. Harvey was crying so I told him to take care of himself (I wish I hadn’t).
I left as soon as I could. 

Mike messaged me the next day and asked me how it went with me and Fiona (it went shockingly but shes a Bitch) but I was more concerned about him. He told me everything (I won’t list what happened) and I was furious. Stephen basically told him to fuck off when Mike tried to talk about what happened to him after he told everyone I was a predator to the group. 

I had a trip planned with Harvey and Mike the next day but I couldn’t go because if I saw Harvey, I don’t know what I would’ve done. I told Mike to come and stay with me for the weekend but Harvey forced him to go to dinner with him and stay at his so I was too late.

This is the part where I fuck up and I regret what happened so much. I go to college to ask for advice about what happened and they basically pressure me into saying who it is. I felt like shit after walking out but when I get home my sisters school is on lockdown and it’s a potential hostage situation so I don’t get around to messaging Mike about what happened. 

He loses his shit when he finds out with reason to. I leave him alone but I get 45 messages of Harvey. I read them the next day and he just tells me to never speak to any of them again. Mike said we could still be friends but then the next day he tells me to fuck off. I feel so bad about what I did and I understand where I fucked up. Harvey took away his power to decided who he wanted to be with and I took away his power to decide if he wanted to report it, if I meant to or not. I was just trying to help and I made everything worse and I lost 80% of my friends. I let my emotions control my actions with what I said and did and I’m so ashamed of myself.

I thought I’d leave it and see if they message me but it’s been 2 weeks and none of them have spoken to me and I miss them. Not all of them but most of them are really nice but Harvey is so fucking toxic. I just miss most of them and I was fine with everyone in a 30 person group but two and now they all seem to hate me. I know I fucked up badly and I probably don’t deserve anything but I don’t know what to do. I just want to feel like I belong again.

910,"Hi

This account might look a little sketchy, but I made it only to write this post. 

My name is Alan and I'm nearing 18 years old. I also have a friend, let's call him Steven and he's 18.

My friend Steven was in love with a girl for over a year. He loved her very much, truly, but in the end, she didn't want to be with him. Although, he would never reveal the truth, that broke him. He had previously a lot of mental health issues and didn't have an easy life, so it wasn't an easiest thing to do to withstand such a blow. 

His dream was always to become a member of WHO and help people around the world. In order to achieve this, he needed to study, hard.

A few months pass by. Me and the girl he fell in love with start being attracted to one another. You know, I always dreamt of having a gf up to that point - love is the most important thing in my life and because I lacked her in my life, I craved for it so much. There are many other reasons, which are not very important.

I decided to ask my friend Steven, if he would be okay with that. He seemed to be done with her, also he said a lot of thing that confirmed that statement. So I went ahead and called him. He said, that yeah, no problem, he's done with her. I asked him that same question over and over again, for hours to be sure. I told him that he needs to be honest, because by no means I want him to be hurt by me. I told him if he would lie, he will suffer as the only one and repeated my wish for him to be honest with me. He insisted, that he's definitely over her.

So I decided to shoot my shot...and it worked. We started being together.

After some time, Steven would start behaving weirdly. He stopped doing anything for school, which was a way for him to reach his dream goal. Our relationship wasn't very friendship-like. He has a tendency, he doesn't tell me very much of what is happening to him, but anyway, I asked him what's wrong, or is there something going on. And I repeated the same question over and over again, but he wouldn't tell me. I was afraid I might lose him.

A month passed, in a huge drama in our friend group surfaced and because of that drama, I got to know from Steven, that he lied to me - he still loved her after I started to be with her. I was angry at him, I didn't want that kind of sacrifice for me. He told me that he got over it though. I believed him. I thought he wouldn't lie to me again.

Present day
My gf broke up with me yesterday. But that's not the important part. Today, another friend of Stevens, let's call her Hannah, told me the truth, in secret. 
My friend was in love with her all along. And, because of that, he didn't study for school. He was heartbroken, he let go of the things he cared about. Now, he cannot relive these past few months. His dream is gone. His life goal. Now he wants to finish high school and go live somewhere else, far away from me and this town.

Basically, he sacrificed his whole life for my stupid fucking little dream.

And he's supporting me to this fucking day. 

Hannah told me, that because of all that, I should give him distance.

I basically ruined my best and only friend's life. How could I have been so blind?? I knew something was going on, but I believed that he was honest with me, that it was something else that bugged him. He haven't told me anything, no matter how much I insisted. This all was kept away from me, in secret. Still, I should have known better. How could I do this?? How do I live with myself now, knowing that I ruined another person's life? My friends life!! How can I repay him?? I don't want pity, but I feel like garbage. Like the worst fucking kind of person. Honesty, I don't think i can ever repay that debt. I don't know how to cope with all this, what to do with our future friendship. 

I'm lost, honestly.",25Mar2020,1

914,"So lately I've been feeling this way, and I feel like I need to get it off my chest and hopefully get some advice for this. Lately I've been feeling that I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, now let me explain. The reason I've been feeling this way is because there's been so many people saying how I look ugly and that I'm a failure and other things. Someone in her family said that ""opposites attract"" and that my girlfriend is much better looking than me and that she doesn't even know why she chose me. I've had people in my family tell me that they don't know why she chose me and that I'll grow up to be nothing and that my sister will be the successful person and I'd just be the person working for her. This is just putting it bluntly. I personally think I don't look bad, but I guess that's just my own opinion. I've been told that my nose is too big, my ears are too big, I just look bad in general. My friends have even said my nose looks bad. Now let me just say that my girlfriend is indeed great looking, and personally I don't know if what they're saying is right about me. I mean, my nose certainly doesn't look good, but other than that I don't see why so many people are saying that my general looks are bad. And this isn't the last reason. Now this may help you understand me better, or I may just be rambling on and giving info that you never needed to know. But I grew up with comprehension skill troubles, and I went to therapy for it and had school therapy for my problems, and I do think it didn't entirely help me, but it did make it a lot better, but anyways. My next reason is I feel like I'm also nothing. I'm not a talented person, and I don't know what I'll end up doing in my life in the future. I want to hopefully do something in the music industry, like music marketing, distribution, maybe even a label. But these dreams and hopes seem like such a stretch, and something that a person like me couldn't achieve. Now my girlfriend is a more talented person. She can do art like I've never seen, she's smart, everything that I'm not, I mean I can draw I guess. But my drawing ""talent"" couldn't ever pay bills. And sure I can do business and market things, but what if that fails if I make it a career? I have basically no back up plan, business is the only thing I'm decent at.

I just needed to get this off my chest and hopefully get some help with this. Thank you if you read through it all. Please give me advice if you can. Thank you

Sorry if there are any typos. If you need help understanding more of what I said please ask me so I can interpret it better for you.",25Mar2020,1
915,"I have this issue that's making me burn out on everything that I like. Basically I'll find something that I love like a TV show, a video game, a hobby, a band/artist or even a person. Step two: I obsess over it like CRAZY. Basically investing all of my time in that interest/relationship/hobby, thinking about it all the time, talking about it all the time with my friends and family, dreaming about it at night, etc. Complete obsession. Then I'll suddenly feel not that into it anymore. I start losing interest until I finally have no feelings left towards that thing. It feels almost as if I'm draining all the good feelings out of things and there's nothing interesting about them anymore because I'm obsessing too much. Feels like I'm exhausting those things with my obsession. Kinda like when you listen to the same song on repeat for 150.000 times then you never want to hear it again and you start wondering what you even liked about that song in the first place. I think you understand what I mean.

I am really bothered when this happens, because I will go through long periods of time when I beat myself up for being obsessive and ruining the things that I like. And the self hate grows stronger every day.

917,"Even more... I'm in a relationship with another woman..

Let me start the story from the beginning, I used to work in another city than the one I work at now, then I met someone let's call her ""Alex"", we dated and we fell in love.. we spend about three months regularly meeting and going out on dates, then I had to travel to work in my current city.. 
In the current city in my new place of work I met this second girl, let's call her ""Summer"", she was engaged to be married after 5 months from the time we met.. 
It started as a friendship, but quickly it was obvious for both of us that what we are feeling isn't just regular friendship feelings.. we discussed it, and we agreed that we shouldn't take it further at the beginning.. then we couldn't resist but fall again.
At that time we were just wishing if things were different and if we could have met under other circumstances.. 
Then she said that she loves me, I didn't say that I love her back at the time, and I told her that I just see her as a friend, I also said that I might consider being ""friends with benefits"" implying sex to be involved, but I made sure to make it clear, we're not in a relationship, and that this all should end by the time she gets married.
So far, I understand that I did bad already and that I should have left in the first place, and I also acknowledge that I have cheated on my girlfriend ""Alex"".. please don't judge me.. I was truly in love with her, just denying it and trying to choose whatever other option that can make me be with her without facing the truth that if we were in love we'll need to breakup with our respective partners, me with ""Alex"" and her with her fiance..
At the time I would have broken up with ""Alex"" to be with ""Summer"".. but given the circumstances and the social norms, it was almost impossible for her to breakup with her fiance whose she's been with for 6 years at the time.. or so I thought and this is why I didn't show my real feelings for her.. 
Then we started having sex, me and ""Summer"".. (side note; the sex with ""Alex"" and the whole relationship was kind of limited by then, due to being in a long-distance-relationship now).. 
Sex with ""Summer"" was magnificent, she made me feel great while I'm with her, and, I argue, she felt great as well being with me.. 
Las time we had sex before her marriage was about a month from the marriage party day.. and she, again, told me that she loves me and that she'd be willing to leave everything behind and be with me if I was to take her..
I didn't budge.
We said our goodbyes, and she got busy with preparing for her marriage and I got myself busy with ""Alex"" adding back more efforts in the relationship and hoping to forget about what happened between me and ""Summer"".. 
Then around 20 days before her marriage, I was drinking and I was talking with my bestfriend about the whole thing.. and my friend asked me ""do you love her? Then if you do tell her, she's not a kid that wouldn't be able to manage for herself, tell her how you feel and stop torturing her, making her feeling like she's in love with someone who doesn't love her back. Stop making her feel rejected"".. I picked up my phone then and talked to her, I told her that I love her, and that I didn't tell her that so I don't ruin her marriage, and told her that she can do whatever she wants, I also told her that if it were for me, I would have broken up with ""Alex"" for her, but only that I don't want her to break up with her fiance that was the thing stopping me... (Side note; I'm not ready for marriage at all currently, and I most probably won't be ready ""financially"" for 4-5 years more.. and for her to break up a marriage for me to wait for me to be ready in 4-5 years was a thought I didn't think was possible or right)
On that call I also told her that I don't want her to break up with her fiance for me and that I just wanted to tell her what I feel for her not to feel rejected anymore.. and we agreed we won't be talking about that anymore..
Then she got married.
And we stopped talking for about a month, in which I have been reconnecting with ""Alex"" and making our relationship status better.. and within this month I have been hurting a lot for having lost ""Summer"" to her fiance, now her husband..
After her honeymoon she returned back to work and we started seeing each other back again.. we started to catch up, and she got me a handmade piece of crochet that she made for me while on her honeymoon vacation (for me that told me that she didn't have a good start with her husband, what else would it mean, if she's spending her time making me a piece of crochet on her honeymoon, then she clearly wasn't in love with HIM).. I thought of it and I ignored it, I thought ""she's a married woman now, I shouldn't be meddling with that"".. 
Then, soon, before she's completed 2 months being married, we talked about us again, and about all that was said and done...
She told me that two weeks before her marriage she told her fiance that she wants to break up, and that she wasn't in love with him anymore.. her fiance didn't take it well apparently, and agreed with her that they shouldn't marry, just to her face and then he called her parents telling them that she's getting cold-feeted and for them to ""straighten"" her mind.. 
Her parents -as conservatives they are- didn't spare a thing to make her continue the marriage, they even threatened her of physical harm and abuse, and given that she depends on them big time, emotionally and financially (she lived with her parents even though she worked, but that's the way our society works..) she went along with the marriage.. 
She continued, that she doesn't love him and that she has already talked to him about that after their marriage, she also told me that they agreed on divorce, but they have to sort everything out before that happens..
Listening to her I was somehow relieved, but I also still was feeling that I'm ruining a marriage. 
After all I'm sure he loves her miles!
And because of me his heart is being broken.
After that I had a quarrel with ""Alex"" and I was actually considering breaking up with her, we had a big fight and things weren't going good.. I talked to ""Summer"" about it and I even told her that I'm going to break up with ""Alex"".. I think she misinterpreted that wrong that I was breaking up with ""Alex"" because she told me she's divorcing her husband..
Things were resolved between me and ""Alex"" shortly after that, I travelled to her city and I spent a week with her.. we were back together as we always were.. 
I came back from that travel felling very much lost, I finally realized I love both! ""Alex"" and ""Summer""...
That's when things went crazy between me and ""Summer"" we started to flirt in sexual way, she told me that she wants to have sex with me and that she misses me.. and to be honest, I missed her so much and I wanted to have sex with her as well.. but I resisted the urge for sometime... 
I never thought of myself as someone who would ever sleep with a married woman, I hate that I did..
Anyway, I invited her to my place and we had sex.
And I hated myself for doing so. Don't get me wrong, we both agreed to it, she didn't seduce me or drag me into it more than I did, and we both loved it at the time.. 
By the end of our time in bed I told her that I'm lost and that I love her and ""Alex"" and that I don't know where I stand or what to do.. I also told her that I don't want to feel that I have any hand in her divorce.. and I told her everything that I feel about her, the situation from the start and myself..
Before we slept together that time I told her, I don't want to do if because I'm afraid I won't be able to live with it.. 
After we've slept together, she asked me how did I feel.. I lied to her, because I wasn't able to admit it to myself..
...
Three days after that incident I couldn't hold it anymore.. I couldn't cover the feeling anymore.. and I was developing doubts even.. 
If I feel that much bad about sleeping with a married woman, how is it that she's not feeling bad about herself and how is it that she's not feeling that she's cheated him? 
What if she really left him? Will she be devoted to me? Or will she cheat on me again? She already did, I was involved, and I cheated on my girlfriend, I know, but cheating on your spouse that's a whole other level..
What if I'm not even the only one that she's CURRENTLY cheating her husband with?! How would I know?
And the doubts got bigger and bigger with every hour I spend, nothing could distract me, nothing made me feel comfort.. my mind was just thinking about her and reasons that I shouldn't trust her at all.. 
Am I just her side-guy? is she just giving me what I want so she can keep me to herself as one of her boy-trophies? Why does she hide lots of things from me? In fact why does she hide everything from me and only tell me what is beneficial for her to make me hooked even more?
I was just doubting everything about her... And I came to a conclusion, I should breakup with her, on all levels, the lover, and the friend..

So I met her yesterday, I told her that I can't bear the feeling after having sex with her, a married woman, and I told her that our relationship is just making us cause harm to people who love us, me to ""Alex"" and her to her husband.. I told her that we should cut it off and end everything.. 

We cried a lot, but she agreed.. 

Now it's been since yesterday that I can't bear the idea of losing her, and I cried a lot for that.. 
I really do love her, and I want her to be with me forever, but I also can't shut the doubting voices in my head and I can't bear the idea of being with her while she's with her husband.. 
I'm really lost, and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it.. 
It hurts too much having the thought that I won't be having her in my life anymore...

Please advice me on what you think of the whole situation, and what you think I should do now, and what you think I should do to forget her...",25Mar2020,1

I also don’t have a crush on him anymore. But, I’m actually not happy about the decisions I made related to him since I didn’t respect his boundaries. So how should I fix those mistakes. Should I apologise to him or something?",25Mar2020,1
919," 

Title probably isn't the best. I'll do my best to explain the situation.

My friend and I aren't extremely close. I would say we're borderline friends/acquaintances.

I joined my friend's server before my birthday. In their introduction template, it was mandatory of them to disclose an age. I was uncomfortable disclosing my actual age so I put in one that was pretty close to my actual age. I was underage when I joined the server. I believe my friend was the one who let me in.

The server was pretty friendly, but I occasionally felt that there were instances of staff abusing their power. For example, there was an incident where someone was misusing the 'confession bot', and staff was trying to find out who it was. One of the staff members pinged a user and immediately began accusing them of misusing the bot. They said that they had 12h/24h (don't remember if it was 12h or 24h) to 'screenshare' their DMs and prove that they weren't the one misusing the bot. I think the user had already sent a screenshot of their DMs with the bot to staff, but staff continued to insist that the photo 'could have been photoshopped'. I DMed the user and asked for a screenshot, and I got one almost immediately. Timestamps aligned as well.

I left the server and rejoined after my birthday. By then, I was a legal adult and put in my actual age, thinking that it didn't really matter as much since I'm an adult. A couple of days ago, one of the members of staff pulled me over to discuss the age discrepancy. I told them that I didn't feel comfortable about disclosing my actual age at the time when I first joined. My friend knew I didn't have any bad intentions and vouched for me. Rather than getting banned, I got muted for a week.

I thought this punishment was kind of bullshit since the staff already knew that I had no bad intentions. I was semi-active in the server and haven't done anything that would set them off (apart from the age thing). A couple of days later, I left the server.

I rejoined the server under an alt and talked for a bit in the server. Today, I was pulled under scrutiny because I had a similar texting style to my main account and was asked to send a picture. I sent a picture of one of my internet friend's (with their consent. I explained the situation to my internet friend and they agreed to let me use their photo under the conditions that I deleted it afterwards). Things began to spiral down from there and I eventually admitted that I was an alt. My main was banned because (according to my friend) I left before the mute.

I apologized to my friend, and they said "" Both of your accounts are currently banned. Had you stayed in the server on your main and waited out the mute, you would've had a chance"", etc. I shouldn't have lied to my friend about the photo, but I felt that the initial punishment was much too severe.",25Mar2020,1

I’m from Chicago and today a mail came to my house from the police saying that I was involved in a hit and run traffic crash weeks ago, I called to the number that’s on the paper for more information, and supposedly I hit a man with my car, and I’m not going to lie and I swear that I don’t remember doing that, the place and the times are correct, I was going through that street like I always do in the mornings, he told me that there’s 2 witnesses and someone recorded a video (I wanna know how they recorded the exact moment) when I called, he told me to choose if I wanna get all the blame or search for new evidence, I chose the second one, after that, he told me that they’re gonna check more, and I just should wait, if I’m guilty, police is coming to knock my door, and if I don’t, then I’m free.
After this I went to the police department for more info, and when I told 2 police guys that on the phone call they told me that the police is gonna come to knock my door they just look at each other like saying “what?” And he told me to look for the report and check everything, but the worse that can happen is that my license can get suspended, or if the guy has injuries he can sue me.
I checked the report where there’s his info such as phone # name and date of birth, this guy is a 71 year old man that supposedly I hit with the front part of my car knocking him to the ground but I DONT REMEMBER DOING THAT, like I can’t be that blind to hit a pedestrian and not know, there’s no way, report says that “the victim was treated for a left leg injury by a doctor ******, victim held for x rays and observations before being treated and released”

927,"My great grandpa died about I think 10 years before I was born, and his wife, my Nana, died in early 2013 when I was 6. When my great grandparents started getting older my grandpa, their son, started taking care of them. In 2006 I was born next door to their house. My Nana loved gardening and bird watching and I would help her do those things because it was fun to spend time with her, and I loved gardening and helping things grow. She had really cool decorations inside, all mainly 80s and 90s furniture and decorations. I liked to play with the little shelf decor all of the time. 

My Nana died at 90 from Alzheimers, and she didn't really remember anybody in my family, and if she did, she got them mixed up for other people. I she knew my grandpa was her son but didn't really know exactly who he was. She knew my mom as my mom, but also didn't really know who she was personally. She thought my dad was my great grandpa, but oddly she always remember me, even though for her I had only been around for a maximum of 6 years. 

I have other posts of the time I saw her spirit after she died, and I've never really seen her since, but my grandpa let some drug addicts live with him right before she died and they stayed there for with him 8 years after the fact, and one of them has 2 young kids. All of them have been held into rooms when nobody but them was in the house, regardless of the bedroom doors not having locks, things have flown across the room, like once an entire roll of toilet paper, and when you're in the basement sometimes you can hear footsteps above you regardless of the fact that everybody is downstairs. I have seen lights turn on even though nobody was home and the power was shut off completely, I have seen candles blow out without wind. My grandpa has been punched and bruised in his sleep without anyone being home. 

This doesn't scare me because I know that the spirits are my family and they love me. Everybody says that it's a man that looks just like my grandpa, (my grandpa's father) and I just want a way to set them free and send them to Heaven. They deserve to be free and not have to watch their house decay and be infested with illigal substances.

We did this the year before about 8 times in the summer and it was great. This time we went in April so it was abit colder than Summer. When we got to the field we was camping in, my friend immediately began cooking bacon and burgers on a portable BBQ. I was sat opposite him with the smoke from the BBQ blowing in my face. I sat there for minimum of 2 hours with the smoke blowing in my face to the point that I had to cover my face with a blanket. The reason I didn’t move was because we was sitting on a picnic bench and there was no where else to sit and I didn’t want my seat to get taken and me have to sit on the cold wet floor lol. Halfway through the night we began a fire which lasted all night and in then morning we burned the tent as we had no use for it anymore (stupid I know). Anyways when I got home the next day I was violently ill with stomach ache and passed out in my hallway. I didn’t eat any of the burgers or bacon yet was showing the symptoms of food poisoning. Is it possible the smoke from either the burning tent or bacon and burgers caused this or is it coincidental that I caught a bug the day after camping? Sorry im not very smart with things like this.

I'm usually good at avoiding a situation like that because I dont like doing things I would need to apologize for in the first place, but this week I've dropped the ball twice. First, I repeated something my roommate told me about the coronavirus to my work group text and scared my coworkers over it, and I later found out it was just a rumor that was false. I had to apologize to my manager for scaring her over it.

Then just now I had to apologize to my trainee over insisting that i trained her to do something when I really trained someone else on it. She told me it never happened and I didnt believe her until I checked our records. I apologized for treating her that way and that I should have remembered to train her like the other girl.

I made an account on roomster.com because I’m looking for a place to live for the summer. Four people have reached out to me that just happen to have the exact price that I’m looking for. However I said I was looking for a room around $400/month because I’m a starving college student, and the houses/rooms that they sent me pictures of looked like they’d be well past $700-$800 rooms.

On top of that each of them said that they are out of town for one reason or another and couldn’t show me the house. They each assured me that there was nothing to worry about even though I didn’t even mention anything about being cautious.

Most of them said that I could make a deposit through some cash app to get the spot because “many people had contacted them about the same room.” They were very pushy about me making a quick decision.

So it’s clearly a scam. Is it all the same person and/or company? I’m not sure.

937,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 1/2 year and it's been okay. We met through a mutual friend and he was quite awkward during the first month or two dating. He later confided in me that it was his first relationship. My boyfriend grew up isolated and didn't have friends and so he hasn't had the usual experiences ""normal"" people like you and me have. 

After a long heart-to-heart discussion our relationship has been going well with some occasional bumps. I sometimes take a ""teaching"" role to help him know what a relationship is supposed to be and how people act. He was a virgin so sex was quite bad at the start to be honest (first ever kiss too) but he's learning and trying new stuff and he's gained some confidence. Now, here's where the problem is. These past months my boyfriend has been getting more depressed about being a late bloomer. He feels that he missed out on the ""normal"" experience that people are supposed to have. Dating while you're a teenager, losing your virginity, first kiss etc. I told him that no one is the same and that he should feel proud with the progress that he's made and instead of looking at that past, see where he is now. 

But he just can't let it go. He's been looking at porn, instagram accounts and just people in general saying on how he'll never get to date/be with them or just have casual sex. ""Am I just going to have 1 partner"" I felt quite hurt at this and asked if he wanted to break up with me but he said no. But again, he just can't let it go. It's people this, date that, casual sex this, wants fuck this person or try this thing whatever. He just can't get this out of his head. It's been getting quite exhausting. I told him to bring this up with his therapist and he said that he has but that it doesn't matter, he missed out and will never catch up. I like him but I don't know what to do. How do I help him?

Other than going to work when they need me, I’m pretty quarantined. I got a bunch of groceries the other week to prepare to hunker down for a while. 
My roommate is taking this time away from classes (they moved it to all being online for us) to work a ton more. She came home from work today, stopped in the living room to tell me that she found out 2 people in the hospital that she knows of we’re getting tested, then immediately went into the kitchen, all while still in her scrubs. 
She asked to use some of my food, idc, but I asked her if she could go change out of her scrubs. She kinda rolled her eyes, she was like “i wasn’t in contact with anyone it’s not a big deal” and as I pushed it and finally I got a “fine” from her and she went and changed. 
When she came down, my boyfriend (who was sitting next to me this whole time) said to her “wash your hands!” as she went into the kitchen. Under her breath she said “i’m not a f****ing child”, then did not wash her hands, and proceeded to make food in the kitchen. 
I’m upset, I feel like she just absolutely disrespected our own health concerns and seems to not be concerned about it at all. I’m busting my ass to make sure the house is clean, I shower immediately after getting home from work every day. 
For some more references ; 
- This roommate and I are really good friends, I’m scared to begin a fight with her and don’t want to damage our friendship. 
- Our 3rd roommate, while very healthy and young, has an auto immune disease (diabetes). 
- Roommate of concern works in a mother infant ward, understandably not a huge risk there of the virus, but in a hospital none the less.

Alex was not fully aware of the extent of Beth's condition; as she became more acquainted with Beth, she decided they were not compatible. However, she was willing to be friends with Beth and Beth was cool with that. 

Alex and I play an online PC game together. Beth said she was interested in playing with us, and she reached out to me on Facebook about it and I helped her get set up with the game. I also set up a Discord chat with her, Alex, and a couple of other friends that Alex and I play with. I was happy to include Beth because I know how isolated she has been since the TBI. 

Now, Beth doesn't play video games, and her TBI makes it very difficult for her to learn games. We try to help her when we can, but sometimes our patience wears thin. She repeats questions, she does not seem to grasp simple concepts, and our games are usually DOA if she is on our team. Additionally, I don't really even like her personality. She annoyingly messages me and Alex several times a day asking if we can play (even after we say ""maybe, we'll let you know"").  I don't really know how to talk to her. She does not talk much, or seem to carry any personal opinions (she just echoes back whatever we say). I could go in more detail, but the point is I do not enjoy her company.

I'm surprised and slightly ashamed by just how little tolerance I have for her, especially since I know many of her traits are because of her TBI. I feel bad because I know we're the only social interaction she has, but I've never met this girl in person and I don't really know what I can do to help her. 

Should I continue things as they are, just letting her play with us whenever she asks? Should I let her know how I feel (she does sometimes ask me if I'm annoyed by her playing with us and I tell her no)? I feel like there's only so much I can do for this girl. 

Note: I feel like most people will say this is Alex's problem; however, I'm the more social one in the group and Beth has clung to me the most, so I feel like this is something I have to decide outside of Alex's actions.",25Mar2020,1
946,"*Let's call him Rob and his girlfriend Mimi, and my classmate Finn*

When i first moved to my town I instantly became friends with my neighbors. I was 14 when I moved with my mom and brother. I met Rob who was 16 then, and we instantly clicked. He was very sweet and so was all of his siblings and family. I fell in love with him gradually as time moved on. I know he knew, but he was also a somewhat of a shy boy so he didn't make a move for a long time.

A month before my 15 birthday, he and I slept together. I remember him asking me if it was okay to kiss me and things like that. Like I said, he is a very sweet boy. I obviously trusted him, since i knew him for a while then. We slept together normally since then, and we never told anyone. No one knew, we were only sex buddies. I always thought that he would eventually ask me to be his girlfriend, but i enjoyed being in secret too much since there were no explaining to do to friends.

When I was 16 and insanely stubborn and was easily jealous, I heard him, his brother, and my brother talking about some girl they met and found attractive. I never dealt with jealousy before, so i thought Rob was genuinely dating some girl. That was when I completely lost it and started sleeping with a classmate named Finn. Rob knew the day after when he asked why I wouldn't kiss him. I just told him I couldn't be with someone like him. I didn't let him know that I was jealous of the girl he was talking about because of my stubborn jealous self. So I continued sleeping with Finn.

Few months passed and I saw him and Mimi ( the girl he was talking about ) at a family party. I just never thought he would hurt me, but here I was being hypocritical. Me sleeping with Finn, and I couldn't let him be with another girl. Of course I acted like it was all fine, even though I was heartbroken inside. I stopped sleeping with Finn and we remained kind of friends. And all I did was focus on school.

Summer comes along, and I celebrate my birthday a little early at my house. Still no Rob, but I was glad a bit just because I would probably cry if he talked to me again. I celebrated my birthday early since i had to visit my grandmother upstate on my actual birthday and it would take a while to drive there. My mom drove me there and left me to stay with my grandmother and it all went fine.

Afternoon came around, and I heard a car engine outside. This is a very quiet and small neighborhood, so i was genuinely confused who it was. I saw Rob there and I invited him in. He met my grandmother and it went great somehow. We ate cake, and it was time to sleep soon. After my grandmother went to bed, we kissed and had sex in my room. I have to tell you that I felt whole and complete when I was with him. Even if we didn't have sex, just him visiting me on my birthday made me feel so happy. It went on like that for a few days, and it seemed like everything was going to okay.

One morning when I woke up earlier than him, I saw Mimi calling on his phone. I literally felt my heart drop to my stomach when I saw her on his phone. I picked up, and she asked me where he was and that it was urgent. When I asked what happend, she said that he left her a week earlier and that she needed to fix things with him. I told her that he was here and gave him the call. While he was talking to hear, I was internally slapping myself for being such an idiot. I knew how much people hate the other woman or the mistress, and I had realized that I never asked if he was still with her when we slept together.

After the phone call, I immediately told him to leave. I couldn't stand in this situation between a man and his girlfriend. He told me that he broke it off with her because he loved me and loads of bullshit like that. I just couldn't believe the kind of person I became. I told him if he came any closer I would scream. And in this neighborhood during the morning, it was pretty easy to hear a woman screaming. He left me and I didn't see him since. I blocked his number, and the worst part was that I think he was telling the truth. For some reason I think I still love him and I hate it. Please tell me what I should do, I have not told anyone because of how embarrassed I am.",25Mar2020,1

949,"I recently moved into a studio apartment that is inside a townhouse. It’s got its own private entrance with a locked door separating me from the rest of the home. I was told the rest of the house was office space that was not being rented out. But a group of young males have just moved into the rest of the house, both upstairs and downstairs, so essentially they take up about 80% of the home while I live in the small 20% in the back. 

Two separate leases. 
Two totally separate living spaces. 
..Same house. 

The property manager informed me *after* I had to reach out to her that the office spaces were now being rented out residentially so the owner could essentially make a buck. 

It’s as if I now have roommates I did not sign up for. 

They yell, stomp, and play loud, bass heavy music full volume every single night since they moved in (5 days ago now). Very rude and annoying , especially considering the first night they were here I confronted them to tell them I was trying to sleep. They turned down the music a hair but kept partying until about midnight. 

I have already emailed the property manager who said she would speak with the owners and said she was sorry for what I was dealing with and it was unacceptable behavior. 

Not sure what to do if the owners can’t control them. I obviously do not want to live in a house with tenants that the owner can’t control. Especially since I didn’t even think anyone else would be living here. If the owner doesn’t fix the issue, what should be my next plan of action? 

I’ve had folks tell me to give them a taste of their own medicine. I’ve had folks say get a legal team involved to try to break the lease if the owners can’t make them stop. I’ve had folks say call the cops on them. 

Any advice would help.",25Mar2020,1

^^ continuing from that, I really need a good system in place that will help me discipline them when they're talking over me (the teacher), or not doing work (etc).

One thing I want to keep the same roughly is the time they start, I'd like that to stay at around 10am. Since all this Covid19 stuff has been stressing them out too, I want them to get enough sleep, and I don't mind finishing later to ensure that happens.

- any example routines?
- how would you discipline / reward them - what system should I use?

960,"Hi!

We have been mulling things over for the last week, and I'm looking for outside perspective.  Some background that is odd: we currently technically maintain two households in 2 states due to his current job, although they are only a couple hours' drive from one another (therefore travel between is very cheap).  Complicating everything is that this is happening NOW, while the nation and world are in a whirlwind of uncertainty.  This is causing even more anxiety. 

Here is where we stand on our Pro/Cons of the new job, starting with Neutral:

Neutral: 

* Pay.  New job is in a more expensive state but comes with more money.  After rent and respective states' taxes, take home is estimated to be the exact same between the two jobs
* Same level position
* Both jobs offer travel for conferences (a must for him)
* Both jobs have similar PTO policies/benefits

Pros:

* New job is in the state we want to move back to, in one of the general areas we would be interested in living in
* New job is at a highly successful large company, in a cutting edge research division partnered with the government in areas my husband is very excited to have an opportunity to work in
* We have friends and family in the area where he would be moving
* New job has better retirement offerings/contribution
* Route to promotion is much faster at new job (he is unlikely to be eligible for promotion at his current company for 7+ years, versus 1+ at new company)
* New job offers potentially higher bonuses than current job
* New job has opportunity for much higher yearly raises
* New job might (this is not entirely certain, but suspected) be in a slightly better funded field than his current, and may be increasingly so in the future 

Cons:

* Cost of living in new state is very high
* We would be long distance for quite some time before I could find a suitable job there (because I am also in a niche field, and the job market for my industry has absolutely been wiped out by coronavirus/economy)
* Any job I get in the new state will offer significantly less PTO than I have now due to my level of seniority with my present company
* He would not be able to telecommute nearly as much as he does now, so seeing each other much less
* We have a very comfortable social network here
* I may not be able to keep some of my professional affiliations if I move jobs
* We would have to pay to fly to see each other
* New job's health care is higher deductible and more expensive (which potentially lowers some of the take home pay)
* Commute times in new state are significantly higher
* Utilities and goods in the new state are much higher
* He currently has a government job (technically contractor, but very secure), so not sure if he would be losing some job security?
* He has to give up the projects he currently manages (which were his ideas that he has personally developed and has a lot of pride in), including the network of students and interns he has cultivated
* The coronavirus happened and is happening.  No idea what this means for job security or how the new company will do, etc.
* His new position may not allow him to collaborate at other facilities the way he has so far in his career, which currently allows him to travel to many other facilities nationwide where he has strong networks he has developed and truly enjoys

As an unknown: My current job is incredibly stable (minus current coronavirus unknowns), and I have quite a bit of seniority and excellent benefits.  On the other hand, I have no opportunity for advancement, and minimal opportunity for more money (especially right now).  I'm effectively professional stagnant, and would not be opposed to a new opportunity.  Moving would not guarantee an upward mobility, however, as my industry is quite small and I may be forced to look for similar level positions, lower level positions, and not necessarily more pay in order to make the move.

Would love to hear your advice Redditors!",25Mar2020,1
961,"I hope this thread kicks off, because I really could do with the support right now.

I'm a male in my late twenties and, like many of my fellow human beings, am struggling to cope with life. I know I'm not in the worst of situations and I always try to put things into perspective, but at the end of the day I can't help feel how I do. It seems that no matter what, there's always going to be some next obstacle around the corner waiting to knock the wind out of me.

At first, I struggled in childhood. I was bullied constantly at school, and my loving parents were somewhat neglectful. I fought internally every day, wrestling with both anxiety and depression, and it wasn't until my early twenties that I finally started to get a grip on a level of self-esteem and confidence.

Then, my first partner left me. We'd been together for a few years, and I had intended to propose. It wasn't so much the breakup as it was her actions; she falsely accused me of abuse, spreading this around like wildfire, and soon after there was another guy in the picture. Everything I had achieved up until that point came crashing down and I was a mess. It was around this time I started on anti-depressants, and began going to therapy.

Yet, I still managed to push myself to go to university. That period of my life was a mixed bag; on the one hand I really pushed myself and made a lot of improvements to myself, but on the other I made a few missteps socially which made things difficult in the short-term. I struggled to make friends and to date, and those I did get involved with I would later find to be toxic, but by then the damage to my esteem had already been told.

Despite all this, I became successful in achieving my life goals and starting my career. I was looking forward to a breath of fresh air, free from being a student and carving my own path. I was so excited for my new job, but it ended up being a total disaster; I was in a hostile work environment, and within weeks faced malicious accusations which cost me my job, and an ongoing investigation which could alter my life for the worse. So here I am, right now, with this dark cloud hovering over my head not wanting to go away. I've received no legal or emotional support from the organisation that is meant to be assisting me, so I've been left alone to deal with the administration and legal aspects.

I've got friends, but many live so far away. They have partners, or are struggling with life themselves, but non of them really make an effort to talk to me or find out how I am coping. I appreciate them, greatly, and they are good friends, but they're not the type to go out of their way to help others, and right now that's the sort of person I need in my life. As for dating; I'm stuck in the same rut I was in several years ago. I'm attractive, healthy and otherwise a decent bloke, but getting a woman to so much as want to talk to me is like looking for a needle in a haystack, except the haystack is on fire and there's seventy of them to search through. The only thing going right for me right now, is that I've managed to come off my anti-depressants and also take up some creative interests.

I'm just...really tired. I'm tired of the hostility I keep facing from people, I'm tired of overcoming a life challenge only to have five more thrown my way, I'm tired of having my self-esteem and confidence dip up-and-down like a yo-yo. I'm tired of having friends but feeling as if I have no friends. I'm tired of being told I'm desirable but feeling like the ugliest man on the planet. I just, desperately, need that break. That moment in my life when, finally, things turn out okay.

I've considered ending it, but there's always something holding me back. I'm still here, in my late twenties, feeling as if I will never be able to have a smoother ride or enjoy life. But I haven't given up, no matter how tired I am.

But this past month or so I've just had very little inspiration and any time I sit down to try and make something or learn something I just lose focus and get bored and quit after like 15 minutes.  Not sure what to do about this.

I think most of it is that I'm out of ideas and haven't reached the skill level I want.  I've made some songs I consider to be pretty good, but they're weird and extremely unlike practically anything I've ever listened to, plus they're pretty simple in terms of composition.  I'd like to be able to make more generic stuff just to combine the weird shit with some more standard stuff as well, but every time I try I just hit a block.  I also want to sing and write lyrics, but my voice is ridiculously deep, and I don't have any idea how to work with it at this point, even though I think I can hit notes fairly well since I can harmonize with most singers I listen to.

966,"I am 19 now. It was two years ago probably March. I remember it being a Friday. Who knows? The day was a memorable one. So, I was kind of in a bad mood cause of an ‘F’ I got from a recent physics test. It was cloudy outside about which I didn’t care much at first. I skipped the thought of bringing an umbrella. The school for some reason closed at 15:00 while it was supposed to at 13:00. I was on my way home walking alone since my friends present that day lived the other way. Halfway through, clouds began to go crazy. A heavy amount of rain and I was preparing to run for it but then I decided to wait it out. There was this closed construction site next to the road. I sought out shelter and settled myself under a ledge to wait it out. It was cold and my uniform was all wet. After a while. I noticed a beautiful girl likely 30 yards away standing below another ledge from a separate structure wearing a wet red tops and I don’t know could be jeans (I have different versions of the day in my head). There was nothing but rain between us only the ledges protecting us from it. I don’t know how long she was standing there but it was weird for me to notice her in that passion. I was didn’t care much at first but soon my mind goes haywire. I was looking for an excuse to start a conversation with her. At the same time I didn’t want to frighten her since no one was around at. I was afraid of what she might think. We stood there for like twenty minutes. Within that, we peeked at each other catching eye to eye once. She was awfully quiet without a shred of expression in her face. In a way, it made me hesitant. A lot was going on my mind but I couldn’t gather any strength to go and talk to her. It was seriously awkward. Something I’ve never felt before. I checked the clock which read 16:12 (memories are precious). Rain wasn’t going to stop, soon it felt lighter I walked away and I still don’t know why. She was still standing there. The corner of my eyes could see her staring at me as I was leaving which I shouldn’t have. I have no idea what was going in on her mind but I could say that I felt heavy after that. I regretted not looking back, even once. Maybe my brain made her way too prettier than she really was. She wasn’t from my school and I was convinced that I’d never see her again. 

A year later, it was warm and sunny. I was minding my own business and just like that I saw her again walking past me with an umbrella. I didn’t believe that just happened. I had to be sure it was indeed her and it was. But this time there was nothing special about it. It’s as is how we cross past pedestrians like they are nobody. But we shared a glance of each other, not the kind of dramatical I wished for. In easy words, it felt like nothing. I let it slide since it seemed unrealistic to make a move. She was on my mind for a while after that incident and the result eventually became usual. The part blurred out. A few months after that I had career plans and had to move to a new place on my own. I don’t believe in destiny but last month before this whole pandemic bullshit, I’ve found out that she is my new neighbor.  

I have no idea what this may bring to but I don’t know what should I do, like logically. Should I let it go? Which I pretty much think I won’t. I may surely get a chance to talk to her after this Covid-19 shit blows over. Even if I were to have that chance what should seem logical to be done? Should I simply approach her like we’ve met and stuff? In that case, how am I supposed to approach her. And what if she’s not into me? I am not deeply in love with her but I admire her in some way. Maybe her strong, silent type personality. I don’t know cause I don’t know her.. Given that the terrible relationship I was previously part of, what’s there to do?

His friends are extremely introverted and when I talk I usually dont get any responce. I guess he finds me embarassing but hes restricting my right to speak and im an extrovert!",25Mar2020,1
968,"at the end of this week, or beginning of next week we're probably gonna be working from home (&amp; since we've been social distancing that means staying home all day) .  
I heard all my friends that are already quarantined and some of them seems going crazy. . .  
what can me and my boyfriend (living &amp; working from home together) do to avoid becoming crazy? or rant on each other? 

I know some physical activity can help, but what else?",25Mar2020,1
969,"For the past week now after going to bed for about 20 mins I have seen a bright flash across my vision, I think it’s a bright white or blue and it happens in a rapid fire of two bursts. I normally wake up and look around and have been putting it down the the fact maybe it’s an LED in my room or something. Today I’ve come to the conclusion that it is 100% not an LED and don’t know what it is. I may be over reacting a lot but I’m just looking for re assurance as I’ve heard you can see stuff like this with migraines without actually feeling the migraine pain",25Mar2020,1
970,"To be honest, I also feel bad because he was one of my close friends too. I also feel bad for his friends that are going through the pain of losing him. But I do not feel sorry for the girl who rejected me. She and her friends made fun of my advancements towards her putting me into a state mental trauma and self doubt. It is our senior year and I decided to shoot my shot at her and she shut me down brutally. I’m not angry at her for rejecting me, it’s just the way she chose to do it and how she acted afterwards. She thought she was superior to me just because she rejected me. It is said that you cannot fully understand the pain someone goes through unless you feel it for yourself. Pain is Pain after all. I am glad that she got to share even a glimpse of the pain she put me through. She definitely deserved this. I’ve been thinking about this al lot lately and I think it just might be karma. What goes around comes around. We don’t make eye contact anymore and every time I walk pass her in the hallways I smile because I know she has finally felt my pain. I don’t think it’s wrong to think this way because my thoughts aren’t exactly hurting anybody . Am I justified to think this way?",25Mar2020,1
971,There’s a girl that I’m interested in that’s in my lab group. I also go to a bigger university. I ended up getting her snapchat almost a week ago and haven’t talked to her. How should I start talking to her? Just ask her about class and then how do you get to know someone personally?,25Mar2020,1
972,I’m 16 and it’s hard for me to really get into my religion because I haven’t let go of worldly things in my life. I have said the sinners prayer and I believe Jesus Christ as my lord and savior but in reality I haven’t felt it in my heart. It’s hard for me to cause I’m clinging onto worldly things too often. I think it’s because I haven’t really felt God’s presence in my life completely. And I still wanna do worldly things because I wanna experience life even though I’m not really supposed to because it’s not good for my soul. How do l let go and let God ?,25Mar2020,1
973,"My family is not very supportive but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. They are big meat eaters and try to get me to eat meat everything. It’s not that I have not enjoyed meat but it’s not what I want to do. I have my own reasons for transitioning and I’m not trying to push it on them to do the same but I want some support. Anyways, what can I do for myself to make it a tad easier? I really want this and am ready.",25Mar2020,1
974,"So my gf called me earlier today and we talked for a bit. I told her I'd give her a call later in the evening. I called her when I said I would and we talked for a few minutes and then I noticed her not really talking and could hear her typing. I asked her if she was still working and she said, ""Yeah. Bye."", and she hung up. I tried calling her back but gave up before I got to voicemail. She called me a few minutes later and I ignored it but called her back like 10 minutes later. She said that she felt like I was mad that she was doing something else while on the phone with me. She also said that I didn't seem that interested in the conversation because she was talking about how much she hates her job and I wasn't saying much. I was really upset. I told her it was very rude of her to hang up on me and that if she was busy all she had to do was say, ""Hey can I call you back?"". I also said that I know she doesn't like her job and I'm just trying to let her vent and if I didn't have much to say it was because I spent the last two days at home not doing much. I felt like she was rude and taking my sympathetic ear for granted. Am I right or just being overly sensitive?",25Mar2020,1
975,"I saw the Edward Snowden Joe Rogan Experience and in one discussion Edward Snowden claims he cannot come back to US, because if he decides to come back and files a lawsuit, that would put US government at trial, which is not possible. Can anyone explain me that.

Will such a case have a stand in the court of law?

Thanks.",25Mar2020,1
976,"I feed the trolls or just general idiots on Facebook of all places (and Instagram or YouTube sometimes). If I see a comment that's misinformed or just plain wrong I can't stop myself from correcting them. That would be fine if I could leave it alone after but I can't. I will keep responding until they no longer respond or they say something dumb enough that I don't even need to anymore. I know I'm right and just can't stop myself most of the time. I never insult anyone but an online argument becomes my whole life while it's happening. I refresh the page constantly, ready to go again. I've done this for multiple days before. I've made a fake account for when people block my main so I can continue my point. Arguing physically makes me shake sometimes and I don't know why. Please help me figure out a way to stop arguing.

TL;DR: I will continuing arguing to the death. Help me stop.",25Mar2020,1

978,"Hell Reddit, I have been concerned about my art style recently. I really like it, but I do have a concern. I’m afraid it looks like it’s in the SJW art style. I do draw characters with diverse skin colors and body types, but I don’t do it just for the sake of making them diverse. It just kind of happens. Anyway, if even a few of you were to look at my art I would really appreciate an honest opinion.   [Some of My Drawings](https://imgur.com/gallery/uAuPbiG)",25Mar2020,1
