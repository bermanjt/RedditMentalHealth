1,"We broke up after 5 months because of her worsening mental health (18M)(17F). I supported her getting help and everything and let her be by herself. After a month of trying something we both knew that it was best to not force anything and for her to focus on herself. We told each other that we will always love each other and all that. It was my first real relationship and we were best friends before dating also so it wasn't arguing or anything bad, just a mutual agreement. I guess I'm confused on what being friends means now, she still wants to hang out and talk to me like before. Has anyone been friends with their ex before? How did that turn out?",13Jan2020,1
2,"Background: I (24F) graduated from college about a year ago, and moved out of my parents house into my friend’s parents house about 5 months ago. After graduating, I had a very tough time finding a job, but was very desperate to move out of my parents house mostly due to my mom’s judgement/narcissism/manipulation/guilt tripping etc due to our opposing views (a lot of it stems from her being Catholic and raising me Catholic, but me solidifying my atheist beliefs around ages 16-18). 

Anyways, I eventually found a job outside of my field about 2 hours from home. It paid just okay, which meant that the only way I could move out financially was to move in with my friend’s family and pay them about $130 per month for utilities. So I did because I felt that it was an important step for my mental health, and to learn to become more independent. My parents are glad I found a job and am happy with my current living situation, but I’m having anxiety over my next step.

My boyfriend (26M) and I have been dating for a year, and I love him a lot. Our relationship is really healthy, we’re a great team, we laugh a ton together, and we communicate through conflicts well. Although marriage scares the shit out of me, I can see myself being with him for a really long time. We recently talked about moving in with each other because we both feel really solid about our relationship, it would save us both money on rent, and I can’t live with my friend’s parents forever. 

I know I’m going to have to tell them soon, because they’re going to find out one way or another, my mom needs to know every detail of my life, they’ll come to visit me, I want them to welcome/like my boyfriend because I love him, etc. I’m just really scared to tell them because my mom has judged some of my cousins for moving in with their SO’s before marriage, and whenever I try to tell my mom something important to me, she turns it around and makes me feel guilty about it because it doesn’t align with her personal beliefs. She’s very about “family” even though our family is not very close, and will call me disrespectful for not falling in line with the “family” even though she means falling in line with her. My dad is less judgmental and easier to talk to, but he married very young and it ended poorly (before my mom), so I think he has some anxieties about that. 

I want to stand up for myself and live my life for me, not them. I’m just scared of the repercussions/fallout so I’m trying to figure out the best way possible to do it.",13Jan2020,1
5,"Starting off this new year has already been a series of unfortunate events for me. I left my makeup bag at my job one night after closing because I was in a bit of a rush to leave and forgot to grab it, I had not noticed that I left it there till the next morning when I went to go look for it and couldn't find it. I went into work and asked everyone if they had seen it and they all said no so I figured that it must have gotten taken, I was a little bummed out about it because there was a lot of expensive makeup in there and I had gotten brand new makeup for Christmas that was in there as well. I didn't make a big deal about it though because I figured who ever took it needed it more than me, and it was my own fault for not keeping track of my belongings. 

So that happens and I just brush it off and am whatever about it because theres more makeup at the store, but then one night when I am leaving work again and walking out to my car I witness one of my coworkers back into my rear bumper as they were leaving which ended up scratching a whole bunch of paint off my car.

Then a few days ago I am getting ready to go to the gym and I go to grab my hair brush and see a freakin bug crawling on a strand of hair that was stuck in my brush...it was FREAKIN LICE!!!!!! come to find out that I was given lice by my boyfriends cousin who had gotten it from school, his cousin usually chills in his room and lays on his pillows and stuff so one of those little shits must have crawled into my hair via the pillow. That really infuriated me because I am a (20f) and lice especially when you're a girl that has long thick hair, is so hard to get rid of and it just makes me feel non hygienic even though I know having lice doesn't make you dirty, but no one wants to have tiny bugs walking around their scalp laying eggs. So long story short I had to do a lice treatment and fumigate my whole room and my boyfriend had to do the same.

Then last night while I was out with some friends my jaw really started hurting me but I didn't think much of it and figure it would just go away. The pain started to hurt more and more through out the night and I could feel the sides of my cheeks starting to get swollen. When I woke up this morning my whole face had swelled up including my glands underneath and I could barley open my mouth, I had thought that maybe I was having an allergic reaction to something I had eaten or drank the night before and took a Benadryl but that didn't help. I woke my parents up and let them know how I was feeling and they could noticeably see how swollen my face was and my mom thinks that I have contracted the mumps...even though I was vaccinated for it twice as a child. Stranger things have happened though and its definitely a possibility because I got the chicken pox vaccine as a kid and ended having shingles when I was 18. I will be going to the doctors tomorrow to get it figured out.

I don't really know why these annoying things keep happening to me, Im not sure if it is just bad luck or if its the universe trying to tell me something. I just wanna know if anyone else has experienced a bunch of bad things happen to them back to back and how you dealt with it? and disclaimer I know that things could be worse and I am not trying to complain or act as if my life is so bad because its not I am a very blessed individual. I just want some words of wisdom for this rough patch.",13Jan2020,1
6,"

So my gf broke up with her ex 3 months ago and we’ve only just started dating. I know her ex he’s a little messed up in the head but he seemed an ok guy the few times that I met him. I know that he treated her like shit when they was going out it’s one of the main reasons me and my gf started talking I wanted to make sure she was ok. Anyway last night she told him that she’s met someone new (this is after he told her it’s over and he doesn’t give a shit about her ) and he had ago at her she didn’t tell him that it was me because we didn’t want to make things awkward. Anyways today we was walking from her house to mine and we decided to stop at the corner shop to get some sweets before we go to mine. So we walk round the corner and of course we walk into his sister I mean come on of all the people to bump into when we’re trying to hide our relationship from someone the second to last person you want to bump into is their sister. Anyway she says hi and acts normal so we feel awkward but carry on getting sweets then going to mine. A few minutes later my gfs phone is getting bombarded by messages from her ex saying that she’s a bitch and that sort of thing we ignore it cuz we don’t want to make things worse. A few minutes later he starts to message me saying that him and his brother are going to find me and “stamp on my head”. I try talking to him to calm him down put this just makes him more aggravated. So what do I do",13Jan2020,1
7,"I recently befriended one of the people I’ve idolized since I was a pre-teen. I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging, or being creepy, I just feel it’s necessary to include to understand where I’m coming from, and how this is even more upsetting. I spend most of my time online, as in my current situation isn’t the best and it’s my only access to a lot of things. I’m now twenty years old, and just started speaking to him last month, completely by accident. I saw his username and that he was following me, but thought it was just a fan account and brushed it off. I’d messaged him over an issue I had with, asking if he’d sent screenshots I posted on my *private* account to the person they were from(dick move, but it wasn’t without reason and that’s an entirely different story.)He denied, but mentioned that he noticed in my Instagram story I’d posted a photo of an album cover with the band he’s in, and that he really wasn’t trying to brag but was glad I enjoyed their music. He also said he liked my face. The way he said it was pretty weird but nonetheless, I was extremely flattered and shocked that I’d actually gotten to speaking to this guy I had such a big crush on. Eventually he began telling me things like how he values a stable and honest relationship, that his girlfriend had passed away years ago. What I found strange though, was when I apologized and said how sorry I was about what happened to her, he acted like it didn’t even matter. It was like he was talking about going to the grocery store, he was like “yeah it’s whatever”. I thought it was his way of coping, but it wasn’t. He eventually started telling me that he knows girls he has sex with, relationships disgust him, contradicting what he’d told me before about stable relationships. I asked him about this, and he got so pissed off and told me to only contact him once a week, he didn’t know why I’d ask something so stupid, that he’s a busy man, and whatever. I stalked his Instagram...and honestly I should not have been. Well, he has a girlfriend, and she is very much alive. He doesn’t explicitly say they’re together, and most of the posts are old (I assumed they were just friends at first) until I went to her profile and saw him name with a heart in her description, and more recent photos on her Instagram. I don’t really know what to do as I have no friends, have no life, enjoy talking to him. But we’ve had really nsfw conversations and photos and...I feel horrible. Guilty. I’m a really lonely person and while have realised he’s a jerk, I never speak to anyone else. I don’t know how to handle, confront, or mention any of this, or if I should just ignore it? I don’t know.",13Jan2020,1

9,"I’ve been looking at this for the last couple of months (yes months) and I still haven’t gotten an answer. I tried numerous online tests (with most of them indicating towards I do), but I know these tests are over exaggerated and inaccurate. 

I have tried tests for almost all mental health issues (as well as Autism and numerous personality disorders). 

• I often tell myself my life is not worth living and I often find myself mumbling kill yourself for no reason (never actions, but plenty of thoughts)

• When I walk down the street, I think everyone is judging me and are all saying horrible things about me

• I’ve had a few panic attacks (never really told anyone, not even parents)

• I come from as quite high income home, so I tell myself that there are people more in need than me so I shouldn’t matter when it comes to treatment

• When I get angry, I get real angry. I throw things until they break, punch pillows, walls, mattresses (anything I can punch), and sometimes start felling suicidal after the episode

• I have extremely low self esteem 

• I often put other people’s happiness ahead of me so much that I start suffering

• When I do something, I think of every single possible scenario before I do so, so I am extremely indecisive.

• I am a very secretive person. My parents don’t know who my friends are and I don’t reveal any information about my day to them

Both my parents work in social care so I really don’t want to bring their work into the home. This is probably the main reason I haven’t asked. Any questions I will answer but I won’t get back to you until the afternoon (British time, probably late morning for Americans).

For extra information, I’m a 14 year old male who does pretty well at school (frequently at top of the class).",13Jan2020,1
10,"How do I maintain a friendship with someone I envy? I’m sorry for the length, TL;DR at the bottom. 


Childhood friend and I are complete opposites. I grew up poor with only my mum. She worked multiple jobs to afford what little we had, always made sure I had enough to eat even if it meant she was hungry. In contrast, my friend comes from a very wealthy family, attended a public school and went on holidays around the world.


We met when we were young - her mum approached me at a piano competition saying her daughter loved how I played and if I could give her lessons. Always needing pocket money I gladly took the offer. I was 13, she was 7. I found her delightful and I took her under my wing. We lost contact for some years whilst we were busy with our studies but reconnected when she was in her late teens and I was in my early 20s.


Now in my mid 30s I have a stable job that pays decently, live in a nice flat with my mum and can afford the weekend holidays to the city that we couldn’t take when I was little. I’m very content with what I have and am very proud that I’ve worked for everything I have. 


My friend is in her 20s. She lives in a posh area in a beautiful flat. She has never held a job, her money comes from a monthly allowance deposited by her parents and inheritances from grandparents passing. I don’t begrudge her of her wealth. She was born into it, she can’t help it. However in the last few years she’s started to become entitled, making various complaints such as not being able afford rent because her parents went on an extra holiday instead of giving her money. She’ll invite me to dinner at an upscale restaurant, brag about her new Chanel handbag then ask me to pay when the bill arrives because she has no money.  She tells me she’s upset that she’s been “forced to use her inheritance money” to pay for everyday things. Even though she can’t even afford herself she bought an exotic animal which has ruined many of her clothes and furniture. She never takes any advice, she makes no effort to change her behavior and continues to live beyond her means whilst complaining her life is full of hardship. 


I don’t know what to do. We’ve known each other for so many years and despite our differences we’ve been like sisters so it feels wrong to consider ending the friendship. It feels disingenuous to pretend to be happy for her because it upsets me that she’s handed these wonderful things when I have to work so hard for something half as luxurious. She’s never had to work for anything so I know it’s not her fault but it’s getting harder and harder to be her friend. Lately I’ve been either ignoring her messages or sending her silly memes to avoid having any real conversation with her. Honestly when she’s not banging on about money she’s one of my favorite people. What do I do?


TL;DR My long time friend constantly complains about how terrible her life is despite her wealthy family providing everything she could want. Coming from a poor background I can’t stand to hear her complaints and it’s affecting our friendship. We’ve had soft confrontations about her attitude but she’s unlikely to change.",13Jan2020,1

     So first off, I’m young. Just a minor chilling on the internet. But I am very certain that I want to be in the fire service. It’s one of those things that I have to do or I’ll probably hate myself for wasting that potential. It’s just this HUGE dream of mine. And it has been for a long time. 
     The only thing holding me back is the probie stage. It’s not that I’m bad at taking orders or full-filling my responsibilities, it’s my huge fear that I’m going to fuck up (because I will fuck up eventually) and I’ll get yelled at and then I’ll cry in front of the person yelling at me. If that were to happen I’d just be so mortified that I might literally bury myself in a hole and die. 
     Every time I get yelled at, I cry. It happens every single time without fail and I’m so embarrassed about it. I’ve tried to stop myself from crying but nothing works and frankly it irritates the living days-lights out of me.
     I often link it to the verbal abuse I received as a young child but I really don’t think my future fire chief is going to give a shit. 
     Basically, what I’m asking is how do I overcome this? Should I ask people to yell at me until I’m over it? I’m at a loss here and I’m terrified of being too much of a pussy to be in the fire service. 
     If anyone has figured out how to overcome this your feedback would be very very appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: I want to be in the fire service when I’m older but I cry every time someone yells at me.",13Jan2020,1

Things have been taken out my room since my brother started living with us again, but everytime i mention something thats gone my mom yells at me, calls me crazy or says maybe i misplaced it &amp; he would never steal from her again. (When hes not here nothing goes missing or misplaced) since hes been here money, papers to smoke, gift cards etc have been stolen and hes moved so many things around searching threw our stuff. My mom is a workaholic so she doesnt have much time to clean her room, its not dirty but it just needs alot of organization. She has the night off and she is deciding to clean her room. Fast forward a few hours... i noticed she was quiet so i asked her if she was okay because she wasnt being talkative and vibrant like her self and she said yeah im noticing alot of my stuff missing etc... i said see what did i tell you. (Hes  been living here a few months and the whole time ive been telling her hes going threw both of our things &amp; stealing but she wont believe me) she thinks im trying to manipulate him, she thinks i hate on him. she tried to blame me, but i also threw out there anytime you clean your room your stuff is not missing now since hes here the stuff is gone? The last time she cleaned her room she didnt say anything was gone or missing this time shes cleaning it and hes here and things are gone. I told her My stuff has been missing too! She went mute. Hes every good at what he does connoving and sneaky I hope this makes since if not ask as many questions as needed.

What should i do?",13Jan2020,1
15,"Hello,

So there is this guy I really like, and I know that the more he sees me, the more he'll like me ( mere exposure effect). I also know that physical attraction is a possibility since he did check me out once. So, I feel like I have a solid chance at getting him to like me. However, the guy is so nice and liked by so many people. I feel like I'm just not good enough for him. Like, the girls he liked in the past were so much more outgoing and well-liked. I have social anxiety and am an introvert. Plus, I'm not nearly as gregarious and outgoing as he is. He knows I have social anxiety and all, which stresses me out even more because I feel like he'll start pitying me. 

I don't know what the best thing to do here is. He has no idea I like him, but it's not exactly like I can distance myself since we are involved in some social circles and share a class. I wish I could somehow still be friends with me and get over my feelings for him, but I have no idea if that's possible.  I think there is a part of me that hopes that he'll like me back, and I keep obsessing over it. It's emotionally draining.",13Jan2020,1

I repeatedly told my mother no, that I wouldn’t be very happy if she visited me. 

My cousin and I aren’t on the best of terms due to ignoring me throughout my childhood and not being willing enough to discuss the tension between us.

17,"Alright, So.. I'm a 22 year old ***physically*** disabled person living on their own in the privacy of an apartment on the lowest floor, where there is supposed to be the least amount of noise. I lived in this complex last year too, though I requested a move down to the renovated one due to less carpeting, which is far easier on my immune system and lungs.

I am in the renovated one now. And it was so incredibly peaceful for at least the first month or two I was in here. So quiet, peaceful, utter silence with no one bothering me. The keyword being 'was'. Then a new resident moved in above me and she brought with her ~~brats~~ children. And they've started playing with other kids here in the complex. Since she moved in a month or so ago, it has been non-stop shrieking, screaming, and stomping aroudn on the breezeway above me and in the field near my windows as the children are loosed on this complex, unsupervised. I can hear them rolling their scooters and skates or whatever down the breezeway while they do it. There was even a time when one of the kids threw a filled water bottle and nearly struck me in the head. And by proxy, my pet, since I was taking one of my pets out for a walk with me.

I have tried talking to the complex about this. The leasing office manager went out there and talked to them. Things were good for maybe... a single week. Then they started back up again. Apparently dozens of others in the complex have sent in complaints, and despite even calling the parent(s), nothing has changed. I have lost sleep over this and the lack of sleep has started to make me sick. Headaches are nigh constant and I'm getting spooked at least twice a day. I've already dropped and broken a dish or two as a result. My dog is barking which is further stressing me. This has been going on for several weeks now.

What can any of you suggest, so that I can get these obnoxious brats to just shut up?\*\*Note: If you're just gonna tell me 'Kids will be kids', or 'You were a kid once', then don't say anything. I'm aware that I was once a kid and I don't know how the heck my parents put up with me. 'Kids play loudly' or any variation of such wording is a god-awful excuse for such wretched behaviour.

18,"No, I don't have depression as far as I can tell. I just truly don't like myself. If I were to meet myself, everything from my voice, to my mannerisms to my personality, I would deteste. 

I also dislike my habits. I self indulge and waste whatever precious time I have on unmemorable time wasting activities. I never sleep enough, I binge eat, and I scroll on my phone for hours on end. 

I'm always on a high horse for self improvement but can't ever keep to targets or achieve what I want in the correct time. For instance, I wanted to finish two books this weekend. I didn't even start reading. 

I've built myself a life with a loving partner, home and professional career. But something about myself, something about catching a glimpse of a candid video and seeing my dull stare, my body language, hearing my voice in a voicemail, makes me want to grimace. 

I really don't like myself. And I question whether I have faked it till I made it this far. I don't feel like a deserve my life. It's just agonising frustration at this point. Am I missing something obvious?

19,"Ok so story time here


I’m 18 gay and happily engaged to the sweetest man I met, he is ok with porn and quite often we have had private time where we rent an adult film and watch it ( not always having sex more just making out and bonding) 

The problem is when I see nudity of a woman I suddenly feel like I’m horny but I don’t love women so why is this happening ? Is it possible it’s just my hormones being confused since I’m not of full maturity yet or am I secretly bisexual ?


I really don’t know who to ask I’ve talked to him about it and he told me he would accept me even if I were in fact bisexual... but thing is I only want men no women but then why do I get hard due to the girl from weird science ( don’t remember her actor) is shown with big tits ?

21,"I’m writing this post to seek a little advice about what’s best for me and my education and I think this is the best place to do so. 
Through year 7 to 11, I was a really decent student, hard working, and I always had a passion for STEM subjects. I was interested in the concept of space, and as time went on I decided I wanted to become an aerospace engineer, focus on building spacecraft etc. So I joined the sixth form at my school. I was supposed to pick physics, maths and another science in order to give myself the best chances of getting into a decent course at uni, but after getting one grade below expectations in maths, I wasn’t allowed to do it. Because of this I would have to do a foundation year at uni before the actual course. 
Year 12 was a struggle for me. I was trying to discover myself and have new experiences with friends, but as time went on I realised the subjects I had chosen weren’t for me. But this was towards the end of year 12, and I felt it was too late to say anything. I decided to stick it out. I thought to myself, okay I hate chemistry but aerospace engineering won’t involve it right? And half of the stuff were doing In physics won’t be part of it either right? If I can do well here then I can do the course I want. I finished year 12 with two Us in chemistry and physics and an E in geography. Not good enough.
University has been a dream all my life, and my parents are obsessed with me going. No one in my family has ever been, and in our eyes it’s a sign of success. But as I’ve got to this point now I’m unsure if it’s worth it. The sad thing is that ive already paid to be applied to 5 different universities, and I’ve received 2 offers back so far. But as year 13 has gone on I’ve realised my lack of motivation is a result of how much I don’t enjoy the subjects im doing. But it’s too late to do something About it. My foundation year will consist of maths I’m not sure I’ll enjoy whatsoever, and then I don’t know what to expect after that.
As I sit here right now, I’m really unsure what to do. I don’t know what uni will hold and if it’s worth me trying to get into if I’ll just drop out after a year of not liking it. But it’s too late to do anything else. Recently I’ve began to realise i have a love for cars, but I’m unsure how to capitalise on this If i can. Any advice would be helpful because I really am stuck, and telling my parents I’m not going to uni seems like something I’d be very afraid to do due to their immense dissapointment, I’m supposed to be going to Bristol to do aerospace engineering, however my lowest entry was for mechanical engineering at Nottingham Trent, so perhaps I could choose this should I receive an offer back in order to learn about cars?

22,"I think my predicament can be summed up as; I have a girlfriend. I love her (pretty much although we haven't said it). She's middle Eastern and curvy, but my sexual preference is white, thin and petite.

23,"For context, I am 15, 16 in August. My parents were never married and split before I was born. I lived with my mom, seeing my dad every other weekend until I was nine when my mom hit a rough patch and my dads now ex wife had my two sisters. I decided to live with them because I wanted to be a part of their lives. 
So my mom and I used to be super close, but when I was 10 she started dating an alcoholic who verbally abused me a lot. He had two other daughters, one was yelled at a lot when she did anything wrong so she mostly stayed in her room and did school work. (If you’re reading this congrats on getting into a good college! I know you’re on reddit.) so my mom basically let this happen for a majority of the 3-4 years they were together. I really felt like the younger one was similar to a sister for me, as we were only a few years apart. I was excited when they got engaged because I thought that meant that I would be actual step sisters with her. But them getting engaged only made the whole situation worse. I would hurt myself because of stuff he did (once he shut the door on the back of my heel and said I should have moved faster) he blamed it all on me and made his daughters and I clean the house for him despite the fact that my mom told him to let us relax and do the work himself. 
So to make this shorter, my mom really fucked up my head. 
Over the last two summers I’ve been going to her house for two months, and have gotten severely depressed to the point of needing therapy. I would have random panic attacks often and if she saw it she would call me ridiculous. My anxiety stems mostly from childhood trauma. Her boyfriend recently threatened to kick me out of the house for crying in front of my brother who is less than a year old. I can’t do anything at her house, and I don’t have any friends. I can’t talk to my friends over summer other than over the phone, since whenever I’m home with my dad I’m with my younger sisters who I hold incredibly close to me as mentioned earlier. Some other things my mom does is she pushes me a lot in school. She constantly talks about how she wants me to get all my school credits in early, so taking more than 12 classes a year (6 a semester), or wants me to run track like she did despite the fact I have asthma and hate running. She also REALLY likes to judge me on my relationship choices. I know I’m young and probably shouldn’t have fucked up my love life so bad at this point in my life but I kinda already did. She judged me when I dated a girl, saying she was worried that I would be lesbian and wouldn’t give her grandchildren, apparently adoption wasn’t an option. I dated a guy and she said she wished I was lesbian so she doesn’t have to worry about me getting pregnant. For the record, I am not and have never been sexually active. She doesn’t want me going out with friends past six, because apparently that means I’ll be doing drugs, I’ve never had a past of having problems with that, and neither have any of my friends. I also don’t have any friends where she is, she just wants to control what I do at my dads. 

SO YEAH I THINK THATS ENOUGH AS TO WHY I DONT WANT TO BE THERE THIS SUMMER.

There is a lot more, but I just don’t want to type it all out right now. 

I don’t know how to tell her I don’t want to be there for the summer, if anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated.

24,"I'm a 15 year old girl who's in her freshman year of high school. 

I'm generally a pretty good kid: honor roll, AP classes, sports manager, rarely gets into trouble etc. So, why do I feel like I'm wasting my time? I keep wondering if all of this will actually matter in the future. Do I have the motivation? Do I have the time? Am I wasting my time by sitting on my ass and posting this on reddit right now?

I keep taking more and more classes to fill the desire I have to confirm my future, even getting special permission to drop my lunch period and replace it with an extra class, but I still feel like everything I'm doing will end up being pointless. Next year I'm going to join the wrestling team to hopefully help with this but I keep asking myself: ""What if I suck?"" ""What if the team doesn't like me?"" ""What if there's no point?"" ""Mom thinks girls shouldn't be wrestlers, is that true?""

It's really making me hate myself. How can I feel more secure that I'm doing enough?

TLDR: I (15F) feel insecure that I'm not working hard enough and I hate myself because of it.",13Jan2020,1

Today I'm studying I go downstairs and start to head back up and see him standing at the top smiling and I just go back down and sit in the living room and freak out a little. What is this?

29,"My friend, let’s call him Ben, has also has a fiancée Karla, who’s also 29 and one of my best friends. And I should preface Ben isn’t really sure about his gender identity. Right now he’s okay with him/his pronouns but is dressing up in female clothes, wearing makeup and has expressed that he has been really feeling female since his childhood but never found a way to explore it until he was an adult.

Whatever way he identifies, he knows Karla and I are 100% supportive of him. But I also understand he comes from this super religious, conservative background and coming out as non-binary or female one day is not going to be easy. We don’t even know if it’s possible at this point. Only a few of Bens close friends know. 

Now to the problem, Ben will get super, super depressed and moody whenever his friends that do know cannot hangout with him when he wishes to dress in female clothes and put on a wig. He’s depressed just in general, but his behavior towards us is hurtful. 

He’s been lashing out at me and two other people like crazy when we couldn’t hang out this weekend and posted on Snapchat things like “I’m gonna go over the edge,” “no one loves me, you’re all fake”. I did call him out on it and even went over to ensure everything was fine.

Then things cooled off, he seems okay, and the minute I leave, he lashed out at another friend over text saying how I came over to help, but the other person didn’t.

This behavior is frankly disturbing to me and I have tried to tell Ben that counseling is a good option. He’s actually a government worker and I know there is an employee assistance program. But Ben detests the idea and dismisses it constantly. 

I’ve even said to Ben this kind of behavior is stuff I used to deal with, obviously I haven’t dealt with gender identity crisis, but I have suffered from depression. 

What hurt my feelings is the last time I brought this up to him, he accused me of never understanding and said I was judging him for being transgender. I was devastated. I wasn’t and I hope it didn’t come across like I was. One of my closest cousins transitioned from MTF. I told him this but he said to stop being up the idea of therapy. 

I’m just torn. His relationship with Karla is so tense and she’s unhappy with him while he’s depressed and blaming her for not helping him either. We just don’t know what to do anymore. I guess we’ve come across like we’re forcing him, we just want him to have help with the depression. The threats of “going over the edge” happen every day now.",13Jan2020,1

I have so many fake friends in my life who use me and toss my aside when they don’t need me. When I am dealing with depression, everyone says away as if they don’t want anything to do with me. Sadly, they come complaining to me all the time when they are dealing with a difficult situation. I have trust issues as well and bottle things up due to not having anyone I can pour my heart to. The only reason I keep in contact with these people is so that I am not “completely alone.” It gets mentally exhausting at times when you are the go to person for listening or needing help.

I have tried complete solitude before but it only makes me feel even more hopeless. I shut myself listening to sad music and crying to sleep. I’ve tried connecting to new people but I can’t seem to find the “right” person if that’s what you are planning to say. I know it is trial and error but what makes it worse is that I don’t trust easily due to the many backstabs.",13Jan2020,1
31,"Hi, Reddit. I was laid off about 3 months ago and thankfully can afford to pay rent and take my time finding a new great role.

Getting laid off hit me hard, and I recently had a phone interview with one company in particular, we will call Company A. This phone interview was odd-- I was asked two questions and then the HR rep rambled about how great the company was for 40 minutes and asked me to come in for an in-person interview Monday (tomorrow). She rambled about every single benefit offered, the health insurance, the office itself, the beer on tap, everything you could possible think of. She rambled, continuously and I only had time to ask 1 question before she said she had to go.

Then, I have a phone interview this past Friday with an amazing company, Company B. The role is exactly what I'm looking for, and the HR Rep was saying some things that stood out to me. I actually looked at her LinkedIn before the call, and she last worked at Company A. She had told me what made her love Company B was the transparency, stability and room for actual opportunity. She said at her last position (at Company A according to LinkedIn), there were constant layoffs out of no where and how half of the people she hired in 1 year, got laid off that same year. 

I also read on Glassdoor that part of the on boarding for Company A is to leave a great Glassdoor review which I believe is skewing their scores.

Should I even bother going to this in-person interview tomorrow? Hearing about the layoffs REALLY turned me off because I am young (23) and CANNOT go through this again. It has really affected my mental health and I need stability in my next role.",13Jan2020,1

36,"Ok, so first. I know yall are going to call me a racist. I dont want to be one, and i try my best to not be. So help me on this, eh? However my main perspective on all things in life is to look at things objectively. Somehow, these ideas are at conflict at times apparently, maybe someone could try clear that up for me too. I am white male, and i come from a part of the states that alot of racism/biogtry exists. I am undoubtedly aware that my cultural upbring effects my outlook on the world. I however do not wish to subscribe to hate, and i strive to move away from it.

That being said, i wish to see why whites cant use the modern ""N"" word. I say modern, beacuse language evolves. Just as ""Gay"" used to just mean happy, and now means Homosexual.  When i hear the ""N"" word in music, Television, or other media, i understand the word akin to ""Hommie"" or ""Brother"". The words meaning has become more of word to call a friend, then to spew hatred. I know the white people have used this word for hatred in the past, and is still used that way today. Witch is something i would never do personally. I want hate to spread as little as possible. But now that this hate word is a friend word, im confused on where i should stand on it. One could say that linguistic evolution of this word goes a step further with the ""a"" and ""er"" ends of the ""N"" word. One meaning its old bigoted hateful meaning, and one meaning its modern word of kinship. Words have meaning, but also context. If you say ""Banana"" with enough hatred behind it, it could hurt someones feelings. To me it seems that the meanings behind a word is more important then the feeling/intentions put behind the word when said, why? Im sure pepple will tell me that its my white privlage that alows me to ask this. But is it fair that i, a person who trys to see people for who they are as an individual and not where they come from (in a culture or biologically) , am barred from speeking a particular word? And if it is fair, why? And if it isnt fair, why? Dosnt this go against the freedom of speech? And why is it so important that whites dont say these things when its out of friendship?

Im open to constructive criticism and new ideas. PLEASE be civil folks.

Tldr, young privileged white boy wonders about the nature of the ""N"" word, and how its tied to his biology, the freedom of expression, and its ties to the past and future.",13Jan2020,1
37,"I (20M) am going to community college for Political Science, originally a CS major but counselor convinced me to switch. Turns out there's no jobs in Poli Sci and I have to wait until November 2020 to apply for a University in 2021.


I'm in dire need of money because family is very poor and I feel like I have to help them. I had 2 jobs before, one seasonal and the other I left due to scheduling conflicts with school. I've applied to 38 minimum wage jobs so far, none have called me back and I believe my phone (which is 8ish) years old now doesn't receive certain calls and texts because friends and family have told me they texted/called me but I didn't answer. I can only apply to jobs near bus lines I take because I don't have a car. I can't apply to jobs too far either because with LA traffic, routes can be hours long on the bus. My schedule this year for school is more work friendly (go to school early in the morning and come out in the evening 2 days a week). I have insomnia and sometimes it takes me 4 hours to fall asleep, so I can't work late nights because of that nor mornings because of school. This leaves mid-day shifts, which are given to experienced employees, which I'm not because I left the only jobs I had and now am unable to get another one.


I don't get FAFSA, I get Cal Grant but I'm given the money at the end of the semester which I think defeats the whole purpose but what do I know. There's another program called Student Something Something which gives me another $600 each semester but I can't enter that program because I don't know why. I can't do Work-Study either which I found out the hard way unfortunately, which leaves me with no choice but look for a wage job outside of school. 



I thought about getting a trade job but have been unable to find an internship. An old high school friend got me an interview with a construction company he works for, but when I showed them my schedule for this semester, which I thought was work friendly, they told me they didn't have anything for me at the moment. 



Everything I want to do, wether it's paramedic, firefighter, nurse, sex slave, programmer, IT, etc, takes years to do so it's no different than me staying in school.

55,"I’m 30, and into my second career job as of last year. My previous job was at a small nonprofit that was incredibly toxic. It did a lot of damage to me mentally. In fact, me and the two other only other junior staffers noped out over the summer after abuse from upper management became too much. Luckily we are at jobs that are working much better for us.

After we left, our replacements already quit within three months. They all reached out to us and said the inflated Glassdoor reviews of our workplace played a role in accepting the jobs, which have below average pay for the work. They said that if there were some more critical reviews that addressed the workplace culture, they would have thinked twice.

Me and my old colleagues are thinking about leaving critical reviews. The downside is that it will be easy to pinpoint that we likely wrote them because the office is so small. 

The dilemma: would it be worth writing a critical review of this old workplace even if it were to probably damage my chances of a reference from some of the management? Management essentially consists of two people who, despite their toxicity, have strong networks in our field.

One side of me wants to alert future employees what they are getting into. (Management infighting, overworked, manipulation, gossiping, condescending attitude, etc) The other side of me wants to just let that part of my career be behind me, keep my head low, and focus on new horizons. Also I may never know when I need a reference where they are well suited for it.

58,"I've been unemployed for nearly four years and I suffer from depression, anxiety and recently I was told that I am developing schizophrenia. In the past I have done retail, outdoor labouring work and been in commercial kitchens and I didn't enjoy any of them at all. I recently did two days of voluntary work in another kitchen and even though it went alright, it confirmed to me that it's not what I want to do at all.

Here's the thing - **no jobs interest me**. I scroll through pages of job adverts and none appeal to me whatsoever. Furthermore we aren't from the country that we live in and don't have a large network of people to ask about opportunities etc. I have tried having many sessions of counselling and help from social welfare though they can't help me as there is nothing for them to work with. Also when I look at jobs they not only don't interest me, they sound absolutely awful and unbearable. If I think of jobs outside of those advertised I still can't find anything that even remotely rouses my interest. I used to have interests such as sciences, aviation and sport, though they all disappeared when I was 17 and seven years later they haven't returned nor have they been replaced by other things. Even if you offered me a fully paid degree in aviation/science I would say no. I have applied for about ten jobs in the last year and had two interviews and each time I often hope they *don't* get back to me which makes me really upset as that's such an awful way of thinking and feeling about things. 

I understand that it may be about simply picking something and going with it yet I feel as if I will go insane if I do it. A few years ago I picked a supermarket job and I broke down and had a horrible time that put me in mental hell that I can't describe in words. I know that sounds a bit dramatic though it's true, and all it was was washing fruit and vegetables and putting them on display. 

People ask me about studying and it's the same story - looking through courses means nothing to me.  I'm completely numb and can't communicate this to my parents or others as one can't find the words to sum it up. 

I have had lots of counselling, medications and group therapies before and none of it has worked for me. 

I spend minutes at a time despairing with my head in my hands as to what to do about this. I can't find any advice on this anywhere because every article I read says things like ""DO WHAT YOU ENJOY MOST!"" or ""THINK ABOUT YOUR GOALS""...... I don't derive any enjoyment from anything and I have been thinking for years about goals and none have surfaced for me. Whilst I would like to have a job as I am bored, lonely and want to earn my own income, NOTHING appeals to me.

59,"Okay, so, my friend from Saskatoon, Canada is trying to move to the US with my girlfriend and I. The problem is, her roommates found another apartment that doesn't allow pets and she doesn't get her passport until February. They're planning on moving by January 30th and the only place she can go doesn't even allow goldfish. We are wondering if there is a company or an airline in Canada that could ship/fly her cat to us as soon as possible. If anyone knows of a service, I would love to know. Or if you have any advice on what we should do, it would be greatly appreciated.  One important thing is, getting rid of the cat is not an option because this is her comfort cat  and she must have her for personal reasons I am not allowed to give out.

Bit of money to spend it’s not fulfilling (obviously) I feel like I am wasting my life not doing what I want to do, it’s just that what I want is very niche and out of reach (at least it seems that way) I’ve been thinking that I should quit this job and dedicate my time for the next few months to going to the gym and getting in my dream shape/ condition (it’s probably the thing I want most in life) as well as learning martial arts again. During this time I want to also find a place to study or intern in archaeology so that one day I may be able to go on excavations across the world (another life long dream of mine) all I find myself thinking about everyday is dreams of me being an expert at martial arts or being on an archaeological dig finding old and valuable relics, I guess the question is should I leave my job for now and pursue my body and physical goals, as well as my future career?

66,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I need some financial advice. In October 2017, I signed up for a gym called Washington Sports Club (WSC). A year later I cancelled my membership since I was moving to a building with a gym in a different part of the city. In order to cancel my membership, I had to go in person to the gym (how annoying!) and return my membership ID. I didn’t receive any confirmation of the cancellation beyond the verbal, all email communication stopped and my online account with WSC stopped receiving invoice documentation.

Today, I reviewed my subscriptions for my credit card and noticed that I had a reoccurring payment for WSC which should not be possible. Since the day that I supposedly cancelled my subscription there’s been about $50 (my membership fees were $39.99) per month going to the gym! And yes I know I should have caught it sooner. I feel so stupid that I lost that much money, but I trusted that my membership had been cancelled and the charges didn’t stick out on my monthly statement.

I tried to call the gym and ask them what the fuck is going on and I think all I did was ruin the front desk girl’s day (oops). She said she couldn’t do anything and that only her manager could look at account information and he wasn’t in on Sundays (yeah right). She also made the excuse that whoever handled my request must have forgotten. This turns out to maybe be completely bogus since WSC is currently being sued by the DC district attorney’s office FOR THIS EXACT THING. You can google it. I might add the links I found on it later.

What I’ve done so far is called my bank to dispute the payments and put a freeze on all future payments to WSC. What I want advice on is basically is there anything else I can do at this point? Should I come to terms with the very real possibility that I’m not getting my money back? How can I make sure my membership is permanently cancelled and that I will not get more charges in the future?",13Jan2020,1
68,"I'm 24 years old. My whole life I have chosen to go on the passive side of confrontation. As long as I could remember people have assumed they could intimidate me and the thing is, I'm not scared of them, but I honestly don't feel angry. So the issue arrives when I rethink the situation and deal with the person in day-to-day settings. Where I deal with their disrespect consistently because of my choice.

Today I decided to play basketball at the local court. Some high-school kids asked me to play. At first I declined cause I just wanted to shoot. Then they asked again and I said ""Why not"". Before the game starts I hear two kids indirectly talking about me calling me ""garbage"". Okay. Fine. I understand competitive trash talking so I don't say anything and chuckle at it. He starts making jokes every time I got the ball so I'm getting annoyed with this kid. The last straw is when I start dribbling and this kid starts mocking me going ""OOOOOH OOOOOH"" and when I drive he calls a carry. I throw the ball over the fence and out of the park, I grab my keys and the kid goes ""So you not going to get that?"". I ignore him and walk to my car, forgetting my ball. Right before I enter my car I hear him say ""He ain't want it."" and I drive off.

So I reach a block away from the park, forget my ball, and U-turn to head back to the god damn park to get it. When I get there the kids are asking me if I'm alright, saying I forgot my ball, asking what it looked like. It was all very condescending but I shrugged it off. Nobody pressured me directly. I understand this situation right here might sound like something you obviously avoid as the adult. But do I really need to always be this passive? It's beginning to take its toll on me and I'm starting to lose control of myself.",13Jan2020,1

When I get home, I workout, then eat and do homework, then have an hour to myself before I go to karate, then I go to bed and repeat the cycle for 5 days.

I don’t have much to do really, besides play video games (getting very bored of) or watch news/stare at the wall. 

Same goes for breaks and weekends. I just had my first winter break a few weeks ago (two week break from school) and I was extremely bored.

71,"Life Lessons From Dating A Narcissist Woman


I’m 25 live in NYC have a decent job in commercial real estate. I usually meet girls at local bars But they usually end of one night stands and don’t go anywhere. About last April I downloaded the app hinge and gave it a shot. About three weeks end of using in a match with this girl(25F) we can call Jay(not her real name). Not gonna lie very good looking girl and we started messaging right away.  From the get go she told me she was a bad texter. She usually took a while to respond and I sort of became patient with it. We finally met for the first date and it went amazing We stayed to the bar past clothes outside and we made out in front of her apartment. 

To give you some back on Jay I hate to use this term but she is supper Jappy(Jewish American princess). Not usually my type. She comes from a very wealthy part of New Jersey and her father was a major wall st Executive. She went a Ivy League college but doesn’t have a job and her daddy pays her 4 grand a month rent. She’s applying to go to PA schools and takes undergraduate classes she needs for requirements. It seems like her parents totally bankroll her lifestyle to live in Manhattan at 25. She also graduated college like three years ago but still obsessed with her stupid sorority and the girls in it. She has a house in New Jersey, beach house on the Jersey shore and a nice condo in Miami. 

 I admit I come from a comfortable family but I pull my own weight and pay my own bills and rent. I might not live in the best apartment in NYC but I can pay for it. I also live with  my younger brother who’s still in undergrad. I used to live with my college buddy but he got married. My brother transferred schools to in NYC and he took over the lease. So I guess you can say my dad pays half for my brothers but I still pay my half. 

We went on a few more dates probably like or five for the next month until June and it was very hot and heavy between us and then we made out like school children all the time and hooked up. However I began noticing that she really didn’t give a shit about what was going on in my life and all of the conversations were dominated about her and her life. Such as  bad talking her roommate and girls from her sorority.  Also her studying for PA school or not feeling well all this stuff  but never asking about me in my life. We hung out about for the sixth and last time in Middle of June. 

I began noticing that it became impossible after that to plan a date with her and she began texting less and less. But she always kind a get me stringed along saying she’s busy with PA Applications. At this point I haven’t seen her in almost a month and it’s almost halfway through July and we made plans to hang out and she flaked out of nowhere saying something bad happened. I asked if everything was ok and she said NOT NOW. The next day she text me and told me I should MoveOn. I was quite upset but I kind of felt like she been avoiding me that the last month even though we hit it off really good. I said OK and then I did not speak to her or reach to her as upset as I was. 

Fast forward through the middle of November. I just got a good promotion at my job doing commercial retail leasing. I’m also starting a side business where I do mentorship on Skype for people trying to get into sales. Life is going well and out of nowhere Jay texts me saying “ hey I’ve been meaning to reach out for you for a while just wanna know how everything is going?” In the back of my head I want to delete it and not answer her. But I was weak soul to the power of P and I respond telling her about my new job. She Responded saying right away that she made a huge mistake or the summer seeing me and she was really sorry. 

We started texting again and plan to hang out the next week because we had Thanksgiving and we’re going to both be home. She began telling me that she was getting her own place and that her roommate was leaving her and then she and her roommate that they have been on bad terms. We hung out the next week later and she just got out out her doctors appointment. We meet for dinner and got sushi We talked about her find a new apartments. Somehow in conversation she brought up that she had a boyfriend who went to Sophie Davis medical school because she didn’t wanna live in a bad area and how she had to go to Harlem sometimes.

After dinner we walked around the area in the Greenwich Village where she wanted to live and looked through a bunch of apartment buildings for like two hours. We made out on the subway ride home but I had a walk over to where I lived. I told her that I still lived with my brother and I knew it definitely took her back a little bit and she looked down me for it and I felt kinda embarrassed. She also knows I don’t live in the best area of Manhattan but it’s the best I can afford right now. 

We still kept texting and talking after that. Her texts became more responsive and I thought she was actually taking a liking to me and I was going to turn it around with her. But I noticed that our text conversations were dominated about decorating her apartment in finding the perfect one. Also her stuff with her school and her family and how much she hated her roommate she was leaving even though they live together in their stupid sorority since college. However she got me super excited me when she said I could sleep over when I help decorate her apartment with her. 

This is where it goes downhill from here...We met for the second and last time About a week and a half later for my last date on Tuesday the 17th. She said she was going to be super pressed for time because she had to study for a test that Thursday and had something before we got food. When we got there she told me she was high as a kite and smoked a lot of weed.  When I asked her where she was. She responded by saying “maybe I’ll tell you one day” and I was kind of taken back by it.  

She obviously starts talking about her new apartment and and  after her test on she was going to Israel with her family for a week on Friday for vacation. At some point in the dinner because this is Manhattan some derelicts come in the diner and cause some ruckus yelling stuff. They are kicked out by the manager but it kind of freaked her out because I guess she’s not used to it. We kissed and said goodbye and she got an Uber home. 

Later on that night I texted her it was nice seeing her and told her And good luck on her test and enjoy the trip with your family and I’m excited to help her with the apartment when she gets back. She just responded saying that those kids really freaked her out. I responded saying don’t let it bother her nothing happened and that you just need to focus on doing well on the test. She didn’t respond at all that night or not even for another week. I didn’t want to text her at all because I knew she was on vacation in Israel with her family. 

Not to sound weird but I did some social media stalking because We never had each other added on anything(Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). I saw on her Venmo that in August She you had some guy send her a birthday gift. I looked him up and saw it was the Sophie Davis medical student who it was her ex-boyfriend. I realize that she stopped dating me in June and started hanging out with this kid and dated him until probably November and broke up. I was just her back burner choice I realized and I played right into it. But if I had known she had a boyfriend in the time from when I last saw her I probably would not of hung out with her or reach back out I felt sort of betrayed/swindled. 

After waiting about two days from when she got back from Israel I just reached out with the Hey text. Two days go by I got no answer. I then said did “I do something wrong? a month you were saying you made a huge mistake when you were seeing me and you miss me.” Another day and a half goes by I still got no answer. At this point I’m like fuck it this girl really think she can do this to me twice. I went off on her like no other in a text.

I basically took all of her lives insecurities she was blabbing to me about it and wrapped it in a box with a nice bow on top. I went off on her for saying how she is 25 and still use her dad to pay for a 4 grand a month rent and her credit card for her rent. Shes just dead weight for her family. Also saying I can’t blame her roommate for wanting to leave her. And that if I was her roommate I would’ve gotten out a along time ago. I also called her a self obsessed narcissist who never really cared about what was going on in my life. I also finished with the Sophie Davis ex how she ditched me for him over the summer. 

I felt like I just let all the range for her  that was pent up from the summer plus now. I never in my entire life flipped out on a girl before and I’m pretty usually chill about.  But the fact that she ditched me for another guy and then think she can come back and then leave again really hurt me. . She responded saying I was crazy Psychopath and don’t ever text her again. I told her MoveOn like she did to me over the summer and then I gave her a Bye Felicia Giff meme and blocked her number. 

It’s never been in me to freak out on someone like that in my entire life. But for some reason she really Grinded my gears and I had no choice but I snapped. And I wrote her probably the most meanest text I’ve ever wrote in anyone in my entire life I went for all of her insecurities and threw them back at her face. But I cannot help him feel guilty for freaking out in such away is not usually in my nature. I felt like I wasted so much time and energy talking to her the past year. But I have to admit subconsciously every time I talked and hung out with her I knew something was off and I shouldn’t be with her.

TL;DR- Date a girl for almost 2 months over summer to have her string me along and just told me to move on. Came back in November said she was sorry and made huge Mistake. Texted me a bunch went on two dates and she ghosted me. Then found out she had a boyfriend between when we first stopped dating. Flipped out on her for stringing me along and not telling me about BF.",13Jan2020,1
72,"So here's the deal. I'm an incredibly non-confrontational person who never learned to stand up for themselves. My friend immediately gets incredibly defensive when he as much as smells criticism in the air. And while I love him dearly, there's one thing that's been eating away at me for the last few years. He's always late. And I'm not even talking real life meetings because we live on opposite ends of the country and don't see each other often but just generally. Him and I play a lot of games together, often with other friends and whenever he says he'll join us we wait upwards of fifteen minutes for him to walk from his couch to his PC and turn it on. I'm not even exaggerating. We mostly play League and Monster Hunter together so starting without him isn't an option since a game of LoL and a hunt both take about 30 minutes on average and there's always the one in a hundred chance he'll actually be in the call with us within 2-5 minutes when he says ""wait for me I'll be there in a minute"". You can pretty consistently add 15 minutes to any unit of time he gives and honestly I'm starting to get enough of it. This night it took him two. whole. hours. to be ready to spend some time with me and even then it could have gone on longer but I told him I was gonna go to bed now. (Not a problem if he would've told me. Then I could've done something else. It's the open ended dead time that bothers me) How can I talk to him about this? 

TLDR: friend regularly makes me and our other friends spend 15+ minutes waiting for him to stand up, walk two meters and turn on his PC because he wants to play with us and ""Will be with us in a minute""",13Jan2020,1
73,"I've been living in a small three-floor house with two other college girls, and now that I've come back from break and come back from my parent's incredibly clean house, my tolerance for our dirty one has gone way down.

Before I left, I swiffered and swept, washed all the dishes and tidied up the first floor. I come back and my roommate, T, has thrown her stuff all around, messed up the pillows, left empty fast food bags out, dishes with food from days ago, and crumbs on the floor. And she does this every day. She'll leave stuff around and if I don't clean it up it'll stay there for weeks (I even tested it, her mess was there for 2 weeks), so I'll clean it up, only for yet another thing to appear the next day. She never takes out the bathroom or kitchen trash (my other roommate, D, and I do), despite filling up the majority of the kitchen trash with her huge takeout bags, and never replaces the toilet paper if she finishes it. She doesn't care because most of the time she's out or in her room with her boyfriend, so she doesn't have to look at the mess. Even when she's sitting in the area with the mess, she doesn't seem bothered by it. D and I have talked about it a lot, but neither of us has said anything. I've kept quiet because I'm very non-confrontational, but I don't know if I can deal with this for another four months.

D, who's lived with her longer, warned me that if I tried to talk to her and get her to clean up after herself, she would most likely remark 'Well I bought this furniture so I can do what I want with it' (even though technically her parents did), and then ignore me for the rest of the year. D told me that T has done this to other people before in other situations when she was confronted with her actions. She's heartlessly cut them off like a loose string. On top of this, T is rich and entitled and grew up with nannies so she's never had to clean up after herself. 

I want to call a house meeting, sit them down and ask if they can start to clean up around the house and stop leaving things around, but I don't want to start a fight or make our living situation hostile. Any advice on how to approach this situation would be very helpful.",13Jan2020,1
75,"I've been talking to this girl for about 3 weeks now. She's had a lot of hardship and baggage so naturally, I try to be as kind to her as possible. I guess she's been taking my kindness as something more. She tells me over call how much she appreciates me in her life and that she loves me. She's even hinted a couple of times that she'd like me to be her boyfriend, but I've tried to politely back out of her advancements. She does flirt with me and I try to play it off as just general kindness. I guess at this point she considers me her ""lover"" even though we haven't gone any further than talking. 

I've gathered that she most likely has abandonment issues and is trying to cling onto any sort of kindness/affection she can get. I don't want to be anything more than just friends with her, but she doesn't seem to understand the hints. I want to be upfront with her and tell her I'm not interested in being her boyfriend or ""lover"" but I'm not sure how to do this without destroying any hope she has for happiness. She's seemed to become dependent on my company as her source of happiness. It's just a stressful situation to be in because it all happened so suddenly.",13Jan2020,1
76,"To add a little background, my friend (or should I say ex friend) and I got in a petty little argument at work more than a month ago. Ever since then he’s been ignoring me. I decided to give him space after I tried to talk to him about it in person and apologize. He told me to “fuck off.” I ended up giving the space and on new years I texted him and apologized. I told him I missed our friendship. Completely ignored me. This morning I hit him up again and he opened it and then proceeded to unadd me. 

I’m sad about this whole situation. I hate that he had to push me away. It makes me feel even more alone. I know a lot of people but none that I’m close enough to talk to outside of work and all that. I’m so far from family and friends back at home. I mean I have my husband and a friend or two I hang out with but we all have times we’re away for long periods of time because of our jobs. I hate sounding like this but I feel like I have no one.

He asked me out a few months ago, I said I wasn't interesting in dating, and he said he was cool with still being friends and would be there if I ever decided I wanted to date.  

Normally this wouldn't be a big deal and I would just talk to him about personal space and what I am and am not comfortable with, but I know he has trouble getting close to people and that I'm the only person he feels comfortable being affectionate to, and I don't really want to take that away from him.

This is the first time it’s happened, I’ve never even called in sick as we only work on PT, casual basis. 
Nonetheless I was supposed to work. 

The thing is, my father’s passing anniversary is coming up in a few days and he’s been on my mind the last few days. I was in a really bad state of mind since Thursday. I’m also dealing with other mental health issues. Anyway, when I came home from my Ft job I just started crying and completely forgot that I was supposed to in to my other job. 

My coworker and manager texted me asking why I didn’t show up. And I just couldn’t even gather my thoughts to write back. I plan on emailing them on Monday.  But I just don’t know what to say?? I mean I wasn’t sick with a cold...but I was dealing with mental and emotional stuff. How should I word it so they understand my reason for absence :/",13Jan2020,1

94,"I’m not even sure where to start on this one. My mom’s always been incredibly overprotective of me. She doesn’t let me go out much and if she does, I have to be home pretty early. I’m not a bad kid, I’ve never given her any real problems. I’m a full time college student and I’m in the process of building my career. I help her when I can, I get good grades, I don’t talk back, I don’t drink or smoke or anything like that. I have a boyfriend that she knows about but has never met because she’s never been too open on meeting my friends or boyfriends. She’s the type of mom that would prefer it if I never grew up and stayed with her for the rest of my life, if that makes sense. 

Anyways, one night I snuck out to spend the night with my boyfriend (which is something I’ve been doing for months) but I guess I got careless and she figured out I was gone in the morning. She cussed me out for 8 minutes over the phone. She told me that I’m ungrateful for all that she’s done for me, that she’s lost all trust in me, that I threw my relationship with her for a dumb boy, and that I’ll never have a mother like I once did.. among some other, pretty harsh stuff. I understand why she’d be upset but at the same time I can’t help but feel she overreacted. What I did was pretty stupid but in my defense, what 19 year old isn’t doing stupid stuff? Besides, it’s not like I was out doing anything actually dangerous— I was with someone I completely trust, in a place I knew I was completely safe. I wouldn’t have done it if I wasn’t safe. 

Regardless, it’s been a week and she hasn’t talked to me. I’m surprised she hasn’t kicked me out, really. I’m stuck between feeling like a shitty daughter and feeling like I’m entitled to be a stupid teenager doing stupid things. Do I beg for her forgiveness or do I wait for her to realize that I’m not 12 anymore, I should be able to make my own mistakes and learn from them?",13Jan2020,1

Now, as much as my ex-girlfriends engagement burns me deep inside because I still do feel something for her, I know I can meet someone better or someone who i probably would love much more deeply. I snapped and had the worst mental breakdown because I had enough of being a loser and living like a hermit only waiting to die.

 It's getting to a point where I'm starting to feel like being on the computer is driving me crazy but at the same time I have nothing to do because I pretty much do not go out, and when I do, it's always with the same friend and in all honesty I don't enjoy going out with that friend anymore because I feel like each and everytime we do go out, he tries to say things to make me ""annoyed/mad"" and call it ""funny"" when I do so I'm kind of stuck in between a rock and a hard place.

I recently did a short course only to find out that almost every place I apply to for a job to be barista requires extensive ""experience"". I also have to move out of my parents house by pretty much mid next year due to parents moving overseas and I don't want to move overseas, I've had plans to study for a while but now that I've just got this whole thing going on, I don't know if I should study or ever want to study anymore, maybe go for something that doesn't require any qualifications and just make a career out of that.

Me and my best mate were pretty close in senior high, but he changed a bit, turned out to be a big jock type, smooth talking and went on moving on from one girl to the other, used to flirt up our teachers, who would respond in Kind and was having many gfs.He was like 6.4 , not bad looking and had noo issues chatting women up, while I on the other hand was a one girl type, crushed on one girl all throught and never acted on it.It was like suddenly he outgrew me and I was kindoff feeling resentful about it.He was also not an open guy, had his own private life, once he had an affair with his neighbour(who was like 23 or 24 then or older to us) and she got knocked up(rumor is/not confirmed but people say), so there were some issues and he dint come to write exams for like 6 months.When he returned, i asked him, what had happen and he wasnt willing to share.

Being a close friend of mine hed often come home, to browse and sometimes when i go to meet my sis during breaks at where we were studying, hed materialize out of nowhere and started to tag along.Overtime, my sis got used to him being around. One odd day out of the blue, he asked her “sis can you see me as your own brother” and she kindoff was confused for a second but told him “hey your my own brother” and then looked at me in a sort of guilty way!.Now about sis, shes long legged, above avg stature and likes heels, likes to look big and I was an avg guy, shes actually joked that im kindoff small compared to her(When on heels) and so when she said hes her brother, i started feeling perhaps because she feels protected by a much larger, more imposing guy and I went red and couldnt understand the melodrama of him wanting to be her brother.

It was like suddenly my close mate became family!!.So now, it was as if she had two older brothers and we often spent time together. One day it soo happen I spent some additional time on the net and when I walked in to the tv room, saw him sitting close by her on the couch both watching tv and he had her hand on her shoulder(like tapping on her bra strap) and she was in her home nighties.I went red,I felt jealous and angry and I walked in, but he dint take that hand and I started fuming, but dint make a scene, but broke it off anyways. We moved out quickly and he became facebook friends! and we both stayed in touch nominally and my sis also on his fb.

Sis got married and she lives close by me and me and her still hang out, and then our old friend messages me and says hes moving close by and that he wants our old friendship and family!(implying us).Since we have been close growing up, I told my sis that hes coming and what I should do?Shes like , hes ur friend right?you should help him settle down!.He asked how she was?I said, shes fine and told her he asked, she was like, what did he ask?I said, nothing just how you are and that hes looking forward to old time friendships with us.She was like..Ok! and everyone's planning to hangout, but dint decide

So, now, I have this close friend whose been close to us, but I,m skeptical of him since those days, i,m confused whether to keep in touch and be friends like old times or no , because i get the angst , as if something will happen and something is not right with [him.Is](https://him.is/) it my complex, or something real?",13Jan2020,1

I am a retired mod of a video gaming Discord Server, I had a very close relationship with 2 of the admins and currently still have a very close relationship with all of the other mods. The admins often talked to me because of my mental issues and how they were worried about me (I have Asperger's, Depression, idk if Autism is a separate thing from Asperger's, and ADHD) and in a fit of fear from change I had rejected their help, they went through my Twitter and found out I had been lying about my sexual orientation (my mother is a giant christian and if she found out that I am leaning towards gay then I am basically as good as dead) and so I think they hardly trust me anymore, I have a tendency to apologize a lot due to trauma from a toxic childhood to the point that I wonder if anyone takes my apologies seriously anymore. I am having an incredibly hard time keeping my space away from the Admins because due to a lack of one in my life I view one of them as a father figure, and it has gotten to the point that I have been crying to myself at night because of how distressed I am about the whole situation, I keep on trying to say I don't understand how I am manipulating anyone but they said that they explained to me several times how but I don't remember and I don't know if they believe me when I say I don't remember. I put myself in a mental ward for a few days and self discharged after only being visited by the doctor 3 times and for about 5 to 10 minutes tops, I feel like I understand some of my issues but I don't understand how I am manipulative and I don't know how to cope with any of my issues, I am desperately asking for help because these friendships mean so much to me that I can barely function as a normal person because of how terrified I am that they will never like me again and if they hate me.

They kept cuddling, my gf would tell them to stop. Friend A kept saying how much he regretted being in a relationship.

Eventually, Friend B passed out from too much drinking. The four of us stayed with her till early morning. When Friend B finally was coherent/stable enough, me and my gf retired to our room for the night, leaving Friend B on the couch, while Friend A retired to his the guest room.

Hi,

So finding the site MGE kind of made me sick. I don't want to offend anyone, but when it comes to pedophilia... I really don't care. Here's the site:

[https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/](https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/)

My friend sent it to me for reference on monster people for some characters we wanna make. I didn't know it was a hentai site. I was scrolling through, opening designs that I thought were cool. I opened the tabs, scrolled down, and read. These are the kind of things that came up:

""On the other hand, when they dry up and lose moisture, not just their kelp, but their whole body shrinks, and they end up in the form of a young little girl. In this state they will frequently kiss their husband, seeking moisture, and slurp his saliva. They'll also assertively swallow up his penis, seeking to moisten their body with semen. Along with the rest of their body, their vagina will shrink to a tiny size, and it will clamp down even more than usual, squeezing out semen instantly"" ( [https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flow\_Kelp](https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flow_Kelp) second to last paragraph).

And

""Any man, no matter how straight-laced, will find himself reaching for the little girl's body, ultimately piercing her little vagina with his manhood. Furthermore, this power also applies to the “spirit energy” of male adherents and men. The more thick and syrupy spirit energy facilitates magic replenishment through sexual intercourse, and gives even more pleasure to the body of little girls who exceedingly love their big brother's spirit energy"" ([https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Familiar](https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Familiar) last bit of third paragraph).

Please, if any of you know if there's something I (or we) could do about this, please comment. I know that there's tons of stuff like this out there, but this stuff just.. disgusts me. Thank you for any and all helpful comments.",13Jan2020,1

I (20M) am in college and wasting everyone's time. I don't put real effort and do ok while others work much harder than me. My classmate is going abroad, is on the dean's list, knows three languages, is super popular and is going to be a special education teacher.

I'll never be hard working enough or selfless enough to counter what a waste of time my life is. I'm too selfish to want to dedicate my life to other people and all I care about is being comfortable. 

Every time I interact with anyone is a reminder on what a piece of shit I am. I'm not dedicating my life to charity, or raising three kids and working two jobs, or anything of value. I'm just a stupid lazy piece of shit that couldn't be bothered to go above and beyond for anyone. I'm a waste of everyone else's oxygen.

I wish that once I graduate I'm working two jobs for 70+ hours a week with no friends or future to look forward to. That's all I deserve at this point. 

I don't deserve anything I have. My parents always talk about how tough their childhoods were and how they never got the opportunities I have. If I succeed in life I'll feel like I didn't earn any of it, and if I fail then my parents would've wasted 18+ years of their life.

I text him on Saturday at noon asking why he called at 4 am, no answer. I text again at 8 pm asking if he was alive, no answer. I called and it went straight to voicemail. Tried not to freak out bc I don’t know if something is going on that I’m unaware of. 

Then today he called at 3 pm saying he was stranded on this street and needed a ride. I was like “I’m pretty sure u had blocked my number but now you want a ride? I’m really confused about what’s going on” so he said nvm and hung up bc he was on 2%. I was out turning in an application somewhere so I texted saying if he still desperately needed a ride I would do it bc I feel mean letting someone walk that distance. No answer. So I call like 15 minutes later and he picks up and is acting weird. I ask if everything is ok and he says yes. I say that something feels very off and he says it’s all good and then says “Ima let you go” and hangs up immediately. I get home and check my social media’s to find out that I’ve been blocked on Facebook and Instagram.. 

Tried calling again and it keeps ringing once and going to voicemail. Texted “really dude. If you’re going to cut me off then just be decent and let me know.” Didn’t send so I’m pretty sure my number is blocked. 

He’s still good friends with my best friends boyfriend... I did message him from my alternate Instagram saying that he needs to man up and explain what’s going on and asked why I’m blocked on everything but I’m not really expecting an answer. 

How do y’all handle things like this? Like I’m so fucking confused because he was SO nice every time we hung out?",13Jan2020,1

133,"So I decided to try the online dating thing. I've been off and on this one app a few times. I'd sign in consistently for a week, drop off for a few months, either because I wasn't having much luck, or because I just got too busy with classes. Each time I came back to the app after months of absence, I was almost guaranteed to be greeted by this one guy in particular. 

Most of our conversations were small talk. I kept leaving, so I technically wasn't giving him the chance to talk to me with any depth. I came back to the app again in late September/early October last year. I actually stuck to it this time, giving this guy a chance to get to know me and vice versa. 

We have talked consistently since then. We've texted almost daily.

I've been crushing on him really hard this entire time. He's brought it up before, so we have talked about the idea. He said he's too old for me, but...despite that very clearly being a rejection, I still hope for it. I haven't talked to any new guys since him. I've only dated one guy, back in October, but I ended it with him in November because the whole time I'd be on dates with him, I'd be thinking of my crush.

Part of me wants to move on, but another part of me wants to cling on like...I dunno, something that's super clingy I guess.

Anyway, thanks for reading. All advice is greatly appreciated.

142,"Please grab some popcorn and a pillow, cos my life is pretty complicated right now and I would LOVE some advice. SO. I am a female bisexual high school student, and around the middle of last year, I fell hopelessly in love with a girl 2 grades older than me. I have TERRIBLE social anxiety, so I could never say the right thing, at least in my mind. This may be a bit confusing because I live in Australia, but in the last term of the school year (around october - december) I decided to actually make friends with her. I sent her an email asking if we could do a duet for a school performance and she agreed. In between practices we could talk about stuff and I learned a lot about her. She is a really, incredibly nice person and told me that she used to be mean but decided that it wasn't good and decided to be a ""big ball of sunshine"". However, making friends with her really confused me and now I'm VERY confused. She gave me lots of hugs, even though she'd only been friends with me a couple weeks. On the 2nd practice, she said, ""I love you, and you're so talented and beautiful and amazing!"" and she acted as if we were best friends. If not for one incident a couple weeks after I came out to my friends, I would definitely think that she liked me back. This one incident was that one of my friends told me she had overheard the girl saying to one of her friends that she was straight, which makes me doubt things a bit. The only thing that helped me to be more optimistic was that I told my friends I was straight for half a year, and I still continue to tell my parents that. So that is number 1 problem, do you think the girl likes me? Should I give up on liking her? How can I find out/get closer to her without embarrassing myself? The only problem with giving up is that it's not that easy, I think I'm in love with this girl. Now for number 2: That afternoon, after I was told that the girl I liked was straight, I was crying in my room and my mum came in. She asked what's wrong, and I told her. (A few months earlier, I had told her I had a crush on a girl, and she brushed it off and said I probably just admired her a lot) My mum started yelling, ""ARE YOU GAY OR SOMETHING?!"" I replied, ""No, so what if I was?!"" my mum hesitated, then yelled, ""GROW UP!!"" and slammed the door. The rest of the day it seemed like she was trying to make it up to me, cos she was sitting next to me a lot and getting involved in my stuff, but I was pretty upset. My dad, when I told him about my friend's pansexuality, reacted in a similar way, yelling, ""YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR SEXUALITY UNTIL YOU'VE HAD SEX!!"" and just getting really mad. My parents are unknowingly making it really hard for me to come out and accept myself, and I have no one to turn to for advice. So do you think my parents are those people who accept others for coming out, but not their own child? Should I come out to them now or wait till I'm like 16 or something? If you can't answer number 2, PLEASE help me out with number 1.

149,"So for the past 6 years I’ve been doing apprenticeships to try and learn how to train horses professionally. I’m working at a barn right now that I have been dreaming to work for/learn from the trainer, for years... and I’m finally here. It’s the highest caliber trainer I’ve ever worked for, so the riding lessons are pretty intensive but I’ve learned a lot so far. I thought I had an idea of how to ride a horse before I came here, but it’s actually much more difficult than I had anticipated.

We just got a new intern a few weeks ago, who is already riding close to the top level. Comes from a rich family, owns horses more expensive than my parents house, and has been given every opportunity under the sun in this industry. I’m the exact opposite, had to work off every single riding lesson I’ve ever had, my cat and I live off of $100 a week, and have been living in poverty working 12 hour days 6 days a week for those 6 years, desperately trying to prove myself as a professional. 

So, I’ve been feeling extremely discouraged. Her riding impresses my trainer (hard to do), and she gets to ride the best horses here. In my lessons I just get yelled at and get far less attention/instruction than she does. I get put on the “training” horses, which are the ones with issues and are harder to ride well. I feel like an absolute loser who can’t ride at all, which is devastating as this is supposed to be my career. I feel like I’m working really hard and trying my best, but that it’s not good enough. I feel like I’m not making much progress, and any hope for extra opportunities here is gone now that she swooped in and is wowing everyone with her talent and ability. I feel like I’ve wasted the past 6 years of my life, and if I were to continue in this path, it might take me 10 years to get where she is right now. I’m considering just quitting horses entirely.

I'm a huge fan of food (haha who isn't) and occasionally like to get those subscription boxes with foods from around the world. Sometimes my friends (who travel a lot) will get me something special from wherever they visited. My brother just takes stuff from me though he knows it's mine/my friends got it for me. Or worse, he'll take part of it and leave some for me. (eg. he'll eat half a packet of ramen, and leave the rest for me... it annoys me to no end). This isn't like a once off occurance, it happens ALL THE TIME. Don't get me wrong, I don't always keep stuff to myself. He's had his fair share, both because I gave it to him and him just taking it. If its a pack of chocolates/candy etc, ofc I share.  It happens with stationery/notebooks and that kind of stuff but I let it slide because whatever, I can always buy it again. But as someone who loves ramen, no, you cannot have this one pack of ramen my friend specially got for me from Japan, and yet what do I find missing when I wake up this morning???

I just got into a arguement with him and I feel incredibly annoyed. I don't even know the right word to describe it, but it's really silly thing to fight over, considering I'm 18 and he's 11.

My mum has told him to not take my stuff, yet he still does, and when I get mad at him for taking it, she gets mad at me for being selfish and not sharing.

The next day after I came home from the birthday party and I was on my phone chilling for most of the day because it’s a Sunday and I didn’t have any homework. 

My mom decides to barge into my room at 9 at tell me that she’ll make me pay a dollar every time she sees my bathroom or closet light on. I told her that’s ridiculous. 

Then, she flipped out and tried to find my wallet to take money that I owed her. I mostly have single 100s that I wanted to spend in the future. I told her that I’ll get her the money later after I earn it . She laughed in my face and said “you’re just waiting for me to forget aren’t you? I’m not stupid” That was not at all my intention. I simply wanted to make money separately so I didn’t have to give up my 100s. I simply was going to make some money and give it to her. Once again you tried to yank my hand away and grab my wallet. 

My dad comes in and agrees with her. Takes my phone and puts it outside saying I was studying when I wasn’t. I get up and retrieve my phone and he yells at me and says YOURE SUSPENDED FROM YOUR PHONE FOR A WEEK. Why? Oh yeah it’s because I was on my phone all day today. Did I have any tests, hw, or projects due the following day? No I did not. Yet he still takes my phone. 

This takes me to another matter. My dad takes my phone for absolutely no reason most of the time. My mom the day I got my phone made me agree to this verbal contract that I would do this specific thing everyday (not going to specify what, but an example is idk like I have to play tennis everyday, go to tournaments twice a month, etc etc) that was just an example to specify what I mean I don’t play tennis. Anyways I got tired of doing it after a while because it was like my 7th year of it. Both went ballistic and took my phone everyday for a solid 6 months. I’d have to say I had it for maybe a month in that time period. They attached impossible strings to my phone.

When they finally couldn’t convince me to do what they wanted me to do, they attached different strings. Had to return phone at 8 everyday, phone doesn’t work after 8 too (data cuts off), and I had to do several several tutors to maintain my phone. They said if I don’t do one of these my phone will be taken for 3 months. ABSURD

159,"Hey reddit, 

Please hear me out.

My dad (58 M) has been in the army and involved in the automotive industry for a while. As a result, we've had to move around a lot because he's wanted to take us with him. We've lived in North Carolina for the past four years and it's been great. However, he's always lived a few hours away from us and had his own apartment with visits during the weekends because of his job.

My mom (59 F) has always excused this and said he's doing it to get her four kids through college because he makes around $200,000 a year.

Note: they've been married for 30+ years 

He recently got a job offer from New York and told us that he's actually been interviewing for months and finally told us today when it was official that he was going to get the job. He will be in charge of a billion dollar company that makes parts for the medical field. He's finally getting out of the automotive industry and he's super excited because he'll be making a bunch (more) of money and he's moving next month (without us).

The issue I (19 F) have is that my mom is very emotionally damaged and clingy and needs him to be here. My brother (18M) absolutely idolizes him and him not being here has caused a huge tear in my family. When my mom gets lonely, she comes to me and I'm usually very busy with school and other things and I'm not able to give her the attention she needs. As a result, she can be abusive and has bit me and thrown things at me when she gets upset. She's asked me to sleep with her on several occasions, and I did it at first but then she would talk with me about my dad and cry herself to sleep and I felt too bad to continue doing that. 

I'm afraid to be at home without him. He'll only be visiting us once a month and I can't imagine how difficult it will be for my mom. He DID say that if I wanted to move up with him, he would move the whole family (my mom, me, and my younger brother). But I want to stay here and continue my education. I'm a freshman in college and attending community college so I can cut costs and transfer to a university next year. I'm taking 18 credits (both semesters) and have all A's. I'm unsure of what a move to New York will do but it does have opportunity.

The advice I need: should I move up with him? My family will finally be all together (my older sister 25 F lives in New York as she is attending Cornell) and I think it would really help us grow and fix some holes that my dad has made. However, I do have a life down here and my dad said that my mom would eventually be leaving my younger brother and I to go live with him in New York sometime in September. So either way, I'm losing something major. 

I'm not sure if I can handle being alone on my own in college. My parents did the same thing to my older brother (23 M) when we lived in Kentucky and moved the family to North Carolina and he fell apart, lost his full ride scholarship, and almost dropped out of college. My dad had to go back for a bit and help him out. 

My younger brother is also in his last year of high school. He's going to join the army (I think he's practically failing high school) so he won't be involved in the family picture for long.

Basically, this whole thing rides on me and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

Tldr; dad got new job, is moving to NY, and will only take the family with him if I want to go",13Jan2020,1

164,"I live with some of the most disgusting, messy people you would hate to meet. They're family, unfortunately. I did not inherit these bad habits by any of them. I have to clean a lot because I cannot stand cigarette butts smeared onto uneaten, wasted food on dirty plates and crap filled diapers all over the floor that the dogs can get into. I cannot change their shitty habits. I'm only here temporarily. Crossing fingers in a few weeks I will be able to escape this hell and move onto my better life.

These people do not pick up after themselves. CPS could get involved and, they've tried and, succeeded. But somehow these people did well and got the children back. Any other chances and they move before they come back. I feel so bad for the kids. Honestly, even I've reported to my sister's school that the parents will not even do a thing for the lice infestation, nothing was done.

Ask them to hangout and I can tell they don’t want to because they would just ignore my messages and not reply back. 

Let me give you an example, today I went to a fam friends place and one of the girls that I used to chill with and known forever she came in late when I was leaving so I said hi to her before leaving and I texted her saying “It’s aiiii but link up soon since I’m always near ur area now lol and Hermela wants me to tell u she says hi 😂” but she did not reply back and it’s been an hour which makes me belive she doesn’t wanna chill with me unless she’s being forced to see me. I mean I get I haven’t chilled with her in a really long time like 6 months but still. 

Another example of when I meet new people is they would look at me in a weird way and they would not want any future contact with me, I know this because we never talk after, if I do message them they’d just ignore me. Even when I just met them they talk to me in a fake way just to be nice type of thing. 

This kinda hurts tho a lot because nobody likes me and I don’t know why",13Jan2020,1

173,"Not my situation but someone close to me needs advice and they don’t really know how to approach the situation.

Sooooo, my friend moved into an apartment with her boyfriend and the boyfriend’s best friend (let’s call him E). Well my friend was already hesitant about E moving in with them because of the whole “making a big step in their relationship and E would be in the way”. Though the boyfriend said everything would be fine and honestly he doesn’t really know how to say no. Which sucks because E kind of keep throwing the idea of him moving in with them. Oh well.... 

Anyway, E started dating a girl and she’s constantly staying over as in every night. Now this is making my friend highly uncomfortable and she doesn’t feel like her apartment is hers anymore. I BELIEVE she’s tried talking to E already but he’s ignoring her.

Which brings me to make this post and how my friend should honestly approach this whole ordeal. I don’t know too much of the situation but hopefully this is enough for some understanding. Personally, I would tell E to chill out and respect my space. OH NOT TO MENTION, E isn’t even on the lease. It’s under my friend’s and her boyfriend’s name.

TL;DR: friend moved into an apartment with her boyfriend and boyfriend’s best friend. Best friend’s girlfriend is staying the night every day and invading personal space. How should my friend approach the situation?",13Jan2020,1
174,"Hi I write to you guys to ask for advice. So i failed, I failed big time. I was studying engineering at the top university in my country and I was in my 2nd year of studies. This university is notorious for its academic difficulty which i came to accept in my first year. Due to a rough upbringing i’ve always been a depressed and anxious kid since I could remember. Come 2nd year my depression got so bad that I started having panic attacks and used to be so sad that I couldn’t focus on studying. Long story short I failed that semester. The university gave me another chance and I was allowed to repeat the semester. I took the time in between my repeat semester to self-reflect and mentally heal my self from my past. I became mentally tougher and made huge progress in getting rid of the demons that have haunted me and getting involved in other life projects.

Now come my repeat semester, everything was going smooth until my midterms came along. Somehow the past crept back up and hindered my performance so much that I completely bombed  one of the six exams I had. I told myself no worries the other ones went fine keep and if i keep working hard ill just need a 50 on the final exam to pass that course. So thats what I did I gave it my all like always and long story short I got below 50 on the exam and failed horribly. Which brought my average down to the point that I failed my repeat semester and will be kicked out of the engineering department in my school with no chance to get back in and the only place i can apply back to in that university is the arts program.

Looking back I realize that I wasn’t smart enough for the program at that specific university because I gave it my all and still performed horribly. But looking back in the grand scheme of things I also realize that though ive always given my best effort, ive never been able to live up to my potential because of my mental state. Which fills me with deep regret because it makes me think if only i was wiser or had better guidance at a younger age and had fixed my mental state earlier that perhaps i could’ve reached my potential and been better focused while studying and excelled. Also seeing as my friends in the same program at less difficult universities excelling makes me deeply regret my choice to go to my current university.

Looking at all my other friends excelling and almost about to get their degrees while im left with no where to go having to start from scratch really hurts.
I’ve always tried my best and most times fell short but this time i’ve fell so hard that i’ve closed the doors to opportunities that i’ve desired my whole life. 

Now I have to in essence start from scratch with 3 years of debt and 3 years of time wasted. I still want to go on and have a successful life, which is why the advice that I ask for is how do I MENTALLY overcome such a failure in life and move on and not fall back into the depression that has always hindered me in my past?",13Jan2020,1

177,"So basically, a month ago, my family and I went to the aquarium, mostly for my 2 year old niece.
Anyways, it was fun for everyone, but I personally found it quite boring, and it did nothing for me since it was mostly ""hey (little niece's name goes here), look at this, so cool"" the entire time.
My flat feet were making my legs and back hurt as we went through it, and it took about two entire hours.
One of the parts even featured a loud waterfall that honestly gave me a weird anxious feeling, and the air was very very humid after that, which made it a bit hard to breathe.

After a few days, my dad asked me if I wanted a yearly pass to go to the aquarium with them and spend time together.
I didn't wanna be a jerk and say ""no"" when everyone else was putting up with it, so I said yes, so he got me one.
Problem is that I honestly fucking hated it, it did nothing for me, and was basically just ""stand and walk around areas, and entertain my niece"" day.

And honestly, I can't do a thing about it, not only do I have to go since I (stupidly) said yes to my dad to buy me a yearly pass, I'd feel shitty if I didn't go since I wouldn't be apart of the family.

So yeah, I don't know what to do, I kinda feel like I'm obligated to continue going since I said yes for the yearly pass, and I also feel that I shouldn't hate it since it's family bonding time.",13Jan2020,1

181,"      I have a really strange relationship with one of my “best friends”. I live with him and two other of our good friends. He’s a good roommate, considerate and clean. But over about the past year I’ve come to really resent him and feel strangely about our relationship. Of course your friends can get on your nerves, especially if you live with them, but this feels different. 
       He’s a moody person and this really effects the people he’s around. He can be incredibly nice, caring, and interested in you. He can also be very unkind and treat you as if he could not care less about you or anything you’re saying. When he acts this way, I say to myself, alright, I’ve had enough. He’s just an asshole time and time again, I don’t care to ever be around him. But, when he’s in a good mood, I love him, of course he’s one of my best friends, and I can’t imagine how I ever felt differently. But nonetheless I know I will again feel that I don’t like him at all and this constant oscillation between liking him and disliking him is frustrating. 
           Despite being a great friend of his for around 5 years, I feel disposable to him. Like he’d sacrifice his relationship with me if a more attractive opportunity arose. But he never has, so perhaps this is just me projecting. When he treats me well, I think of course he cares about me. But so much more often I feel like I mean very little to him.
          In addition to this, many of his traits I very much dislike and am annoyed by. I suppose that is my own issue. Everything he does is so contrived, calculated, and done for a purpose, usually to further himself in some way. He’s actually very good at this, and he is very successful due to this skill. But his inauthenticity and hustler mentality is so frustrating to me. Maybe he’s been forced to have this mentality in order to survive in his environment. Perhaps I am also just jealous of his success and wish I could be like him.
 Also, he consistently humble brags about himself in such an unsubtle way, I can’t believe he doesn’t realize how much of an asshole he sounds like. He’ll talk about himself forever and share the smallest details, but he would never, ever give you the same attention we’re you to speak the same way. It’s tiring interacting with him because all he ever has to say is a flex, or a boast.
          This seems like classic narcissistic behavior. Constantly talking about and bragging about yourself, only being interested in yourself, doing whatever it takes to further your own pursuits, etc. But, I can’t in good faith truly believe he is narcissistic. He can be so generous, and caring and interested in others when he wants to. He’ll support you and fight for you when he wants to. Its such a strange duality of behavior, he can be on both sides of the spectrum. Perhaps just like everything else, his generosity comes at a time when he thinks it could ultimately benefit him.
            Maybe I’m just describing a person I shouldn’t be friends with and it’s just that simple. But he’s friends with practically all of my other friends. I can’t just leave. I especially am a person who requires a group of friends in order to feel happy.",13Jan2020,1

186,"3 years ago i met a girl in class, the shy type that just doesn't stand out but to me she did. I started talking to her in class and via snapchat and all that stuff, after a few months of all this we became real close friends. It was around this time i started getting feelings for her but i was strugling with alot of mental problems for a very long time before all this ( of and on the meds for a few years ). I don't know why but she just made me feel better when i was with her, when i heard her voice or even just saw her. After a while i confessed my feelings to her and she just wanted to stay friends. I just accepted this because i didn't want to lose her and for some odd reason we became even closer friends after all this. I wasn't happy because i got rejected, no one is after getting rejected. But i felt happy that i could still be around her and just keep seeing or making her happy by just being there for her as a friend. But around 10 months ago i was at a real low point in my life and she just dissepeared. She wouldn't talk to me for weeks and when i tried to talk to her she answered me like she was mad, ofc i got mad after a while and we had a fight and we didn't talk the entire summer vacation. At first i thought fuck her, i dont need her and i felt fine about all it. But then classes started again and i saw her again, just as happy as before but this time without me. I asked around what she got up to during the vacation cause we ended on bad terms and turns out she's just way much better of without me in her life, but goddamn i miss her. There have been countless nights ive stayed up hoping to just get a ""hello"" from her. Even though i know she's happier without me bringing her down i want to be by her side. I haven't had a full conversation with her since before she started ignoring me, so every now and then i ask her friends how she's doing cause deepdown those feelings for her never left. My question is if i should just text her again even though i'm just gonna bring her down again with being a nuissance with all my mental health problems ? I know it's a weird question but with her gone i don't have anyone i can talk to anymore. And i know it's difficult for people to keep talking to me cause i've heard that it's a pain to talk to me when i'm tired of trying and wanne give up.

192,"So I (F15) had been texting this one guy (M14) for almost a year. We vaguely knew each other before he moved schools but as we continued to text we grew closer. A few weeks ago he confessed to having a crush on me and I also confessed the same. 

At first he would just send hearts when he said good night and good morning but eventually it was talk of going out on a date that weekend even though he lived 2 and ½ hours away. Then he started to talk about sex, asking me personal questions that I never thought I'd have to answer in my life. I told him to back off a bit and that being raised a Catholic girl I wouldn't be doing anything with anyone until after marriage. He apologized and agreed to tone things down a little. 

It's been three days, he hasn't texted me once and on his snapchat story he did a YOLO. The one and only reply had tons of heart and kissy face emojis and said ""I love you! And I had such a fun time with you"" His response was ""I love you with all my heart babe"" with the same amounts of lovey-dovey emojis. It hurt. I thought maybe he actually cared about me. Maybe this time would be different but no. 

I know that this guy ""wasn't good enough for me"" and that I ""deserve better"" and all that but it just doesn't seem to help. I can't stop thinking about him. He was the first guy that ever said that they also liked me. I wanted it to happen so bad. But hes ditched me already and I don't really know where to go from here. 

Do I straight up just block him and pretend he didn't exist? Do I text him and ask about it? Ask what went wrong and if he ever liked me for more than my body? I've never had to think about these things as before so I'm clueless and really sad about the situation as a whole. If you could give me any sort of advice at all that'd be great and don't be afraid to ask questions when clarification is needed. Thank you!

194,"     To start off, I have something called POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. No, I’m not asking for sympathy, but I’ll tell you what it is. POTS is a chronic illness that effects the nervous system. A lot of people think POTS is bullshit because the easiest and most ignorant way to describe it is, “I get dizzy when I stand up.” A lot of people on other subreddits have said it’s a “GenZ disease” and “Ugh, kids these days.” Yeah, I get it, it sounds stupid. But POTS is a type of dysautonomia that ranges from affecting your day to day life a little, to literally being bedridden. For me, my heart rate is way too high for the average person, and my blood pressure is way too low. Because of the big difference, I tend to faint, black out, and lose consciousness a good amount. I’ve had to call an ambulance before because I completely lost consciousness...yada yada. I’ve had it for almost 2 years. Anyway, my best friend is very very skeptical, and it wasn’t until she saw I have a disability placard that she lost her shit. I don’t use it much, but I have it since my doctor advised me to get one for school so I don’t have to walk 3 blocks and black out again. My best friend literally got incredibly mad and said she “doesn’t respect anyone who uses a disability placard.” I said let’s move on. Flash forward a month later, my boyfriend and I are having some troubles and when asking her to talk for support, I could tell she was in a really bad mood. She eventually cracked and went off on me in paragraphs about how disability is real and I don’t have it. The problem is that no one really realizes what I go through...I’m 18 and I already have to use a wheelchair whenever I walk a lot or travel. I have chronic pain every day and am literally sobbing from how bad it is. I shouldn’t have to explain it, but I did a little to her and she was completely ignorant of trying to even listen. At the end of the conversation I asked if she still wanted to be friends with me- she never replied (greeeeat.) It sucks that a friend of 10 years is doing this all of a sudden.

TL; DR: My best friend of almost a decade decided she didn’t want to be my friend anymore over my chronic illness.",13Jan2020,1
195,For the past few weeks I've been dreading the release of some important exam results and although I might have had control over how well I did while I was preparing for it but at this stage whatever mark is on those papers is finalised and is only waiting for my eyes to see them and that fact kind  of terrifies me (no it really TERRIFIES me) . I'm overseas right now and I want so badly to enjoy this time with my family and this sort of unfamiliar environment that I rarely get to experience but my mind is always on those exams and I want to know how you manage with this type of student anxiety and dread?,13Jan2020,1
196,"I went back to my hometown a few weeks back and left a few dirty dishes in the sink not thinking anything of it.

I came home to fruit fly galore 

I washed the dishes, sprayed, and put some cleaner down the drain.

Since then I even have fruit flies in my clean room that doesn't have food,water, or anything damp in it. They are on my books, tv, and even all over my bathroom.

I continue to clean and spray and nothing is working.

How do I get rid of them and how are they even multiplying in areas with nothing for them to live on?",13Jan2020,1
197,"A few years ago, I had a sigmoidoscopy, which unexpectedly revealed a 1cm non-cancerous colon polyp. I had a follow-up colonoscopy to see if there were any other issues, and nope, all good, but it meant I'd need have to have another colonoscopy in a few years to keep an eye out for colon cancer.

Flash forward to now, and my appointment is tomorrow at 4pm.

Because sharing is caring, here's basically a live-feed of the prep and procedure:

**The prep**

Yesterday, I had a wonderfully naughty cheat day with the BF — lots of low-fibre delicious goodies I don't usually eat (classic breakfast from A&amp;W with white toast, spicy KD, Pringles, etc.), and today has been all clear fluids. I've discovered a delicious beef broth and a palatable chicken broth, and along with water, I've been drinking white cranberry juice, apple juice, black coffee, and white Gatorade (cherry frost). I also picked up some fizzy flavoured water (tangerine–lime and raspberry), but haven't cracked into them yet.

I picked up the CoLyte kit at CO-OP earlier today (I had to ask for it at the pharmacy, and when I paid through self-checkout, I discovered it was $35! A bit of a shock, but it was quick to pick up and I didn't have to go through a cashier, which was nice), filled it up to the line on the jug, and popped it in the fridge to chill. 

I'll be drinking eight 250mL doses tonight (2L of the 4L jug) from 7pm to 8:45pm, and then eight 250mL doses tomorrow starting at 9:30am and running until 11:15am. I'll get to the clinic at 3:30pm tomorrow and will have the procedure at 4pm.

To make this more palatable (and to make this feel a bit like a game), I've created a measuring and chilling system. I'm drinking the solution out of an empty cherry frost Gatorade bottle with the cap off one cup at a time, because this is the fastest way to drink it. 

I put the first dose in a 2-cup glass measuring cup (filled only up to the 1-cup mark), put two ice cubes in it, and put it in the fridge to get even colder. Once it was time for the first dose, I transferred it to the Gatorade bottle using a funnel, then measured it out another dose into the measuring cup with what was left of the ice cubes, then popped it back in the fridge. This way, the dose will get extra cold, which will make it easier to drink. If you have a container you can put ice cubes in, you can skip this step, but my ice cubes don't fit in my Gatorade bottle. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

My phone and laptop are charged, Netflix is open, and I've  popped a hot water bottle into bed to keep me cozy while this process runs its course. (If you don't have a hot water bottle with a fuzzy/cozy case, get one! Total life changer.)

**The play by play (or A timeline of drinking and pooping)**

7pm — First dose. The prep doesn't taste too bad! I think reading all the terrible reviews on reddit lowered my expectations enough. Knock on wood.

7:15pm — Second dose. Still not bad! It's a bit salty and has a strange artificial flavour (maybe cherry? Or maybe that's residual from the Gatorade bottle?), but not bad at all. I mean, not great, I wouldn't choose to drink this, but it doesn't even make me shudder to drink it. Easy peasy so far.

7:25pm — my stomach is full and starting to rumble. First trip to the washroom—good progress! 

7:30pm — Third dose. Salty, but still, I've had worse. Buckley's cold syrup is exponentially worse than this.

7:35pm — Feeling a bit crampy.

7:45pm — Fourth dose. Halfway done for tonight. Feeling a bit cold. Also bored. More stomach grumbling. Some burps. Nothing else of note.

7:53pm — More crampy rumbles. Feeling the urge to go, but going to try wait until after the next dose at 8pm, because lazy.

8pm — Fifth dose.

198,"It all sorta started when my dad bought a broken car from our landlord (I'll call him K) we didn't know at the time). Dad got pissed, and ever since we've been struggling. Dad decides he wants to accuse K of using the car as a ""strategic move,"" and that he's done working to get us to work for free. Bear in mind, we're $2800 in debt because of this, and we can't afford to pay it off anytime soon, so we work for him instead. I end up convincing him to apologize, and he does so.  My family ends up taking a break after that incident (my dad's hip got hurt). Our car breaks down, so K agrees to let the debt go until the car works again. We get a new car ( a gift from our aunt) and K decides to ask for him to work again. Dad asks for like $5-10 worth of compensation, and he had a bit of an attitude with it. K goes off, calling him names talking about how much he's done for us, talking about how my dad's mentally ill (he's on disability for manic depression), talking about how we're freeloaders, etc. Dad kinda fueled the flame by not backing down before he got really mad. All of this was online. They always thought he was a ""trump humper"". Dad uses marijuana to medicate his bipolar disorder instead of his meds because they think (mom and dad) medicine for mental health is bad. Hell, dad convinced mom to drop her meds in favor of pot. They had a bad experience with them, so they gave up on it.

K is not a saint. He's used our labor because we're thousands of dollars cheaper, he's ignored basic regulations (our house is beginning to slide down our mountain because of the retaining wall, he has asbestos in his house with kids and his wife), and he treats us like crap. When my dad had a seizure (he has epilepsy too), Chris only cared if he was gonna get back to work soon and if he was gonna get in trouble. He treated us like tools essentially, but he at least paid us. He didn't keep track of the debt and only wants us to keep paying. He called our house a dump and said we're supposed to fix it. It'll cost $400,000 to fix our retaining wall. He's also a pathological liar and harasses his tenants. He even stalked one of them and walked into their house while they were showering without permission. He's also apparently scammed someone before us with a car. He called Trump the person who will save the world also.

Despite this, he has done good business with us before and has only recently been this bad. He was rude, but he didn't harass us and call us names. I worry he may evict us, or accuse us of something. Keep in mind I'm just a college student living with my parents: trying to get by and keep my head down. I think it'd be nice if mom and dad started working for him again, and that we just stop all of this damn drama (I help them with work btw, so it isn't any easier for me). Hell, I just don't like the thought of there being a constant drama. My dad has constantly had this attitude of anger, and he's made compulsive decisions for a long time now. I don't care, I just want this shit to stop, and for them to get the debt paid off and to continue having a mutually beneficial relationship. I'm tempted to just move though",13Jan2020,1
199,"I (28m) have been single for years. I have never been a sexual person due to childhood sexual abuse. Starting this new year, I have decided to try and work on myself and change that to try and have a more fulfilling sex life, sexual confidence, etc. I've been chatting with this cam-girl (32f) (met on dating site, later found out about porn) for years and have had obvious reservations, but finally decided to take her up on her offer of dating. I felt like it would be good for me to see someone that is very much in tune with their sexual self. We share a similar dark sense of humor, especially on the topic of her former (recent) occupation. After this second weekend of spending time, I  am surprised how much of our time is spent talking about it, creepy people from it, joking about it etc. I am in no way jealous etc. But I'm at a point where I cant tell if this bothering me because of my problems or if this is a valid concern. That's ALL this girl talks about is sex or camming. Obviously, if it bothers ME, than I need to decide what to do about it. Other obvious red flags, joking about doing sexual favors for things, not afraid to ask for shit (she is aware I am comfortable financially). She is a school teacher for the last six months and stopped camming. Didn't receive holiday pay for winter break. I got tired of hearing her mope about it all night so I gave her the cash I brought for our night together for dinner and a movie ($200) and we just stayed in and watched Netflix. Girl really likes me and SPONTANEOUSLY introduced me to her parents today??? They live up the road from her. Thinking about calling that that and ""getting off cheap"". Anyway, I'm rambling bye.
TL;DR
Dating a former cam girl to discover my sexual self. Too sexual?? Red Flags, getting attached. Gave her money that may serve as an emotional severance package.",13Jan2020,1
200,"Was dating my boyfriend for about a year when he suddenly broke up with me. He was very kind to me our entire relationship and I loved him but I realize now it just wasn’t the right match. When he broke up with me, he completely cut me off. Which I know is his right. But it hurt so bad, going from being “in love” and living together one moment to not even being acknowledged the next. He refused to speak to me, acknowledge my existence or how close we were. I became desperate and did very fucked up things like send him pictures of me cutting myself, showing up at his house, and trying to sabotage his new relationship. I regret these things very deeply. I know none of it was right, or fair. I’m about to go back to the college we both attend and we are in the same social circle and he lives in the same apartment building as my best friend. I am absolutely terrified and dreading going back to school because of this. It feels like it wasn’t even me who did these things. I can’t apologize to him, as I have no way of contacting him and I honestly think it would do more harm than good. I’m paralyzed with depression. I don’t know how to move past this and enjoy my life again and move on from this guilt. Please, any advice would be so welcomed. I have no idea what to do and it’s becoming unbearable inside my head. I failed my semester of nursing school because of it, which I’m now repeating, causing me to be stuck in this situation for another entire year.

207,"Hi Reddit, so I've had problems with this one guy from my school. I met him over the summer for a school-related two-week thing and we've slowly become good friends. Let's call him Kevin. And there's also this girl whom I'll call Keira who is a good friend of mine. She's been my friend for about four years and was also at that two-week thing.

So one day at school, in the beginning of the year, Keira tells me that Kevin has been texting her. I ask her ""About what?"" She says about her life and his life and hobbies and stuff. I brush this off, thinking it's no big deal b/c Keira and Kevin aren't as close as Kevin and me.

This continues for several weeks. I talk with Kevin, who's witty and downright hilarious. We connect on many levels. Keira updates me on her and Kevin and she complains about how he texts her ""way too often"" and how she's not interested in him. Meanwhile, I have started to develop feelings for Kevin. I tell Keira, who understands and offers to show me her texts with him as many times as I need.

I find out Kevin's been texting Keira a ton and he texts her the same things he texts me! (I mean, he sent the same memes to both me and her on multiple occasions). This makes me mad because I feel he's comparing the both of us. Also, he's been complimenting her and calling her cute. (I swear I'm not lying.) Nothing like that has been sent to me from Kevin, but he does talk to me nearly every time I see him and he rarely talks to Keira in person. And he's never mentioned her to me. Keira often tells me that he texts her almost every day and how he's ""really annoying"" but she never does ANYTHING to stop it. No one-word answers, no ""K""s, nothing.

So at this point (around late November) I'm getting really frustrated. I haven't talked to Kevin about any of this because he's the one causing all of this and I don't want him to figure out I have access to Keira's and his conversations together. So I talk to some of Kevin's friends (whom I really trust) and they just tell me to calm down, to wait it out and be patient. They're wonderful people. And that's what I end up doing.

I basically change my whole way of talking to Kevin. Instead of initiating conversation, I wait for him to talk and it actually goes really well. We're learning a lot about each other (interests, hobbies) and I get many of the things he talks about, his references that are sometimes dirty (but this boy does have a sense of humor I can tell you)... until just a few days ago when he sent me this one meme I asked him to explain because I didn't get it.

Then this boy says ""You're as innocent as Keira"". And I freaking LOSE it. I mean, I've been trying this entire time to be ""better"" than her, if that makes sense. I get all his memes and references, I don't double text, I try to be chill and everything and he just goes and says this. So I sorta let it slip a little and say ""Did you send her this too?"" and he confirms, yes, he did. And to top it all off, he says ""You two are exactly the same"" and refuses to elaborate. I mean in hindsight, he was probably joking (probably). But anyway I just didn't respond and left it at that.

Now, he's still texting Keira and me. We still talk, and laugh, and joke like friends do. It's sort of settled down and I have kind of gotten over Kevin a tiny tiny bit. But if he were to ask me out I'd probably say yes... Is that a bad thing? Anyway, Keira and I have sort of fallen out over this. I told her back in November to just leave him on read if he's bothering you that much, and she was like ""oh I can't I'm too nice!"" So she didn't. And they kept talking. I tried to explain to her, ""Keira he really means a lot to me, I want this to work out between me and Kevin"" but I can tell she really didn't understand.

I don't really talk to her that much anymore. I mean if I have to, yeah, I can talk with her no problem. But sooner or later I'll keep asking about Kevin and that won't end well.

As for Kevin... how do I keep a good relationship/friendship with him? I do NOT want to reveal I like him anytime soon. Thank you all in advance for anything and everything! :-))

209,"Hello All, 

My ex-girlfriend and I broke up 2 years ago in March of 2018. The primary reason why we broke up was because she had way too many insecurities that weren't going away any time soon. We don't hate each other, still get along decently, and still hang out here and there. But since our break-up, she has had sex with 2 celebrities that turned out to be complete psychopaths. They are well-known but I will not name them in this post to gain some unbiased advice. For the sake of this post, I will name one of them ""Punk"" and the other ""Dork"". Punk had sex with her in the fall of 2018 and didn't want to let her go afterward. He started harassing her, kidnapping her a couple of times, and even beating her to the point where she was given black eyes. Punk also introduced himself to her family and made himself appear as a kind gentleman. With her family convinced, he was able to get away with every wrong that he did and no one would believe my ex no matter what proof she had. She reported Punk to the police in multiple states and countries but no one would believe her nor take her seriously. After a couple of months of this, she eventually ran into Dork, who she met through Punk. Dork initially tried to save her, so she started falling for him. After a couple months of hanging out with Dork, she eventually had sex with him too. But things now got a lot worse. Dork damn near fell in love with my ex and continued to stalk and harass her to a whole new level. Since my ex looks to me as being her only real friend, she comes to me with all her problems and seeks advice from me. We still care a lot about each other and both Punk and Dork know this. Because Dork was very aware of our feelings towards each other, he started harassing me just as much as he harasses her. He would text me from anonymous numbers, email accounts, and social media accounts. Saying things like I don't deserve her and I should leave her alone for him. Keep in mind, she is not my girlfriend so it doesn't matter to me who she chooses to be with. I cannot control her feelings towards me or control how she interacts with me. I can not stop her from contacting me if that's what she wants to do. I find it very unfair that I'm getting extremely harassed by someone I never met face to face. He has called me hundreds of times from unknown numbers, contacted my school saying that I participate in domestic violence, started group chats with my parents saying that I'm an awful human being and still harasses my ex, except he'll occasionally show up at her home unannounced. We have both tried contacting the police, but these celebrities have so much power to do whatever they want and deny everything. I want to know if anyone has any advice that could bring this harassment to an end. It's been going on for too long, I've changed my phone number (my ex changed hers 4 times but these celebrities keep finding it), but nothing is stopping. Dork has even set up hidden voice recording devices in our places so he always knows what's going on. I had to buy special equipment to detect this. I'm in desperate need of trying to catch these celebrities and getting them locked up so any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",13Jan2020,1

I have never felt that with my guy friends. I always feel accepted and comfortable with them, and have been able to connect with them on a deeper level (not romantically, but as friends).

I searched this up on the internet, as one does to validate themselves, but most articles either paint girls like me as toxic or as ""one of the guys""… but I don't think I can fall into either of those categories.

219,"A little background on this story. Back in 7th grade I met a fellow student, we'll call Kylie, well from what I remember my friends from back then would say that Kylie always felt a certain way about me. I'm not calling Kylie ugly in any way, it's just she had a different personality than what I was looking for in someone. Flash forward, this past year at High School graduation, I seen someone who looked very familiar, it was Kylie, anyways we both experienced alot of changes over those years, not like puberty or anything, yes it was still happening, but weight loss, better attitudes, different lifestyles, etc, anyways my friend, who well, unfortunately I can't think of a different name for him, his nickname is his initials for crying out loud. Anyways, apparently the day before, graduation practice, Kylie wouldn't stop talking about me, I didn't think too much about it, but at graduation, I left a little early, and my friend said that he wanted to take a picture of me and him, and a few of me and Kylie, because she wouldn't stop talking about me. Now present day, I walk in the local Speedway to pay for gas, snacks, whatever, I walk up to the cash register, and kept looking at the cashier, she had piercings, black hair, it was Kylie, things got awkward between the two of us, we both had a shakiness in our voices, our eyes never broke from each other, and as I was walking away with an ice coffee and Hershey's bar, she calls back to me, hands me another and says, ""They're two for one"" I was originally going to buy one because as a new years resolution (now shattered) I was going to slowly cut down sweets. I said "" I'm trying to watch myself"", after I began walking away again, I went back, bought the second with a full dollar, told her keep the change, and she said ""I'll see you later"".

222,"So I found this girl I like on Tinder, but here's the deal, I know her because we used to go to the same private math teacher (we never spoke, she doesn't know of my existence as we were studying different subjects at different tables), but I got her IG by listening to her first and and last name, this is where the problem lies, I always liked her but never approaches her as I'm not that good, and when I found her on the app I got really exited, but we didn't match, so I figured I could talk to her on IG, but she didn't leave her @ on her Tinder profile, I knew it from before, so my question is: How can I approach her saying I saw her on Tinder without coming of like a weirdo/creep, because I'm sure the first question I'll get is ""How did you get my @?"". I follow her and liked a few of her pictures, but she wouldn't notice if I removed the likes and stopped following her so I can appear I just found her. But what are my options? Because the way I see it, this is my hand:

-Telling her the whole truth of how I used to see her at the private teacher's place and thought she's really cute (which I'm not very keen on doing since I think it makes me kinda look like I have a fixation on her)

-Tell her that I complained to a friend that I accidentally swiped left on her and he coincidentally followed her (this makes me have to justify taking a screenshot of her profile)

-Telling her that I ran her pics through a web image searcher and that's how I found he IG (which not only makes me have to justify taking a screenshot of her profile but also makes me look super creepy)

Help please, ladies, what would you think more comfortable with if you were in her case?

223,"  

I have been in and out of college for 10 years, I'm 29 years old. My family doesn't have much, my father is terminally I’ll and I honestly don't think he has much longer to live. My mother, God bless her heart, works so damn hard at 62 years old and basically lives paycheck to paycheck. I've been trying so damn hard to finish my education and the past 3 years I really tried to buckle down and finish. Last semester I found out last minute that all my financial aid would be taken away because in my state (Florida) if you have too many college credits they punish you by taking your funds away and doubling the cost of your tuition.

Because of this, I had no way to purchase my textbooks or pay my rent, I was even having to resort to stealing food and going thru the garbage at fast food places to reduce my spending. The stress of all that caused me to fail all my classes, I was then put into a mental hospital because I almost committed suicide after going through all that. After I got released, I was told that I will be dismissed from my major because of my grades. I will now have to change my major and stay in school for a year longer if I want to graduate. I tried to appeal my financial aid and they rejected the appeal. I went into extreme detail as to why I'm ""over-credits"" (moved to 3 different states, had to transfer to 3 different colleges many of my credits didn't transfer but they still count it as my attempted credit hours) in the response letter they didn't even care, all they said was "" your appeal has been rejected because you are over-credit hours.""

I am now in the process of waiting for an answer for Medical withdrawal in order to have those grades expunged from my transcripts from last semester so that I don't have to say in school longer than I already have. My family worked their butts off and scrounged up money for me to pay my rent for this semester but because I'm still waiting on an answer for my medical withdrawal I'm only enrolled in 1 class. I feel overly pressured by my family AND the government to finish. All my friends also want me to finish.

I'm always told the same thing ""you've come so far, don't give up"" ""you put so much time and money into this, don't quit now"" Yeah, I get that. But for me to do well in school I have to put 100% of my effort and school. I can’t work a fulltime job and get A's. I've tried numerous times, I can only do well when I'm working very minimal hours but now I have no financial aid to help me pay my bills while in college.

I'm so tired of putting my life on hold for school. I'm almost f\*\*king 30 for Christ's sake I'm been here too damn long for a damn UNDERGRAD degree. I have put my life on hold for this, put off jobs, friends, relationships, family time all for this stupid piece of paper. I'm almost 30 and I making 9 dollars an hour, when I try to find better-paying jobs they keep harping on having a degree when I've been working for over 10 years, no one gives a s\*\*t about my work experience.

I feel that I'm just not meant to succeed, like Ill always be stocking shelves in a damn retail store the rest of my life, I just want a career, I want to help my family, and most importantly I want my father to see me walk on the podium and get my degree before he dies...",13Jan2020,1

231,"S—my (now) ex, lives in Tennessee, has diagnosed bipolar and depression, 23
A—his friend, lives in Chicago, 30

My boyfriend S and I have been together for about a year and a half now. We met about two months after I got out of a three year long relationship the involved me getting cheated on a lot, ect. S lived with my friends I had lived with previously and have known for like 5-7 years just about. He has only known them (now) for about the time of us dating. Just a few months longer then that. 

S had this friend A that he was basically in love with when I met him but he denied it and said that he used to have feelings for her way back but not anymore bc she turned him doen. She (A) lives like in Chicago and we live in Tennessee. 

We start dating and as time goes on he was just kinda mean, always fighting with me, always texting A, always Skyping her, ect. He called her ""mother"" bc they apparently were just the close but she would get jealous about me and call me a child among other things. 

So anyway, fast forward to 6 or 8 months into the relationship. He finally admits that he had been doing some soul-searching and that he did in fact have feeling for her still but didn't want to be with her. So we eventually got passed it for a while until we took our first break break(1️⃣) on his account bc apparently I hadn't been the same.  S and A had began to talk on and off, like he would go a month without talking to her then be like ""I miss her"" and start talking to her again. Then be like ""she causes issues with me personally"" and stop talking to her again. But anyway, I moved out and moved back with my mom so I could start saving up money and just do good for myself. 

A month or so passes and we end up getting back together after feeling stronger with our bond, ect and giving it time. 

So S moves in with my other friends that I introduced him to once his lease ended with our previous friends. 

Then he started complaining all the time about how I don't spend enough time with him alone..even though all he wants to do is sit at home in his room and watch shit we've already seen on Netflix. Won't even play borderlands 3 with me so we are sooooo behind on playing it 🙄.. then on New Year's Eve we threw a party and things got extremely escalated. It was about 1 am or so and he had work in about 3 hours at like 4 am. So I was telling him to go to bed and one of our friends helped him off to bed. He was extremely wasted. He laid in bed for a while and kept getting ""mad"" because he could hear us having fun in the living room while he had to sleep so he got up out of the bed and locked the door to the room. Eventually I got up to go in there and check if he was asleep and realized it was locked. 

So at first I'm wondering if he did it on purpose or on accident since he was drunk. One of my friends picked the lock after I had banged on the door and he didn't answer (all of my stuff was in there, I wear contacts so I eventually needed to take those out too, I wanted to change from the outfit I had on, ect). Once the door was opened I asked him if he meant to lock the door and he just grunted. So I was like okay maybe he's asleep I'll ask in a bit again. 

A little while later he came out the room to the bathroom then went back into the room after. So I went in there because I saw him. He pretty much said that he locked the door and ignored me bc he was being petty. So I grabbed my shit and left. Obviously. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

The next day we talked it out a bit, it was alright but I was still mad kinda. He told me he went to work. 

About a week or so later he decided to day drink, I told him not to because I didn't want him to do that. My father was an alcoholic, my ex was, and I didn't want him to become one and it seemed to me like he was starting to. He got mad at me basically and started saying me and him are completely opposite once he got more drunk and we ended up calling for break number two(2️⃣). The next few days are him throwing pity parties, I'm sorry, blahblahblah, it's my depression, everything else. Telling me either I'm all in or we're done for good which is bull because HE called for the first break. I called for this one and didn't say anything like that when he felt like it was needed. 

So we get that sorted kind of. Then one day like a few days ago I went over there to hangout and he ended up telling me he doesn't know if he wants a relationship or not or if it's his depression telling him he didn't, ect. So I was like okay well maybe you need to work on yourself and we can just be friends for now. So the break turned into the BREAK UP. He also drank that night and the night after. Every since that day it's been nothing but pity party from him. Him saying he's sorry that he fucked up and that he realizes now that it was just his depression, ect. Finally he started to be sorta okay...Then last night I went over there and spend the night so I could hangout with his roommates (MY friends). I slept in my friends bed with his gf, whom I've known for years. S woke up today and apparently saw me in bed in his roommates room and got upset bc he realized he fucked up again and that I ""should've"" been sleeping in his bed. So then he basically said that he was self harming and stuff bc of it. Which really made me mad more then anything. 

So I just was like ""okay well I just won't spend the night here anymore"" blahblah. He went to work. During work he tells me he might go see A in Chicago bc the last time he did (before he knew me and when he had feelings for her) it made his depression not as bad.

OR do I hire someone to watch the kids? I’d considered this because there’s a grooms cottage for everyone to spend the night and the kids could go there. But it’ll be about 5 kids under 5, and 6 other kids under 12, so we’d need a few sitters which is a fairly large expense.

Trigger warnings: suicide.

So, my mom and “stepdad” (they never married, but I eventually called him this for simplicity’s sake) were together for about 8 years. This entire time, his two youngest daughters treated my mom like absolute shit. They called her a gold digger (spoiler, he made &gt;100k when they met), talked down to her, treated her like their maid, and said all sorts of nasty stuff to her constantly. Ex-stepdad never said a word until my mom left him (the first time) over this. He was constantly afraid of upsetting his daughters, whose mother he had divorced before they were even in schools. 

I wasn’t the friendliest when they first got together (my parents had divorced just a few months prior), but I NEVER treated him like they treated my mom. I was polite, and eventually friendly enough with him. We all went on vacation together about a year later, and his daughters treated me like absolute crap. They were rude and snotty, and I spent the whole vacation crying. My mom would take me out to do things separately, away from the group, and he would throw a fit because he wasn’t with her. So, no more “family” vacations for me, as his kids didn’t like me. I wasn’t invited. I never blamed my mother for this, even though she later admitted she felt very guilty for allowing these trips to happen without me, even going so far as to say she was “bullied” into it, as well as many other things.

He would buy me birthday and Christmas gifts, and I would stay over at their house from time to time, but that was really as far as our relationship went. When my mom argued with him for not treating me better, or not taking me on vacation, he would remind her that I “wasn’t his kid.” Which, true. I wasn’t. But he expected her to treat his kids like gold, where I never had a room of my own at his house, nor even a place to leave any things (like clothes etc)... so I never truly felt welcome or home with them. I never really complained, as he did make my mom happy at times. They traveled a lot for his business, had lots of friends together, and had a very active social life, which she had always wanted. 

I didn’t see it at first, but the more time went on, the more I saw the negative aspects of my stepdad. On the surface, he was your typical 50s something white guy who worked in sales and loved to golf. Overall, he was alright, at first. Then I started realizing how critical and controlling he was. He would criticize my mother for the simplest things, like trimming the bushes in the yard too short, or cleaning the windows in the wrong pattern. 

In addition, he would get upset with her for spending so much time with me and her mom, who lived about 45 minutes away from them. She would frequently spend the night on our end of town. He wanted her to be with him, which I understand, but still. 

She put up with it for YEARS, and I completely regret not encouraging her to leave him. In fact, I did the opposite a few times. I was scared of change, and had gotten comfortable with him and his family (even though they sucked) in my life, and I didn’t want her to go find someone else and make me go through the whole terrible process again. It was selfish, and one of my biggest regrets. Had I encouraged her to leave him, she might still be here.

SO, about 15 months ago, my mom committed suicide. I had found out she had gone on a date with another man, as I’m very against cheating (she cheated on my father which led to their divorce and I still was dealing with feelings from that 9 years later). I yelled at her, called her a whore, basically said she was a bad mother (she wasn’t— I was very lucky to have such a loving and beautiful mother). Instead of encouraging her to date other men who wouldn’t treat her like shit, I just yelled at her for cheating. 

A week later, she died. Ex step-dad was very supportive throughout the process. He was there when her body was taken to the morgue, held my while I sobbed. He paid for the funeral and cremation costs. She left him a voicemail asking him to take care of things, and me specifically, and he promised me that he would be there for me, always. I believed him, at first. I truly did not blame him, as my mom was plagued with mental health issues throughout her life (she lived through a previous suicide attempt, spent time in psychiatric facilities, and was abused and assaulted as a child). She had many issues of her own, and I found myself defending him because I know he loved her. My grandmother was keen to blame him, as well as other family members, and for some reason I would defend him and say it was no one’s fault. I still feel that it’s no one’s fault in particular, but I know we all could have been better to her, me especially. 

Oh, but the last time I saw him in person was last March (2019) when I forked over a 40k life insurance check. After that, radio silence. 

BUT here’s the main reason behind the shitty voicemail. He’s had things of hers since she died that I’ve been trying to get back. I would call, and he’d have some excuse as to why I couldn’t come get them. He was busy with work, he moved from their home, he was ill etc.

Over the holidays, I sent him texts: “happy thanksgiving! Merry Christmas!” Etc, nothing fancy or overly sentimental. I never got replies. I assume he was ignoring me. So, a few days ago I was having a bad night. I was upset, tried to call him twice to no answer. On the second call, I left a voicemail that was essentially:

“I know you haven’t given a fuck about me since my mother killed herself after you treated her like shit for nine years, but I want my mom’s shit back, so if you could give me a call back, thanks bye.”

I felt justified at the time. I felt as if he had abandoned me. He hasn’t tried to speak to me of his own volition since a few months after she died when he would call and check up on me. So much for his promise to take care of me, right? And all these feelings made me realize how much I resented him for not treating my mother better, so I was angry. I genuinely wanted to make him feel like a POS with this voicemail. And honestly, I actively blame myself more for her death than I do him, but again. I wanted him to feel like shit, too. 

Well, the next morning he sent a copy of the voicemail to my father (he couldn’t just message me instead??) and explains that he, the day before, had knee replacement surgery. And his broken leg (which he’d broken not long after my mom died) had gotten infected again and he’d almost died twice etc... I knew he’d been ill a few months ago, but I didn’t know how bad it was still. 

Yeah, I felt a bit like an asshole, but i know he’d been in good health over the summer months. Or at least good enough to put her shit in a box and have me come get it. When he moved over the summer would’ve been a perfect time to do so!! But of course he didn’t. He just ignored my calls and texts for months.

But my dad says I’m wrong for sending the voicemail, as I’d known the man’s been ill and is probably still grieving heavily, as I am. He may not want anything to do with me because I remind him of my mother, and he just seems like he wants to move on. Which, fair I guess. But still. I know I was never like a child to him, but I thought I at least deserved a call after so much time?

245,"*Sorry for format, on mobile* 

Quick disclaimer this is a little long and I just wanted to make sure I didn't skip over any important details.

I'm 18M from Ontario, Canada and I've been working at a warehouse for a postage related company for the past 3 months. About a month and a half into being here I and others had quickly realized that these two ~35 year old guys come to work drunk quite often (3/5 weekdays or more!!) and although our job in particular doesn't involve the use of heavy machinery, one of the guys drives the forklift sometimes as a special privilege of some sort!! 

After witnessing the guy who drives the forklift sneak a can of beer into the workplace (Alcohol and Drugs are strictly prohibited)  I thought it would be right to tell my supervisor. I called my supervisor after work that night, made sure he was alone and I told him what I knew. I strictly told him not to mention me and he told me it's all good of course not yadda yadda. He then says he's going to talk to them himself and get them to cut it out or something. They were nice guys and did a lot for the company; coming in early and focusing hard and I honestly agreed with this outcome. I strongly believe they were just going through an addiction and I would have loved to see them begin a recovery after a slap of reality. 

The next day neither of them show up, weird, never found out why. 

The following day they show up and I walk by one of them being spoken to by the lady in charge of the whole warehouse. 

From then on I notice them being very distant around me and shushing when I go near them when they're talking to eachother/other coworkers, very similar to what they'd do when they would be drunk and a supervisor+ would walk by. I used to talk to them pretty often and I just pretended I didn't care about them being drunk all the time so it was really striking to see them go quiet around me coincidentally right after I informed my supervisor.

They never confronted me and as the days went by they ended up getting moved to doing different work around the warehouse until one day they decided to quit and work somewhere further north in Ontario. 

Fast forward to last week I discover while talking to a coworker my age that he knows I told management about the drunk guys. I just played it dumb and said I had no idea where he got that from and that I wanted to know who told him that, and he tells me the two guys themselves told him. My friend used to talk to them a lot and he was often the only person they would talk to. I didn't let him know the truth, I only denied it and he gave it up, not sure if he believed me.

I don't show it one bit, but I'm livid on the inside. I have just been promoted, if you can call it that, from seasonal employment to part-time permanent. I know it's not an issue anymore but just knowing that two addicts had a grudge against me for the 1-2 weeks they were still at the warehouse just kind of freaks me out. 

The company also has a 'snitch program' that offers quite a bit of money (thousands) for information on reckless/criminal behaviour.

My company is part of a union and I am officiallialy unionized so I believe there is a lot of protection within that. I want to speak to the lady in charge of the warehouse as she has some liking over me and was the one who decided that I become a permanent employee. I think she can be reasonable with me. 

How should I approach this situation?",13Jan2020,1

  So about 6 months ago I moved away from the state they lived in. I’m still really close with them but it’s not the same. And the two friends are “besties” or something. But it always makes me really annoyed or mad when I hear that they do anything together. It didn’t help that they now go to the same school either. It also didn’t help that they would post on their stories while hanging out and referring to the other as “bestie”. I almost feel left out but selfish at the same time. They always seem to have more fun together then with me. It’s hard playing games with both of them without getting upset. I haven’t told them anything in fear they’ll hate me or get mad.  Yeah I get that they’ve known each other longer then I’ve known either of them so they have the right to call each other that, but I get so frustrated at the same time. 

  Is there any way that I can stop feeling this way and still remain friends with both of them? If you have any clarifying questions I can answer those. Thanks.",13Jan2020,1
247,"I’m entering my second semester of college and just came back from winter break. I noticed while walking through the halls that a room had no name tags on it (all of the other rooms do) and therefore there must be nobody in it. I have considered asking my Resident Advisor for the room. However, I worry about some possible outcomes.

My main problem is I’m probably going to need an excuse to leave my current room. My roommate and I are not friends. We’ve probably had about 10 interactions in the 4 months we have lived with each other. I don’t dislike him or anything, it’s just the room has become extremely awkward as time has passed and we’re not any closer to becoming friends than we were at the beginning of the year. 

If I were to ask my RA for the empty room, she may respond by asking what my relationship is like with my roommate. I don’t want this to become a counseling session between the two of us. I think we can both mutually agree that we are not comfortable with one another and would prefer to live in separate rooms. That being said though, I don’t want to have to say it to his face. 

I hope I don’t sound too ridiculous by asking this but I’m honestly not too sure what to do in this situation. Any advice towards a good enough excuse or what I should be doing?",13Jan2020,1

250,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half now. He was extremely unhappy at his old job and I kind of helped him get a new job working under my sister, even though ultimately she’s the one who gave him a job because she’s the boss. My sister and I have a complicated relationship that is not in the best place right now. I feel like I made a big mistake. I’m actually happy for my boyfriend because he’s so much happier at this new job but it’s really been hard for me to hear about my sister all the time. (She is his boss and they work together all day). He’ll come how and tell me all about their day together. I really hadn’t realized how much this would effect my home life, because, as always, I was thinking of someone else rather than myself. I’m trying to stay positive and be supportive, especially when he tells me about his day and what my sister has taught him and what they’ve done together but I’m struggling. It’s not that I think he and my sister are going to have a sexual or romantic relationship, it’s just the plain fact that right now hearing about my sisters life is very difficult for me because she really hurt me and it’s just easier not to think of her much right now. Especially when it comes to things like her success and achievements, as much as I hate myself for saying that. Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with this and move on without being unsupportive of my boyfriend? I really feel caught in the middle.",13Jan2020,1
251,"The following information is just me narrating my family's autobiographical account and how we came to be financially stressed. If you'd like to read it, please go ahead. If not, the only thing that I'd like to ask here is that I want to make money as a teenager, but I can't go outside my house because of protective parents. The only form of skills that I have our beginner level drawing, intermediate in writing and editing, and intermediate in origami xD please tell me ways in which I can help my family financially, by working or investing. I am a 15 year old from India, by the way.

So, I'd just like to provide a little bit of context regarding my family background in order to help you understand my situation better. 

(Summary of the following paragraph: My father sold his ancestral property for 1 million and spent half of it to buy an apartment. The rest, he deposited in banks in order to get interest. This was his only planned from of income after retirement.)

My grandfathers jointly bought a property in a small scenic town nearly a century ago. After numerous lawsuits posed by a relative who had a property right beside ours (for reasons I still fail to understand), our family finally won and we decided to sell the property after many long years of living there. Out of the two grandfathers, one had two children, a son and a daughter and the other had four sons, including my father. It was obvious that our side would be getting the lesser share, but the property was sold for a good 8 million. Half of this obviously went over to the other grandfather's children, while the rest of it was divided between my father and his brothers, leaving us with a million dollars. Half of this was spent in buying a flat in a metropolis since our city did not provide the librty to migrants from other states to buy properties (this was imposed long after my grandfathers bought the property), and the rest was put into banks or mutual funds in order to earn interest.

Everything was going on smoothly until the new government came into power and interest rates dropped significantly to a point that my father's previous plan for earning through interest could no longer be relied on. It was during this time that business went completely down in my town. Our town is heavily reliant on income from tourism, and my father owns a tourist taxi (he takes tourists for sightseeings at the price of about 42 dollars per sightseeing. Basically he's a driver for tourists.) His monthly earnings decreased significantly and he'd remain unemployed almost 15-20 days a month, if not poor. This situation is currently continuing, and we are under heavy financial strains.

A little about me and my family, I am a 15 year old girl currently preparing for my 10th board examinations. I have a sister aged 10 in 6th grade. My mother is a 42 year old housewife and my father is 58, nearing the age of retirement. He hasn't made any plans for investments in shares or anything of that sort as he's afraid of losing money. We live in a rented apartment that costs about 80 bucks or so. My sister's school fees is about 30 bucks and after I pass my 10th, my educational expenses will significantly increase.

Whoo, writing all that was a ride. So, getting to the point. My father is getting depressed because of this lack of money and his growing age. My mother is slowly succumbing into it as well. We basically have no form of income, and we're afraid that the money we have will soon run out.

My sister and I have been raised dainty children who were never exposed to such problems. Now that I've grown up and I'm seeing all the stress my parents are undergoing, I'm slowly crumbling. I was never a bright student, one who'll be able to get a scholarship or something and reduce the burdens for my parents (basically an 85 percent holder). I'm not business minded as well. The only thing that I plan to do with my life is completing my education, getting a degree in liberal arts and becoming a teacher. But these current situations are turning all our plans south. I'm so worried, and I constantly curse myself for being so unproductive.

So, I've decided that I'm going to do something about it. I'd like to know how I can earn money. I've read article that tell me to start mowing people's lawns, babysitting, starting a lemonade stand or something. I really can't do all of that. I live in India and these things would never work out for me. My parents are also very strict and egoistic, they'd never let me do these things. The only way that I can work is from home, and the only ""skills"" that I have are that I can draw a little, I like writing and have pretty good grammar, and that I like making origami. 

I'm really feeling disappointed. I'd really like to do something for my family, but I'm lacking all form of direction. Please tell me about any way in which I can invest a small sum of money to earn more or some form of work in which I can earn a small some of money. Any sum of money would do, I just don't want to be so stagnant. I really don't know what to say anymore. I'm absolutely confused and saddened. 

If you have read so far, thank you so much. Please do help me if you can.",13Jan2020,1
252,"Me and my boyfriend have been on and off for a few years. Recently we had a huge fallout and I told him to give it two weeks when he got home from work and see that I’ve changed. I didn’t argue with him about things we normally do and have him space and I thought we worked it out. Our biggest issue was him feeling like he doesn’t have any privacy. He gave me his social media a while back when there were rumors of him cheating so I had his account info for a few months. Eventually he said this should be enough time and he wants privacy so I agreed and told him to change his passwords. Well a few days into him going out of town for work I decided to look one time because I had a really bad feeling. And low and behold here he is talking to another girl about how he wants to leave me and he likes someone else who he believes is “going somewhere in life”. I’m currently pursuing a degree in psychology and I found this extremely hurtful since I pay our bills 50/50 and sent him to work with over $100 I got for Christmas so he’d have some grocery/gas money. I confronted him about this other girl and quickly deleted the conversation and said he was baiting me to see if I’d get on his Facebook. It hurts because I know him and this girl are friends and actually talk, but why would he create this baiting situation with a girl he actually has contact with? I told him I was hurt by this and he lashed out calling me a psychopath, ignorant, b*tch and whole bunch of other stuff. This isn’t the first time he’s done this while away for work and this isn’t the first time he’s broken up with me. He only does all this when he has to leave for work and I’m at a loss. He respects that I pay the bills and is giving me time to move out, but says he doesn’t want to come home to me anymore. I’m so angry and upset and I don’t know what I should do. I feel throughout our relationship when I catch him doing something like this he gaslights me and deflects to turn the issue back on me. “Babe why are you talking to this girl and saying you want to flirt with her?” “Dammit you psychopath it’s your fault you went on my Facebook, I was baiting you and I proved you’re a psychotic toxic b*tch” he has another week before he comes home and I don’t know what to do.",13Jan2020,1

He words things in such a cringey way! Also, he over compliments and it’s gotten to the point where I altogether ignore the complements and focus on the convo.

256,"So basically, I've hated sports my whole life. Not because I didnt like running or exercising, I'm just  deathly afraid of playing on teams. I didnt think it would be a problem because all of my gym classes up until now have been consisted of just messing around and doing whatever the hell you wanted. But as soon as I got into high school a year ago, my teacher explained to the class that we would be playing organized games every time we had gym. My heart sunk to my chest and I was too close to crying right in front of the entire gym class.  I tried skipping class, making excuses, faking injuries, etc etc. It got so bad to the point where I would forget my uniform on purpose and take a detention instead. With the new year, it would be great if i didnt have to go through what i did last year. If you have and advice or experience with this PLEASE let me know. Thanks ✌🏽",13Jan2020,1
257,"my girlfriend (f, 29) and i (m,25) have been dating for about four months now, and things’ve been going really well. 

the other day when we were hanging out together her phone went off. when she picked it up it was a tinder notification. 

she knew i saw it and said, “hey, i know you saw that, so, let me explain. i don’t talk to anyone, and i can show you that here. i only use it for an ego boost.”

she then opened the app and scrolled through and showed me her matches + messages and she was being honest. 

she hadn’t had any conversations with anyone. she isn’t talking to anyone. she only uses it for self esteem, really. 

i then told her that i appreciate her being honest and transparent with me, to which she responded, “yeah, i don’t want you to have the wrong impression or you to think i’m cheating on you, because i’m not. it just helps me feel a bit better about myself.”

i’m honestly not really too concerned about it. she’s not the kind of person to cheat. and especially since she openly showed me the messages and she was being honest about it and even had the audacity to bring it up.

258,"Before I start...I know I’m a spoiled brat who’s a lazy fuck who needs to grow up.

I’m a 20m currently living at home with my parents..I’m lucky to have a place with free food and shelter,but my parents are starting to lose their patience with me (understandingly) because 
A. I’m extremely lazy. I sleep all day and stay up all night (I got really bad insomnia) and really don’t do anything all day except go to the gym and be on my phone.
B. I have no job. I’ve had two jobs in the past but can’t seem to hold one down. I have barely any desire to look for one myself..the only thing really pushing me to look for one is my parents nagging me about it.
C. I flunked my first year of college. I didn’t pay attention in my classes nor did I really do my homework causing me to fail. And my parents paid for it btw so I wasted their money.

I know I’m using them and not being a independent adult..taking care of myself and contributing to my family and society in general and I feel fucking awful about it. 
This isn’t excusing my actions but I have severe depression and anxiety and have been treated for it but over the last four years I’ve only gotten from a place of wanting to end my life to not wanting to die but not wanting to go live my life. And honestly my parents aren’t helping me at all in feeling better...at first they were very empathetic but now it’s more like “ok it’s been several years you need to be better now” attitude. They believe if I get a job and was more organized and got more sleep I’d be practically cured..the thing is I was like that four years ago before I attempted suicide twice..and having a job, being more organized and getting enough sleep made absolutely no difference AT ALL in how I felt..I still felt awful and with these last two jobs and being in college made me more organized and made me sleep better and I felt slightly better tbh..for like a week then I felt the same numbness/sadness I’ve always felt except it’d be a little worse when comparing myself to my peers who are organized and ambitious in there lives and they are happy because of it then looking at my self trying to be the same way but being miserable.I’ve told my parents this and they don’t believe me saying I just need to try again and harder..it’s honestly making me hate my parents. 

Idk what to do I know I can’t live on my own like this and I’m being a burden to my family...

Lately I feel like I have 'checked out' of the relationship - a good indicator that I should end things. He has persistent mental health issues (depression and anxiety), but I feel I have no more spoons left to give, and I feel hopeless in helping him. He refuses to seek help from therapists, professionals, friends and family so I have carried his burdens but it has started taking a toll on me.

We share many friends and I'm so anxious I will be cut off from them. He is really emotional and takes a lot of time to process things, so I'm expecting him to be really upset and unable to see me (even in large groups) which is understandable. 

I don't know whether I should stay and support him because I genuinely love him and worry, or breakup with him. I feel guilty prioritising my happiness, because I know this will break his heart. I'm worried his mental health issues will be amplified. I'm also worried about losing friends, as I don't want to 'take' them away from him as he will need support so I probably shouldn't reach out to them.

277,"I'm discovering that my long term relationship (5 years) isn't good for my partner and I anymore. We've almost broken up 3 times in about a month and a half. I feel like I'm being held back from growing as a person being in this relationship and I feel that might be the same for her. I don't want to have to answer to someone when I want to go out to do something or have a friend over. I want to just be able to live my life how I want and not worry about tailoring it to another person.

I also can't lie that I've started to feel more attracted to other people. I've tried talking about that and the points above but it's met with anger or guilt tripping. The third time we almost broke up a few weeks ago she went on about how amazing my life would be and how shitty hers would be. That I would live happily and she would just get confirmation that she's worthless and second rate goods. Instead trying to understand my perspective she would just assume I wanted to break up because I didn't care about her.

So I felt guilty and decided to try to stick it out. At first things were okay. But the negativity started to creep back in. I started to really slip after listening to a few songs. Specifically ""Still in Love"", ""Go to War"", and ""Just Say When"" all by Nothing More. Those songs just hit me like a ton of bricks. I realized I still don't see a future with her and after commiting to us trying again.

I've also noticed that most of my thoughts and opinions of her have turned really negative. It's like I don't have anything good to say about her anymore. She just went to work not too long ago (night shift) and I started getting so annoyed because she kept complaining that she didn't want to go to work and was basically leaving it up to me to encourage her to be the responsible adult she should already be. This happens often even if it's just getting her out of bed.

Most of all I just find the time I've been spending with my best friend (also a women) just feels better. Our friend group has always been a very close cuddly group so it wasn't unusual for us to cuddle with other people even of the opposite sex. This has been a thing for a couple years. But lately it's just felt nicer being close to my best friend. The other night were together (girlfriend was there with her male best friend) just cuddling on the couch enjoying a show and it felt so good. She and I have also started working out together and that's been amazing because we're so encouraging of each other even though it's been incredibly difficult at times. I just don't feel these things with my girlfriend anymore.

I know we need to break up but I'm so afraid to. I desperately want to talk to someone but one close friend is asleep because they work early in the morning. And my best friend, while she's amazing, has gotten to close to this mess before and it was coming close to causing damage to our friendship. I just want to do this cleanly and avoid as much drama as possible. So it's just about the two of us and not involving another person.

Can someone please help?",13Jan2020,1

283,"Ok so, throwaway b/c someone irl might know my reddit and I do not want this traced back to me in any way shape or form. Also, I’m on mobile if formatting is weird. Oh, and I’m aware I’m a humongous asshole in this story.

Ok so, I took a few classes in community college. I got an A in two of them and and F in the other two. Idk, I literally cannot do the classes I don’t want to do. Two of the classes were interesting, two of them weren’t, and since like middle school I’ve had the hardest time doing any classes I don’t want to do. I just can’t force myself to do anything. Idk, I don’t feel depressed, but I guess I’m unmotivated? There’s just nothing I can do to motivate myself. I know this sounds fucking privileged (I’m a white boy with upper-middle class parents) because it is, but idk.

My parents covered half of the cost. I photoshopped my grades when I sent them to my parents. I made one of the classes I failed an A- so it looks more realistic and they haven’t questioned it. 

To understand this fully, I need to explain about those classes. Basically, there’s a transfer agreement in my state saying if you can get x credits in community college, your general studies will be covered for wherever in the state I transfer to. The two I lied about are a part of the agreement. One I absolutely need, one I just need another class in that field to make it up. The thing is, in the field I want to into has a class that I need to be able to go into the upper level courses that’s only available in the fall semester. My Dad, who’s helping me schedule everything, is trying to get me to get everything in the transfer agreement done by then, which is doable assuming I passed the classes I didn’t. 

With that background, let me explain some more stuff. This is going to be a long post but I feel like all this is useful. Right now, I’m living with my parents. I own a car, have a job, and have a couple thousand (usd) in the bank. I really don’t want to ruin my relationship with my parents. They’re some of the most amazing people ever, and they say they love me unconditionally, but reading posts where people cut their kids out of their life has made me fucking nervous. What I know is that they wouldn’t let me just mooch off them for the rest of my life. They’ve said as much. The last time I lied to them about school (it happened a couple times in high school) it took them time to trust me again. Now that I’m an adult, I’m afraid they’ll cut me out entirely if they find out. Possibly irrational, they’ve never said they would do something like that, but I really don’t want to lose them. Oh, and after the semester, they also they helped me set up a room in the basement and helped pay for the furniture with the expectation that I can keep the furniture when I move out.

Ok now that I’ve laid it out, here are my list of possible solutions rn
1. Admit it to them right now. This seems not good to me, it would make everything go to shit really quickly. 
2. Admit it after this semester. Maybe they’ll be more forgiving if it’s in the past. I can potentially add those courses to my summer schedule (which could actually might have room). The problem is that if I could force myself to do them once, I don’t know if I could force myself to do it if I tried a second time. At this point, I don’t even know if college is for me. 
3. Try to get my parents less involved in my college and take the classes again. This would be the “everything is normal” to them kind of option. Basically, I’d have to suddenly go from my Dad helping me with scheduling and telling them what classes I have and everything to being secretive about everything. That seems insanely suspicious and has the same problem as the above ones in that, I just don’t know if I can even motivate myself to do the classes and pass them if given the opportunity. 
4. Get a job I can make a good enough living off of without college and drop out after this semester and do that. The problem is that I don’t really want it to be retail or food service. I’ve worked at McDonald’s for a year and a half and at Office Depot for a little over a year now. I definitely don’t want to do those long-term. I’ve tried to research as much as I can, even looking at trying to make a living through small stuff you can do online, but I can’t figure it out. One idea I had here was learn to code and then maybe there’s online coding jobs I can get without a college degree. 

There’s probably potential solutions I’m missing. I really don’t want to sacrifice the relationship with my parents. Advice on which solution, or if I’m missing a solution, would be nice and also advice on what job to get if I try option 4 would be nice as well.",13Jan2020,1

285,"Sorry if this is extremely long,  but here goes... I currently live with my parents and work part time. I attempted to go to college twice with no success, so I figured it would be better for me to work full time until I am ready to return to school. 

Here's my issue though: I have had severe anxiety issues since I was little (along with depressive episodes since I was 15-16), and it affects me physically as well (to the point of being ill). I have inconsistent eating habits, my sleep is very erratic and I have little to no inclination to leave my room other than for work. 

Because of this, my mom has gotten on me for not helping around the house as often as I should (though I was spoiled growing up, so it is hard to get used to do so without being asked unless she was sick). I admit, I tend to slack, but for some reason it felt like she was annoyed and disappointed with me this time. It even got to the point where she threatened to disconnect or take away my electronics.

I also am hesitant to make/reconnect with friends as I had two relationships (one romantic) go south in the last couple years and don't want to risk that again. This is also why I'm worried about living with a roommate.

While I am good terms with my parents, I sometimes feel like I am an inconvenience to them. I figured if I leave, I could be way less reliant on them and not have them be bugged by me. Should I just save up for a place once I work full time?",13Jan2020,1

hey guys, so in my spare time i do moving jobs and such. pretty much, there is this realtor lady (RL) that pays me to come help her clients move into their new homes. (i’ve only done it once with her, this would be my second time she’s hit me up). 

anyways, RL wanted me to bring someone to help, so while trying to be modest and not be greedmaster5000, i told RL i would charge $17/hr. we live in CA, so having my friend and I come out and move this older couples’ entire inventory into this new house saved them a couple hundred bucks, probably more. 

they ended up only needing us for 3 hours, and we made like $52. we were all expecting it to be a 5-6 hour job, but we did it in 3 because they just had us move everything up some stairs and into their front room because i guess they’re son was going to come over and help them set up the house + furniture. but they had a LOT of shit. HEAVY shit. i think we ended up walking with $60 each. kinda BS considering we did it fast, efficiently, and saved her probably $400+ not having to hire a moving company. 

I told her i’d charge $20/hr this time around for the new clients. i don’t work for a company, just a under the table thing.

anyways my question is, do you think i should’ve charged more last time, or even this time around? i’m not trying to seem greedy, but last time was kinda whack for how much we did in 3 hours, we were kinda hoping she’d just slide us a hundo each and recognize we were tryna help them out. what would’ve you done? thanks.",13Jan2020,1

Long story short, my uncle molested me was a child and raped me when I was 18. He was a huge part of my life and I had blocked the molestation out until the traumatic experience when I was 18. My mother was aware her brother did this and kept him around and reenforced the ideological father figure he had become up to that point. She kept it all from my baby sister who is 9 years younger then me. He still lives on the property of a closer family member (we will call her stupid ass Tiffany) me my husband and my three month old have been living with mom and Shannon for about 6 months and have been saving up to move out.


Recently my sister (we will call her Shanon) asked me why I hate uncle so much, why I refuse to go to aunt Tiffanys house and I told her it was a fucked up reason, maybe she should ask mom. shanon said she had but mom kept lying and changing her story while encouraging her to not hate him just because I do and to go see him with my mother. 


So I told the bare minimum of the situation that had happened and to stay the hell away from him, and to call me if mom pulls that shit again


Well this weekend my mom and Tiffany got drunk. I mean they got super fucking drank and mom went down to talk to him.. when shanon found out she tried to talk to Tiffany about it because she was anxious as fuck and got yelled at for it. followed by Tiffany shooting said uncle a text telling him to come and drink with them... Which is when she finally called me to come get her because she was scared (and rightfully so.)  Tiffany screamed in her face basically until I got there 


I'm still fucking livid about it, I sped the whole way there. When I got there my sister was shaking and sobbing and mom decided to come home too.. the ENTIRE 30 Minute drive home our mom wailed about how she did nothing wrong, causing shanon to cry even harder. 


Once we got home mom tried again to tell me she did nothing wrong and I sorta spilt my guts. I told her this was INDEED wrong and hurt me on so many levels. I told her I can't possibly fathom how she could still want to see that monster and open the door for him to hurt my sister. She argued and insisted nothing happened and it didn't matter before going inside and ignoring me, or telling me again how nothing happened and I'm being dramatic and overreacting about it all and she did nothing wrong



After that I talked to Shannon for two hours about how sorry I was she had to find out about mom's issues like this. I told her mom loves her but shes a little twisted and it's not Shannon's fault, Mom was twisted since before either of us was born. She just couldn't believe mom would do that. She asked me what if they had passed out drunk and the uncle came up and did something to her? She didn't understand how mom could be selfish like that.. I told her to talk to Dad about all this. (They're divorced). I told her I was worried about her once me and my husband left, and to please consider moving in with dad or at least going over more frequently.. because mom, as much as she loves us, isn't well and doesn't want help for it. 


She did and decided she's moving in Tuesday for a month to try it out. She's still hurt with mom and has spent the weekend with dad too.. mom is furious that I 'put the idea in Shannon's head' and she agrees that my aunt should come and 'sock me in the jaw like the bitch I am'. Mom keeps insisting she's hollow without ""her Shannon"" and she 'cant believe I would do this over something so stupid'

292,"Im trying to start my career and figure out what is the best route to get to my goal. I've recently taken an interest into the National Guard when a guest speaker arrived in my Criminal Justice Vocational class.

I, being the only one in the class that signed the ""may we contact you?"" form, was contacted by a recruiter, My family and I met with this recruiter, and he talked about the same benefits that he told my class. My mom and step-dad seemed very interested and were proud of me that I wanted to join the National Guard, and frankly I am too.

2 weeks after the initial meeting, I got taped and weighed, and my waist length busted me over the limit, and I need to lose 12% of my body fat to be able to qualify for MEPS. Which at the time, didn't seem too much of a problem.

So, for my Xmas gift my parents booked me and my “best friend” a trip to DC. We’ve been on and off friends since 2011. We are both 18. They booked the Train and hostel. And we just came back yesterday. Parents don’t really like my friend (she made fake hate accounts about me years ago and secretly video recorded my entire family calling them white trash) but they didn’t want me to go with my boyfriend and they told me to pretty much babysit her before we went.

We Took a 17 hour train ride to DC from Chicago and stayed for 8 days. 

On the train - She wanted me to sleep in observation car so she could lay out in our seats. Gave me an attitude when I came back to seats. Got pissy because she brought too much luggage and had me pay for her extra suitcase. 
Kept going up and down aisles while others were sleeping. Inconsiderate and didn’t care. Kept bitching about no service and how she’s bored. I didn’t want to say anything because she’s argumentative as fuck. I was already annoyed on the train. She also kept calling me names and loudly announced how I need to stop sharting my pants and that I smell like an onion patch (neither are true she’s just being an obnoxious jerk).

We finally got to DC. 
She brought her speaker and She starts blasting explicit dirty rap music and porn complete with smacking noises and kept banging the headboard off the wall. You could hear the music from the elevator. When I told her to turn it down she told me to F off. She also opened the window and blasted the music and was looking for reactions from people on the streets. She also mooned people from the window and lifted up her bra and yelled t!tties in a man voice.  

I believe my friend also wiped her ass and smeared shit on the walls in the communal bathroom because it wasn’t there before she went in there (several times) Of course she denied it but that’s something she would do (she did gross things in the school bathroom before) Somebody also took a literal shit on the shower floor itself and there was poopy toilet paper in all the sinks. She was laughing. Absolutely disgusting. 

She kept talking in Australian accent through the hostel hallways and elevators and was yelling fck me baby, oh aching clitoris where are you, cum in my pussy, I got the strap on waiting in the room and just all these disgusting sexual things and thought it was hilarious. It was embarrassing. It was also at like 1 or 2am.

She also kept calling me a dumbass and just saying all this hateful stuff really loudly and I told her it’s rude and hurtful and she laughs and says she’s just joking and I said I’m starting to wonder. (I believe she thinks self deprecating is hilarious)

She also made us walk to Arlington in the middle of the night from dc. It was freezing cold and it hurt my lungs to breathe and she said “I don’t fkn care about you I’m gonna keep walking bye ya fkn loser” I was irritated.  

I had to keep paying for ubers the entire time when the metro was closed because she refused and I couldn’t leave her because if I don’t see her again my parents would’ve flipped. 

When she gets angry she will walk away and not answer her phone exactly why my parents told me to watch her and why I couldn’t say anything to her. 

She also made us stop at the pentagon when on the metro (to look at the memorial) at 10:30pm and I felt extremely uncomfortable. 

On day we were suppose to come home - She wouldn’t let me see the train tickets (physical copy) and kept talking about how she didn’t want to go back home before it was time to board. She told me the train left at 7:30pm (it left at 4:05pm) she didn’t get back until 6 and goes oh shit the train left and started laughing. My parents were furious that we missed the train and pretty much wasted their money.  My boyfriend paid for greyhound tickets back and my friend was saying how her mom would drive to dc and pick her up and told me to go myself. My boyfriend and parents bought her a ticket and my parents told me so help me if your friend doesn’t come back with you and I had to practically beg her to come back with me on the greyhound. 

Throughout the trip She kept yelling at me to leave her alone  and to stop watching her every move. We were at a restaurant and she moved tables and I was video calling my boyfriend and I look over and she left the entire restaurant. I started crying and panicking to my boyfriend and he said that my friend is an asshole and he felt really bad for me. I told him I couldn’t wait until the trip was over. My dad called and I explained what happened and he yelled at me to go look for her. Long story short she was outside the metro station a few streets down talking to someone and badmouthing me to them. She saw me and was like “oh look the annoying fuck decided to get off the phone with her middle eastern fkboy and followed me” I told her that is ignorant and she doesn’t even know him (they never met) and she said and I don’t want to know him he’s a controlling ahole (wtf?) 

We were at the air and space smithsonian and she left without me knowing and wouldn’t answer her phone. I got yelled at for not watching her and I better find her. Or police would get involved. I was crying at that point. 

She also got extremely angry that we left the hotel at like 2-3pm some days (because we were out all night) and she said we didn’t come to dc to sit in a hotel room all day. She was limping around dc because she hurt her leg (too much walking) and was still wanting to go on more forest marches. 

My parents got a $170 cleaning fee because she trashed the hotel room and they are making me pay it back because she’s my friend (but I didn’t trash the room). I also have to pay back for the greyhound tickets. 

This was my Christmas gift and I had a miserable time but my friend loved it and she’s now asking when we are going on another trip again. I left her on read. She has some nerve. I’ve been getting yelled at all weekend and scolded and she’s gotten nothing from her parents (probably because all they gave her was spending money and my parents paid for everything else).

TL;DR - my friend made our trip literal hell, she is extremely immature and I’m getting backlash from my family evenhough they booked the trip for us knowing how she is and there is so much that went wrong that I can’t write in a tldr so please read and give advice thank you",13Jan2020,1

Recently my sister (we will call her Shanon) asked me why I hate uncle so much, why I refuse to go to aunt Tiffanys house and I told her it was a fucked up reason, maybe she should ask mom. shanon said she had but mom kept lying and changing her story while encouraging her to not hate him just because I do and to go see him with my mother. 


So I told the bare minimum of the situation that had happened and to stay the hell away from him, and to call me if mom pulls that shit again


Well this weekend my mom and Tiffany got drunk. I mean they got super fucking drank and mom went down to talk to him.. when shanon found out she tried to talk to Tiffany about it because she was anxious as fuck and got yelled at for it. followed by Tiffany shooting said uncle a text telling him to come and drink with them... Which is when she finally called me to come get her because she was scared (and rightfully so.)  Tiffany screamed in her face basically until I got there 


I'm still fucking livid about it, I sped the whole way there. When I got there my sister was shaking and sobbing and mom decided to come home too.. the ENTIRE 30 Minute drive home our mom wailed about how she did nothing wrong, causing shanon to cry even harder. 


Once we got home mom tried again to tell me she did nothing wrong and I sorta spilt my guts. I told her this was INDEED wrong and hurt me on so many levels. I told her I can't possibly fathom how she could still want to see that monster and open the door for him to hurt my sister. She argued and insisted nothing happened and it didn't matter before going inside and ignoring me, or telling me again how nothing happened and I'm being dramatic and overreacting about it all and she did nothing wrong



After that I talked to Shannon for two hours about how sorry I was she had to find out about mom's issues like this. I told her mom loves her but shes a little twisted and it's not Shannon's fault, Mom was twisted since before either of us was born. She just couldn't believe mom would do that. She asked me what if they had passed out drunk and the uncle came up and did something to her? She didn't understand how mom could be selfish like that.. I told her to talk to Dad about all this. (They're divorced). I told her I was worried about her once me and my husband left, and to please consider moving in with dad or at least going over more frequently.. because mom, as much as she loves us, isn't well and doesn't want help for it. 


She did and decided she's moving in Tuesday for a month to try it out. She's still hurt with mom and has spent the weekend with dad too.. mom is furious that I 'put the idea in Shannon's head' and she agrees that my aunt should come and 'sock me in the jaw like the bitch I am'. Mom keeps insisting she's hollow without ""her Shannon"" and she 'cant believe I would do this over something so stupid' 


So Reddit, am I over reacting? What do I do at this point? Did I make the wrong choice? My mom has me so fucked up I don't know what to do I feel like I'm right but maybe there's a better way to go about all this. I did assure Shannon that I would always be here and support her no matter what choice she made...",13Jan2020,1
308,"So to start off this is something that is kind of weird and personal and iv'e really only mentioned this to a couple of people (parents and girlfriend) and its not something that's so serious I felt the need to get help on but this is a throwaway to talk about personal insecurities anyways so whatever.

For some context I am a 16 yr old guy and I honestly grew up in a kind of lonely childhood, my house was far away in the outskirts of town and there was nobody around or even a neighborhood around, I did see others at school and sometimes outside of school but my parents both having a busy work schedule meant that I would be alone a lot at home, and yes I did have a dog to play with but I took on this collection of stuffed animals mainly dolphins and such, for some reason I just connected with them and I would talk to them, me being really young this was not any concern but I am a grown ass 16 year old guy with school, friends, a girlfriend, and I still have a collection of stuffed animals sitting in my room, I just can't bring myself to throw them out since they where like childhood friends and its not a huge issue apart from the fact that I have a pile of 20 or so stuffed animals in my room and it looks really weird but its started to get to me, I don't find it to be all that strange, I know that adults even still have their fluffy childhood friends but its honestly kind of embarrassing as I don't really seem like the kind of guy to have a collection of stuffed animals (not that I am necessarily a chad or anything) Its just something weird for a teenage boy to have, I'm not sure what to do, I could just leave everything and not mind that I have them and still maybe talk to one every once in a while for nostalgia, or should I start trying to detach myself from them? I don't feel completely useless without them but I still worry about all of them and I worry that something will happen to them, is this weird? should I start to separate myself from them or just let them be? i'm not really sure if its even a problem and I just need to talk about this but thanks for reading anyways.",13Jan2020,1
309,"I [17M] have been struggling with procrastination for a while. Recently, it got worse. I’ve had big assignments and I would be thinking and making plans of what to do, yet, I don’t act on them. They have already piled on to the many works I’ll have to be doing currently. I will still be doing them despite being way, way, way, way overdue. Those zero marks don’t seem to scare me anymore.

I wouldn’t have much of a problem with smaller assignments but I now tend to cram them. When it comes to the bigger ones, I just felt like “nope” and I go on my phone watching or browsing social media or any other stuff away from assignments. Like, I can’t just do it. I always say to my mind that “I just have to do it” and such. I’ve already faced many negative consequences yet I’m still doing it. It’s like I’m avoiding it like how a child closes their eyes to “avoid seeing.”

Although occasionally, I will have a few (and sudden) moments where I would just feel like being productive. They tend to be crams but I feel so accomplished and relieved when those moments happen and I really do finish work. But it’s not enough.
And of course, not to mention the obligatory just-really-have-to-do-it crams that we all did when we procrastinate, but it feels quite different from the aforementioned moment.
Like a spell was chanted to make me productive rather than an extrinsically forced motivation.

I also procrastinate chores aside from school, but I have more control of them. But procrastinating school work is the most problematic thing for me. I would do chores quite easily and even have more of those “sudden feeling productive” moments but not even do school work.

I honestly don’t feel like telling this to my family. I feel like I would rather take this upon myself. I get annoyed at the thought of them pointing it out, yet, I wouldn’t mind if you tell me the obvious.

To give you a perspective:
I’m currently in grade 12, at the peak of my worse (yet.) In grade 9, I’ve had a few cramming moments, but I was still a lot productive. It gradually got worse, each school year, until I’m now at the “point of no return.”
I’ve had moments in my earlier years but I feel that these recent times are now more significant to look upon.

I don’t know if there’s a new habit I have to develop or if there’s another underlying problem or if it’s just the harsh “you just have to do it.”
I don’t wanna go on a too much rant but it’s just really my biggest problem. I feel like if I can overcome this, I can conquer everything.

Thank you for taking your time reading and replying!

p.s. I’m currently procrastinating and I have like 5 (big and small) school works to do to truly catch up, and due soon (not including the earlier mentioned big assignments). :/
And I have to worry about post-secondary applications due in a few days

311,"Realtors of reddit. Help me sell my house

I’m looking for any advice to get my house sold ASAP
It’s listed and the open house is Sunday. It’s priced to sell especially after all the updates I did to it. The only real issue I think I’ll have is some of the cosmetic issues, which the price reflects. (IMO) 

I already found my new home and my offer was accepted. Everything is contingent upon the sale of my current home.

312,"This is probably going to be quite long as there have been several incidents that I feel need to be included. 

So I’m in 11th grade currently about to finish my first semester. I have one class with this teacher and when I started the semester thought he was a really cool guy. He had approached me in the last month or two of 10th grade because he saw me with a camera around my neck. (His classes also include quite a bit of photography.) He asked to look at some of my shots and told me that I was quite talented. He asked me to add his class to my schedule as he absolutely wanted me in it. He mentioned it half a dozen times before the end of the school year. When this school year started I was unhappy about my schedule and told him. He got guidance to fix it and had me put in his class. I do enjoy his class but it involves a lot of photoshop. I suck at photoshop. I have almost no experience with it. Somehow I’m sitting at a 95 possibly higher in his class. I haven’t turned in half the assignments because I don’t know how to do them. He’s had me do lots of extra credit. I’ve taken photos at school events and helped him with organization in his classroom. 

When the semester started he told me repeatedly that he thought I was great and that if he had kids he hoped they’d be as great as I am. Those comments have stopped now. He’s made comments about my body. He’s told me that he likes my hips and that he thinks it’s fantastic that they fill out my jeans. He’s told me repeatedly that he thinks I could model and that I have a great figure. He keeps telling me that I look like I’m in my 20s and that older guys in their 30s and 40s must love that. (I get this a lot and it’s caused problems with older men before.) 

In our school district there’s a rule that states that teachers can’t date former students until two years after their graduation. He’a repeatedly told me that he’s counting down the days until he can date me legally. He knows full well that I have a boyfriend (M18). He’s told me what a great guy he is and that I should keep him around. He has and continues to make suggestive comments about me in front of my boyfriend and other friends. He doesn’t make comments like that about other girls in the class. 

He gives out his number to select students including myself. (This is against the rules but many teachers do the same thing). When he gave it to me he told me it was only for school purposes and not for personal use. When the comments about me being like his theoretical children stopped he also started to bend this rule. He’ll send me messages randomly. Often they’re not related to school at all. He’s also offered to go for coffee and take me to a restaurant that he thinks I’d like. 

The worst incident happened at the end of last week. I was in his class and accidentally brushed up against him. He told me that it had been a long time since he’d been with a woman and that I should be careful not to get him riled up. 

There’s many more stories I could tell but I am absolutely terrified of being more specific. I’m not ready to report him but I would like advice from others. I have spoken about it with my boyfriend and another friend but I don’t have an adult to speak to that won’t report it or absolutely freak out. As well as advice I was wondering if there were any adults willing to let me vent. I need someone with legitimate life experience that can give me advice. I really hope this doesn’t break the rules but I need someone to talk to that’s anonymous.",13Jan2020,1
313,"Hey, just a guy in a school, and I've been trying to improve myself everyday, and It's been going good. But there's this one problem I can't fucking remove from my idiotic useless brain, and that is being an Attention-Giver.

For example, I had a rash on my wrist, and I put a cast around it to make people feel bad for me or talk to me about the wrist, and I will be like ""no It's okay I'm fine"" to make them feel even worse. I really fucking hate it so much, but I just can't resist it, I need attention, but I know it's bad being that kind of a person.

315,"I’ve never been in a more amazing relationship. He’s my best friend of 5 years and we’ve been dating almost two. He has two kids. He was living on his own for 10+ years, but due to financial struggles had to move in with his dad and step mom. They are pompous assholes who wouldn’t even bother liking me, they are two faced but very blatant about it. His kids love me, I spend every weekday with them after school. His parents came home recently from vacation and told him (again) that I’m not allowed to spend any time at their house. Apparently, from the horses mouth, it’s because I get along too well with them and our family dynamic makes them ‘uncomfortable’. They make their house feel like a ‘family’. What the fuck is this shit. What do I do? I can’t spend any time with my boyfriend because he’s either working or taking care of his kids. I’ll have to bring them 20 minutes back to my house, and only spend an hour or so with them.

318," 

my step-sister is a huge fool since she abuses my mother.

I dunno what, but my mother has done nothing to her. She's always been pretty warm and open. but my step-sister spreads lies on her online. My step-father banned her from my mother's house since she causes undue stress and she's just a fool. and she never seems to visit her dad (not mine by blood.....take note...) and take the time to take him out or give him money. They all are pretty much wastes. I look at them, and they seem like a self-absorbed bunch. like there is a guy there who is of a similar age to me - and they invited me to their new years' party. and he never once spoke to HIS grandparents and just sat there playing with his phone and not saying much. And his grandparents have never much-abused him or anything.

how can I excuse and excise myself from the waste of a step-sister?",13Jan2020,1
319,"For starters, I (F20) have been seeing this guy (M19) for a couple of weeks now, and he, we’ll call him Chris, seemed super into me and I was also super into him. Today was our third date and we decided on going to this tabletop game cafe then dinner. While at the cafe, some random guy calls Chris’ name, and Chris looks super uncomfortable. I thought maybe they were friends and had a falling out of some sort, but I introduced myself. The guy was alone and was “waiting for his friends” and said he had “shown up half an hour early”. He asks to sit with us and suggests a game. I didn’t think anything of it and did not want to be rude, so I said sure. 

We play the game for about 15 minutes, and Chris excuses himself to go to the bathroom. I was talking to this other guy and asked, “oh, did you guys go to high school together?” He says no, so I ask how they met. Now here’s the real kicker: this guy says that him and Chris met in tinder. I think my expression changed because the guy got super uncomfortable and didn’t say anything else on the matter. Chris comes back from the restroom and then the guy excuses himself. Chris asks me if he told me how they met, and I just say yes. I was shocked. We play this game after the other guy gets back for about 15 minutes, and Chris and I escape (the guy’s friends never showed up either). We walk outside and I say “um can we talk?” 

So we talk for a couple of minutes and I just straight out ask him “are you bi?” I have nothing against this, I just was very much taken by surprise. Chris says no and that he met that guy a really long time ago when he was in a “dark place”. He seems really bothered and upset and so he says he’s just going to go home. I kind of just sit there in his car for a second and then get out. 

He gave me a hug and said he would text me but I haven’t received a text from him and this happened over 5 hours ago. I don’t even know how to process this. What should i ask him? I don’t want to pry as this was only our third date but, it was super weird? What should I do? Should I reach out or let him text me first?",13Jan2020,1

328,"This is a long one, I'm sorry.  


In 2015, I changed my major from Computer Science to English Literature and minored in Linguistics.  I had a plan, I would get an English degree and go to asia to teach for awhile and come back to pursue graduate school in some subfield of Linguistics. After all, my love of computers and programming was definitely more of a hobby. Game design and Hobbyist engineering was all I really wanted to program for and I could do that in my spare time. Linguistics... Linguistics has been a life long passion. I would get the degree, go to Japan and teach and come back to the states to keep going. Screw having the normal life I thought I wanted. The girl I was in love with didn't love me anymore and had broken up with me at the end of highschool two years before. I had to get away from my home town where i'd never wanted to leave and I had to reset somewhere far away. Japan had always interested me since I was young for the advanced tech, the gaming, and the Sengoku period of history. So I wanted to go there.   


I took a year of Japanese and even went to Kyoto in 2017 to go through intensive language training. My life was set on this course and the way I was doing it was optimized for plan A.   


But in 2016, I met a girl in a Christian geek facebook group. She was from South America and when she showed up in my inbox I honestly thought she was a bot. but, she wasn't she was real and the chemistry was almost instant. She lived about 3 hours away, since she was in the states for college. about a year after we started talking, She actually played her sport against my college, and I met her in person for the first time there. And even snuck into her hotel room and that was it. Our relationship was official. Few months pass and I leave for the summer in Japan mentioned above. I came back and our relationship continued. I'd go to her town, she'd come to mine. I met her family at her graduation, And she stayed in the states  for graduate school. Life went on, and I pretended like the ultimate choice in my life wasn't growing ever more eminent.  


Now, it's at a head. Let me say that I love this girl and she is without a doubt one of if not THE most amazing person I've ever met. She has her negatives, but I am still just as enamored with her as I was the day I first saw her eyes in person. I adore her. But in 2018, my stresses were becoming pretty high. I was nearing graduation, and I had no Plan B, I struggled to find one even. Looked up and down, and all around but couldn't find one. My physical limitations due to my palsy prevent me from any long term physical employment, the only job option to me in my one horse town where my degree is next to useless on its own. and my GPA took a hit from advanced math classes before the major change that it never recovered from.  


I was going to look for a job in Japan, but my sick grandfather deteriorated fast right around the time I would have needed to look. And I missed the deadline for his funeral and to stand by my family. I came home, and stalled the decision. I got a job delivering pizza for my cousin's pizza joint. And weighed my professional options. The only course was to enroll in my college's TESOL (Teaching English as a Second or Other Language) certificate program. With it My GPA would be reset and I'd be on my homefield of linguistics so I could raise my GPA to a 4.0 and then go to grad school off of that score. That's what I did. but the TESOL program encourages us to go ahead and get employed in that field or its next to worthless. I thought I was gonna have to go over seas for certain this time. but I got an offer from my college to be a Graduate Assistant to a professor. A position I got, but then the school reneged on the job after discover a regulation saying certificated Graduate students were ineligible (something not even the head of my department was aware of.) So I kept running Pizzas for a Year or so.  


And My relationship is getting rocky. The stress has caused me to be put on anti-depressants. I've become distant to my girlfriend, and honestly my mental state is declining. I'm a 26 y/o who was the first in my family to graduate college (my father was the first to graduate Highschool) but my degree is useless for where I live, my only work experience is my family farm and cousin's businesses. My girlfriend is from Venezuela but has a Chilean citizenship since her father is Chilean and her family fled Venezuela to Chile when she came here alone.  Her student visa runs out soon, and so does her graduate program, She'll have to go back to South America soon. She's hinted quite a few times and even flat out told me that if I asked to marry her she would say yes.  


But I'm falling apart. I can't afford to get married... I can't afford to have the children I want or take care of a wife. As it stand right now, there's no way I could support a family or even honestly myself. And I don't want that for my family, and I don't want a wife that has to take care of ME. growing up with a disability has made me FEAR being a burden on anyone and I strive to be able to pull my weight. and several other things here are driving me further down.  


I've looked for a job in the field stateside. It's the wrong time of year and I have nothing that stands out from the crowd Except a bunch of professors that adore me and want me to continue in Linguistics and would praise me to anyone for my talent there. And to be honest. I don't want to be Stateside. I don't want to settle down just yet where I'd never get to see the world. I can't get my summer in Japan out of my head and how good I felt being there on my own. A Southern farmboy lost in the city of Kyoto. But, she doesn't want to go to Asia and I don't blame her, and she doesn't want me to go to Asia either and I don't blame her for that either. Infact my entire family doesn't want me to leave. The only one truly supporting me in the decision is my Brother who's also the only member of my family who's ever left the country. My mama supports me too, but doesn't understand my want to go to another country especially since I was such a homebody growing up. And honestly unless they were in this immediate area somewhere near it would have the same effect due to her professional commitments.  


And now. I have Job offers from Korea. I haven't even told my girlfriend that I applied to them. I just wanted to see what offers I would get. And the closer I get to going. the better I feel about it... Untill I see her. and until I hear her voice and her laugh and everything about her.  


And now. I have Job offers from Korea. I haven't even told my girlfriend that I applied to them. I just wanted to see what offers I would get. And the closer I get to going. the better I feel about it... Until I see her. and until I hear her voice and her laugh and everything about her. I love her. I would marry her if I felt I was able and would be happy having her be the mother of my children in the town that I grew up. That's what I always wanted. Was to have a wife I adored, and have my children grow up where I did. To be surrounded by their family.  


But since leaving home. I finding it hard to want to come back and stay. I feel like I'm 26 and I'm just barely still young, I'm still free. I don't have any responsibilities and I can see the world and go on this adventure that I planned on since 2015. Then I come back and get my doctorate. and If I don't do it now, I'll be too old to get what I want out of it, and I'll regret it. I'll also have anchors set back here at home. And If I do... It will be the end of my relationship. I'll lose the most amazing girl I've ever laid eyes on, and I know it will crush her.  


I have a choice that will decide the rest of my life. and I have less than a few days to make it. Do I choose to pursue what I've always wanted my entire life with no real plan almost blindly, and almost certainly dooming me to a career I don't have any interest in... or, do I go with the plan I came up with and dedicated my whole academic career towards the one that has security, and also adventure. That let's me have the highest chance of playing out my career dreams and passions as well.

329,"I need some advice. I had some new neighbors move in to the apartment next to me, and they have a baby. The bedroom is unfortunately on the other side of my wall, so I can hear everything. 

I have gotten ZERO sleep the last couple weeks because the baby cries all hours of the night. I recently heard the parents screaming at the baby things like, “shut the fuck up, you have no reason to be crying” among many other rude and hurtful comments. I even hear what I believe to be slapping or spankings in coordination with the excessive crying, though I’m not 100% sure. 

Not only am I stressed, exhausted, and tired from the lack of sleep, but I am genuinely concerned about the well-being of the baby. I know it’s not the baby’s fault for crying, it’s what they do. However, I’m worried that the reason it cries so much is because of the potentially abusive parents. 

Is this a matter that I should bring to the police? Is there someone else I can call? Or should I just buy ear plugs and hope they figure everything out on their own? I’m really at a loss because I don’t know what to do, and I don’t necessarily have proof of the parent’s behavior other than what I’ve heard. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",13Jan2020,1
330,"Background: My ex (mid 20s, M, Buffalo, New York, USA) and I (mid 20s, F, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) met online and started dating in Sept 2018. He stole pictures of his childhood best friend (Long Island, New York, USA) from Instagram and created fake profiles (fake name, stolen pictures) as of ~Nov 2018 on Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid, and Match.com (as far as I know) to get women to sext with him. He sexted at work, at home, the second I walked out the door after visiting, etc.

When I caught him in August 2019, he admit it was at least one new woman a week for the whole year, on average. Often more. He deleted his throwaway email account and deleted all of the accounts on the dating apps. However, the friend whose pictures he stole had a screenshot of the Tinder account sent to him from friends who saw the profile. So that exists. He promised he would do anything to change and I wanted to believe him.

I stayed with him, took him to therapy, and tried to help him overcome what seemed like an addiction, because I truly loved him. I had lost my grandmother the same month this all came out and I was completely lost.

We broke up Nov 2019. I tried to get him to seek help, to be better, learn from his ways. He refused to speak to me. We cut ties after I attempted to reach out to him three times to no avail over the following 4 weeks.

In January 2020 I finally contacted his sisters. I told them the whole story, and they said they would figure out getting him help and asked me to stop talking about it. They must have reached out to him today as he contacted me today for the first time in a month threatening that I have harassed him non-stop for “3 months” (we were still together 3 months ago by his choosing...) and that he would have no option but to take me to court for harassment if I didn’t stop talking to his family. He messaged my brother the same thing, who was not involved in any way, shape, or form.

His family spoke to me willingly when I sent them the story/outline of events. Am I at any fault here? I truly believe I am not. I have the case file from therapy where he admit to the fake dating profiles so it is not defamation of character as I am telling the truth. He is American and I am Canadian, so I am also unsure of whether or not that has anything to do with anything. I just feel nauseous about the whole thing... His family asked me to send them the files. I have blocked him but now just want to move away from it all... but also want to pass on the files... please advise.",13Jan2020,1
331,"TLDR; I want a graduation party, my sister doesn't. 

My sister and I are both graduating from post-secondary education this year. Me from a 4 year university degree and my sister from a 2 year college degree. Nobody in our family has ever gone to post secondary school so it is a huge deal to our parents that we have accomplished this. A couple weeks ago my mom and I were talking about how fun it would be to do a combined graduation party at a local brewery for my sister and I (all costs on my parents). I was totally down for it but when I told my sister, she wasn't too hot on the idea.

Well yesterday my parents went for drinks at the brewery and my mom booked the party without any notice to me or my sister. I called my sister today to discuss it and she said she didn't want it. After prying, she said because she has a lot of friends and she wouldn't want to exclude anyone. This seems like a bullshit excuse to me because she is normally the type to want to party.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I'm fine if my sister doesn't want to have a party for her, but I'm not sure how reasonable it is for me to have a party if she doesn't. I will he inviting family and they may wonder why she also isn't being celebrated. My question to you all is: what are your thoughts on this situation and what would you do?",13Jan2020,1

It’s getting bad because now I’m questioning whose she’s texting or what name was that, and she shows me but she’s getting upset and today I did something that caused a huge fight. Some guy dmed her and I was curious, it turns out it was a gay guy her cousin knows asking her a question about a homework and she showed me and showed me his Instagram.

334,"So I have a 6 man friend group, we hang out every day at school and every single weekend. We get along well and are all alike but you can probably understand at times we can get on each others nerves and such. I however always overthink these instances and worry that my friends will stop liking me and kick me out of the group. We specifically had one instance where we trash talked over a game but it wasn’t personal. I however tried to lighten the mood by dumbly saying “just wanted to say you guys are my best friends so I hope the cod drama does make us grow apart”. This made them more annoyed because they said I was overthinking everything. I swear I’m pretty good with social skills but I can’t help but feel paranoid about making sure my friends like me. I just know if they stopped liking me I would have no one to hang out with during school or every weekend. I just always feel like they are talking bad behind my back or secretly don’t want me hanging with them even when there’s no evidence to support it. 

Does anyone else have this problem? I need advice on whether I’m overthinking this and how I should better deal with this anxiety.",13Jan2020,1

While I didn't always have feelings for her, I've slowly come to realize she's one of the funniest and friendliest people I know as well as being beautiful. Not in a model, way, but she is pretty, but her being is just someone I want to spend the most time out of the day with. I've tried working up the courage before, which is difficult as I've only dated one person before and was really brief, and my anxiety kicked in out of fear I'd ruin the relationship which is one of the most important constants I have in my life. Should I pursue this further, and if so, what do I even say. I worried she'd think I'm creepy or that I've never truly valued her when it wasn't the case.

337,"Hello Reddit, i'm currently 15 years old and I love the idea of becoming an animation director one day. I have many ideas that constantly keep me up at night, and I love drawing.

But after doing research in my spare time, I have found that being in the animation industry aren't really solid, and requires a lot of sacrifices just to land a small job. Then, I look on Reddit, seeing people talk about how people shouldn't follow their passion, and just look for the highest salary.

339,"Will an unauthorized atm transaction lead to someone being charged with a crime? But I want to file a police report for documentation purposes.

I’m worried that if I file the police report the police will investigate, it’s pretty clear cut since atms record photos, and the family member will find out.

But I want clear cut documentation in case it gets worse and I have to file a restraining order.

I've changed my number and blocked this person, but this person has begun to use other numbers to call me. I've marked all her emails as spam but she keeps creating new ones. Today she went to my ATM (I gave her my pin so she could deposit checks several months ago before our falling out) and withdrew money. In the past, she's waited outside of where I was staying despite begging her to leave and having to call the police. Not only does she support my family, but I've also done regrettable things that she could report me and send me to jail for. And I'm worried that she'll retaliate by bringing those things to light.  

**Maybe I'm scum and I have no reason to do these things. Things I've done.** 

**I used her social security information for student loans (parent plus loans) but it's because I have a high GPA in college and I'm a lucrative major, I figured I'll be able to pay her back and she wouldn't sign my FAFSA in high school till another family friend pressured her to do so, so I missed financial aide. I'm not changing my mind on this but I'm planning on getting scholarships to offset this.**

**She'd encourage my brother to start fights me, one weekend my brother started fights with me every day and she decided to hit me despite not hitting me in over 8 years. I slapped her back because I thought it was the only way to stand up to her and prevent her from hitting me more. I hate the idea of hitting my own mother and I know nothing can come of this since it wasn't documented.**

Please take my word, she'd do so many things that she and my family members would ignore or walkaround when I told them about it and I'd feel like I was the bad one and never tell anyone about them. 

After the day I slapped her, I started living with a family friend, then she'd contact them and they lost trust in my and she'd tell me things to make me lose trust in them. Then I used money from my internships to live on my own, came back to the city I was from after I ran out of money, before that I asked people if I could live with them and some said yes. But the person that said yes had a work trip so I lived with her for the first time in several months. Two days in we get into an argument after she lied about something and wouldn't talk about it and I go back to my habit of being spiteful and not communicating with people, and I decide to start sleeping in a homeless shelter and figuring out how to live on my own. Then my friend offered to let me stay with him. I had $76 in my bank account and when she withdrew it and I had to beg her to put it back it made me really scared because if I was living in a homeless shelter and she took away all my money, the time it would take to get it back or not get it back could have been devastating. **It feels like no matter what I'll do she'll find a way to ruin it or prevent me from doing it.** 

Since I started living with her since I was 7 dealings with her as been my biggest life struggle.

I feel like if I press charges she'll report me for identity theft in spite. So the next best thing is to begin to get documentation for a restraining order.

I'd tell my social worker from the homeless shelter about this but he's reaching out to people to help me and I'm afraid the identity theft part will prevent him from helping me.",13Jan2020,1
340,"Hello, so I've hopefully deleted some of my past posts when I wasn't in my ""right mind"". I have a mental illness and I am often in the hospital but I have to work hard to fake normalcy and often spend time hiding symptoms to stay out of there. For those of you who haven't been before, it's not pleasant. I am making it outside but barely. Once you go in the first time, it feels like the rest of society has it's eye on you to make sure you break again after you're out.

With that deeply personal matter aside, I need money. I graduated HS like most of my grade but gradually got worse and now I'm trapped.

I can't work in a normal retail environment, and I can't work normal hours. Medication doesn't work (I am resistant to it, I just experience side effects) and healthcare is too expensive, and therapy has done nothing for me even after thousands of hours of it. I'm naïve and I've been sort of cut off from the normal world for the past two years since then so as a result I'm continuously attracted to self employment, I keep thinking I can make it work but I run into legal boundaries and fees and costs for classes to train in something over and over.

My aim was and still is to employ myself somehow. I see people around me doing it all the time and I know it's difficult, it's not supposed to be easy, I am accepting that it is challenging, I have a lot of motivation towards certain things, but time is not on my side, money is not on my side, and no one will hire me anymore. I could go on all day with reasons why I struggle to keep jobs, but ultimately I need some way out of this. 

I've considered some kind of self-employed motorcycle repair business where I just put the number on the back of my own car in a sticker form, along with business cards, a website, and advertisements at my college board, or perhaps I can get back to an instrument I was particularly good at like the Cello and see if I can do something with that on YouTube. I compose for my instrument but I have hurdles to get through with that too, especially with privacy. I liked gardening at one point. I'm willing to take classes online, in person, or at my college if there's a way to employ myself, whatever works. But I am running out of time and looking at a lot more hospitalization/homelessness and honestly, just want to drive until I run out of gas and starve by that point. I like writing poetry and novels and would be able to do that consistently, I've written up to a thousand pages for that, but firstly publishing is a problem, and secondly, I don't know how to get patents or whatever you use to keep someone from just stealing everything I do.

So there must be a way out of this. I know so many people just struggle as it is, I'm not alone and maybe wanting to freelance the way I want to (online or in person with free hours and no employer) is too much to ask, but I see so many ways I could make it work if I could figure out how to do it properly. Any advice for fixing this situation? I might delete this post for safety reasons but I appreciate any helpful advice.",13Jan2020,1
341,"Thanks for reading and for any opinions/advice, sorry for any poor typing skills I'm at work on mobile. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible, I (21m), met a girl (19f) off tinder a year ago and she moved in with me 3 months after. Everything was perfect, we both agreed what we had was a once in a lifetime connection so I didn't mind moving to her hometown away from mine, she wanted to. She introduced me to her family, we talked about kids, life, death, blah blah blah. Well a couple months ago she wakes up and decided to break up with me over a trivial argument. Instead of apologizing, she doubled down and went back on tinder, got fired from her job, and snuck people inside our house at night and told the landlord they were taking over her lease. When it didn't work she got mad and tried to steal my phone so I couldnt uber to work to pay the bills she was leaving me with. She hit me twice and the landlord had to evict her on the spot and the two random people. All this happened in one day for context. Anyways, her mom has been there for me throughout this whole process. I couldn't comprehend that we were each other's first everything, and in a week she's hooking up with guys on tinder after almost literally making me homeless. I truly don't think I would still be alive right now if it wasn't for her mom. Her mom helped me get to work when I couldn't afford Uber, fed me, invited me over on Thanksgiving and Christmas. She let me cry my heart out into her chest until I couldnt. I know there's no way I can repay her but I'm moving states away and I don't know if I'll see her again, what kind of gift could I get her that might show I appreciated everything she did?

A few days pass where we are just casually chit-chatting, and she asks, “So what do you even do” and I told her where I work. She said, “No, not your job. Like what do you do for hobbies”

I was honest and said that between work and school, I don’t have time for much aside from YouTube and videogames. She said “ok” and I thought it was no big deal, but then she tells me how it’s weird that I don’t do anything at all outside of work.

I told her that most people don’t have time for anything because we’re all so busy these days, and then she said “I don’t think this is going to work”. I pried and asked her why she thought that, and eventually she just straight-up said, “You sound boring”.

How am I supposed to respond to that? I really do not have much time or energy outside of work, and I can’t just magically conjure an interesting hobby out of thin air. Like wtf am I supposed to do?

343,"I came to my work building early (around an hour to an hour and a half) and was wearing my staff shirt, I was also wearing a plaid shirt sort of like a jacket. I'm technically not supposed to wear it off-shift, but it's a Sunday, the building is pretty much empty and I'm staying in an area that really only has our people working (with the exception of two non-staff students). 

It wasn't allowed and I know now that I shouldn't have done it, but I didn't think it was that harmful at the time because the area I was in was very low-populated.

One of my managers sees me wearing it and I try to explain but he's busy. He messages me on our chat app very directly in a way that I felt came off as annoyed or even frustrated. (I'm not going to post the chatlogs because they're obviously private, so really just give me the benefit of the doubt.)

He ends the message with ""I thought we had covered that in staff training"", which in all honesty, made me feel really shitty. He's a good guy and I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, but I feel guilt *strongly.* It's deeply embedded in me that I'm fundamentally not a good person and even situations like this can reinforce that feeling.

Basically I've been worried about my sister-in-law who married my abusive brother a while back. When he came home to live with me and my mother a while back he was a total power freak. If he wasn't exploding into fits of rage then he was gaslighting the hell out of me, drilling into my head that I was inferior and didn't deserve any basic human respect because I'm younger and haven't accomplished his (relatively minor) accomplishments. He never physically struck me but frequently threatened and intimidated me, always seeming like he'd get around to it eventually. One of the biggest things that still upsets me today is the time he shot my dog with a pump pistol (after I asked him not to) and drew blood from 15 feet, then let him loose around the neighborhood (after I asked him not to) and then took me for a walk explaining that it was my fault for being a bad dog owner. I'm still working on identifying and undoing the damage he's done in the year since he's left, but going basically no-contact with him has been really nice and has improved my life in more ways than I ever would have expected.
But that's not what I'm here to talk about.
My brother and my sister-in-law both live in another state halfway across the country now that he's joined the Air Force. Their relationship was really shaky/off-and-on before they got suddenly got hitched right after his tech school graduation. I don't use Facebook, but it was pointed out to me by my family that she's been posting some fairly concerning things (in my eyes, at least). A lot of empowerment memes about not putting up with assholes and stuff like that. She also recently announced that she's going back to school to become a therapist.
I don't know her that well even though she kind of lived with us for a bit while my brother did. But I'm having a hard time believing that there *isn't* something bad going on. I know it's not the norm to butt into people's business in this way. It's also true that I've developed a tendency to be paranoid. But I practically couldn't live with myself if I found out that he's being just as toxic to her as he was to me and I never reached out. On the other hand, maybe she doesn't think anything's wrong and my brother finds out I contacted her and a ton of drama ensues. Or maybe everything is fine and the Air Force has helped him get better.
It's unanimously agreed in my extended family that there must be something fishy going on over there, but nobody wants to reach out and ask. I think I do want to reach out to her, and her alone, but I'm unsure of how to do it. Both in method of contact and in delicate word choice.

355,"I’ve been in a rut before. Many times actually. High school, college, even recently as an adult. There is a feeling of confusion, lack of purpose, and general wonder on where you’re headed. Don’t panic, this is normal. Life is confusing and wonderful and terrifying and beautiful at the same time. Ya can’t have a peak without a valley, and sometimes you spend more time in the valley than at the peak. That’s okay. 

My rut-busting advice is simple: Take inventory. Document all that you have in your life. You’ll quickly learn that maybe your rut is just a small divot, easily isolated and healed by some minor changes. Don’t let it consume you. In the end it all works out. It’s just temporary. But you have to be willing to go out and fix it.

I hope this post is found someday by someone looking for guidance on what to do when they just don’t know what to do. You’re not alone in this, trust me. Sometimes just knowing others feel the same way can make all the difference.

361,"In September, a black small Honda started appearing in front of my house every day in the early hours of the morning (5:45-6:45 am). The same time, every single day. Every day they would park on the street a few feet from my mailbox, directly across the yard from my front door. 
I’m a high school student and this is the time I go to school. For a while, my mom drove me because I wasn’t sure about the bus. The strange car was not necessarily a concern. 
Then, my mom started to work and my dad was out of the country. So, my first day taking the bus I stepped out of my house, called a friend, to talk with on the way there. As I walked down the street towards the bus stop, I heard the car start up. My blood ran cold. The car was moving very slowly behind me. Shit. I started running, with my 15 pound backpack most definitely weighing me down. Thankfully, one of my neighbors turned into my street to wait with their elementary school kid for their bus. I was good.
Needless to say, I didn’t take the bus after that. But the car moved locations too. It no longer stood in front of our house. In November it switched locations. Now it stood parked at the edge of our street, right next to my bus stop. Whenever we drove by, we looked in, hoping to see who was in there. The dimmed dark windows revealed nothing. Sometimes there were two people, sometimes just one. But every time, we could see the outline of a shining phone screen in their lap. 
I am not sure if I should contact the police to come check this out. It has become a slight concern and very worrisome. Should I confront them myself?",13Jan2020,1

364,"It's exactly what the title says: I don't feel worthy of love.

I got diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Clinical Depression when I was 11. I have lovely parents, have never been severely bullied, and while I am a lesbian I've never received much backlash for it, so my guess is that I have poor mental health because of genetics (also cause my dad has anxiety.) I've taken tons of medicine, have had a lot of therapy, and a great support system, but for some reason I can't stop absolutely hating myself, and this self hatred has been especially bad this past week.

It's gotten so bad that I've literally made a list of all the things I hate about myself just to get it all out of my system so I don't say anything to worry my friends or family by accidentally mentioning it. I've done some really shitty things to them, but for some reason they've all decided to forgive me for it. No matter how awfully I used to treat them, they've forgiven me. The worst offender is my friend who we'll call Ethan. I've done some awful things to Ethan, yet he still regards me as his best friend and constantly reminds me how much he loves me. I know I'm not the same person I used to be, but I don't think they should forgive me for them. Maybe thats dumb? I don't know, I'm a wreck right now and its almost midnight.

TL;DR I have so many people who love me but I feel awful about it because I don't feel like I deserve it.",13Jan2020,1
365,"I'm (19M) currently doing my bachelor's degree in engineering. I've been sort of struggling with some stuff since the start of 2019. I lost my dog, my best friend committed suicide, and some other relationship problems that I'd rather not talk about, things got progressively worse after that. I tried committing suicide as well until a certain incident made me realize what I was about to do to myself and everyone around me. I still have bad days but it's not as grim as before. I'm at least able to hold myself together.

But that's not why I'm here, I frequently suffer from sleep paralysis (for those who don't know, it happens sometimes when I go to sleep or wake up, my mind feels disconnected from the body, I feel as if I'm conscious but I don't have any control of my body whatsoever. I can't move or speak or anything at all.)

The problem here is that I sort of see things that I can't explain during that time, the line between reality and hallucination become sort of blurry. And it's generally followed by paranoia. I feel as if I'm about to die. It's just scary. And too much to handle sometimes, so much so that I just don't want to sleep at all. And that's where the problems start. My attention span is getting shorter because of that lack of sleep, I can't focus. I can't remember important details or the previous conversations I had with someone. Which lead to some people (who I really cared about) leaving me for good. I am unable to study or maintain relationships or do anything for that matter. I feel tired all day, and feel a lot more anxious and a lot less confident while holding a conversation.

I wanted to seek professional help but it's gonna be difficult to afford and visit them considering the fact that I live alone in a different state from my family.

How can I deal with this situation? (I've tried fixing my sleep schedule and all those hygiene practices. Eating properly and stuff, nothing seems to work.) Keeping in mind that I can't regularly attend therapy or any treatment that either requires me to take time off or something that I can't afford. I'd really appreciate any help/advice I could get. Thanks.

366,"My best friend is recently engaged and she said her and her fiancée are planning to get married at the courthouse with family only. I never imagined not being there for her on her special day and I’m feeling sad that she’s decided to exclude her close friends especially when her and the fiancée tend to speak negatively about his parents. They don’t have a ton of friends/family so it’s not like they want to keep it small by only having family. This makes it worse in my opinion she doesn’t want my support in person.

We’ve known each other since preschool and she was recently in my wedding as a bridesmaid just a few months prior. I’m not sure how to explain to her that I’m hurt that she wouldn’t want me there to support her. In the past when she talked about future wedding stuff  it never seemed in the plans that she’d be doing family only and at a courthouse. I have a weird feeling that her fiancée may have something to do about it but I can only assume and I don’t want to ruffle feathers by prodding. I understand that its their day and I want to respect that but I also want to let her know that it hurts my feelings and honestly makes me feel like I’m not as a good as a friend to her as I thought I was.

367,"Hey guys, 

I'm in college, and for some reason if I sit somewhere people look at me and find another seat. When class starts, I look around and people sit everywhere except near me.

I'm also doing track for my college. It's my 2nd year doing it. Whenever we travel for a meet and load up the travel vans,  people look at me and sit in the back. My row is empty. So then the next time, I sit in the back, again, they look at me and everyone sits up front, and im by myself.

Also when I'm in the locker room and it's me and another teammate,  they dont want to talk to me. I try to talk to them but they give short answers, almost like they WANT me to be quiet. 

I feel people think I'm weird, I dont know why. I dont know what I did wrong. Everyone does this to me. I barely have anyone to talk to. People avoid me, and if they talk to me, they give no attention or short answers.

Any advice on why this is happening to me?",13Jan2020,1

370,"Hello, Im not quite sure how to start with this since im very new to actually posting on Reddit.

My basic current situation is that I am a 20 y/o college student who feels as though I am treated incorrectly for my age. ( Dont get me wrong I dont see being 20 as being extrememly grown up, but I feel like im at the point where I should be atleast granted some freedom ) My mother constantly attempts to control where I go, and who I see. I do live at home because I am thankfully able too since I am going to college, and was working full time ( I quit my management job about a month ago because of an intense amount of work place harassment. Im currently going through applications and interview processes for other establishments) I have considered moving out a few times, but am seriously considering it now because of the way I am treated. 

About a month ago, around the time I quit my job my mother made me download life360 on my phone and constantly harasses me If I go anywhere other then exactly where I tell her im going to go. Along with this I am dating a 31 y/o (M) My mom does not approve because of the age difference. He is nothing but kind to me, and she constantly threatens that If I end up having a relationship with him (she denies the fact that we are dating) or even seeing him she will never let me hang around the family( hasn't commented that she would kick me out, but possibility) . He has done nothing to turn my mother away from him, in the begging of us just being friends she had many friendly conversations with him. Along with this my mother has ended up telling me that I shouldn't be talking or hanging out with anyone in general because I need to ""learn how to be alone and work on myself."" Every time I go out, even if its for a college project she hounds me to tell her exactly what I did as if I was out doing illegal things. Its gotten to the point where I dont even want to leave my house because I know I will come back home to many questions and more often then not yelling. 

I have had conversations before with her about how she puts me into positions where I feel like she is always judging me, and she makes me feel like I can never get her approval. She denies these things, and then once went onto tell me that since I am the oldest she thinks she holds my actions closer to her. Which I can tell through my younger sister 18 y/o (F). My sister is able to basically break rules and have her boyfriend at our house, or be out way past the designated curfew. Yes I am 20, and still have a curfew, which I cant even use since I cant go out. ( 10:30 Sun-Thur / 12:00 Fri+Sat)

Back to the boyfriend ordeal. Anytime I go out, she always texts me repeatedly asking if im with him, or if im lying about my where abouts. She will tell me exactly where I am on my life360 app and accuse me of actualy seeing him when im not. I will admit I have ended up bringing him along to events with my friends because I want to see him. But there are many times It has just been me and a friend. Am I wrong for bringing him along?

I want to be able to have a relationship with my mother where she trusts me and im able to grow into an adult. But I strongly believe she is holding me back, I don't want to have to move out because I enjoy being able to save money from work so college doesn't throw me into debt. I dont pay rent at my house but I help pay for house hold repairs / yard work. Its just my mom, sister, and I in the house so i feel like my mom may just be holding on to me strongly because she doesnt want me to grow up and make my own decisions. But like I said I feel like im really being held back.

The main thing that effects me is the fact that I cannot see my s/o. He is my best friend and we talk everyday, he has said it feels as though we are in a long distance relation ship even though we live in the same area. Also a side note on that. About a month ago my mom banned him from coming to my house because he stopped by a day she was not home and did not approve of him coming into my house without her around. I thought this was ridiculous because my younger sisters boyfriend is around all the time when my mom or me is not around. 

My mother has never fully trusted me, and im not 100% sure where that is rooted from, but I honestly just dont know how to talk to her at this point because it always just comes back to her screaming at me. Im not sure if I should move out. I would move out with my s/o, but she directly said if I do that she would basically disown me from the family. I care about my moms opinion a lot, but I honestly think she is tearing me down too much.

TL;DR My mom tracks me and doesnt want me to see my boy friend or friends because she wants me to learn how to be alone and doesnt trust me.",13Jan2020,1
371,"I’m a trans guy and I have a crush on a gay cis guy. We’ll call him Guy. Guy is super chill and I’ve liked him for a bit now. I’ve never been good at taking the initiative when it comes to crushes so I’ve kind of just bottled it up until now and I want to ask him out. 

I’m afraid he won’t want to date me since I am pre-t and pre-op. 

Normally I wouldn’t worry too much because if he doesn’t like me for the fact that I’m trans then it was never a possibility in the first place.

373,"So a bit of background: 

I’m about to enter my second semester of college, and so far I’ve been commuting between home and school. It’s only about 45 minutes away (this is normal for where I live), and I enjoy the drive because I get some downtime. Anyway, my mom thinks it would do me good to try living in a dorm since she never stayed on campus when she was in college, and she regrets it. I don’t really find the idea appealing for a few reasons.

1.) Room and board is so expensive (like almost as much as tuition), and I have a hard time justifying spending that much on living quarters. 

2.) I tend to be pretty introverted, so I like having my own space. I’m also not the neatest person, so I feel like I would be a horrible roommate. 

3.) Family has been and always will be my number 1 priority, so I highly value time with my family. School is a close second, but since I can do it while living at home, I get the best of both worlds.

another time i noticed this after he upset me pretty bad and i said i didnt want to talk anymore. later on after i cooled off i tried to text him (imessage) and my text never said delivered so i knew. i dont think too hard on this cause it makes sense. he was expecting us not to talk again.

things have been good and we were texting a little bit. but out of nowhere about three weeks ago my messages no longer showed delivered. from time to time i would get a text from him. but by the time i tried replying it didnt deliver. he still denies ever blocking but i know hes lying. one time my texts werent delivering, he said he had to ""do something"" then told me to try again. THEN it delivered.

this happened last night too. my texts stopped delivering but i kept getting calls from him hrs apart. i tried calling back a few hrs late and got no answer. but he called while i was by my phone so i answer and he told me to text him. i said ""i did but you werent texting back"" he said ""do it again. i didnt get it thats why i wasnt responding."" i text him and BOOM. delivered. i say ""you had me blocked."" he didnt say anything, just hung up and texted me like usual.

I’ve been working in a managerial position at a small company for a little over a year now. About 6 months ago I started having a lot of issues with an employee who I directly manage. The company hired me for my expertise in FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing because they need to tighten up to pass audits and regulatory compliance. With these regs I had to implement a ton of changes especially on the sanitary side. I’ve explained and trained multiple times on new ways to do these things and one of my employees just refuses and continues to take shortcuts. He doesn’t respect me for some reason and doesn’t feel he needs to listen. He has gotten in my face abrasively and yelled at me to the point where I just had to go home. This has happened 5-6 times now. I’ve told hr and the ceo multiple times of the problems I am having with the guy. In a sit down meeting trying to hash out how we can make it work, the ceo told him yelling and screaming was okay as long as it didn’t come to physical violence. I was shocked that they didn’t have my back. 

Come to find out this guy has been addicted to pills and that’s what caused his outbursts and angry mood swings. Hr and ceo both know of this. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but again the other day I asked him to put his cap on in a hygienic zone and he freaked out on me and told me not to micro manage him and puffed his chest out while in my face aggressively. 

Because of all this, about 4-5 months ago I started getting really bad anxiety/depression and having panic attacks. I’ve lost almost 40 lbs since starting the job and my anxiety/depression have gotten to the point that I’ve had to seek therapy because I was afraid I might take my own life at one point. Since seeing a therapist, I’m doing better, but going to work is really hard on me. I’m afraid to say the wrong thing even though it is my job to make sure we are in compliance with the rules. 

This guy also smokes weed all day in the parking at work. While I’m not against pot, I don’t agree with getting high while at work ( at least not in a manufacturing setting)he’s always forgetting things and I have to do 10x the work just to make up for stuff he forgets. Ive also brought all these points up to hr and my ceo while asking for a raise and I was denied.

389,"Hello, and forgive me if I overlook anything: Here goes...

I'm a 20M living in Washington. A couple months ago I went through a nasty breakup that left me utterly heartbroken and feeling lost as to what I want to pursue. I live with my parents as of right now (whom I'm very close with), and am currently unemployed (have some savings from previous job that allows me to cover my bills), I'm an avid PC gamer and have a very close knit friend group from that community (I swear I'm not getting off track, bear with me). In my current city in Washington, I don't really have any friends here nor do I know what career path I'd like to look into (so I'm not very interested in school atm). One of my online friends is VERY wealthy, his family owns their own very successful business through the states of California and Nevada. This friend has serious health issues that makes everyday life quite a challenge for him. He's offered me a job where I'd live in with him (no cost of living, everything would be covered) in California, basically fulfilling the jobs of an assistant. I would lend a hand with housework, drive him around on his bad days, cook when needed, and overlook some of his finance stuff. This position would pay me FAR more than I could make working full time in my home state ($16k more annually) and I wouldn't have shitty hours as I've previously had here. I have more friends than just this potential employer in the state of California as well (online friends who I've known for years and would love to regularly hang out in person) which makes it seem as though I could be much happier down there, as I've been feeling very lonely in my hometown...

Moving two states away for my first time living on my own is a daunting feat, but the pros from this decision are VERY tempting. It's a major life decision and I'd love the opinions of some dear internet strangers. I've done ally research in regards to monthly costs I'd contend with (health insurance/car insurance/gas/car upkeep/etc.) and it's very much doable. My family (whom I previously mentioned I'm very close with) are of the opinion that I should stay in my hometown, and look into getting full time work,  making friends in due time. From my point of view, why should I grind away 40+ hours a week for minimum wage pay here in my hometown, when I could be making far more for less hours alongside friends I already have in California? My parents aren't the assholes that would forbid me from coming home if I make a mistake. They've made it very clear that if things don't work out in California, they'll have my back and I can just come home and try to work something else out.

401,I am a sophomore in college at the moment. Last semester I got bad grades and got academically dismissed from my university. My fraternity allows me to stay if I goto the community college in the area so I did so. (this is a good time to add that my fraternity/school is around 3 hours away from my home) Now that the semester is starting I am starting to get home sick and am having second thoughts. I have never felt like this while being at college. I am conflicted on what I want for my future or what I want to do anymore.

402,"A couple of months ago, I (F 21) started noticing that I don't handle stress and anxiety like I used to. Now, when I get stressed or anxious, I get really bad headaches, I feel like fainting, my heart races and the number of anxiety attacks went through the roof! The worst anxiety attack was when I was sitting in my living room with my family and I started feeling my heart pump really fast and hard. My deep breathing was not helping and I started to see colors. My chest was really hurting and I was scared to get off the couch since it felt like I would pass out. I was sweating and it was getting hard to breath. I told my family and they thought I was over-reacting, but after 10 minutes of this, they took me to the ER. The doctors concluded that it was a severe anxiety attack and said that school and work was the reason for it. I knew they was wrong since I always feel anxious all the time, and even paranoid. After attending some therapy sessions, they concluded that I have the early stages of G.A.D (General Anxiety Disorder) and depression. But it's not too severe so they didn't prescribe me medicine. Only a small dose of some pills to help me with my anxiety attacks. I saw the shock on my parents' faces when the doctors were explaining this to them and I felt so terrible. I felt like a monster ..   


It's been like 5 months since that happened and I am still in denial that I have depression and GAD. And I don't want to bring this up to my family because I know they're going to accuse me of making this stuff up in my head again. My parents are very old-school and they don't believe in mental illness. They think a good night sleep, soothing tea, and some good food will make all my anxiety and sadness disappear. But it doesn't, but I still follow their steps so they can see that I'm trying. I want to be happy again. I want to feel that spark  that makes me really smile. I want to have a good night's sleep and wake up refreshed. I don't feel as sad and depressed anymore but with the spring semester starting soon, I'm scared of my anxiety coming back and taking over my life again. School isn't stressful but it's my surroundings that scare the life out of me. I get anxious when I walk to class, when I drive, when I eat at the cafeteria, when I order something from Starbucks, or anything!  I want to stay home and never leave my room. And I don't have trusting friends to tell them these things and how I feel (which is why I am here on reddit all the time). I'm in a relationship and I tell them all the time on how I feel but I feel like I'm being annoying so I stopped talking about it.   


I wish I can go back in time where I can drink an energy drink without the anxiety attack, I wish to smile and sing while I'm driving to school and back, I wish to feel what a smile REALLY feels like, and I want to be able to live my life happily. I see so many people around me being happy, laughing, and smiling all day and that makes me so angry! Why are they happy? Why can they feel happiness and I can't? Why am I like this? Why did this have to happen to me? I want to be happy! I see selfish people feel happiness all the time and they take advantage of that everyday! There are people like me who can't feel that and wish to feel that warmth when you smile.  But I will end it there! I am trying everyday to be happy! 2020 will be my year! I want to improve but I don't know what I can do to start my progress. Taking pills is easy but what can I do to be happier?",13Jan2020,1

Aside from all that, I’ve just been an overall negative person to people who purposefully do me wrong, even to the unhealthy point where I’m willing to suffer a little bit in certain circumstances if it makes them suffer too. I’m legitimately repulsed by this and I know it’s not right and want to try different ways to get back to my previous mental state before all of this where I would let go of things much easier.

I live in a small dorm at a university, and my roommates are pretty much never here (they probably stay at their girlfriends' place most of the time). I go out every day, and I am thankful to have a close group of friends here, but even being alone for a few hours in my dorm causes me to go insane. I get extremely anxious, and I can't stop my leg from bouncing. Being alone makes me think about the past - I can't stop thinking about a break-up I had more than a year ago, and how I'm never going to find love again, how I'm ugly and how toxic my high school friends are and how no one ever respected me. I'm not suicidal but I'm worried I'm starting to go insane.

For the past several days I've been thinking about just biking away, I don't know where to, but just away. I feel like leaving because I almost can't take this anymore. I don't have any motivation to do any work, because any bit of work is very stressful for whatever reason. Recently, I've also started fantasizing about becoming famous to get back at everyone who made me feel lesser than, and I couldn't help but notice that for a few segments of the day yesterday I felt like I was on top of the world, and that I was superior and that I could do anything. I'm worried about this because I've really never felt like this before. I've struggled with low self-esteem for a very long time, but this is the first time I had such high self-esteem that I felt like I was superior to everyone around me. It's getting hard to sit for an hour each class, because I get very anxious and I keep having this instinct of running away. I have been going to therapy, which is provided for by the school, but the therapists are only available once every 3 weeks, and since I just had winter break I haven't seen my therapist for a month.

I’ve got an exciting and fulfilling career waiting for me when I graduate and I’m so excited about my life moving forward, but to be brutally honest, I’m not sure if she fits in it. 

In the intervening years she’s dropped out of the college where we met multiple times before finally starting an online degree. She’s moved from rubbish job to rubbish job, lives in a pretty awful town where she and her partner basically never go out and just stay in watching TV. I know money is fairly tight for them but I think it’s more an attitude thing - they just don’t DO much. 

Every passing year I feel like our lives and our trajectories get further and further apart. When I visit her I have fun, and I know she doesn’t have many friends so I feel guilty about leaving her, but she doesn’t really challenge or interest me a whole lot, and I don’t feel like she has much to teach me? 

When I look at my other friends, they have such drive and motivation, I like my friends to push me to be a better version of myself, to inspire me a bit. I’m aware it’s cheesy, but you know that saying that you the are the sum total of the five people you spend most time with? Well, I believe it. 

I feel I should add here that’s she’s an incredibly kind and caring person, generous to a fault. I wish her well in life, I just don’t feel like she adds much to mine anymore. My plan was basically to just taper off talking to her over the next year, but I’d like to hear thoughts on this.

420,"Heyo. Little background info, I guess. I'm M19. I go to community college. Work a part-time job, and feel like I'm unnecessarily money tight for my age. I know how and when to spend money is rather subjective, and ultimately, I do spend money on myself. I buy food every so often, buy myself something nice once in a while, and bought my Mom a iPhone 11 for her birthday (Well, put it on my credit card, as I wanna build credit) 

But apart from those irregular purchases, I don't buy myself anything nice, I guess. Since I've started working about 1 and 3 months ago, I've personally saved about $10,000. To me, this seems like a lot. I'm expecting to get another 5ish within the next 3 months. All this money also justs sits with me. I have no idea how and where to invest it (I'm taking finance-related college courses this semester to learn/my major) From my part-time job, I bring maybe 150-300 a weakish (part-time, min wage) and like to think I save 90% if not more.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a good thing im this money-saving focused at such a young age? As I said, I do buy myself stuff here and there. But I have plenty of days where I kinda use aimlessly walk around the mall and don't buy myself anything. And there's lots of stuff I could and would want, but could never see myself buying it. Maybe my self worth is too low, idk. I do come from a rather poor family, and I guess the idea of having a house downpayment ready out of college sounds sweet to me. (I won't be having any student debt thanks to Community college and some sponsorships ill be getting for my local state school)

Is my mentally good at such an age? Everyone my age looks like they blow their money on whatever they want, and they sure look happy. I do even want to consider taking my mom on a vacation, as she has never been on a real one her entire life. Am I good? Should I be happy I have such restraint?

423,"I severely limited my career path bc my parents need help financially (but I've been building networks here from scratch and building some stuff to increase my chances of getting hired in the path I was trained for); my dad was gone most of the time in the last 10 years and my mom is doing labor intensive work (they're in their late 60s now). She still has to work some bc I'm not at a place yet where I can cover everything. I made the choice bc I know she sacrificed a lot for me so I know I owe a lot of debt and gratitude to her (e.g., I was an unwanted pregnancy, which led them to get married (it was the 80s in a more conservative country); in which, especially when I was younger through hs, he'd physically and verbally abuse her and she stayed bc of me; she had to get an abortion of my potential younger sibling bc I took up too much of the little finances they had; they made sure I had better primary education, etc etc.). I've been trying to look at it as something that I'm choosing to do bc I really believe that I owe them, especially my mom. But something happened where I realized that I'm not really worth much to them right now. My dad came back home - this is the longest he's stayed (over a month) in the last four years. Out of nowhere, he wanted to buy a used car so he could drive around instead of taking taxis (but he's leaving in a few weeks). Then my mom wanted me to talk to him about it (I dunno why), and I tried to talk him out of it. Then some how, he started accusing my mom of trying to steal from him and his business and verbally assaulting her, so I intervened, devolving into him calling me things and putting his hand on my neck, physically threatening to punch me and pushing me, and me pushing him back and yelling at him. I was the only one that had little scrapes (only in a few places). Which isn't a big deal (truly). My mom ran to the other room and didn't help me at the time or say anything to him, which I found disappointing but I tried to understand (bc I'm not like a kid, right? I've seen him abuse her). Then later, he told my mom that I'm a mistake/failure in his life bc I called him things after he put his hands on my neck and pushing me, etc., to which she responded with how he shouldn't say that. Which I guess is the best I should hope for in the situation. Then today, he asked her to go eat with him so he could ""apologize"" and she accepted both the invitation and apology (which again, I get and don't get). I asked her why she'd do that when she knows he tried to choke me and was otherwise verbally and physically abusive the other day. Then she said, ""You know you're not the only one he has done that to."" Since I was young, I always tried to be understanding of her physical and verbal abuse with me bc she was stressed from my dad. But for some reason, I always thought she'd have my back when it got like this. I guess I'm just sad that I was so wrong. I just want everything to end sooner than later. But what should I do next (aside from a therapist bc my insurance does not cover)? Do I stay and continue supporting them or secretly save some of my earnings to leave? If I leave, do I let them know where I'm going? How can I quickly get over this and not sad? Anyway, if you've made it to the end, thanks for reading all this dumb ramble.",13Jan2020,1
424,"We were together for 3.5 years, high school sweet hearts and in a long distance relationship.  We were an awesome couple with very minor issues all around, she got an amazing internship that would allow her to move to a place that we both love, and would have free housing for a year. (Important info for later) She went to study abroad and had an internship last year (combined 28 weeks spring/summer). She got angry at me one week for not talking to her enough and called for a break, which eventually became a break up. I begged her to consider ‘us’ again and she came back at the end of her traveling saying she was interested, but we would have to change a lot. I declined &amp; we moved on. It was a very mutual decision, we still regularly talked and hung out after that, I would see her every 2/3 weeks bc of mutual friends. Fast forward to winter break, we hang out with mutual friends and she develops feelings for me again, she finally brought up the idea of getting back together and moving in after college. we’re in similar fields so this would be a great opportunity. Again this is a place we both love, and dreamed about living together in. Us getting back together would honestly be a great thing, but I honestly think neither of us took the time we had apart to try another relationship and find out who else is out there, so I had always put the idea off. I ended up saying telling her I still loved her, but I think it wouldn’t be a good idea.

She has now blocked me on all forms of social media, as well as my phone number.
I can tell that she’s not happy with the decision, and my thoughts are that she probably did this to help her forget about me for a while. My friends are telling me I’m an idiot and I should not burn this bridge bc we’re so good for each other, and her opportunity to move to this new place is a great way for me to grow too, but idk. I feel weird about it all. I’m in my senior year of college now about to consider job offers and I can’t decide whether I want to take this opportunity to make a great life with her, or if I want to break it off and try to find someone else. Any advice is great thank you guys.

TLDR; long time ex-gf and I broke up mutually. She received an awesome job offer to move to somewhere we always dreamed of living and asked if I wanted to get back together and start a new life there.

Long story short, I’m with my bf since almost 2years now,everything is going perfect, I really feel like I found the person I want to do anything for. The problem is that our relationship is a long distance one,he lives in CA and I live in FR.
We feel the need to close the gap as soon as possible but I’m still in college..still some yeaaars to go(med school), I applied to universities in Quebec for 2020 but I’m not sure I can get accepted,never really worked before so any other visas don’t correspond to me I guess. At that point I don’t know what to do, I also thought of maybe change my major or find a quick formation there but even this is a hell to find for a foreigner with “nothing”. We try to see each other as much as we can but as you can guess it cost a lot of money at the end and I’m scared of taking the plane. I really want to make it works,I don’t want to be a burden for him , I often feel like maybe he deserves to find someone who can offers him a normal life,I know he loves me for me and we knew it wouldn’t be easy but that’s just my opinion because I want him to be happy,make the family he wish to have but I see no solutions right now.

438,"I have a friend who I’ve been friends with for over a decade. We always hang out in our “girl squad” with 3 other people. For years, I’ve always dealt with her remarks. She always had something negative to say about me during our hangouts. For example, she would comment on my appearance- my clothes, saying they were “cheap,” my makeup was “the wrong shade”, point out my acne, critique my body, etc. For the longest time, I’ve been uncertain of whether she genuinely cared about me as a friend since some of her criticism could be that she’s just looking out for me. For example, her comment on my makeup could be that she wants me to do better makeup. However, I’ve been reflecting and now I’m now realizing that a lot of the times, her comments are unnecessary. It seems that she’s always trying to point out a flaw. She’s also always been very anal about my decisions in life.  She pretty much tried to micromanage me. She tried to set up an intervention for me with our other friends because she didn’t approve of the fact that I was raving every month and it was a distraction from my studies.

On the one hand, all of these could be argued that she cares and is looking out for me. But when is a critique crossing the line?

I (23F) feel I need a little bit of back story to make sense. My usual job is working as a makeup artist for casualty simulation training, it’s super fun, decent money and I love it!

Over Christmas the work goes dead and I’ve been told it won’t be back on until probably February which is a bit later than I expected. 

I knew this would be the case but I found it much harder to get a Christmas temp job than I expected!

Tom is in medical school and i always have heard of him or see him around on insta but he never knew i existed. I wanted to keep it that way until idk maybe the universe would make us meet some how through a friend? Point is i didnt want to seem like a typical girl in a guys DM. One day Tom messaged me and i asked to be friends and we ended up clicking. I was so happy because yesss my crush likes me back!!! We known eachother for about 3 months.. however.. i have a friend lets say his name is Jim. Ive been friends with jim for a minute and he is 3 years younger than me. And its his senior year. Jim is really attractive and funny.. jim confessed to me recently that he really likes me and he wants to be in a relationship. He wants to treat me right because he feels he genuinely wants to be loved. I look younger than my age so i usually have younger guys attracted to me. But for me im having a difficult time choosing because for the first time my crush actually likes me. But then my friend who i also care about as a person, i dont want to break his heart.

For those who don’t care to read, I was basically accused after breaking up with said ex of pressuring her into sex, pressuring her to sit on my lap when friends were around, and telling her it was okay to hook up with her friend at a party. Since being accused of this, which, is all entirely untrue (I have dozens of screenshots of our texts where she talks about how much she wants me and how she misses the stuff we did etc.) 
These accusations have genuinely upset me, as I treated her like an absolute queen, I was always so nice to her and we never argued about anything. I gave her all my affection and attention and yet she does this, along with trying to turn my best friend (her cousin) against me. 

I know I didn’t do the things she was accusing me of, and some of you may not believe it but I can’t do much about that. Recently though, I have been thinking alot about my past, thinking about how I’ve acted and reconsidering my whole life basically. 

All I can think is “did I ever pressure this girl when we talked?” “Was I an asshole of a friend to people?” “Was I a toxic person?” “Do people see me as a horrible person?” I ask myself these questions all the time now, and it has been causing some pretty bad anxiety. I just feel like I have this dark past where I pressure girls into sex, black mail people etc. and I never knew it. But my life was never like that, I’ve always been good to people and I always act to make other people happy.

Is this a feeling that will pass? How do I cope with self-doubt that maybe I’m the worst person that ever existed. I feel like this has scarred me but I don’t want to over react either, I’m just getting driven crazy by these thoughts that maybe she was right and I’m going to grow up to be a monster. What can I do in this situation?",13Jan2020,1

I don’t even have a license because I’m too afraid to talk to an instructor. Anyways, I’ve been looking for a job for months. My boyfriend has been supporting me and he’s been so stressed because he can’t afford the 2 of us right now. We have been getting by but it’s a struggle.

I don’t think he realizes how bad my anxiety is. But, I applied because I thought I could handle it and I really want to help pay bills. But now I’m coming to the realization that I cannot.

453,"I want more freedom, more choices and options, and generally speaking just an easier, better life with far less worries.  Don't we all, right?  I know I'm not special and no more deserving than the next person, but I can't seem to change how I feel as much as I would like.

My very tired and rambling story is this.  

I started working when I was a very young child to buy my own clothes and other necessities because my parents were poor, ill, uneducated, and sadly somewhat irresponsible.   I vowed as a child to insure my children would have better lives and I've succeeded in that aspect; however, years of hard (and smart) working just haven't led to the life I hoped and worked so hard to achieve.  

I saved to by clothes and school supplies as a young child.  I saved and bought tools as a teenager to pickup more odd jobs and earn more money, which I saved and used to buy a car.  When I was old enough to legally become an employee, I did, and worked hard and lived as frugal as ever to save for college.   I ran out of money in college and joined the military.  The military dolled out inadequate funds to fully pay for college, but I took on extra jobs and worked overtime to cover the difference.  Again, working and working so many hours, so many years.   I lived in some of the worst conditions to be so frugal to get by, to buy books, to maintain my car, to pay my tuition, to pay for insurance and taxes.   When I graduated and got my first professional job, I worked even more. Days and nights and weekends, and continued to live in the cheapest housing I could find.   To pay for my spouse's college, I settled for a near-by business that paid poorly, but promised sizable bonuses that would have made the yearly pay relatively fair.   The business owners never paid bonuses they promised, but I kept working hard and helped build more things because ""maybe next year"".   They sold the company and made millions, but shared none.  I stuck with the company because the purchasing company promised stock options and bonuses as well.  That company failed to keep it's promises as well, and year after year they dangled new carrots, new promise after promise, and each time they broke those promises.  Young and dumb, I fell for it.  That company sold, and that owner walked away with 10s of millions of dollars from the products I played a lead role in creating.   He shared none of the wealth.  It was absolutely shocking, but hey just business right.  My team and I were let go and our jobs were moved over seas.  

Anyhow, as a result of falling for these sort of deals, my wages were low for years and other employers used that as their logic to offer similarly low salaries.   Eventually I started pushing back hard, pointing at all of the products I'd designed and built, all of the contributions I'd made, and the dollar figures related to those contributions.  I've been able to get my salary up to a somewhat reasonable amount that allows me to save, but not meet all of my long term requirements, such as being able to replace old cars, help our children afford college, and save for retirement.  I have to chose.  I don't want to chose and I want enough to cover all and then some.  

A few years ago, I got in on the ground floor of a new business.   Developed a new service from scratch.  I was an employee, but we had no CEO or other high level executives.   Just my boss and a couple other team members, some lawyers, and our investors.   The company sold and I got nothing.  CEOs came and went during my time, and other executive people were able to retire young, but not me.  Nothing.  Nadda.  

Fortunately, I have a job, but I'm so very tired.   It seems from my perspective, I've worked so hard, so many hours, so many nights and weekends, and created truly valuable products over and over, and counted on executives to follow through with promises, yet never received the big paydays that they did.  Now, I'm old.  I've been ill for about a decade or so now with a progressive degenerative disease that puts me in constant pain and constant fatigue.   Worse, my mind is now slowly fading.   And, it'll be at least 15 more years of grinding away before I can rest easy that my children will have made it through college and be able to fend for themselves.  

Now, here I am again, grinding away, working through the day and night again, under constant pressure, to maintain one product I built while simultaneously developing a new service that will bring in another $10,000 per month for the company.  And again, I have no true, legal binding assurance that all of this hard work will result in a true reward for myself and my family.  In fact, like the times before, there is a good probability that when I've finished, the maintenance phase will be offshored, the executives will again get their bonuses and ever increasing salaries, and I'll be let go.   Old, gray, in constant pain, and slowly fading, marginalized despite all the value I've created that has enabled so many other people to live grand and easy lives.

Sure, IF (that's a really big if), I could actually remain employed for the next 15 years with no break in employment and my illness doesn't fully incapacitate me, my kids and spouse might be ok.  The chances of that are very low.   And I've done a lot of research about my condition and what it takes to qualify for any sort of disability.   There is just too large of a gap between ""you're too sick to work for us"" and ""you qualify for disability"".

So, what do I do?   Do I keep trying, keep suffering from the constant pressure and nearly hopeless situation, grasping for that tiny chance that maybe this time the executives won't pilfer the company, take their golden checks and toss the rank and file to do so. OR do I jump ship and try to start my own business?  I'd definitely burn through what savings I do have (bad timing and took a big hit from the recession, taxes, and inflation).  Or, maybe take my savings and start buying lottery tickets?  In any case, it just seems there is an ever increasing probability of having to burn through my savings either due to healthcare bills, getting canned and being aged out of the industry, or possibly failing at a business venture.  The latter seems increasingly attractive because if I'm going to go down, I'm doing so on my own terms.  And maybe, just maybe, my skills and work ethic, and finally being able to capture all of the wealth I might create gives me a chance to succeed and cover all of my needs and wants.

Or, maybe I just need to adjust my attitude right?",13Jan2020,1

455,"17 months ago I started to get serious anxiety. I would ruminate on thoughts of things that I believe will ruin my future. These events are stupid things I've done in the past and I had no intention of doing so/ it was an accident. 

I went insane thinking about that. Sometimes I get periods where I have Insomnia and other times I get periods where I actually think I'm gonna go permanently insane. You know when you hear about mental patients that are in padded rooms screaming and just talking nonsense? I honestly thought that was gonna be me because it feels like there's a demon in my head that's torturing me. 

In November 2019 I started to feel anxious again except it was different. My rumination thoughts were back and I felt like I was going insane, but I had no energy in me. 

What I mean is that I didn't want to do anything. I used to not give up on anything, no matter what. If I failed then I'll get back up again. Since November 2019 I don't feel that way. I haven't done any studying at all, I don't really want to play tennis which I love doing, I stopped going to the gym and I just don't want to do anything important. Sometimes I get bursts of energy to do stuff, but it's never enough. I do play tennis sometimes, but not as much. 

I haven't been identified with depression by my doctor or therapist. I'll be seeing my therapist at the end of the month for my therapy sessions. I mentioned this to her back in November when I had an initial assessment over the phone, but it's stayed like this since.

I called my mother today to try and talk to her about it, but it didn’t go very well. She yelled at me and said she was disappointed which is normal for our relationship. It was difficult to hear but in the end she just acknowledged that shit happens, and she “was sorry I didn’t have the potential she thought I did”.

Her reason for grinding on me, according to C, was because I have never grinded with a girl before and she “wanted to do the honors”. 

But a few days later it dawned on me that that was a terrible thing for me to do. Even though I do not know her well and have only spoke to her pretty much twice, and finding out that she had a boyfriend earlier that day, I still grinded with her instead of stopping her and saying, “Don’t you have a boyfriend?” or moving away from her. 

My friend told me not to worry because it wasn’t my fault. I feel like a fool who got too excited because of his stupid hormones. But on the other hand I have no idea what their boundaries are. But I know that if I had a girlfriend, I’d be upset if she grinded with another dude. 

I need some advice on this - was what I did wrong? I feel like she is to blame but some of the blame is on me as well.",13Jan2020,1
466,"Bare with me as this will probably be a lot. My boyfriend of almost 4 years now (we’ll call him Max) lives and has lived with his college best friend for 3 years now (we’ll call him Jake). Problem is Jake absolutely hates me. Max’s entire family adores me, we hang out with other friends of his often and have a great time, but his best friend in particular has never given me a fighting chance. They have a fairly large group of friends from college, of which Jake is the unofficial ring leader of. I’ll admit i’m a fairly shy person when first meeting someone, but amongst all the inside jokes, and stories from the good old college days the group would constantly tell, no one ever really tried to get to know me. Any time Max and I would have plans, Jake would become passive aggressive with us, me specifically, which would just make me retreat even more into my shell, I mean i’d barely met the guy and he was acting like he hated me. Every time I would talk about things I liked or stuff that would interest me in an effort to put myself out there, it was treated as if it was stupid, vapid, childish things. I’ve often though of their apartment as a safe haven for me when I have family issues. To make up for my heavy presence at their apartment, Max would buy extra groceries to make sure I wasn’t impeding in any way, I’d cook almost every night, clean, go grocery shopping, etc. And it’s gotten to the point now, where Jake has outright told my boyfriend he can no longer stand me and hates to me around me. Max has told me he’ll obviously move out, because how can i possibly feel comfortable at his apartment now? But mainly, I just feel like absolute shit. Like every fear and anxiety i’ve had about people hating me, and judging me and nitpicking me has me feeling like I need to walk on egg shells. And like I just make everyone’s life harder.",13Jan2020,1

471,"I came to Reddit just for some help.

Two days ago I had a very emotional ending with my “ex”. I say “ex” because we were not officially together. We had been in a two year relationship a few years ago, then broke up for a year. We definitely needed some space at the time, because we really didn’t know what we wanted for our lives, and it seemed like we were holding each other back. It wasn’t the worse breakup, but still had an impact on me.

Fast forward to a year ago. It was her birthday, so I decided to say happy birthday, no hard feelings. But that then turned into talking, and we found out we had actually moved to the same city. Things progressed, and we both realized we had not found anyone that really meant anything to us, and we missed what we had.

The fact about not having anyone was especially hard on her. Most of her family has sadly passed away, and she had been struggling to make friends. She has been loosing hope for other people, and how they can be good to have around you.

But anyway, we start seeing each other, but this time she makes it clear to me she does not want anything with a name. We are not actually boyfriend and girlfriend. We just want to keep each other company when we are lonely, need support, or some other more exciting things. This also means if one of us maybe finds someone else, that’s okay, we can move on.

I accept this. If this is what she wants, then that’s okay. I’m with her, and I’m actually really happy. At first.

The problem starts with my own insecurity. I’ve been told as to what we are, but I find myself easily attached to her. I love her. I get jealous of when she talks about other guys. I slowly start to resent her, but I keep going with this relationship because I think she will actually want to be with me.

Then I meet a new girl, and we both like each other as friends, at first at least. Long story short, she ends up really liking me, I wasn’t sure about myself though. I end up taking her on a date. The only problem is I did not tell my “ex” I was doing this. I knew she had told me that it was okay, but I had to tell her when I was getting feelings for another. I stupidly assumed that she would be extremely mad at me, and not want to talk to me again. So I end up lying to my “ex”. And I didn’t want to tell this new girl I am with my “ex”.

At this point it is clear how things can go bad. But I for some reason didn’t see it before.

Then a month ago, had enough of the this relationship has no title thing, so my “ex” and I get in a huge argument over it. In the end I end up hating myself for feeling this way, feeling like I love her in the way I do. She had told me what she wanted, but my brain told me she would come around, and she would be satisfied with me. 

This conversation we had really put a sour taste in my mouth. I end up talking to the new girl more and more now, and I get feelings for her.

Two nights ago is when things got bad, and I’m feeling my mistakes. My “ex” see’s my texts with the new girl. She then gets very upset with me. She feels like I’ve been using her, and really don’t care about her. Or that I can’t wait to leave, why else would I keep this girl a secret? She tells me she can she that I’ve been acting different around her, I haven’t been as happy. And I agree. 

She then lets the load down that she has been feeling worse and worse everyday. She feels lonelier and lonelier. There is no one out there that cares about her. At least she thought I did, but it tears her apart thinking I don’t, her best friend.

She makes it clear to me that she never wants a real relationship with me. However, she gives me the choice of what to do. I leave, or stay. 

At this point I am so disappointed in myself, I can’t bear to do this again to her. To make her hurt. Our relationship before didn’t last, then why should this one? I thought to myself, she deserves better than me. So I leave.

I have never made a decision before that actually makes me hate myself. So many things I have done throughout this makes me hate myself. My heart sinks as more time goes by. I let my best friend down, in a time that she needed me most. The person I love. I have now realized I had everything I wanted. I had her, and she was loving me. I was happy, I just needed a stupid fucking title. The new girl thing is still going on, but I am already finding myself turning away from that. I miss my “ex”.

I need advice. Will my ex hate me? Will she never want to talk to me again? What do I do about the new girl? How do I let her know what I feel?",13Jan2020,1
472,"I (24 F) think I’m in love with my best friend (25 M). We’ve known each other for almost 2 years now. We met at work and just kinda clicked. He was home schooled and doesn’t have the best social skills, so he doesn’t get along with a lot of people or have a bunch of friends, so we have a kinda special bond. He recently broke up with his abusive and controlling ex and have been helping him get over his break up. We started hooking up (no sex, but everything else) about 3 months ago. We aren’t exclusively hooking up, but since it has started, I’ve definitely started feeling more for him than before. I’m not sure if I just like the affection or if I actually have feelings for him now. I don’t think I should tell him because he often brings up how he’s worried I’m going to fall for him. I don’t want to ruin our friendship over it. He’s one of the best things to happen to me and is someone who would do absolutely anything for me and I’m so scared that I could lose that if I say anything. What do I do? Do I tell him?

473,"I have a pretty severe, intrinsic guilt complex rooted in childhood trauma. Any time someone is visibly disappointed, upset, or angry at me, I can handle things rationally but in the quiet of my room, I take to hurting myself as a punishment.

Recently I had a small tiff with my partner and even though I was reassured, there was no cogent argument they could make. They were visibly upset and I guess feeling as though they didn’t audibly care very much about the self harm, I did it anyway and broke my 6 month streak.

475,"i’m a college student from the Philippines

i currently am having doubts about going further with my college major (bachelor of science in tourism management). i chose this major because I had (and still have) dreams of becoming a flight attendant and that’s it, nothing else in the tourism industry catches my attention for a career. i plan to shift to a bachelor of science in accountancy program which is considered one of the most difficult programs in the country. i have friends there who study vigorously but still got two failing courses. i want to be a CPA, and this is only something i realized lately but I am also well aware that i can potentially jeopardize my future if i fail to progress further in the program because they cut off students with a grade lower than the specified minimum once they reach the third year.

to understand my decisions better, here are the factors as to why i want to shift IN ORDER.
1. i am having extreme doubts about my major in terms of career opportunities - being a flight attendant does not necessarily need a degree in tourism management. jobs in the tourism industry also do not need tourism degrees to get in. i feel more secure if i shift to accountancy in terms of career path but it is also a more difficult path. i would need to pass all courses related to the major and also pass the licensure exam (which has a 14% passing rate in here).

2. the major itself is unfulfilling - i hope i do not offend anyone in here but my major is a very easy one, almost everyone can get into the dean’s list with minimal studying. the major i am going to shift to is the complete opposite and needs hours of dedicated studying to even barely pass.

3, i tried activities related to the tourism industry - i tried doing ushering and tour guiding in my university to try them out and i just genuinely didn’t enjoy them.

with regards to my passion, i am not passionate in arts or music but I do want to see myself working in a corporate setting, i am also an extrovert and I love math and solving mathematical problems. i even already asked for notes and handouts from my friends in the accountancy program and i genuinely enjoyed studying them even if they are more difficult from what my major is by a large margin. i also absolutely love devoting my days to studying, doing nothing makes me bored but i find studying really fun.

I can take two paths:

The Safe Path 
- stay in my major, EXCEL  socially and academically (i already am doing this)
- graduate with latin honors and IN TIME (june 2023)
- no board exam
- can immediately be employed but opportunities are not limited to people with a tourism degree only, which means that i could have taken something else instead of tourism management for the same jobs.

The Risky but Secure Path
- shift, try NOT to fail in any of the courses
- graduate as a regular student BUT late (december 2023 or june 2024)
- pass the board exam and become a CPA (14% overall passing rate)
- once one is a CPA in the Philippines, opportunities are vast and pay well (depending on the company and years worked in it)

my university is considered a center of excellence in the tourism program and i can potentially graduate as a magna cum laude but will these help me in landing a stable job? i don’t think so, but i want someone to prove me wrong.

if i fail the CPA board exams, i can still try applying for a flight attendant position in the many airlines within and outside the country as I am already qualified except for the fact that I need ANY college degree but it still won’t be easy.

also, does anyone here know someone who graduated with a tourism management degree? if so, what became of their career? what are their jobs? i am genuinely curious what people who graduate from my major become after they graduate.

please let me know your thoughts and advise me on my decision as this is pretty life-changing.

i still have about five months before the university starts the process for shifting so I am using the time to think critically and reflect on what i should do. me choosing the tourism management program was a purely impulsive decision.

apologies if my english is not very well. 

thank you so much!",13Jan2020,1

481,"I am not even sure if this is the right sub to post this. To get into it,  I dated this terrible man almost 6 years ago. He was emotionally abusive towards me. He would always say things to make me feel like I was useless,  stupid,  etc. When we would argue,  he would punch walls and break things. He would grab my wrists really hard to stop me from walking away from him,  block doorways so I couldn't leave. He would even laugh at me when I cried during arguments (i tend to cry when i am frustrated or angry). He scared the shit out of me. 

After about two months,  I couldn't take it anymore after finding out he also cheated on me with several girls. I went home from his apartment one night and broke up with him over text. He would continue to try and contact me for 5 years after I had ended it. I had to block him on every social media account of his i could find. Sometimes,  he would still find a way to reach out to me. I would tell him to leave me alone as nicely as I could because I was so afraid of being rude and he would hurt me. He threatened to have been beat up by a group of girls he knows. I kept those screenshots for years in case something ever happened to me,  i would have proof of who did it. When i told him i was keeping screenshots of the convo he said ""go ahead and call the cops,  you are gonna need them""

Now for the reason I am so afraid of him. Near the end of relationship, he told me about his ex girlfriend and how he was gonna wait until she was gone and burn her house down because she got a restraining order against him. He is violent,  been arrested many times and once was for beating his girlfriend who he dated after me. He has even pulled a gun on my bestfriend's boyfriend before. 

He has been to my house once before but I am not sure if he knows my address anymore or even knew it in the first place as I met him at a plaza neary house and then we walked to my house that day. So I am not sure if he was paying attention to the street name and house number. 

When I go out to the mall or other public places, I sometimes look around me to make sure he's not there. Ive had dreams that he has shot me before.  I have fears of him breaking into my house and killing me or hurting my family when I'm not there. Once,  I was in the shower and I was home alone. I heard a noise in my house and my mind immediately went to the thought that he might have broken into my house. I know i sound paranoid and probably irrational but i also have anxiety issues so that might contribute to it.  

Recently,  i seen a post on reddit where cctv photos of two suspects came up and were wanted for a terrible violent crime where someone was murdered. When I saw the photos, my heart immediately started beating fast because I swear I recognize one of the men as being my ex. So dispite being terrified of this man and retaliation, I identified him as possibly being one of the suspects. Even though I did it anonymously, I am afraid he will find out it was me and get revenge. 

I am so sorry this is so long but the advice I am looking for is how to get over these fears of him hurting me or killing me? How can i get over this trauma he has caused me?",13Jan2020,1

487,"Last year my boyfriend claimed our son for taxes, I wasn’t working at the time because I was a stay at home mom so I didn’t file, he got around $6000. He bought himself a car (2500) and a new gaming laptop (600), and paid for our sons first birthday (300), and paid off my car that he had been driving all year (500). He spent the rest on miscellaneous things.
We broke up earlier this year and I moved into a house with roommates, and have been the primary one to take care of our son. I have him 16 hours a day, and my days off. The only days I don’t have my son are on my boyfriends one day off. He also makes more than I do and pays less in rent bc he lives with his parents.
So because I have my son more, I claimed him this year. My expected tax return is $5,600. My boyfriend and I are planning on renting a house together so I’m planning on saving $3000 for that, paying off a $600 ticket from an accident I was in, and keeping the rest to save for a car (I totaled mine in the accident).
My boyfriend wants me to split the rest because he thinks that’s what’s fair, and he wants me to include the ticket in “my half” of the split. Mind you, he’s getting a tax return of his own, and I’m paying for us to move. So that would leave me with $700 while he gets $1300 of my return plus his own. And he got an attitude with me when I told him the ticket would be coming out of the return before the split. Guys, I totaled my car I DONT EVEN HAVE A CAR RIGHT NOW.

I don’t really want to split it at all. I told him we would wait and see how much his return is before I decided if he would get any of mine, and he didn’t say anything but I could tell he was mad. What am I supposed to do?",13Jan2020,1

I felt something bad would be said about me.  We were friends in September then boyfriend and girlfriend in late September. I found out about the relationship like... in October. I was crushed and had nothing better to do, so I just became numb to my emotions. (Sorry for sounding dramatic, I don't mean to) Then I forgot about it, then I asked my friend (who she was dating) and LIED to me. I guess he didn't want me to tell anyone, that or he was scared I was going to ask him why, or question him. If I'm told the truth, I'm fine about it. I would have been fine about the relationship, too. I don't judge too bad if told a lie, and even when I am told the truth, I don't judge. When I'm told a lie, though... I feel like I can't be trusted. I feel quite bad about it. So this friend lied to me about my girlfriend and him dating and I was like ""Okay."" Then again, I was reminded about this and I was just emotionally broken from what I remember (not a lot at all) and I couldn't stop talking (in my mind) to myself *like a crazy b\*tch.* I kept asking myself if I was that bad, then I ask why. It's for leaving. I accepted that and left it alone. Again, from what I remember. It might have taken a while for me to accept the truth, then... I guess I accepted it. I believed the lie. I'm like that. That's why I don't like being lied to.

Then, on January 6th, she said that I and the friend make up and we f\*\*\* her senseless or I do, myself. The first thing made me a little twitchy because I hate that type of thing.

492,I am a 25 year old Male and have been married for 6years. I got married right out of highschool and it has been like what I thought a normal marriage was like not all sunshine and happiness but more good then bad. But lately I have been questioning where have the good times gone. I have been unhappy for years at this point trying to wait out the bad but it doesnt seem to be getting better. She has mentioned several times whenever we argue that she is unhappy as well but is that her throwing stuff in a argument or has she been as unhappy as me. I'm wondering if it would be better for the both of us to divorce now while we are young and no kids rather realise we are miserable with kids and feel like we are stuck with each other.,13Jan2020,1

494,"Hi!  I've worked in hotels for something like seven years now as a Night Auditor.  It's essentially the One Guy in the building on payroll during the eight hours that everyone else goes home to get some sleep.  I handle everything that the other shifts can do during that time and a little more. The long and short of the story is that I've been working in this line of business pretty much solely because it's really easy and I'm scared to step outside my comfort zone.  It doesn't really even pay all that much better than day shift does.  I've just.  Gotten content in this position and stagnated.

I gotta get out of this occupation.  But I really don't know where to go or what to do.  I don't have a degree, I suck at school and honestly, working this way has turned me into a social nightmare who practically fears interaction.

I need some suggestions.  Here's some points to consider.

\-Enjoys writing

\-Enjoys talking (but not interacting with people, coworker or not)

\-Is willing to learn a trade but hesitant to plug more than a month or so into it

\-Anything over 16 bucks an hour is a plus

\-Actual real Daywalker Hours is a plus, though I like to keep my evenings open

\-Relaxed environments are a plus

\-Being able to show pride in my occupation is a major plus

I’ve known my friend for over 11 years now, we used to go to school together up until I moved countries 6 years ago. Last time I saw her was exactly 3 years ago,  and now she’s studying abroad and going to graduate school in June. I really want to attend her graduation, especially that her immediate family won’t be there and shes not even looking forward to her graduation. 
Here’s the thing, I love my dad, he’s has the kindest heart truly but when it comes to his daughters he’s overprotective. He’s refusing the fact that I, a female 1) Travel 2700 miles alone 2) He ‘doesn’t trust people there’.
I tried to make an agreement that he’ll only have to pay for the flight and visa, pocket money is on me, and for accommodations I’ll be staying with her but yet he’s not convinced.

498,"my boyfriend’s shower constantly drips. it started as a small, infrequent drip. it has now become a constant stream. it sounds like you left the shower on. the main issue isn’t how annoying the sound is, it’s the fact that it’s hot water dripping. the condensation is everywhere, the toilet, the ceiling, and the mirror is frequently fogged. we leave the window open to give it somewhere to go, but that still doesn’t prevent black mold from growing. we noticed it a couple days ago and have used bleach to clean it, but it keeps coming back. it’s so bad that the whole shower should honestly be replaced. 

not to mention, we also live in a very cold and snowy area so running pipes is not a good idea. 

we have called the landlord twice previously and he sent a plumber out to “fix it” but they clearly didn’t. we could call our own, but we are both college students so money isn’t really something we have a lot of. 

now, he doesn’t answer and has ignored the seven calls we have made in the last week.

500,"I tried posting to r/legaladvice but post was deleted so here I am.

Throwaway account because this is a pretty personal situation but I am freaking out and need advice. 

So about 3 years ago I had a suicide attempt where I was contemplating shooting myself.  I had been a meth addict for going on 2 or 3 years and was at the end of my rope. I had been clean for about 2 weeks prior to the incident but was getting that feeling I was going to relapse again. In my drug addled state of slight delirium and major depression I grabbed my .38 special and sat in the closet to hide to try to ""work up the nerve."" My fiance at the time (together for 10 year) found me and tried to talk me down. I guess at some point she thought talking wasn't working and grabbed the gun. We struggled for a second and it went off. 
Blew one of my fingers almost completely off and hit her in the chest and traveled up into her neck. I had reconstructive surgery and came out fine but she was in a medically induced coma for a month. When she came out of it we talked and I thought smoothed everything over the best a situation like that could be. No criminal charges were ever filed because the investigation turned up that I was telling the truth and she confirmed it all. We kept communicating for a couple months and then decided we were absolutely too toxic for each other.
Her grandmother had gotten and injunction against me which said I couldn't go near their house or own a firearm for 3 years. I had absolutely no arguments and told the judge as such and expressed my immense remorse at the hearing.

Ff to present and I'm finally getting my life back in order. Been clean for almost 2 and a half years, working 45-60 hours a week at a great job with full benefits, and have even gone back to college to get my bachelor's degree. 

On Saturday I received a notice from usps that they tried to deliver a letter I need to sign for and I'm freaking out. The only thing I could possibly think it could be is my ex or her family suing me for damages from all this.  I know I need to figure out what the letter really is about before stressing, but I just can't help it.

Basically I am wondering, if it really is something to do with this situation, am I totally screwed? I'm definitely not the same person I was back then and thought I had paid for my mistakes already. I am an early 30's college student with a student loan now and there is no way I am going to be able to pay some million dollar hospital bill. Would it even be possible for this to be a viable case and if so is there anything I can do? I definitely don't have money for a lawyer. 

I'm going to pick up the letter today. Any advice would be extremely welcomed. Thanks in advance.",13Jan2020,1

508,"I posted this elsewhere, but I kind of just feel lost and in need of advice. Sorry it's a long read.

This is an issue I've been having for a while and I don't know what to do about it. I've spent countless nights looking up remedies to help, but I can't find anything.

I slowly came to realize I can't stay emotionally attached to someone. I don't know why.

I've never been in love. Not in true love, anyway. I've liked people. A lot. Almost to the point where I feel like I'm in love. But it always seems to fade. If I find a guy who gives me attention, treats me well, and is attractive, I start to like them. And those feelings will consume me for a while. But then as soon as they come, they go away.

All my feelings will slowly fade away for no reason. I realize ""*oh I don't like them, I was just infatuated.""* Then I start to feel trapped.

I don't know why I'm like this. I'm actually a very sensitive person. I have no issues with building bonds with family and friends.

Sometimes I wonder if it's because I tend to be alone a lot. I love hanging out with friends and such, but after a while I start to get tired. Oddly enough, I feel like a battery in need of a charger. And being alone *is* my charger.

I'm a very private person. I don't like sharing my feelings with others. When I do share them, I only share certain things. Only certain people can know certain things about me. I've never been comfortable with one person knowing *everything*about me. My insecurities. My odd theories. My flaws. My opinions. My dilemmas. It would make me feel very exposed.

I found an article where a lady struggled with this, too. She partially blamed it on her family. I thought maybe that's it - maybe thats why I struggle keeping an attachment. Everyone in my family has had dysfunctional relationships. My mother and father included. I grew up in an environment lacking love.

But I don't like blaming my family on my romantic issues.

The truth is I hate being like this. It's hard. I stay up late a lot thinking about it. Wondering what's wrong with me. Perhaps they're other people with the same issue? Regardless, it makes me feel like a terrible person.

There was a guy I was involved with once who I genuinely cared for. We weren't involved long, but the connection was strong. He cared for me. He trusted me. He confided in me about some of his most intense insecurities. And for a while, I thought ""*wow, he could be the one. I've never felt this way before.*""

That came to an end, though. The feelings I had for him slowly drifted away. And I felt trapped in this relationship. He was so sweet and perfect and loving - and yet, I was losing the ability to reciprocate. When I finally ended things, it was devastating. I contemplated going back, but I knew it wouldn't be the same.

I hurt him. I didn't mean to; I just didn't have the same romantic feelings anymore. And boy, did I feel like a piece of sh\*t.

I've caught myself a few times since then catching slight feelings with people. One friend that I confided in told me I should just give it another shot. They said I was still so young, I just have to wait til I meet ""the one."" I don't know if I believe they exist.

The reason I took the time to write all of this is because I'm curious if there's anyone else like me. Anyone who falls madly in love for a short time, but then all feelings fade after a few months. I don't know what to do or how to fix it. I'm lonely, I'll admit. A few times I've been tempted to give another shot at a relationship, but I don't want to inevitably hurt someone again.

I've never really gone into full detail about any of this to anyone, only just bits and pieces. Typing it all out kind of feels calming in a way. I know it's not a huge issue; there's so many bigger problems in the world. I just really hope someone can relate to this. Or even if someone could just give me advice to change it.",13Jan2020,1
509,"My dad has been good to us all in the family. He is a hard worker. He works as a vetinary surgeon and he works long and consistent hours. Yeah sometimes he does strange things like bring specimen from work home or plays hans zimmer when driving but his quirks are a part of him.
We all have something unique about us. I get on with my dad and I love him. My mom and my dad rarely argue unless it's something silly like mom being grossed out he put specimen in the family fridge or if he brings home another eccentric item. He brought home a hippo eating the letter H before. It was so random.

Anyway that's just an example how my dad is but he's good he takes me to shows, games, and he ensures that I have a good life. I was abused when I was a child as was my sister by his mother so he spoils us, and I think sometimes it's too much but that's his way. Now that my sister is gone to college, he has a present pile made up for her when she is home from semester. He gives me a gift every Friday. My Fave gift to get is arcade and bowling vouchers. I bring my childhood friend. He was born with water on the brain so it affects his speech but I love him and I'm the only one who fully understands him. We are a good team.

Oh boy I type too much.. So let's get to the root of the problem...
 Oh also I forget to add my dad has suspected I am on the spectrum from 10 years old but my mother refused at the time to get me diagnosed as she told my dad i was just being an awkward boy. I am 23 now and I had a talk with my parents and I'm going for the test this week. So wish me luck please..

Oh.. Yeah..
I was looking about my dad's pc one night as I was super bored but I was always curious from a young age. If I went to somebody's home I'd sneak around it and snoop. So I decided to snoop my dad's computer. My mom is computer illiterate. I was looking on the PC and found a folder called ""Work Surgeries"" so I clicked in to score me some animal surgery viewing. What I found next was worse. There was a plethora of weird and disturbing photos. For example a cartoon lady fashioned into a wall hook, barney the dinosaur sucking his fleshy penis, a lady fashioned into a toilet and her labia into a seat. There was many more weird ones. Too disturbing to name.

I kept looking and the more I looked, the more disturbed and confused I was. I really don't care about weird stuff as I am weird myself but it was a huge shock the amount of crazy weird stuff that was on my dad's pc. He also had a collection of weird furry creatures fucking and some IRL disturbing pics. I exited the PC and retreated to my bedroom.. I spent the whole night awake wrestling with the pros and cons of my father. He had far too many pros to ever expose him so I kept quiet and went about my day as per usual.

People are saying ""tell your mom"", ""leave the house"" or even more fucked ""put a plastic bag over his head"". Someone even messaged me to say break a thermometer and putting the thermometer juice in a sandwich for your dad, that will cure him. I can't see how that could cure him. I'm highly confused at all the messages and comments I received in response to the posting of the pic of the toilet lady.

Anyway advice would be welcomed and if you can explain as I get confused easily. Thank you.

Duty, care and comfort please thanks again.",13Jan2020,1
510,"I'm part of a ten-person friend group, but lately, I've been thinking of kicking someone out.
Let's call her Mia. Mia has been one of my friends for two years now, and we've shared many secrets and had our fair share of fights. However, I've noticed that she doesn't really talk to me (or any of us) anymore unless she has questions about schoolwork or if she wants to rant about her problems and get her ego stroked. She hasn't gone out with the group for over a year now, either.
In the past, Mia also told me directly that she avoided associating with a few of us (allegedly except me) because we weren't too ""socially acceptable"" or whatever. She also has a separate friend group, one that has vastly different interests and attitudes from us.
I've discussed evictions with my group before, but only recently did I get the group's general consensus about who they would hypothetically evict on the basis of ""participation"", loyalty, and just overall concern for the group: Mia.
My friends seem a bit reluctant about evicting her and are torn between: a) a slow burn (cutting her off gradually), b) a long, serious conversation to send her off, or c) starting some kind of fight that can cause a fallout to make her leave us instead.
I guess I'm some sort of the ""de facto leader"" of the group, so I usually have the final say. In this situation, though, I'm really not sure how to deal with things. Any suggestions? Thanks a lot!",13Jan2020,1
511,"There are two rare albums I really want to buy on wax. I’ve seen them go for about 100-150+ each at one point (who knows who’s buying them at these prices, though, and not 100% sure if they still go at these prices). They’re both rare, and are likely to never be re-pressed ever again as they are from a relatively obscure group. 

These albums are basically my holy grail albums that really transport me back to my high school years. Even after 18 years, they are extremely haunting and still speak to me; I have a very strong emotional connection to the music.

I’ve found a relatively good copy of one of the albums for $55.

I’m conflicted because historically, this is a lower price. But it is still hard for me to justify paying any more than $20 on a record considering I hardly ever listen to records. I’m not a record collector, although I do have a small collection. I can easily pull the full album up on YouTube and hear the music. Also, there is no telling how much the price will fluctuate over time. I can’t imagine the price going up any higher; I imagine the price would lower over time, as will the condition of these records. From that perspective, it can very well be a losing deal. Also, with other records I’ve purchased, the excitement usually only lasts for a few spins.

As I’ve stated, the group is relatively obscure, so the value of it will only be understood and retained by people who know about it, and enjoy it, like me. And there are probably not a TON of us around. There are just enough of us to keep the price high.

The purchase COULD be justified because it IS a rare album, at a lower-than-normal price, and I have such a strong connection to the music; owning the original artwork, and having my own physical copy of it would be so satisfying.

In short, I have the money, and can totally make the purchase, but even at this lower price, I am having a hard time deciding if I should pull the trigger as it still seems a little high for an item I will probably not use too often.

OK, so there's this girl I've known since we were 3 and been friends with for a long time. Since 2017-ish, I started having a crush on her, and I'm sure some people know it, when I want it to be a secret.

I've given too much effort for her to like me back, but it seems that she isn't interested in me, so I gave up not too long ago. I might have feelings for her, but not as many as I used to now.

There was a game that she loves so much, TWEWY, that recently came to the Switch. She doesn't have one, but she's planning on buying one. TWEWY is one of those games that she wants to buy on day one, but she might not get the Switch in a long time.

Recently, that game had a HUGE discount in a local videogame store, so I bought it in a rush. The thing is, I don't know how to give it to her.

I could tell her that the game was discounted and I wanted to save one copy for her so she wouldn't pay too much alongside the Switch, give her the game and she would pay me (or not). OOOOOOR I could give it to her as a present, which is way after this discount is available (which would raise some eyebrows on people about my generousity to her), but she would be surprised and she could have probably bought it herself (which is not great).

On the one hand, she knows she'll have it and I wouldn't worry that she could buy it herself, but it wouldn't be a surprise.
On the other hand, she would love it as a present, but there's the uncertainty that maybe she already has it.
In both ways, my family will suspect that I care too much about her, and they will connect pieces if they haven't already. I also feel less happy about it, since I don't have those strong feelings right now.

Can anyone help me decide? Thanks in advance!",13Jan2020,1

He was condescending rude and berated me for half an hour over being too quiet even though the only time she spoke was when he said am I right. I admit I have my flaws but this was ridiculous eventually he kicked me out and I left but I cant help but feel she was in trouble. She is so young and probably has nowhere to go. What should I do should I reach out again and try to help she can stay with me no problem if she needs to escape. I texted her afterwards to ask what was up and he answered her phone. What should be my next steps?,13Jan2020,1

526,"This happened in mid-September. I [17M] was celebrating my aunt's 50th birthday, and eventually my dog and my cousin's dog had to take a walk, so my cousin [20F] and her boyfriend [24M] decided to walk the dogs, and I asked them if I could go with them, and my cousin said yes, but I initially went outside without a jacket, and this was during late at night. My cousin became a little irritated and said she wouldn't allow me to go outside without a jacket, so eventually I just ran and grabbed the jacket because I couldn't wait to go for a walk with my very nice cousin. However I'm not sure she became irritated. I told her the reason why I did it was because I know she wants me to get a cold, but I guess that wasn’t true according to her. I think honestly she did just to show my aunt what a hero she is, but she didn't have to play hero in that moment. Also, later at night I was going to go outside again, but my cousin became irritated again and I became a bit sad because my cousin was almost shouting at me. I don't know why she got so irritated just because I was going to go outside without a jacket. However, right after that, my cousin left along with her boyfriend as it was pretty late and they were going to sleep over at his house, so I decided to go to the bathroom and cry. Then I took a walk for at least an hour outside without a jacket. I got to see both my cousins play football in their respective teams the day after, but during late at night on my aunt's 50th birthday party I was really sad.

TL;DR Was I stupid for going outside without a jacket, despite being told not to?",13Jan2020,1

528,"Hey all, I recently moved into a new apartment (Dec 1st). The apartment is in a pretty bustling downtown area in a small city. Street parking can be difficult sometimes, and luckily my building has 3 spots out back, accessible by an alleyway. 

I don’t usually park out back (my work schedule seems to get me home when the street isn’t very busy).  However, the last two days I have parked in one of these private spots. This morning I found a handwritten note on my windshield threatening to tow me for parking there. I have a slight inclination to whom it may be that wrote the note, and I actually think it was the person (another tenant) who showed me that I could park there. 

I am worried that I will get towed by mistake. I plan on calling my landlord today just to find out for sure that I can in fact park there. As for the note, I wrote “hey I actually do reside in the building, my phone number is # is you need to reach out” on the blank portion of the paper, and put it in the door leading to the parking spots. 

What can I do to address this? I don’t want to make any accusations against anyone in the building, but there is one tenant who seems to always be in other peoples business, and other tenants have warned me of her. This is my 2nd apartment that I’ve rented from this same landlord, and he is very reasonable. I have a good tenant-landlord relationship with him. 

None of the other cars in these spots appear to have any sort of tag on their car indicating that they live in this building.",13Jan2020,1

I have quite a few. They’re Key Moments in life where my mom was her worst and even just one listen could easily explain to the common person who gets angry at us, her kids, for not treating my mother like a god since shes *so kind and sweet*, why we don’t. 


But I don’t show many people because people are very fast to run and tell my mother things I told them and it makes everything worse. So in all reality, I don’t need these voice recordings. But deleting them feels as if i’m erasing it. Letting her get away with the way she treated us. I can’t bring myself to delete these. 


But I am stuck with the p.o.s phone for the long haul and I need to do something. Yes obviously i’ve cleaned all my other apps but these recordings are starting to pile up. 


**TDLR** is there somewhere I can put my voice recordings easily online or something so that it’s not taking up anymore phone space? Or should i just delete them since honestly no one will ever hear them and i’m just hurting myself by never letting that time go..? Personally it’s unfair she got away with it but there’s nothing we can do anyway. Im the only one who knew I was recording so it’s not like I can use anything against her.

535,"So for me it's confusing and it's driving me nuts because the amount of things I want to do is overwhelming and I really don't know what I want to do, what to start with, what I should think about etc.

I'm a 23 year old female, living in Sweden. Currently working full-time as a receptionist and I'm happy with my job.  
Though I've been working here for 2 years now I'm really starting to feel a huge urge to do something with my life, this feeling has only become stronger and stronger the more time that has gone by.  
I promised myself that in 2020 I was going to do something big in my life, take a big step forward. It could be moving to a new country, start university, travel or something that's going to change my life for a bit.

First I was convinced of moving to a new country, now I don't know if that's going to lead me anywhere and I'm having my doubts.  
I want to start studying but what I want to study is HUGE here in sweden, so I have my best chances here without taking loans and stuff, also I don't really believe in myself. Which is a huge problem obviously cause I want to study game design/game development but I don't think I can even come in to a uni. I want to do stuff before I start studying but at the same time I don't want to be ''too old'' when I start..   
This last half year one of my best friends went backpacking in asia for about 4 months and has been on me how good it is to just backpack and travel the world a bit, especially when I'm still this young.  
I want to backpack as well but I'm too afraid of things like ''what if I get sick? What if I get robbed?'' which is stupid because getting out of my comfort zone and traveling all by myself to countries I've never been to would really do good for me.

This all is just bringing me anxiety because I don't know what to do, where to begin with, I'm so lazy as well and I'm so critical of myself.  
This has led me to having sleepless nights and being stressed the fuck out because I keep reminding myself that it's 2020 and I better make a a move ASAP.

However I feel like I know them well (even though it’s just an illusion). He talks about them fondly a lot. I also found over 1000 photos and videos of his wife and parents and children on a public photo sharing community and have looked through each and every photo multiple times. I spend hours just looking through the same photos and reading every single comment trying to imagine what it’s like to be part of that family. I know I’m being ridiculous but they seem like the most beautiful and amazing family with the happiest children. They just seem like these cool laid back parents who just love their kids so much and are so close to grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc. It makes me feel happy inside just to look at the pictures and admire the beautiful souls of the people in them. This can consume huge chunks of my time. I usually just bask in the “warm fuzzy” feelings but sometimes I feel a deep longing and a tinge of bitterness and envy because I will never get to really know or be a part of their world.

They send me shit like ‘prayers for animals don’t do anything’, and such... yet they continue to eat McDonald’s chips that are cooked in beef fat and palm oil even though I said that’s not very “Greta thunberg of them”.

541,"I'm a 26-year-old whose wisdom teeth have never erupted. A couple of weeks back, while I was traveling on holidays (Christmas/New Year) I had a minor infection on the site of one of these teeth, which was partially exposed, and I had it treated and extracted both of the teeth on that side (left), since the Rx showed that all 4 of my teeth are super crooked and out of place and they're not going to erupt anyway.

The surgery was fairly quick (although the anaesthesia was SUPER painful) and I had both teeth removed in under 40 minutes. The dentist stitched the site of the surgery and sent me home with a prescription for more antibiotics, painkillers and NSAIDs.

The first day was basically me almost drooling all over because of the anaesthesia wearing off. The pain was bearable, I'd place ice packs on my cheek every few minutes to reduce the swelling. I tried eating some ice cream. I bought a new toothbrush with soft bristles and would constantly brush my teeth every time I ate or drank anything other than water.

I have also had bad trismus. I can barely open my mouth half an inch. It's made it really horrible to eat anything because I absolutely hate eating in such small quantities, it makes me highly anxious, like I'm force-feeding myself, and in the last few days I pretty much lost the drive to eat. I have lost about 8lbs in the last week and I still can't open my mouth past a freaking half an inch. I dream of eating proper meals every night. I have gone to other doctors, cried in desperation to my husband and the doctors, I'm not getting any help and I am having suicidal thoughts.

544,"Hey there,
So i really didn’t know where to post this, so i am just going to let out her. Okay so here’s my story,
I am an 18 year old Male, and this happened exactly 2 years ago. When i was 16 i got in my first relationship, with classmate (who else happened to be my friend’s sister). At the time i was shy and introverted kid, the only reason i began talking to her was because, she posted one of those “anonymous chatting boxes” and from there we kept talking, we hung out a few times and eventually, she confessed to me and i was the happiest guy in the world at that moment, from there it was just typical relationship stuff, corny texts, love messages etc. So when her birthday came, we went out and she had invited her friends and i was wither her brother and another guy who was also a classmate and close friend to all of us. But that night one of her friends (we’re gonna call her “Rose” for the sake of the story) so Rose was a really out going girl, she was super energetic she always smiled and laughed, but she chatted with me a bit more then the others, i paid it no mind and let it go, my GF then told me more about her friends and she mentioned that rose had a BF, but he was out of the country at the time being. So i was like..ok cool, there was no misunderstanding she was just being friendly. So then we go out again, but this time its Me,Rose,my GF and her brother. So, we are sitting in a cafe, then my GF brother (lets call him “Max”) decides to go the washroom, now we were on our phones(cuz i was awkward around people i didn’t really know)and then Rose hand me here phone without saying a word. She had her notes open and a message were written saying, “what if i flirt with you right now?” ,so a bit confused and trying to look cool, i wrote “am in a relationship and she’s your friend”..she then type “well.. what if you weren’t in a relationship with her? Would you date me?”..i texted “idk, would i you?”. And that was the biggest mistake of my whole life!!!!. At this point my GF notices what we were doing and asks, “what are you guys doing? What are you writing to each other?”.. we play it cool and act as its a “secrets” for her. And she doesn’t really pay it much attention and let it go fairly quickly. After that our drinks arrives, and max is back. The rest of the night goes by fairly normal, except before we left i had to make sure there was no misunderstanding between me and rose, because i really loved my GF, and i didn’t want to cheat on her (especially with her friend). So after i clear to Rose my intentions and tell her that i was just messing around and that, we are both in a relationship and that its wrong, then she gets really gloomy and says “ok” and goes back. And i thought that was the end of it. Before we left she gave all of us a hug (which i wasn’t comfortable with coming from her).. and she was on her way. On my way to my house Max calls me and says, “yo dude, what happened with you and Rose she called me and she was crying about how you hurt her”. At that moment i was like “Hell nah..i did nothing wrong, but my conscious told me to apologize to her at least” and so i did, i asked her for her number and i called her, and she was crying none stop telling me how much of a horrible person i am, and i was a stupid kid and so i comforted her, and tried my best to get her better, after that she started messaging me regularly and flirting with and send me slightly inappropriate texts, and because i felt bad i just went with it(i know am a dumbass). I complemented her on the pictures she sent and responded to her flirts as best i could, but know i felt bad for the things am doing but didn’t know what to do at the time, and so i kept to myself. Then one day i had enough i needed someone mature that can help me with my problem but i didn’t want anyone, i wanted someone i can trust and so i made a plan i SS one of my chats then edited the picture to make it look like my GF was cheating on me (Am a horrible person, idk why i didn’t and honestly i deserve everything that came after) and then i sent it to my close friend at the time, we talked about it a bit but there was a pause between replies(because we were both working at the time) and then he told me he will handle this, at this point i didn’t understand what he meant so i decided that i would just respond to him in the morning telling him it was fake and that i just wanted to see his reaction. The Next morning i wake up to a ton of messages from a my GF and my friend.. Turns out his bright idea was to put us all in a group and talk about it.. the moment i read the first message i knew i messed up BIG time, i immediately private messages him asking him wtf does he think he’s doing, and he told me that we are gonna fix this problem, then i told him HELL NO and explained the whole thing.. He then realized that he Messed up because he told her about the whole thing before he made the group at this point, it was hell, she kept asking me Where did that photo came from and she accused me of making it to make her bad, and i was panicking and just kept, lying over and over and over and never budged, because to me if she knew the truth it felt like she would dump me right then and there, and i didn’t want that to happen, but eventually she just..... she replied to my messages as if our whole relationship was a joke said that she dated me out of pity then dump and blocked me... I tried ending my life that night it was new years eve as well not that it really mattered, i was hospitalized and got questioned on why i did it, and welp the best answer at the time that it was “accidental”..Needless to say...i just....idk became a creature, i stopped feeling emotions and everyday seemed like its the same day, as if its just repeating, i started interacted with people normally... i just didn’t really having anything anymore..( must have been doing a good job, seeing that  no one noticed),a few weeks later, Rose starts texting me again, and asked me how am doing after the breakup, i just answered with whats appropriate and then she asked to meet up, i said sure why not but urged her to get a friend with her, she protested but i insisted. At the same time my friends also wanted to go out with me so i just asked them to come to the same place that i was meeting Rose, so i met up with friends first, and then met up with Rose, she tried running to hug me but when she saw my friends she backed off “i thought you were coming alone?” I said that they happened to be here and was just hanging with them, i then left my group and told them i will meet up with them later, they didn’t mind and so went our separate ways, she was as energetic as ever, trying to cheer me up and all of that, but i was not having any of it, the conversation was plain, and kept reaching dead ends, i knew that’s whats going to happen hence i insisted that she bring a friend. At the end i could tell that she gave up, and so she made an excuse saying that she was sick and went to the washroom with her friend. I knew she was gonna leave and so i called my friends asking them to come pick me up.... after a while she came out and said that she had to call her mom because she wasn’t feeling well,i agreed and said that she should, i could tell from the look in her eyes that said “please, lets stay a bit longer” bit i was not interested. I just wanted to get this day over with, 10 seconds after my friends came up to me and said “that they need me in a very important matter” and so i left with them while she stayed with her friend. My friends tried there hardest to cheer me up i could tell its just that i am a lost case and so i just went with whatever they said, when i returned home i hade dozens of texts of Roses Friends.. saying “your just gonna break her heart and then walk away you prick go end yourself” and stuff like that, i really didn’t though..then a week later when i was in school i receive a call from a number i didn’t recognize i was with one of my girl “Friends”. And she suggest it we prank them, i was like why the hell not and handed her the phone, she then answered and to make it short..she hung up and she had a confuse look on her face, so i asked her what happened and said that a women was super pissed off and was threatening her that if she doesn’t give the phone to me(Called me by Name) she was gonna call the police  on me...Now after she hung up she started texting me that if. I don’t reply and give her my information, she was gonna call the cops on me for dating a minor and threatened to get me killed.. so i did what any sensible human being would do in this situation..i took SS of the conversation and blocked her number, i got called several more time but blocked them all.. so then while am in a gaming lounge i get a call from Max’s Mom ( and she asked me about what happened ?) and though i was confused i told her everything and she understood, she didn’t tell me why and neither did i ask, then she hung up. I immediately blocked her number (because i just didn’t wan to talk to anyone about it) then texted Max about what was that all about. Turns out Rose’s Mom went to Max’s house and Blamed my EX for everything, obviously Max’s mom didn’t put up with this and a heated argument broke out, which ended in Max’s mom kick them out, after that i hung up and started my walk home because i was done with all of this and just wanted to go to bed, then i get another call, i answered it and it was the police station, Now my patience started running low after all that happened so the police asked that there was a complaint about me and explained to me what the lady said, i told him my side of the story and that i have all the proof and don’t want to be involved in this anymore. He asked me if i could come to the Police station to give my statement i kindly declined, and thank god he was understanding and wished me a good night. After that i never received any messages about them ever again, and the whole story just went in history, i still had her number so i thought maybe i should anonymously apologize to her( My EX that is) but i always decided against it at the last moment. A year later on  November 25th, 2019. My friends were posting about her death, and so i immediately called Max to ask what had happened, then he dropped on me the shocking truth. he told me that she died after she went to bed after school from a heart attack. I was shocked to say the least, as hard as it was i asked him to show me, and he sent it. There she was lying in her bed so peacefully wrapped in a white cloth, looking like she could wake up in any moment. I did what i could to comfort him. That day i contemplated what i have done with my life so far, you never things like that would ever happen to the people you know and love till it actually happens and then ask why must it happen to you. Needless to say i barely got any sleep for the next week. Never saying anything to anyone. But my grief aside let me get to the actual “Advice” part...(sorry for the long story i just wanted you to understand what led up to it)...Today it has been 2 years since that accident..and since it resurfaced my mind i want to put it to rest and end that chapter of my life so i can finally start a new one, however the issue is am trying to contact her anonymously, through different accounts(not my main), problem is she’s not responding and i can’t find a way to contact her...i really don’t know what i should do.

545,"I’m 17. Last March my grandmother moved into the house with my father and I. She has had a lot of conflict with other family members and is estranged from all of them except me and my father. The first few months were okay, but everything went downhill after about month three. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time by going into detail, but she is around 80 and is very mean to me and my father. To her, she is always right and I am always wrong no matter what actually happens. She has become very mean to me over the past year, no matter what I try. She calls me names and screams at me; she has gotten up in my face and antagonized me to hit her, which I didn’t. I have tried sitting down with her and trying to figure out what’s going on but the conversations never end well. She lies a lot. I had bad anxiety in middle school and it has reoccurred a lot because of the conflict in my house. I have tried forgiving her and hoping for change, but nothing ever changes. It has gotten so bad that we no longer talk to each other. I have tried to explain to her calmly why I am upset with her, but she gets mad at me and screams because she does not think I should still be upset. She has apologized, but she never accepts blame. She never admits to hurting me or my feelings, instead, she says “sorry your feelings are hurt”. In light of all of the hurt I am going through, I have turned to Buddhism. I have been reading and practicing for two months now and I am unsure of how to deal with this situation at home with my new faith. I was previously agnostic. I am happy to answer any questions about this, but I am looking for some answers. How should I deal with this? I’m not old enough to move out to leave the situation. We are still not talking.

I was mostly performing data entry for a website, SEO, wordpress and creating a social media presence. My qualifications in IT are up to Level 3 and I had around two years experience working in that role which ended in mid-2016.

Savings are good, but could be better. Really I'm looking at a career change or a way I can get my foot back in the door with IT after so long away from it. I've considered going into a Maritime career, Cybersecurity and a few more roles of a varying nature.

549,"You're literally one mistake away from crashing, which could either kill or maim you or others, or destroy your car.

When you're at the red light on a upward slope you gotta start the car just right, and if you make a mistake then you crash on the car behind you.

You always have to take fast decisions, you can't hesitate and if you do, you create a very dangerous situation.


When turning to the left at a 4-way crossroad you gotta have the timing right or you just crash into a car.

The worst for me is the highway, I'm so nervous there because I know that if I change lanes at the wrong moment I'll crash, so I look at my blind spot for way too long before changing lanes, which is even more dangerous since I instinctively stop accelerating when I'm not looking in front of me.

552,"Hello everyone, I'm a 26 Chinese male working as a freelance photographer from Malaysia. Recently or not very recently, I got to know this girl, who is a ""17"" ( There's a reason why I put the quotation mark,that's for later ) the reason why I said not very recently is because she has been on my friend list on a social messaging app for quite some time, it's only recently that I started seriously chatting with her, otherwise we never did. So we chatted for days, and it came to a point where she said ok I'll wait to see you prove your actions to me, and the reason she said that is because she is afraid of her own looks which would scare me away and stuff, but I said no, I won't, and I'll prove it. Today, I went to the mall where she works and met her, hanged out with her there for 2 hours ? Went to buy her lunch together, and along the way we chatted like normal, and she held my hand first, so naturally I wouldn't shy away from that. 

Now, at this point, I'm not saying things is progressing fast between us, which as a matter of fact, it is, but this is not what's bothering me. Here comes the issue, everything is going good, and so during our chat before we met, we did some basic introduction, exchange names and age etc. She told me she was 17, and I was shock, because she looks like at least 20 ? But nevertheless I just shrug that pass. So I met her, and fast forward to the end of the meeting, due to me not feeling too well, and she knows that, after getting her lunch, drop her off right at her work place in the mall, I went home. So I woke up, call it luck or not, but I found her facebook appearing on my ""Someone you may know list"", I clicked in, and out of curiousity, and not doubt, I went into her About details, and her birth date is shown as 1996, and that puzzles me, isn't 1996 = 24 this year ? How could it be 17 ? So either she's lying or she put the wrong birth date, which is highly unlikely, of course this is no red flag, at least not now, not yet. I haven't confront or ask her about this but do you think I should ? Also, she ask me if I'm coming to accompany her at work and sending her back afterwards, if not she would go back herself, well I said yes, I would. So i'll be going by her work place again shortly after, and this pretty much sums up everything that's happened. So what do you guys think ? Should I be careful ? As far as money spending goes, she has been using her own money for her own stuff, but that's still too early to say or judge.",13Jan2020,1

I even had a mental breakdown one day because I’ll see a couple get ready for my pitch and freeze up before talking to them. 

It’s not just that, my job doesn’t do background checks and I’m with felons, my co-worker is trying to pimp me. He found my social media and threaten to grab me one day cause I keep turning down his invitations to go back to his place and the tourist location is filled with pimps and drug dealers that constantly try to talk to me. I laugh it off and try to be polite because I have been a victim. You never know what men are capable of when they don’t understand “no” and “no thank you” I’m usually alone at night too. I’ve only been at this job for about 2 weeks which is short.  I  want to give up but I need the money. 

I tried sleeping last night but couldn’t because my mind is filled with anxiety about going in today. And it doesn’t help that my co workers and managers like me and want to see me do good.

557,"I met this guy like two years ago. When I first met him, I felt like it was love at first sight. I felt like we had a connection; it was as if we had known each other for years. I was instantly comfortable around him. He was all I thought about for a very long time. He told me he only wanted to be friends which I was okay with I guess. 


A month after meeting him, he told me there was a chance he got this girl pregnant and she was five months along. The girl also lived two hours away. He went with her to prenatal appointments and was even there when she had the child. He temporarily moved in with her for a month until the paternity test came back and they found out he wasn't the father so he moved back. 



Once he moved back we started hanging out all the time. However he told me he still just wanted to be friends. There was one time he was acting really weird and he's like ""I know you act like you don't like me at times but please don't leave me."" He also asked me if there was a special person in my life and I told him no. I asked him if he did and he replied ""I'm not sure but I think so. I just don't know if she likes me."" He then said ""if I ask you a question, will you give me an honest answer? Are you in love with me? Just tell me the truth."" I told him that I don't even like or love myself so how could I love someone else. It was just strange. The honest answer was that I was kind of in love with him but I didn't want to tell him. Another time he told me that the only reason he didn't want to date me was because he already kind of had a girlfriend already when we first met. 



He ended up getting in trouble in June and went to jail and he's been there ever since.


After a couple months I started getting over him but I started to like a good friend of his. Now his friend is all I think about. However recently my feelings for my friend started coming back and I'm just so confused on how to feel. I had feelings for this guy for almost two years and I still think about him daily. He had many positive traits but he also had some negative ones such as refusing to get a job and just being a bum in general.

569,"I am a girl, 19y, and i'm not a native speaker so i'm sorry for some mistakes. 

First and foremost, i'd like to say that i think there's smh wrong with me. i easily can fall in love and when some times passes (usually its 2-3 weeks) i forget i even liked this person.

this usually brings a lot of problems because i break their hearts and i feel shitty because they feel shitty. in my life i had a lot of one night stands and friends with benefits, but only a few really long (from my subjective point of view) relationships. i always was the one who breaks up first and i had to explain to them why and it was very painful both for me and my ex-partners. when i'm giving the explanation to why, i always feel like i'm making excuses: ""it isn't you, it's me"" and the other standard blah-blah.  

i went to the psychologist with my problem, but she didn't give me anything useful, so i'm just very desperate and depressed. the problem is: i see a man, i like him, we fuck, and smh clicks in me and i do not feel very attracted to him anymore. it's like i have some kind of check appearing in my imaginary list near his face and name. i've tried various tactics (*yeah, i know how it sounds*), but the result is the same. always. and i always end up hollow and depressed because i've hurt someone, because most of them are really nice guys (not [*those*](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/), of course).

so i started seeing this boy. he's in the same group in the uni as i am. (yes, i know that was silly and now i kind of regret it, it's like dating your college) he's handsome. we've kissed but never fucked because he lives with his parents and i do too. so he doesn't know about my ""little problem"" and i really don't want to tell him. i'm afraid he doesn't know that i had more than one bf. we've been dating for 3 months or so, and to me it is very long. but i begin to feel like i'm loosing strings to this person (idk how to properly say this in english). i feel like he's not 'right for me' (though the same thought strikes me every time i lose attachment to any other boy).  i still like him! he's a very nice person and he's very interesting. i don't mind fucking him. but this thing happened this month...

as i've said i have a lot of friends with benefits. and this month i met with some of my friends and well... we fucked. and then i fucked again with some of my new friend with benefits. and i realised i don't feel guilty that i had cheated. yesterday he told me that he loves me and that he hopes our relationship will be long. i felt like shit and i wanted to cry right there - i was afraid. when he asked how long do i want to be in this relationship for, i honestly said that i do not know. *well, at least here i was honest.* 

i could break up with him as soon as we fuck, but we study in the same group and i think it will be very difficult for him to see me. and i do not want him to suffer from my stupid self!

and i don't know what to do. i feel like i need to tell him all about that, but i fear his judgment and i do not want to lose him because he's a very good friend and an interesting person.

what do yoy think i should do?",13Jan2020,1
570,"I've been here in France for almost five months to study the language. I've made lots of friends, learned a lot and had a great experience, overall. My main goal was to experience a foreign culture and to learn the language, and I feel that I've succeeded. 

The highlight of my study abroad experience was meeting my girlfriend. We met online and found out we had much in common, which led to the relationship developing quickly. Of all the relationships, love interests and flings I've had in my life, what I have with her has easily been the most rewarding and absolute favorite of all. We often talk about a future together, and she is someone I can easily see myself being with for the rest of my life. 

Everything changed when I told her this weekend that I no longer want to be in France anymore. 

As mentioned, I've had a great experience here in France, but I've only recently been wanting to leave as soon as possible. I've learned that France is not the place where I want to spend my life currently and that I'm not ready for all of this at the moment. Upon dumping all of my feelings and thoughts onto her about this, she cried plenty and has been begging me to stay here in France. To my shock, she even said that she would want me to move in with her at her place. 

When we first started talking, I did tell my girlfriend that I wanted to stay until my visa expires in June. However, in my defense, she told me that she not only had problems with commitment but also that us dating and hanging out with each other did not mean that we could be together. Thus, I had no idea she'd ever get so attached to me – especially after not even four months of talking to each other. I anticipated none of this.

However, the intensity and relentless of the bullying came as a shock to me, despite the fact that I clearly remember middle school being a horrible experience.

Up until now, I've let him decide whether or not I got involved. He asked me to let him handle things, because he didn't want to be known as ""the kid who went crying to Mommy"". But that changed on Friday.

The boy who has consistently been the worst bully rides the same bus as my son. On Friday, he threatened to rape my child and stomp his throat until he heard him gurgling as he died.

This is coming from a 12 year old child.

I have a background in psychology, so I'm willing to bet this child has a dark home life or, at the very least, some trauma in his past, but that doesn't make me want to protect MY child any less.

I already contacted the school, and received an email from the principal saying he would talk to my son today and do everything he can to help out. He said nothing about the other child, but I'm assuming he can't discuss disciplinary measures with people not related to that child?

Regardless, those threats, to me, should not be taken lightly and, as the subject implies, I'm wondering if further actions need to be taken.

The one before that cheated on me too, and it's my own fault going into these relationships knowing they had a history of cheating.

Anyway I'm turning 19 this February and I just want someone to waste my time. I like relationships and dedication to one person because I feel like I don't belong to my family, at least I belong to a person. But when I'm not in a serious relationship I feel like I don't belong to anyone at all.

So this brings me to my question. I'm starting my second semester of college, and I was thinking of getting into online dating. It would be an easy way for me to try and find someone, but I feel like the people online aren't looking for anything serious. Plus the thought of meeting a stranger from the internet is really awkward for me.

582,"\*Warning, a little long\*

\[Context\]

I live in a house-share with 3 other women, since about June of 2019. One of the women (J) had placement so hasn't been in the house all that much since then. The three of us (not including J) kinda settled in and got used to each other. We have good but not perfect hygiene standards but it has never really been an issue, because we all just tidy up after ourselves.  When we've had issues, we just had to say ""Hey, do you mind doing such-and-such"" and that person will sort it. This is mainly like leaving washing in the machine, or giving the kitchen a quick wipe, nothing major. Over Christmas, one of my housemates accidentally left bread in her cupboard, which caused a mite infestation, so the whole kitchen has been cleaned like 3 times. I have a massive insect phobia, so thankfully my partner and his friend were there to help out. This caused me to essentially abandon the kitchen since New Years, so when the other women got back (I was the only one in the house over the holidays) they came home to a clean kitchen (with the bugs still hanging around a little).  J was the first to come back, and I told here that the insects had been everywhere, but that my partner had dealt with it for the most part. I said that they weren't gone completely, and I was still too freaked out to use the kitchen, even though the bugs were harmless. She cleaned the whole kitchen again, and I kept offering to help in any way, because even though I was freaked out, it still needed doing and I felt bad for her doing it all (with her partner) 

 J has much higher standards than the three of us, so when she got in, she reorganised and moved people's stuff (including the sofas) until it was to her liking. I have no problem with this, except she didn't say anything to anyone. She turned the boiler off of the timer and onto constant without telling me, so I turned it back assuming it was by mistake. This happened twice in total, until I realised that was intentional and I left it alone, and just turned my room radiator right down, since it was making my room sweltering (why I checked the boiler in the first place) She has a habit of leaving the lights on when she leaves the room, and because of the way the house is laid out, they shine right into my bedroom, so if she forgets then it keeps me up at night until I go to turn them off. Not a big issue, so I just asked her in passing to turn them off when she leaves the room.  She then turns around, and with no preamble yells at me for messing with the boiler (this is the first time she's even mentioned it to me) and then I hear her later yelling about me on the phone (my bedroom's next to hers) and starts throwing around other things about me doing stuff around the house in a way that she has a problem with, like how I didn't help clean the kitchen/ bathroom (I offered to help repeatedly) or how I left washing out and so on. I'll be the first to say that I am not perfect, but she hasn't even mentioned any of this to my face, and half of what she has been complaining that I do, she has been doing herself this last week. Then the afternoon of the same day I mentioned the lights, she screams through the whole house ""STOP CHANGING THE F\*\*\*ING BOILER"" shouting that she had changed it back that morning and that it was back on the timer. The thing is, I hadn't touched it for days, having realised that it was left on intentionally, so my theory is she mis-remembered when she last checked it. Because this happened after her shouting at me, I know that it looks like I've been really petty but I haven't, and the fact that she wont even give me a chance is really frustrating me. She then stormed out of the house and slammed the door, and I haven't had a conversation with her since. I have heard her exaggerating and lying about me to one of our other housemates though, and it's really upsetting me that she wont just come and tell me what's making her so angry, rather than trying to turn the house against me.

So, here's where I need advice. I don't do well with being shouted at (upbringing), but she seams to lose her temper at the drop of a hat. How do I go about being a better house-mate without being petty, or passive aggressive, or triggering more gossip and shouting? (I should note we're 20 yo uni students)

[Sorry for the long text and possible awkward sentences since English is my 2nd language]

Little bit of backstory - I lived in a third world country in which schools were not divided amongst levels, my school was a Preparatory school (Kindergarten through Highschool), so the people in my class grew up with me since I could read, except for the ocasional new student. Ever since I transitioned into high school, me and my original friend group fell apart (we were never extremely close but they were my best friends). So going into freshman I had no group of friends and was more awkward and shy. My class got along pretty well and we all knew one another and were around 50 students in total. I grew to be friends with people by the end of freshman year after an awful depressive state which felt like a whole decade for me, but was never part of a group. I had my individual friends and basically got along with a lot of people so I was not seen as an introvert but also not a popular guy, typically in between. Fast forward to the summer after freshman year, I became friends with 2 guys who I can call my to this day my closest friends and they basically made my social life and built my confidence. They had a group of their own even, who were considered fairly popular, but I never became part of, still we had trust among one another and it was fine. So I was sometimes invited to their things, I hanged out with them and they seemed to be chill with me. I came to accept this and be ok with not being a part of the group, my social life was great. I went out to parties, I had things to do every now and then, I even got my first kiss and all. My introvert self was kind of disappearing but I still had my clumsy and awkward persona when it came to social interactions. Then we had to move, and just like that I said goodbye to my awesome social self. 

New Life
When I moved I was devastated and fell into a weird state were I despised my parents for a while. I was trying to find ways to go back to where I came from, were people knew me, and were the schools were WAYYYY smaller than a typical US Public School. I’m talking no 3,000+ students and 500+ just on my junior grade. It was a BIG CHANGE, but I managed. So far its been 6 months and I am starting my second semester, but ever since I enrolled here I feel like I am back to the start of freshman year. I can speak to people and thats great, I have those who I talk to and typically sit with in class, but in lunch I got no one. I tend to go to the library and study all by myself and feel awfully lonely. Outside of school I do nothing but work, helps around in my house and play video games, talking to my old friends and wishing I was back home (I kept contact with my old friends). All I want right now is to find a way to take it to the next step in a friendship. I don’t know what to do and I feel stuck here like my life is just a cycle of school and work and nothing else. I even have come to accept that I might not  ever have friends for the rest of high school and I should just wait for college. Except, I do want friends and a social life and a girl friend ( thats for later tho). I don’t know what to do, can someone please help??",13Jan2020,1
587,"Hello! So I (22F) am a recent college graduate that has just started a full time job. I make a pretty good salary, considering my status, and I am really excited to finally move out of my parents home (since I commuted my entire undergrad). However, after thinking about it a bit, I am beginning to consider staying at home. 

I am starting a part time masters in the fall and plan to go to medical school right after. Even though I am a little sick of being at home, staying might be more financially responsible. But, when talking to friends and coworkers a lot of them think I should take this time to be independent and move out, since I never had that experience. Also, I’ll be 25 and still living with my parents, which I’m not too keen about.

So basically, I am asking for advice whether I  should stay home to save money for medical school or move out for two years to be more independent?

Thanks in advance!!",13Jan2020,1

My brother never cleanes after himself, I won't even talk about his room, but he still has stuff from primary school in it, tons of dust, garbage everywhere, doesnt change his bed sheets regularly (maybe few times  year?) but also sleeps with cats that walk outside, few days ago I offered to clean his room... Found his milky teeth and a box full of little spiders casually lying around.

Always when he cooks he makes the biggest mess and doesnt clean after himself. Today when I returned I found 4 different pans(!!) and a pot, 2 salad bowls, utensils and plates...  and 2 days old food still sticking to them. 

In the kitchen there's food lying around everywhere. And we got ants :)

I clean after myself and my whole family while my brother only watches tv and plays games. He doesn't study rn, and doesnt even want to accept a nice paying job that's been offered to him. Today I lost it a bit, and shouted at him that he should clean after himself and that I dont wanna live in a house this dirty, and he hit me, then sit in his car and drove away.

Here's some context.

&amp;#x200B;

I (M22) have been smoking and quitting pot nonstop since graduating high-school.

My consumption, just like my life habits, has been extremely sporadic. The longest time I've been sober for the past 4 years is no more than two months.

As of right now, I live with my family. They are not understanding about this substance in the least.

I mostly use it recreationally, but have also found it extremely helpful in my creative writing, and out-of-the-box thought-processing, aside from many other benefits. Knowing my career aspirations in the lie in the game industry, I don't think I will permanently stop smoking. But I would like to learn how to use it more efficiently.

Regardless, I still live with a very hive-minded family of drones, which I love very much. I need to stop smoking so I can function normally with them.

If you guys have any advice on how to cope with these side-effects, I will credit you in the Special Thanks of my shitty work.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Insomnia: Easily the most hate-able. I'll be doing 5 yawns per minute at night, eyelids are drooping, and my body feels as energized as a sack of potatoes. But the moment I close my eyes, you can put wheels on my brain and have it compete in the Daytona 500. My mind is not filled with anxiety or negative thoughts, but I just can't stop thinking, period.

\-Poor eating habits: I barely eat. And when I do, I eat very random amounts of food throughout the day. This is a bitch because it conflicts with insomnia. I will feel most hungry when I want to go to sleep.

\-Irritability: My opening lines explain enough.

\-Concentration issues: I love smoking because I can come up with some interesting ideas and concepts, that I later develop when I'm sober. But this middle-ground doesn't let me do either.

\-Anxiety: But not the *oh-fuck-me-the-world-is-going-to-end* kind of anxiety. It's more like *butterflies in your stomach for no fucking reason* kind of anxiety.

595,"Hello.

I'm 21 years old , my older brother is 23. We've grown up together and still live in moms house. Ive kept a steady job ever since finishing high school , and he never finished for being on dumb stuff like following girls and the wrong crowd. Ive offered to pay for his schooling to get a GED but he is so lazy , and still hangs out way too much with friends and girls then focusing on being an adult. Well, Ive always been a fan of Jordans, Nikes shoes , collecting them since age 13 ; my collection would of been grand and no doubt around 40-50 pairs by now if I didn't catch my brother pawning them for money or straight up selling them withouth my consent. 

Today I was going trough some old photos on my iPhone and saw 2 pairs of shoes , 11s Cool Grey , and 11s University Blues , I have been very busy at work and don't have the time to check on my collection like I use too. So I want to check them out and I head to my closet where I assume I have them ; they are gone. These shoes cost about $200 a piece , and were in near new condition , limited edition as well. 

I got angry , again. My shoes gone. I checked everywhere around the house , even asked my parents. Nope, they are gone. So I go to confront my brother who is still asleep on a Monday at 7:00 am since he still doesn't fucking work , about my shoes and he tells me ""Oh i dont know"" over and over. I get more furious and tell him about the fact that he still doesn't work , is inviting girls that already have kids over , and that he has been doing this shit since I was a kid. He gets angry and shoves me , then we get physical with each other , with him then start to destroy his room (he does this behavior when hes really pissed). Then hopped in his truck and sped off.

How do I prevent this from happening? I don't buy nice stuff for me anymore since I know it will go missing in a few months or weeks , is it time for me to move? Did I do wrong? Please any advice would be cool. I just got tired af of him having no shame in stealing from me , I have never took anything from him.",13Jan2020,1

602,"backstory- when i was 15 (i'm 17 now) my dad attempted to kidnap me. he did it on the weekend i was supposed to be with him (my parents are divorced and share weekends). he picked me up after school and after an hours drive (his house is 2/3 hours away) we stopped at an airport. i assumed he was picking up his wife but he told me to get out and go with him. i was confused but again assumed he didn't want to leave me in the car by myself while he waited for his wife. nope. he opens the trunk and hands me a suitcase and tells me to stay with him. i was very weirded out by his behaviour and kept asking him what he was doing but he kept dodging the questions, all i know is that we're going to singapore. it's at this point i'm texting my mum, telling her where i am, what's happening etc. she tells me she's called the police and that they're on their way and to comply with what my dad's saying to avoid unnecessary conflict. i do so and we board the plane. i know the plane will be delayed and i was right. my dad was arrested and i was taken home (after the usual procedure for kidnappings).

my school was told about the situation and all that jazz but my friends began to make jokes. now, usually i use humour as a coping mechanism but for things i can 'control' (my depression, anxiety etc). i know i can't control them but it's direct, if that makes any sense. i have no idea why my dad was taking me to singapore and it still freaks me out to this day.  my friends say things like 'you should have just gone, free holiday' or 'you're such a snitch now your dad's in prison' (he's not) and things like that. like i said, i use jokes as a coping mechanism and i'm not saying other people can't but i don't think they realise how scary and potentially dangerous my situation was. i found out a few months after the incident that the police were working with police in singapore about a paedophile ring there. now i am in no way claiming that my dad was taking me there for that reason but it was a very real possibility and the evidence against my dad (search history, pre-booked hotel rooms in a hotel that has been busted multiple times for rings like this, sketchy chat groups talking about this kind of stuff, etc).

My school life wasn't much better. I was ostracized. I was usually in trouble so much that I didn't get to play during recess. I played with imaginary friends longer than most children did, and when that stopped working I turned to books.

My mom was pretty manipulative. She was almost a textbook narcissist. If things weren't about her, she made them about her. You could only be happy if she wanted you to be.

When she abandoned me it crushed me. I went emotionally numb. I went through the motions but I wasn't really there. I had to see a family counselor.

I saw my mom at my big sister's wedding this weekend. I knew that she was going to be there, and had a panic despite trying to prepare for it. I expected the worse.

That's not what I got. She hugged my and touched my face twice. She kept it short and brief. I had to excuse myself to get myself together because I didn't want a scene.

She didn't talk to me much most of that night. I think she knew I was trying to process everything. At the end of the night we gave each other hugs and exchanged phone numbers.

I just don't know what to do now. I know it's possible to still love someone and hate the pain they caused you. Despite everything she did I always loved her.

So basically the past 4 years were a road down and down and down to hell. Hard breakup, brother becoming a drug addict, I was expelled from uni and I couldn't find a job since then. Up until last friday. I need to get the medical exam tomorrow, that's fine. But on Wednesday, I'm starting. It's not a dreamjob but I need money and it leaves me with enough time to actually start learning coding effectively so I'll be able to work more reflexively with better pay.

But my problem is, I've always been introverted and these past years, especially the last 6 months, pushed me down so much I have a hard time speaking a word to strangers. I never spoke much anyway and I always had social anxiety. It is boosted now. Thing is, I never had a job before (lack of time to get even a part-time sadly due to courses and travelling every day). I want to work and I don't mind being a ""ghost"" to the future colleagues. But I'm starting to lose sleep, something I'll need the most. I can't afford a therapist. If I could I'd have done that years ago. I can't ask my family either because 1, they are extremely ignorant of mental health issues. 2, I don't trust them in the least with things like keeping it a secret and since I live in a rural area everyone knows everyone (mostly) 3, my family isn't well off and therapy is expensive here. I'll definitely see a therapist when I have the money but until then I need advice.

I have always did what I had to but now I feel desperate. I have faith in myself but I'm wondering if there are some neat psychological tricks to get me out of this self-destroying mindset of being afraid I'll fail. I only need a good start, then I know I'll be able to work greatly. Because basically I am extremely afraid I'll mess it up.

So I (19f) have been dating my bf (21m) for almost 2 years. When I met him we instantly connected and he’s been my best friend ever since. He introduced me to his best friend several months into our relationship. Right before he introduced us my bf jokingly said to me “don’t fall in love with him”, I get chills thinking about that moment. 
At first I thought his friend was an attractive guy but didn’t think much of it and didn’t form a legitimate attraction to him until I really got to know him. I’ve seen some of the best and worst sides to him..I’ve seen him cry, I’ve seen him angry, I’ve seen him extremely happy. Our friendship is the kind where we’re always poking fun at each other and making each other laugh, but we’ve had our serious moments too. We just have the same sense of humor. 
I consider him my best friend apart from my bf. 
Over the past year and a half I’ve been feeling myself grow stronger feelings for him everyday. I never wanted to feel this way and when I first started noticing it I distanced myself and stopped hanging out as much. We’d go months between seeing each other but it didn’t matter, I still felt my heart tugging toward him and he was often on my mind. 

My bf and I previously got in an argument because he felt his best friend was flirting with me a lot and that our banter was making him uncomfortable. I realized how it did seem flirtatious and held back from the way I spoke to him since then. 

Lately I’ve been feeling like I love my bf so much but I don’t know if I’m in love with him anymore. It feels like we just go through the motions and aren’t much of a couple anymore, just two really good friends that spend every day together.

618,"TL;DR I am going back to school (online) to pursue a degree in Psychology to learn how to shape my mind by thinking and understanding how I/people think, to basically be a better person/friend/wife/and to help others with their problems. Advice/tips on how to work full time and go to school? 

Without going into too much detail, I’m currently seeking help from a therapist because of my childhood. I have severe mommy/daddy problems. Both my parents emotionally and physically abandoned me as a kid after my parents divorced, even though they were present in my life and I lived with my mom. This has caused issues in my life with friendships and relationships. 

Fast forward to today, I’ve been married for 5 years and my husband [30 M] is the best thing to have happened to me since my parents divorce. But I have major issues with thinking through things/communication/trust/processing emotions/etc. 

After starting to work with a therapist and seeing how much it’s helping me (I literally have had one session and felt so much relief), I want to go to school and pursue a degree in Psychology, or a degree where it can help train my mind to think differently about things and to help others. I’ve never gone to college, and I have an good paying full time admin job right now, and I technically don’t need to go to college because I got lucky with my current career. But I want something more out of life with my career. I want to complete a degree, for myself and to potentially help others. I think I’d like to become a therapist. If I can help someone as much as my therapist has helped me, I’d love to give that to someone. Am I in over my head to go back to school while working full time and change careers at 25? If I pursue this career field, would it be expected to complete my masters as well? Should I first work with my therapist and process my past issues, and then start school?

My mom also is going to move fairly far once she gets a new place. I have little to no family that really cares and the ones that do couldn't do shit about it. And she's public about her relationship anyway so anything they'd be willing to do they'd already of done it.

621,"I'm trying to find a way to help my boyfriend, and I'm hoping that someone out there can give some guidance.

I'm white, and my boyfriend is black &amp; white (only sharing that info because it's actually relevant). We just had a discussion last night about how he feels separated from the black community. He describes his upbringing as being very black, with lots of black music and black culture, but he ended up going to a primarily white middle school &amp; high school because of a move when he was young. He was explaining to me that, as much as he gets along with all of the white friends he's ever made, there's something missing. He's just not able to connect with white people on certain things - music is a big one for him. He grows increasingly more disappointed every time one of his friends tells him they don't know who Lauryn Hill is.

Anyway, while we were having this discussion, he mentioned that he thought it would be nice to take up a hobby or something to find a black community he can connect with. At the same time, he's also explained how he doesn't feel accepted by the black community because of his 'whiteness.' He doesn't feel like he fits in anywhere, like he's always seen as an outsider in both the white and black communities, since he's not totally one or the other. 

Is there anyone who can relate? Or does anyone have any suggestions for how he could go about finding a black community that he can be part of? We recently moved to Madison, Wisconsin, which seems to be a pretty white town, and both of our workplaces are primarily white. I just don't know where to start or how to even go about looking for the community that he wants. I'm not even sure if this is something I can help him with, but I want to try.

629,"This is a very long story. Basically when I started my first semester of college, I made friends with a group of people down the hall, which was a big mistake. At first they were pretty nice to me but as weeks went by they started constantly treating me like crap because they knew they could. They would hit me, tell me I wasn't as pretty as them, tell me I was a fake person because of my zodiac sign and one of the girls in the group who was a virgin, and she would constantly brag about being a virgin, would call me a slut because I've had sex before. Eventually, I had enough of being treated this way after they created an entire new group chat without me and I had to find that out through another person. They also got mad at me because I took them off my snap story, they didn't need to see the personal stuff I posted on there anyways but when they found out, they acted like I killed one of their dogs or something. They actually harassed one of my other friends who was in the group, to the point that she had to move across campus to feel safe. So I left these people for a new group of friends who actually treat me like I'm a human being and it's been great, the problem is, I live in the same dorm as the previous group of people, they live down the hall from me. It's now a new semester and I had basically forgotten all about them as I hadn't talked to them since October of last year, but apparently, they don't wanna forget about me. We had a floor meeting last night with the new RA and I showed up and these people were there, which isn't a surprise as they live on the same floor. They immediately started staring at me and obviously talking about me to each other, like they were trying to get a reaction out of me. One of the girls kept staring at me and so I stared at her back and she kept staring until i guess she got tired of it and looked away. At the end of the floor meeting, i decided to talk to the new RA about the situation, in the moment it just felt like the right thing to do. This is where I made my mistake. When I told the new RA about them, I told him everything that happened in the past, I basically put it all out there, including them hitting me a few times. This alarmed him and he had to actually file a report on these people because he's a mandatory reporter or whatever. Problem is, the girl in charge of the group that's harassing me, her roommate is a desk assistant in the hall and so she's able to see whenever RAs make reports on anyone. And if this girl sees that a report was made about her roommate, she's going to go tell her (they're like best friends). I'm worried these people are going to come after me. The RAs want me to move to another hall which, I honestly, don't really wanna do because I'm exhausted.

We’re simply priced out of NYC, and tbh, it’s changing (I know it’s always changing, but now, it’s really just for the rich). 

I’ve done tons of research on smaller, more affordable cities. We visited Pittsburgh last summer, liked it, but we felt it was too far from the ocean (or any water for that matter). Next city we’re going to check out is Baltimore. We’ve also considered Florida (but I am nervous, being from the Northeast, that it will be a huge cultural change). Boston we love, but like NYC, too expensive for us. 

Any other suggestions? We like urban, diversity, and culture. We both have jobs that can translate anywhere (education administration and retail management). Oh, and our son’s education is important to us, albeit via a public school system.

I kind of feel trapped here in Brooklyn. But I want so badly to get out. And we have considered NJ, but still too expensive, and a little too suburban for our tastes, not to mention, not as diverse as we’re used to. Regardless of how my post sounds, we are open to any and all suggestions!

637,"Hey

I'm a 20 (21 soon) y/o female from Europe. I have many passions and I consider myself a productive and smart person. My problem is my university. I study computer science. I went there and hated every second of it right from the very beginning. I'm not earning any money and I'm not learning anything valuable. I always think about quitting, especially during the exam season. I'd just go to work and maybe finish uni in a couple of years if I'd need it. It's just such a huge waste of time it makes me mad. I'm learning a lot on my own and I really love programming, but my uni's syllabus is trash. We learn electronics, all kinds of math, physics... . We have a programming class only once every 2 weeks.

The thing is, I always get really stressed out during the exam season. I go from a healthy person, working out 6x per week, cooking and programming every day to a hot mess. I panic. I go back to vaping (bc nicotine calms me down) and quit right when the semester ends. I eat junk food, just because I don't have time to cook. I pass a lot of my exams by cheating, because there's too many shitty subjects to learn at once. After the semester I smoke weed and drink for a week to forget about all of this.

Why won't I quit then? Well, I've already wasted 1,5 years of my life for this thrash and I don't want to lose it. There's an option to suspend the course for a year for an amount of money that I'd earn in 2 weeks. Unfortunately that option's flawed too, because the syllabus has changed and I'd have to learn different subjects and take some classes my year doesn't have in order to graduate. At the same time the thought of quitting completely and just getting my life together as an adult properly is soooo tempting. I could get the degree at a private uni in a couple of years without blinking an eye.

638,"I live in a very dog friendly neighborhood and was walking my German Shepherd yesterday afternoon when I noticed a Pitbull sniffing a mailbox, without a leash or collar, a few houses down. I stopped where we were and asked my neighbor, who just happened to be taking his trash out, if he knew who's dog it was. Said he didn't so I made the decision to cross the street and to tell my other neighbors' kids who happened to be playing in their driveway to go inside and get tell their parents there's a big dog walking around without a leash. While doing so, my neighbor yelled to me ""Its coming your way!"" Turned to see the Pitbull running down the street towards us. This already got my adrenaline going because even though I'm a dog person and I'm use to owning big dogs, I have no idea whats about to go down. I tried to remain as calm as possible and got in between my dog and the Pitbull however, the Pitbull kept running around me and getting to my dog. At first it was just pawing at her and jumping on her with ""playful"" bites, but my German Shepherd wasn't sharing in the enthusiasm and was starting to growl and nip at it. This escalated the situation and they started ""fighting,"" Pitbull would back off and run to my Shepherd's rear and bite at her hind legs at which point my Shepherd would react and show teeth and nip at it. While all of this is happening, my neighbor came over to help at which point I gave him my dog's leash and asked him to take her inside while I focused on the Pitbull. He reluctantly helped and I don't blame him for being hesitant but this all happened so quick and I was just trying to get the dogs separated as quickly as possible. The dog's had a couple more scuffles on the way to his door at which point I was able to toss the Pitbull by the skin on its neck just far enough away for us to squeeze through his front door and call the Police. The Pitbull hung out barking in the front yard for a few minutes and then left. By the time the police had arrived, it was back where I had first seen it a few houses down. Turned out that was its owner's house and the dog got out due to an open fence in the back. Cops asked me if me or my dog were hurt and the truth of the matter was that neither of us were, so they took my information and told me the family who's dog it was was extremely apologetic, and that they understood the magnitude of the situation and they were given a firm warning and that was that. 

I went home and called my wife to tell her what had happened. She hasn't handled it well because she walks the neighborhood all they time with out four month old and our dog. If I'm being honest, I my neighbor wasn't there to help out, I have no idea to what extreme the situation could have escalated. What could I have done? Taken my dogs leash out and let it fight while I help? Do you try to kill it if you have to? What could my wife have done? Try to help my dog? Would the dog have gotten aggressive towards her? Could she have defended herself? The whole ""what if"" question is causing me some anxiety today which I'm sure is normal after a high stress situation, but unfortunately it comes down to the fact that my wife probably won't walk the neighborhood for a while and I'm going to feel on edge about it for a good while myself. Any advice for both her and myself that may bring us some ease of mind?",13Jan2020,1

647,"I'll try to make it brief, but I've been feeling... different for a very long time. I can recount noticing differences in how I'd perceive the opposite gender since I was 9 years old, on the playground. I have been reading all these wonderful ""coming out"" stories this December, where people would do it as a sort of 'Christmas present'. Being gay has been the biggest obstacle of my life, without a doubt. It feels like living a double life, and I love my family. And they loved me.

I come from a very conservative family. My dad is a blue collar metal worker, and my mother is a receptionist. Fast forward to yesterday, I had planned it out, written notes. Trained my 'speech' the entire day before they came home. And then when evening came, I went down to the living room, and sat in the couch, and explained my situation. My dad was stunned, he just sat there, completely seized up, and looked at me for what must've been 10-15 seconds before screaming at me to get out of his house. My mom started to tear up, and eventually full out cry, and headed for the door leading into their bedroom.

My dad and I went into my room, and he angrily helped me pack my stuff, and then sent me on my way. Luckily, I have an amazing friend who let me stay over at his place. That's where I am now. Now, here's the kicker, around 3 hours after arriving here, I receive a text from my mother, saying that my dad is researching lawyer to amend his will to leave the estate in its entirety to my sister (who was not home during this ordeal).

I'm currently in university studying to become a veterinary doctor. I really relied heavily for my family as a support system.

648,"I'm a 23 year old male who has been working a NPO job paying $15/hr while loving at home in a small town in NY. I have a Business Administration degree from a SUNY. I have been working for about 6 months in my job where I help people with disabilities prepare for work, find work, and keep work. The employment specialist role I'm in has a lot of transferable skills and tasks that I hope will help me find a HR job, preferably in recruitment. 

A place of interest that my girlfriend eventually wants to move to is Boston, but I am looking to make a move now to further my own life and take the next step for me.  I would be willing to take a more basic job soon and spend the months following searching for a job with better pay, that more aligns with my career goals listed above.

 Let's say I found a campus recruitment position in Boston, that paid $20/hr Full-Time...how could I make ends meet in Boston? Assuming I could be within 30-40 minutes of the city, what would I be looking at for rent? When I search rent costs I see 1000-3000$/month...how can any young person afford this? Keep in mind if I were to be taking a job paying $20/hr, I would be making roughly $3200 BEFORE taxes and monthly expenses. Monthly I owe car insurance, I have a car payment, I have student loan expenses, health insurance, grocery expenses, gas expenses, small personal expenses (being able to go on dates sometimes would be nice), and misc expenses. Also, I do have a dog, but I do suppose if it was a huge inconvenience I could leave her with my parents for a while until I had a better financial situation to fund a dog aka dog food (she is only 10lbs tho so not too much). 

How do young people do it? How would I make this move? How should I evaluate the job market and my potential? I do not know the exact cost of my student loans because they do not kick in until late March, but I expect, unless I refinance them prior, I could be looking at upwards of $1000/month towards student loans. My car payment and insurance total about $300/month. Health insurance costs would depend on my work, but my current plan costs me about $100/month. My current employee taxes are about 20% of my current gross income, which for $3200/month would be around $640/month. I will probably spend around $200/month on food and $150/month on dates/going out. I currently spend ~$100/month on gas and spend $10/month for Subscriptions (spotify and xbox). Im not 100% sure but let's just argue dog food could be $25/month I'm sure I missed some basic expenses, but here I would guess I will have nearly $2525 in expenses....if I'm only making $3200/month, how would I survive? I'd have roughly $675 left over for rent....how would I be able to live in Boston on that? 

Should I reconsider my options or is it part of the grind to live poor until I find a job that could pay like $4500-$5000/month instead of only $3200. Would a smart plan be to take any job I could around $3200/month and then make the move and then take months and try to find a better job directly in my career path? 

Any real advice wpuld be appreciated. If anyone wants to DM me their stories or personal path, please do! I can also send my current resume over DM. Also, for anyone who can relate or who is looking into similar things in Boston, DM me and I would be open to connecting on LinkedIn!

657,My ex who cheated on me when we were dating for two weeks is now in a relationship with the person she was cheating with. She says she loves him yet she doesn’t trust him or shares any personal details about her life (which is so fucked up btw) . That job goes to me she shares everything about her with  me seems to trusts me and even care for me sometimes yet when I confront her about this she says she doesn’t trust me or doesn’t like the word trust many of her friends think her relationship is not really workin out as they tend to fight.

660,"The title says it all, really. We've dated for two months and it's like pulling teeth getting him to shower. Speaking of teeth, I think it's been two weeks, maybe three since he's brushed them.

Let me be clear. I adore him. He's smart, funny, kind. He's pretty much perfect. But he showers about once a week. For a while I got him to wear deodorant and he did, but now he's stopped again. He doesn't wash his clothes and his stench is getting out of control.

Just yesterday he ate some of his Greek leftovers and he's gone so long without brushing his teeth. I got so grossed out by his breath, I told him it smelled like someone threw a spice rack in an outhouse. He just laughed. He doesn't take it seriously no matter how much I nag. And I hate nagging. I don't want to be that girlfriend. I want to hug my boyfriend and cuddle him and kiss him. I can't do that.

I need advice outside of nagging and just letting it go. I shower with him at times but I can't do it everyday as we work different schedules.

667,"So Just to preface, I work in an office with 3 other women on my team. I’m 23 so I’m the youngest and the new girl  Claire (24) started about 5 months ago. The other colleagues who are Jen (28) and Phoebe (40) are the existing ones and have been gossiping so much about her it’s borderline bullying!

When Claire started the other colleagues did not like her at all, Claire is quite confident and friendly and I guess they didn’t take to this. They would often complain about her to me on Skype for business and to be honest at first I wasn’t keen on her either and would take part in the gossiping about her. I felt  extremely bad for this especially as I was making effort to talk to her and get to know her and to be honest she is actually really nice, I would say we have become friends. I no longer took part in any of their gossiping even though they still invited me to Skype chats to talk about her.

Me and Claire were then talking and she was talking about how her mum was cheated on. Claire has a very active dating life and she is quite vocal about this which is of course fine, but when Claire and I were talking, phoebe made a Skype Group with Jen saying “what was that about Claire’s mum, sara? Maybe that’s why Claire is the way she is with men”. I just said “Claire’s mum was cheated on”. The conversation wasn’t private and they were more than welcome to join in but they didn’t. They often make fun of Claire being the only one dating and criticise her choice to have multiple partners. I just ignored the chat after that. 

It was at that point I decided enough is a enough, Claire is my friend and I’m going to tell her to be  what they just Skyped me. I was extremely nervous to do this but it was really sad seeing Claire be so open and friendly to them whilst they were just being awful about her behind her back. I told Claire that I’m sorry for the way I treated her when she first started and that I was no saint but just be careful what you say around them because they gossip about her so much! 

Examples of things they have said / done :

Made fun of her whatsapp display picture 

Called her names regarding her sexual endeavours 

Purposely make her feel left out by not reorganising lunch when she was sick but reorganise for another colleague

Make fun of her appearance and her confidence 

Made fun of a different co worker who is a young man for balding 

There is definitely more but it’s difficult to specify.

Now fast forward 3 months, after I told Claire she got really upset and cried in the work toilets, she has taken days off because she is anxious to come in when they are both working together. Things are better now as me and her will talk about stuff but recently it’s like a us vs them situation. They won’t say hello to us or peep a word the whole day. We talk to each other often and will talk to other colleagues in different teams. 

Phoebe and Jen have proposed a meeting to get things out in the open and discuss the atmosphere, this caused Claire to have a panic attack in the bathroom. It was decided we would have the meeting with our team lead tomorrow, but Claire wants to let out everything I’ve told her? 

I just need advice on how to move forward with this please",13Jan2020,1

669,"My boyfriend and I were together for 5 years. I broke up with him because I went on his laptop and found hundreds of nudes and conversations with an old friend of ours. I considered that cheating so I confronted him about it. I knew he had mental health issues but he would never open up to me before. Once I confronted him, he told me that he has a porn addiction and he’s suicidal. I stayed with him for about a month but I eventually found it weighing on me too much. I found myself not wanting to be with him, kiss him, or say “I love you”.

Immediately after I found out about him cheating, he started going to therapy. This is something I’ve been suggesting to him for a really long time.

Two weeks after we broke up, he asked to meet up because he wanted to talk. He told me he tried to commit suicide. He said he only decided to tell me because he was doing better. But last night he texted me because he was suicidal again. He ended up calling the Suicide Hotline.

The thing that keeps me talking to him now is that he doesn’t have any friends. He doesn’t know how to maintain relationships and he can be very selfish and sometimes even rude. All of my friends (who also know him pretty well) say that I should completely stop talking to him. But I can’t get myself to do it because he doesn’t have anyone else. But I don’t know what to do. He asks so often if we can get back together, and I truly don’t want to do that. I don’t know what to do. I want to be as gentle as possible but I also want to break up with him.",13Jan2020,1

Were having sex Sunday morning.  Then i wake up this morning to a text telling me its not working.  Been crying at my cubicle all day and wondering what it is that makes someone end things so coldly.   I guess im just wondering what about myself is so disposable.  He just acted like i meant nothing to him even though we have been talking every day all day since we met.  I feel so hurt, like i cant even manage.  Why do things like this happen to me?  Why do i always get ruined like this? All i wanna do is crawl under my covers and sleep for hours on end. I wish i never met him. I feel as small as anyone could feel.

671,"I left college in the middle of my last semester due to the sudden death of my mother. I moved back home to be near my sisters. This was a few years  go and since then I've been in dead end jobs. I want to go back to school (just to community college) but am told I can't get an official transcript from my original school until I complete paying back the entirety of my loans. I owe *several* thousand dollars that will take years to repay especially since I'm working job (since no degree) that I barely scrape by on. 

I've talked to the financial aid office and the collections agency and made down payments in order to set up loan arrangements. When I originally spoke to the financial aid office I asked specifically if setting up payment arrangements would mean that I could get an official transcript. She lied and said yes. The collections agency said that the university probably wouldn't send one.

Now I don't know what to do. I can't wait another several years to move my life forward.

676,"I've allways liked to sing but I've never sung in front of anyone but a few family members.

My mom used to tell me i was good at it but i was a kid then so she might as well have lied to me. Apart from her, only my cousin and once a couple of classmates have heard me. My cousin thinks I'm good too and only one of my classmates had said to like my singing. Said classmate tried to record me and later when i heard the recording i panicked. It was so bad i almost cried.

Thought when I sing when Im alone and I think I sound pretty good.

I've already graduated from schooll and I'm not really doing anything at the moment besides from learning english. I think this sudden urge to put myself out there is thanks to that.

Having a succesful music career where I'm from (Perú) is very hard if not impossible. I fear that some of the jobs I'm concidering might end up just being scammers or even worst, human traffickers (they tend to scamm aspiring models, I'm not sure if they do this with aspiring singers too but I'd rather be careful). It's really dangerous for young girls like me here, so that's another big concern. I don't have any family member to do me company during castings or auditions, thought I've been thinking about asking a friend of mine instead to help me with that).I've also got to mention that I have almost no knowledge of music theory nor do i know how to play any instrument. Finally, I'd like to add that I'm not pretty at all , althought there are many succesful singers that are not considered attractive, I've heard that it can be harder to break into the industry if you're not attractive, and i also kinda fear being mocked.

I'm not asking if I'm good or not (I'd have to link a video of myself singing for that and i guess it's pretty obvious by now that I'm too shy to do that) but rather if I should try and apply for little jobs that involve singing so I can either improve or start a music career.

I know i sound too insecure, but i beleive thats somthing I can work on with time, I just want to hear other opinions since I haven't told anyone else about this.

678,"For background, my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. He is an active duty soldier stationed in Washington and I'm a Reservist based in Utah. I mention this because of the reputation that service members have; that they're cheaters and no one bats an eye. I trust my boyfriend very much and cheaters like his friend give my boyfriend and other good people out there a bad reputation. 

So last Saturday, my boyfriend and his friends go to a party and everyone's talking about who's who and who everyone is with. There's talks about a hot new girl. And guess who walks in with her? My boyfriend's married friend who he really looked up to and had a lot of respect for. Now, this could be perceived as ""they're just friends."" But let's not be naive. They came to the party together and left together. Coupled with the fact that this is the military, no one bats and eye and everyone just goes about their night. 

My boyfriend and I were on FaceTime last night and he is very very torn up about it and he doesn't know how to go about the situation. It's kinda fucked him ip a little bit because he really respected this guy and it's very personal to him because of his past. He feels like he should do something about it because he's been in this situation before and that was the deepest hole he's ever been in his life. But he also doesn't want to say anything because it's none of his business and he could possibly get this douche canoe in some serious fucking trouble. 

I've given him a little bit of advice. Like talk to the friend one-on-one about what he saw and if his perception is true, tell the friend how he truly feels about the situation and if he does nothing to change it, tell the wife next. I've also told him that he could send an anonymous message to the dickbag about that night and if he does nothing about it, send an anon message to the wife next. Or just not do anything about it and live your life and let them live theirs.

679,"Hi, Reddit. I (25M) used to be in a relationship which I absolutely adored. We were SO happy for four years, it hurts just to remember. Then, something happened. She started to lose interest in me, and we finally broke up a few months ago. She was quite hurtful when it happened, saying things that basically destroyed my self esteem. 

I broke. For a month, all I did was cry and think of how could I get her back. You see, despite what happened, she had been the light of my days for years, and all I wanted was to have that back. With a lot of help from my friends and family, I managed to be able to function again and move on with my life and my projects.

However, that doesn't mean I don't think of her everyday. As far as I know (we have a ton of friends in common), she's about to start a new relationship and it hurts me a lot to think about it. I've been trying to stay away from her as much as I can, but like I said we have too many friends in common and we always end up seeing each other at gatherings and interacting in group chats.

All my friends tell me I need to move on and start seeing someone else as well, and I'm trying to do so. But it's hard. I'm not particularly attractive, and the few dates I go on are usually awful. Even the ones that work out can't make me stop thinking about my ex. I still cry when I think about the future we had planned and that won't ever exist now.

681,"I know my overbearing positive energy is annoying, weird and too much for some people (Think 21 year old girl in a 32 year old mans body, occasional throwing glitter all over my face and dancing at 80s night in a rainbow tutu). People generally meet me and say things like 'wow, I love this guy, He's just out here doing it!' or 'I just love how he is always on and ready to go'. But my constant positive wacky energy is also very draining and people tire of it quickly, making long relationships hard for me. In addition, I was just rejected from a job for being too 'bubbly'. And despite 6 years experience in my field, some leadership experience and a masters degree, I can't gain the professional respect of my boss who was hired for his job with half the experience and less education, but with a more down to earth personality. 

At the same time, I do not want to surrender who I am. I love being overbearingly positive and energetic. It is very hard for me to tone it down, even just a little, as that positivity is just a part of who I am.

I mentioned wanting a job and she told me maybe I should wait and that I’m not ready and overall just advising me against it.

683,"*tl;dr: Currently paid under market rate for my current position and I've been doing the work of a position above me for a year, I have inquired about a pay raise and told that I need to seek a promotion to get one. Sought promotion, was told it's only given 2 times a year (Oct/March) and out of cycle promotions don't exist. Colleague with less experience than me was just promoted out of cycle and I don't know what to do.*
 
I have been with my company since early Dec 2018. I came to the job about six months after graduating with my Master's (relevant to the job) from a prestigious university, in addition to relevant work experience with high-profile companies. 

I initially accepted a salary that was 20% under market rate (for my experience + education level) because I was a little desperate and I also have a tendency to undervalue myself. I should note that I'm (27/F) the first and only person in my poor Mexican family to ""become"" something and I earn the highest out of all my family members ($75k). I struggle with imposter syndrome but have a strong work ethic; I am always ""all hands on deck"" and I tend to accept less than what I'm probably worth a lot of the time in many aspects of my life, something I'm trying to work on. I work extremely hard and pull 60-80 hr weeks during busy periods and 50 during slow ones.

When I first joined the company last year, I was immediately leading a project (something usually reserved for leads/senior leads which are one and two levels above my position respectively). I continued to lead 80% of all projects I was on throughout the year and delivered high quality results. I have been trusted to travel internationally to oversee and lead projects as well. 

I started this job in San Francisco and transferred to NYC to be with my partner, so it goes without saying that it's difficult to ""make it"" in these cities on $75k given that I took out loans for undergrad and some loans for my master's (I had 50% funding). 60% of my income goes towards rent (even shared rent with my partner) and the rest is bills, loans, and food. 

Upon my 1 year anniversary, I inquired about a raise. I was told that the only way to get a raise was through a promotion. I then inquired about a promotion since I have been doing the duties of a lead since starting the position, and I was told they only do promotions in 2 cycles in the year, March and October. I was told I would have to wait and see until March. I was already feeling little incentive to continue to do the work of a lead until March when I can be considered for a formal promotion, when I've already been fulfilling these duties in a lower-ranked, under market-rate-paid position.

Then, my colleague on the same team, who has less experience (both past and in the current position at the company) and less education than me, was just promoted out of cycle to the lead position. I am furious and feel extremely disrespected. I have a great relationship with my boss and have mentioned my frustration to them multiple times on this subject, but with this new information I almost want to tell them that I need to be considered for a promotion or I'll need to look for another job. However, I HATE giving people ultimatums and feel they are usually unproductive and don't yield positive results, so I really don't want to do this. How should I proceed? I should mention that I do like this job a lot, and I feel so fortunate to have found a ""career"" when no one in my family has ever done so.",13Jan2020,1

691,"So a quick run down, this is kinda the result of my last post. My dad and I were talking about a lot and I broke down and told him how my mother has threatened to hit me and how she never takes me to the doctors for my mental health issues and even more.

My dad wants me to live with him for obvious reasons and my partner wholeheartedly agrees along with my best friend. 

Now the answer seems simple *move in with dad* but it’s not. I want to get all my stuff from my mum. Teddy bears from family and my partner, my books, clothes, everything including my cat. 
My mum isn’t capable of taking care of a cat. She over feeds her and doesn’t clean her litter box and not to mention even though my cat is over fed, she won’t eat it or she’ll throw it up as she only eats if I feed her.

She has no legs to stand in to force me to stay, our house is falling at the seems. Especially my bedroom. My wall is cracking as my mother, being the cheap ass she is, decided to fix our broken shower herself and the pipe wasn’t sealed properly letting the water rot my wall. Water was leaving a small puddle on my carpet for months. Not to mention our house, especially my room (from the water) has mould everywhere.

She is verbally abusive. She will call me stupid if I didn’t hear what she asked from me.

Example:

Mum: Wash the dishes!

Me walking in from the other side of the house: Sorry, I couldn’t hear you.

Mum: Are you f*cking stupid? *she starts talking slowly like I’m deaf or don’t understand English* Wash. the. Dishes.

Or if I talk back I get:

Context: I told mum I was staying with dad for another week as I want to.

693,"Hello guys, i hope i'm in the right subreddit for this(This is gonna be long so you can understand my thinking)...From when i was a little kid in primary school i was curious and i wanted others to answer every ""why"" i had. I was good  at math, but then i met physics... I fell in love with them and i loved how it had answers to question i couldn't even think of. My teachers were always like (through all of my school years): Your kid is very smart BUT he is lazy. I believed i was smart, i starting digging into physics more and subscribed to many youtube science chanells that i could spend hours watching. It was certain, i was MADE to be a physicist. Then came the last class of high school (in Greece you have to take exams when you finish school in various subjects depending on the direction you chose, so that you can enter the university of your choice). It was pretty tough for me ... i never studied because i ""had to"" i always did it when i wanted to and because i wanted to. I was even bored to study physics and math.I started to doubt myself...Do i really want this? Am i capable of becoming the great scientist i always dreamed of ? Am i even smart ?. Also i had no friends (and i still don't have), i went through all of this alone, i made only 1 during the end of the season with who i am now separated due to university. Anyways i got my results... Not even close to what i wanted...But they were enough for a place at the university of patras. I'm here now, studing....Physics! yey, i finally made it!... Not exactly, you see i still like science and physics, i can feel that it's not over...I just don't have the same passion anymore... i feel like i know everything there is to learn and everything else from now on is just precise definitions and exact measuring, i don't have that curious kid inside me anymore... It's like i lost my ""color"", i feel like i am greyed out, that i lost my purpose in life...All i do is learning guitar (on my own)(i started when i entered university) and game development, which i have started before uni. Now i even lost my exams because i didn't know i had to declare the subjects i'm studying at this semester. I wanted to be a cosmologist...seems like i'm a looser with no friends and DEFINITELY not smart enough.
I don't even care whether this sub is the right one or not, i don't know if anyone can help me, what question to make...All i know is that i don't know.

Thank you for reading this. Don't get me wrong, i love life and i feel for lucky being who i am, i don't know why my mind is ""sabotaging"" me.",13Jan2020,1

TL;DR


I’ve recently started becoming better friends with a guy I’ve known for about a year now. (Let’s just call him B) When I was going through a rough time, he said I could talk to him about the stuff I’m going through when I need to. So I have been. It really makes me feel like he cares about me when he listens and tries to help the best he can. I used to tell my best girl friend what’s going on but she’s busy now a days so I talk to him. I want to talk to him more though about things other than my problems because he’s a cool guy😎. I am a hugger, I love how it feels to be hugged by someone that cares about me! Sometimes when my best friend doesn’t know what to say to help, we just hug and she lets me cry and say whatever I need to. I want to hug B like that too because idk it just feels good to have that affection from someone close to me, as I said before. I’m worried that would make him uncomfortable. I don’t think I have feelings for him, even though he is attractive and I know he doesn’t have feelings for me either even though he told me he thinks I’m pretty I know it doesn’t go farther than that. Therefore I don’t feel uncomfortable hugging. But, I don’t if it would make him uncomfortable and ruin our friendship.

I am a 21 yr old student who is adjusting to adult life. I am having difficulty taking care of my health, and I would like some perspective on the severity of my issues (I am NOT looking for medical advice) 
I am 21 years old and trans. As far physical health issues- i have displaced knees and cracking in all my joints including my jaw. I have pain throughout my back and neck. I also struggle with anxiety related gastrointestinal issues. I have difficulty sleeping as well as mental health issues (gender dysphoria, anxiety, CPTSD, depression, addiction, and an eating disorder) these are diagnoses that I was given during my time as a patient. 
As a child and teenager, my health issues were often left untreated and I was not taken to the hospital after a traumatic auto crash. 
Is my health really bad for my age and my condition or is this typical? I am asking so I can put this into perspective and not feel like I’m “broken” I guess. I have appointments to help my issues, I just want to know if I should be worried or take precautions for my future health. Thanks!",13Jan2020,1

700,"I have a job that I used to really love. I would get up happily on Monday mornings and look forward to going. It’s now been 7 years and I’m so bored with it. In theory, I should still love it. It’s not very stressful at all, I have great vacation time, co-workers are all nice people. It’s what I always thought I would want to do and it used to be so fulfilling. I’m just immensely bored. However - I feel a little stuck because of the time off and relaxed atmosphere. I have horrible anxiety and don’t do well with people breathing down my back. My fear of getting in trouble or being caught doing literally anything wrong makes switching jobs scary for me. The time off is too good to lose as well. I live 1,400 miles away from home and having the ability to travel back often is something I don’t want to give up. My parents are getting older and every single member of my large family still lives there. My husband reminded me that I can’t stay at a job just because of the time I don’t have to be there. He’s right. But I just can’t find the motivation. I now understand what people mean when they say they just feel stuck.

701,"Previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c8u64k/finally_leaving_hoarder_parents_need_advice_on/

After six excruciatingly long months, I've finally moved out of my parents' cascading nightmare of a house. Got the keys on the 25th of November, but had to spend the next month and a half getting everything sorted out, which involved lots of misinformation, cyclical calls to the council and service providers, all that stuff. Moved in for good on the 4th of January, and have now spent 9 days on my own.

It's brilliant. I can go to the kitchen, and not feel absolutely disgusted with the sight of fuzzy mould, pans that haven't been cleaned in weeks lying on the kitchen floor, and whatever other horrific treasures have been festering. My parents drummed up how hardcore and heavy it is to cook and clean on my own, trying to psyche me up with anxiety, which is a tactic my mother used extensively when I was growing up.

Turns out that it's not hard at all to cook, clean, wash, and buy groceries. At least, it's not hard when there isn't a week's worth of dishes caked in dried up grease and rotting food, and there is actually counter space to prepare ingredients.

[Here's an album of pictures showing what the kitchen, dining room, and living room look like over at my parents in 2019.](https://imgur.com/a/1E1KUtc) It's horrific, and has only gotten worse over time. It's a six bedroom house, and have lost 8 rooms to the hoarding. You can't navigate or find anything in the house, as it's all a Rube Goldberg machine of trash, clothes, and whatever else has been festering since they filled the place with crud.

[Here's my new place, and it's fuckin' amazing.](https://imgur.com/a/0mtZ2a3) Might be basic, but it's an infinitely better upgrade than my parents house. My chronic functional nausea has become much more manageable as well, which is rather surprising; I'm well enough to get out of bed and brush my teeth around noon, whereas before, it was rare for me to be well enough to get out of bed at a time closer to noon, than midnight.

Now, I need general advice on living alone. Like getting insurance, switching gas, electric, &amp; internet providers without getting reamed with fees, travelling and getting deals on bus tickets, all that stuff. I'm currently on Universal Credit, and the rent should be completely covered by my Housing Benefit, so I've got some money flowing in that I need to budget with as it's not that much. Any tips and heads-ups would be great.

702,"First and foremost, hi, this is a throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 27, male. And I believe I've arrived to a bad place and I am really unhappy with where I am right now. It's been over a year since I finished my law school and went on to pursue the career path of an attorney. But, honestly, I don't enjoy working as a lawyer. 

Whole my life I was preparing myself to finish all those schools, certificates, internships and now I just feel so empty. The job itself is so unsatisfying. I feel like I really missed an opportunity there and should have gone to a technical/business university instead. Now I am stuck at work, leaving me with a very limited skill set, being almost surely unable to work abroad in a different field, as I am basically without qualification, (which I would do in a heartbeat, there is nothing tying me to my home country), while sustaining a decent wage. And I honestly don't know what to do. Because all I've ever done were mostly legal oriented jobs, without any other field intertwining it. I feel like it is a bit late to pick up programming for instance, because working hours in legal field are long and tiresome and doing both simultaneously is not doable.

Maybe my view is limited, but it is my point of view right now. I feel seriously burnt out.

I also feel like, I am obliged to finish the job, to pass the bar exam or I could regret it later on and then quit the legal field for good, but that would demand another couple of years of my lifetime.

I'd appreciate any words of wisdom. Would you continue the legal venture being at my place? Maybe I am just looking for a different perspective provided by any of you.

Thank you.",13Jan2020,1
703,"So basically I had to go to a new clinic as my employers insurance does not cover my usual place.

(my bf and i have been together 7 years so sometimes we don’t use protection) the dr continues to say “you shouldn’t be having sex before marriage. you shouldn’t be having unprotected sex, and you need to stop.” I was horrified, i didn’t know what to think. i quickly told her that i didn’t need her opinion or her judgement and she said “it’s the best way to prevent an unwanted pregnancy and stds and you’re too young to be having sex anyway” (i’m 23) at this point i just felt shamed, embarrassed, and mad. is there someone i can report this to? i will never go back there but i don’t want anyone else to feel the way she made me feel.",13Jan2020,1

I switched to political science because I figured it’d be easier to switch from political science to something else rather than jump from art to something else. I’m taking all these history and political classes, which I really enjoy, but I know that with this major I’m not really in the best position to succeed after I graduate as a political science major doesn’t have a lot of opportunities without getting an amazing internship opportunity.

712,"Hello,

I hope that someone who is of similar character to mine and has experienced similar things can chime in with some advice on what I maybe need to work through in order to find direction and meaning in my own life, if that makes sense. To start off, I'm a gogetter by nature who has been so far unsuccessful in many of his ventures, have been addicted from high school age to different things during different periods in my short life including smoking, drugs, alcohol and gambling, with which I have brought upon myself fairly serious debt for someone in their early 20's. Serious money was loaned to me after having a better than average income, of course, which I no longer have and moreover, I am also now unemployed for the time being waiting to find something to do like construction or other jobs that don't require any specific education, which I do not possess. I currently have to my name a beater car, a laptop, a very low end digital camera and about 2 EUR in cash, while also having overdrawn all three of my bank accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I find that this does not discourage me as much as the current emotional situation that I'm in, and I have no particular thoughts about quitting life and so on because of money. Money really is not hard to come by and on that note I believe that anyone can put their own capabilities and common sense to use in order to achieve their financial goals, and others. This, however, does not mean that I have found the direction in which I want to take my life in.

&amp;#x200B;

What has happened I want to express very shortly: being young and naive I put a lot of faith into a two year old relationship with a girl that I believed to be in love with. She has no practical abilities, no language skills being that we are both foreigners, and expresses basic interest in sciences and astrology, like most. I do not consider it a compromise on my part, but rather that there was a specific charm to her, a go-getting attitude that she had faked in the beginning that attracted me. She expressed interest in living together, but I could not bring myself to do it being that I did not trust her for reasons such as lying in order to hide her social media activities from me, and her usage of Tinder and similar dating apps, which I know persisted throughout our relationship. Some time in and I was getting more fond of her just for the things that we had in common, and of course we were both physically extremely compatible wherein we were having the same amount of sex that we had in the beginning up until a year later. I found out that she had been having sex with someone else for three months behind my back and came to see some video footage of some of their encounters as well. She had been very sexually active with this person as well. In spite of this, and after some negotiating, we did move in together and for some months I financed everything out of pocket. This caused my emotional state to deteriorate as the months went by, so I put an end to the relationship and have not bothered with the idea of reinvesting in a relationship with her despite her pleas. This is really the bare bones version without getting too detailed about all of this. What I feel however after this experience is that I cannot for the life of me focus and find my direction in life and on top of this I have stopped seeing women in a romantic way - it probably does sound kind of nasty, but I cannot express a romantic interest in other women despite all of their beautiful, attractive qualities, and only see them as objects of my inconsistent sexual desire.

&amp;#x200B;

I am intelligent enough to look at the whole situation objectively, but it is perhaps my heart that is not at ease. Can someone please help?",13Jan2020,1
713,"Quick background: I work doing medical transport for a nursing home in a small country town surrounded by lots of other small dying out country towns. Unfortunately, the highest level supervisor at my place of employment is my boyfriend's mother. She does not directly oversee me but she oversees my boss and all the other department heads. Anyways, because of this I have been disliked by a handful of people at work that do not like the boss so as a consequence, they also hate me. After two years of low key bullying and just a bunch of BS I don't feel like elaborating on right now, I have learned to mostly hold my head high and not let these petty people bother me. They have tried to get me fired or in trouble countless times and I think the ultimate goal is either to force me to quit or to commit suicide. I'm really not sure which one.  For the most part I am successful at staying positive and not letting them under my skin, until this morning. One of my supervisors came to be about some texts she had received, of my work van in my driveway at home. She starts getting these on Saturday morning while she is in bed. Then a few hours later another picture of my van in the driveway at a different time. A little while later a picture of me and the van out in town doing my transport pick up. So I have someone following me and taking pictures of me at home and work throughout the day. Whoever spent their Saturday watching me was unaware that I filled out a time sheet before I left Saturday including my times of transport and excluding the hours at home in between waiting for my dialysis patient to be ready for pickup. So their intentions were to get me in trouble for being at home on the clock, at least that is my best guess?? But what I want to really know is how they found out where I leave?? Why they spend all day following me around?? That goes beyond watching my comings and goings in the building to try and get me in trouble. I also work in a different town than I live in, which is twenty minutes away, so apparently someone is going out of their way to keep tabs on me. Am I crazy or is that a bit too much??? 

After my ADON told me about this I told her about previous incidents of what I called bullying but I'm not sure how to classify it. I told her that many days I used to drive home crying or holding back tears. That I've wanted to quit and been advised to quit many time by my boyfriend. But, (and this is entirely my fault) I stick around because I am one of those people that doesn't like to jump from job to job. I like to be dependable and show that I can stay employed at one place for a long period of time. Plus, I don't want them to win and run me out. Like I said at the beginning, these are small towns without many good job opportunities. But to top it all off, she asked me to keep that information to myself and not to tell her boss, the administrator of the building about the issue. Keep it under wraps is what she said, between me and you. How about the fact that you pretty much just told me a have a stalker and I don't feel safe anymore??!! Like, WTF?? How do they know where I live? Why are they following me?? I already know they hate me enough to put this much into it, what else will they do?? And don't say anything? So of course I ask who this person is and she gives me some excuse, blah blah, she doesn't even know, she got it as a forwarded text from the DON who got it as a forwarded text from some other couple of people. She said it ""went through about five people"" before it got to her. So...why are so many people watching me and concerned with what I am doing? This is not cool. So I don't know who this group of people is (although I have a good feeling it is the group of people at work that ""despise"" me. The group that ""talks so bad about me it makes other people uncomfortable and they have to walk out of the room"" but I still am not being told what is being said. Or maybe the ones that are always telling me watch your back) I don't know anymore. But what I do know is my inside are trembling, I'm stressed out. I don't even want to go back to work but I can't let them win and I can't afford to not work or miss time either, and I can't tell anyone or do anything about it. So I just keep ignoring it and feeling on edge at all times now and not just at work?

717,"Hi everyone,

So, I live/work in Arizona, while my ex wife and our daughter recently moved to California for work. I have a job lined up in CA, but it's just so disgustingly expensive, and I really don't feel like living in a run-down studio apartment making $20/hr just to exist. I have a friend in Henderson, NV, who is trying to convince me to move out there and be roommates (this would bring me about 1.5-2hrs closer to my daughter than I am now). I am incredibly unhappy with where I'm at currently, mainly because of work, so I need to make a move soon.

Is it wrong for me to be a state away from my daughter? Should I bite the bullet and move to California despite the cost of living?

724,"I recently made it my goal in 2020 to be more assertive and decisive. I want to stop people from walking all over me. I've always been such a people pleaser and I'm tired of it - especially at work. I ""work"" (intern) at my aunt's place of work on the side of my part time jobs and going to school part time as well. Lately I've found that her and her boss have been asking a lot of me - more than what was originally outlined when I joined the team. I recently couldn't attend a commitment with them. For backstory, I had said no to attending originally but they kept saying, ""we need you there"" and it felt like I no longer had a choice. I never said yes but they just kept saying that and assumed I'd come. So I just decided, sure I'll attend this one event and help them out. I put in the work before hand in regards to helping them to prep materials and presentations for it. My dog had been sick for the last few days and we took him to the vet. They told us that if it got worse that I should bring him back. I told my aunt this so she was aware of it. That night I said, if it got worse I'd have to bring my dog in tomorrow morning (which is the time of our event). She said okay and that was that. Later that night she asked if I needed a ride to the event and I said sure. The morning came and my dog was worse so approximately 45 mins before I let her know that I wouldn't be able to make it. She was extremely short/rude to me and I haven't seen her or her boss since. I'll be going in tomorrow and I know I'm going to face a heavy meeting. But I know my heart and I know I made the right call. But I feel like they expect so much from me. How to I make sure I stand up for myself?

726,"I'm in a unique situation of loving my life and hating it at the same time.

On one hand, I'm in my early 20's with a cushy office job that pays decently. I have good job security, I'm engaged to the love of my life, I'm supporting myself financially and things seem to be looking up for me.

On the other hand, I really dislike the work that I do, the stress that I'm under, and my outlook on life has diminished. I tend to live by a ""why worry"" philosophy and I've noticed that changing as time goes on. I'm sweating the small stuff, I'm riddled with existential dread, and I feel as though I'm destined to be unfulfilled in my professional life forever. I worry about being fired constantly, coming up short on my goals, or disappointing the people who rely on me. I dont think I need to be in my ""dream job"" to be happy, but I want to do work that I'm at least passionate about.

That being said, I know that my current position is only temporary and the future holds infinite possibilities. What I'm trying to really figure out is, how do I focus on the good things in my life and work towards being consistently happy? All I want is to stop worrying about my future and not care about my life's greater purpose. At the end of the day, all that matters to me is happiness and comfort and I want my psychology to reflect that. 

I know this is a very broad question so I'm open to any and all ideas. Thanks in advance!

""User A is having a problem with version X of program Y. He's on computer Z.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of that information, in about 1/4 of all conversations, one of those will be incorrect.

A little background, ever since my sophomore year I’ve had really bad social anxiety, and it’s made my life hell from then on. Ever since graduating it has gotten a bit better. When I started working at my first job I started opening up a lot more and being more sociable (not surprising because I connect more with older people anyway, I’m an old soul). Even recently, I chatted up a girl at an ice cream place and asked for her number but she was taken. But I was proud of myself cuz that was my first time ever asking a girl in person for it, and me from a couple years ago would’ve never done that. But another problem is I’m a major introvert and barely get out the house unless it’s with my parents, or they have to take me somewhere cuz I don’t have a car of my own. Also, talking to girls I’m attracted to feels like a job and I’m particularly not comfortable around them. It’s like I just wait for them to stop so I can make a quick joke so it can ease it for me a little bit, but overall I’m always on edge what to say next so that’s another reason why I don’t start conversations first as well. I don’t necessarily even want a girlfriend, I just want to have a friends with benefits type of thing with girls I’m actually attracted to. So plz advice is needed on how to meet girls the way I am and specially with no ride of my own.

748,"My gf and I live in an apt townhouse property, typically with very few disturbances. However, my neighbor shot off two rounds through the shared wall of our bedroom the other day. Fortunately, noone was upstairs so there were no injuries or harm caused. I was running to the leasing office to notify what had happened when I saw said neighbor standing outside of his place looking frazzled. Instead, I immediately confronted him about the situation (partly to make sure he didn't just dip out and leave). Honestly, he looked more in shock than I was so I knew he knew he f\*\*\*ked up bad. He kept apologizing as he explained what happened, that he was removing any rounds and clearing the chamber to take it to the range when the gun fired twice. Two exit holes from the wall, one round was stopped by a large pile of my clean clothes, and the other round broke through my bedroom window and buried into a neighboring apt across the field (which, fortunately, was unoccupied). I showed him all the damage, which he immediately offered to fully replace, in addition to getting rid of his two guns (which ideally shouldn't be necessary given proper gun safety, but I was fine with considering his royal f\*\*k up). After acknowledging that noone was hurt, and with minor damages, I took a calmer approach and decided to take this one step at a time. I am now on the fence about reporting the occurrence to the complex/police.. I don't want to screw up the dude's life over an accident, even though it was one caused by extreme negligence and carelessness, and could have been way more traumatic. So if anyone has any advice, as far as how this could unravel if reported, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, I feel I should mention I am a supporter of guns and obviously gun control/safety.

To make the long story short, my boyfriend and I have been together for about three years and prior to me, he was a player and had only slept with girls on dating apps and never settled down with another girl seriously. Flash back to within the first six months of dating he cheated on me with a girl who looked like me because we live an hour away and work so he was really horny and a pig. He also received oral sex from a random girl. He was snap chatting and contacting many women on dating apps with a secret account that i had no recollection of and was receiving nude photos from various women. After i found out, it brought me to a huge depressive state and i couldn’t function. Flash forward to now, we have been a better couple and grown from all the mistakes he had made aside because he genuinely apologized and realized he wanted me in his life and was better. It has two years since and we have taken family vacations from both sides together and are considered family to both of our parents. I just found out he had an urge to cheat again..... i found out today after snooping this his phone which i haven’t done since we had the falling out two years ago, but i had some weird feeling which was the same feeling i had when i first found out about the situation before. We recently went to Florida for Xmas with his family and the day i left... (literally saw me the same day from just getting back on vacation with HIS family), he downloaded an app that was for free texting and was a fake number given to you for a period of time and i used to use it when i was younger and didn’t have data on my iPhone. So, i recognized the capability of the app well. I also caught him recently looking up a girl he slept with prior to our relationship. I confronted him completely and held a strong mentality even though i was falling apart... he admitted he was wrong for doing so and told the truth that he downloaded the app to text women from a dating app and snooped on the girl’s page but didn’t go through with anything and didn’t contact any girl because his conscious told him it was wrong and he shouldn’t do that.

I’m asking for help because i don’t know what to do... I’ve been this tired and helpless feeling person all day today and it’s gotten to the point where I’m so disappointed and heartbroken i have no idea what i should do next. I haven’t talked to him since i kicked him out of my house this morning and he drove back home. I keep crying and it resulted in a migraine and lack of appetite.

Everything and everyone im around gives me anxiety. My family, my work, my roommate(my brother). My childhood was rough and left a mental toll on how i feel about my family. So everytime im around them (holidays, except for my roommate brother) it puts me in a position where i feel like a child. Which inturn stuns my mental growth. And none of them really care about growth. They're content. (Yes I've mildly voiced my concerns). 


Before christmas i was delivering pizzas and hit a deer. My insurance isnt covering anything so its leading me to financial questions about my future. Luckily the damage was minimal. Im signing my car over to the impound to cover fees and im currently shopping for another vehicle.


So, heres the problem. I want to live the minimalist life and ive been looking into Vanlife (travel, live out of a van/wagon type car). I planned on starting this summer (till i hit the deer). To get a vehicle i have to procure a loan and use my credit card as a down payment. Which puts me in a bit of debt. 


Where i currently live my lease is paid off. So i could leave whenever. I've felt this way for years, now i guess i just needed a reason to think about it. 


I want to leave states, leave everyone and everything (except my doggo), and just start over. Though to do that, ill be in a good bit of debt (maybe 3-4k not including rent/utilities where i want to move).

764,"Like I've been on it for about 3 months now and after upping my dose from 25 mgs to 50 I started being unintentionally rude much more often and saying tasteless jokes and stuff I shouldn't have said.  Also, concerning my mood swings, the highs are too high (that's when I do most stuff mentioned and hardly pay attention to what I'm saying). After ruining a friendship and hearing from an another person that I don't respect people's limits enough anymore I talked with my doctor and we reduced it to 25 mgs but just today I also went ""high"" and I did some stuff I hardly even noticed. Idk if it's hypomania but I surely don't have bipolar because it doesn't last for days. I'm asking here because I don't really trust my doctor that much. Should I stop taking Zoloft altogether?

770,"
I need advice regarding my sister who I think is abusing her kids. 
She's my older sister and she has two kids (age 8 and 3) and ever since she gave birth to her first child I was frustrated. 
Her and I never actually had a nice relationship. We were always fighting and hating each other until she became a mother,moved out and suddenly became nice to everyone. 
Then because of her abusive then boyfriend she came back to live with the family,and then she became the person I hate again. I can't describe to you how much I hated her. Just hearing her breathe was enough to infuriate me. Why - the way she acts and treats her kid. 
She used to come off work tired and the kid was obviously happy to see her and she would just tell the kid to leave her alone,go away and etc. And she would often shout at the kid,spank her,call her name's (as in idiot,stupid,moron ...) And curse all the time. And she still does that. Every single day.
Now this kid was raised by all of us during those 2-3 years. Until my sis found another guy and eventually had another kid and they all live together not far away from us. 
But she continues to abuse the first one. She constantly mistreats her, constantly calls her fat and tells her what she shouldn't do while never really taking time to explain and care for her. Never spending quality time. But constantly blaming her for everything, telling the kid she's stupid when she never even bothered explaining something. 
And as for the younger kid..  she treats her better than the older one. A very unfair relationship. Even tho she's not doing a good job with that one either...
She is nice to her kids. But rarely. And I hate being around her and the kids because the way I hear her talk with them and treating them. There are so many things wrong. And there's too much to write now. 
And I talked to her. And so did my parents. Telling her what she does wrong and to raise the kids better. But she won't listen. She's stubborn. And she constantly lashes out her anger on them. And never cared about learning a thing or two about parenthood. And I can see that it has already affected the older kid. She's having troubles at school and she's quite shy and insecure. 
And I don't know how to approach this situation anymore. How do I talk to someone who refuses to listen and refuses to admit her wrongdoings?",13Jan2020,1

772,"So I 20F live a few blocks from my university. I go to a private Jesuit college. I lived at home. 

I have taken a gap year due to my crippling anxiety, which has led to an episode of depression. I am in therapy. I haven’t been feeling as depressed lately. 

I would be a sophomore right now. Since I commuted, it was automatically harder to make friends. I absolutely loved my campus, but the friends were hard. I hung out with one of my lifelong closest friends, and another commuter, and some other acquaintances. But I never made a solid group of new friends. 

So my social circle is small. And it is smaller now rhat I’m taking this gap year. I have a boyfriend, and our relationship is wonderful. He’s the best person I know and I see myself with him for a long time to come. He is also local, but in school. He plays sports for his school and has friends. Lives home and has no problem with it, as he transferred about an hour away at one point but then came back. 

I just feel like a huge loser. I don’t know if it’s because I have nothing going on right now, I didn’t necessarily feel this way when I was in school. But I see these people I know who are in Miami, Colorado, State College PA, etc., all these awesome schools and I’m just home. Is this wrong? Will I ever make friends if I commute and I go back to the same school?

I want to see a new place but at the same time transferring is a huge process and I feel like I’m too behind to make new friends now. 

I also don’t want to leave my boyfriend behind. I know I’m young and I have to live for myself but I love him dearly and I have no interest in finding another guy or hooking up with dudes at parties. I’ve had that time and I don’t care for it.",13Jan2020,1

774,"This is probably the most difficult decision that I have had to make. I suffer from anxiety and depression and after taking care of dogs and feeling so much better, I thought I should get my own dog. I tried to rescue an older dog but since I work full time and live in rented accommodation in the uk, I was not allowed to. We ended up getting a puppy. I know puppies are so much more work and I was willing to put in all the time and effort. The first couple of months were great and I was even able to manage going out of the house because I was so focused on her and my panic attacks were much better. I’m an idiot. I should’ve known it wouldn’t last long. She sometimes barks a lot and the paranoia of my neighbours getting pissed makes me end up getting angry at her. Last week I completely lost it with her and pinned her down out of anger.  Thought I had it under control but today it happened again. I’ve completely stepped back and now my partner will be taking care of her. I’m so ashamed of myself and I know it’s better for her to get rehomed. I can’t believe I am capable of doing this. Never in a million years would I have thought I could do such a horrible thing. I am so ashamed I don’t feel like I can tell anyone.

780,"The situation at hand is getting worse and worse everyday. My social life outside and inside of my house is basically non-existent at this point.

Yes, I do get socially exhausted easily. Even the littlest bit of social interaction with someone makes me fatigued of doing anything to entertain him/her without having the surrounding atmosphere get awkward and boring. It's not that I don't like in the company of someone, it's just how it really is. I like having some time for myself. Call me selfish or anything but i'm more comfortable with being alone because it removes my anxiety of being silently judged by someone else about what I'm doing.

It's a long story of how it continues to affect me like  my classmates talking behind my back, my family and friends snubbing me and feels uncomfortable with me. My enthusiasm and liveliness gets killed everytime whenever they say to me that they don't want to talk to me, even if I'm the one they need to talk to. At the end of it all, it just makes me think that I'm unneeded and thoughts come to my mind like no one will notice when I pass. This is not good.

I just want to let them know that I want to join in and will talk about whatever pops up in the middle of the conversation, because I'm still a normal person. I share their enthusiasm and interest because I do like talking to people. It's just my ability to be able to continue for such an amount of time is low.

I'm not sure what to do. I selfishly dont want to tell her so that I can avoid drama, I don't want to be in the middle of something or mess up someone's potential relationship, I'm also not sure if it's the right thing to do anyway. I was thinking of telling him to tell her and if he wouldn't telling her myself but I don't want to hurt either of them or ruin my friendship with either of them.

783,"Hi there, I'm coming to this forum in the hopes of getting some objective advice on a dilemma I'm having with one of my friends. I've been feeling really conflicted about our friendship and it feels like I can't talk to her. There are a lot of things that have contributed to my questioning how good our friendship is, and I can't talk to her because her attitude is kind of careless. I feel like the things that are bothering me are things she should just be aware of already. 

I hate letting go of friendships. I really do, especially as an adult when it's hard enough to make friends outside of work. But here are the reasons why I'm thinking about giving this one up.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **She doesn't pay me back** \- I find this to be the easiest reason to explain because it's so quantitative and it's been happening a lot. The first time this happened was when we went on a trip together and I booked the room with my card with the agreement that she would reimburse her share. At the last minute, her sister decided to come along, and I booked another room for her. She (my friend) told me either she or her sister would pay me back eventually. Neither of them did, and I waited a few months and then gently brought it up through a text message. She responded by saying ""Actually I \*did\* pay you back, but I don't think my sister paid her share."" She didn't pay me back though, I'm pretty sure she was recalling a different trip we took together where she gave me cash, but she never paid me the second one. So I decided to just let it go because she really believed she paid me and I wasn't hung up about the money, as much as I was about the thoughtlessness. We were also driving around a lot in my car, and neither her or her sister offered to help out with gas, which also really bothered me. The second time she didn't pay me back was when we recently took a trip to England and she said she'd Venmo me whenever we needed to get an Uber. I kept track - I paid for a few Uber rides that added up to about $210 (this is excluding the shorter Uber rides we took, and also the times I paid for expensive meals), and she never thought to pay me. I've come up with a lot of reasons for why this is, and I think she her circle of friends are little loose about who pays for things and when to pay each other back. But at the same time, I've looked through her Venmo feed and I've seen her pay other people for rides and meals but she doesn't pay me without a reminder. It's not like I don't have the money to pay for things (though I make significantly less than her), it just doesn't seem fair to me, and it comes off like she doesn't really care.
2. **When we have conversations about politics, she plays devil's advocate specifically to get a rise out of me -** not because she wants to have a real conversation. I normally enjoy having real, civil conversations with people whose views differ from mine. I tend to have pretty feminist values, and my friend does not identify as a feminist at all. She provokes me and nitpicks at my arguments just to antagonize me, and then she laughs when I get annoyed. Here's an example - we watched Little Women and afterwards we were talking about the meaning of the movie, and she said she thought it was so inspiring how Jo March overcame all the odds against her. And I mentioned how I thought the movie did a good job illustrating how difficult it was for women to find financial independence at that time. And for some reason, she just wanted to argue with me. And she said, ""Well yeah, but it was hard for everyone who was poor at that time."" I said, sure, but that it would be easier for a man who was poor to find opportunity than a woman. She kept arguing with me, I'm not sure why. I mentioned how it wasn't legal for women to get credit cards until the 1970s, and she was like oh that's true, but when were credit cards invented again? And I told her the 50s, and then I asked her why she was arguing with me. She just laughed, and then jokingly threatened to lock me in the laundry room because apparently I wasn't having a sense of humor. It would take her NOTHING to just say ""Oh wow, yes, women had a rough time back then"" or even ""hey this stuff depresses me, let's not talk about it"" but instead she goes through the EFFORT of arguing with me just because it's entertaining to her. It's almost like talking to a RedPilled man. Or like being a kid and your younger sibling who is just trying to get a rise out of you. Not fun.
3. **When we're traveling or out together, she sometimes ""ditches"" me to hang out with her other friends, or gives me a last-thought invite because she feels guilty -** Okay, so this is very middle school and shouldn't be happening as an adult. It normally wouldn't bother me, but the way it happens just feels really hurtful. Here's an example - we were at a movie together, and when it ended, a group of her other friends happened to be there. We were about to get something to eat afterwards, but she seemed to forget I was there. She didn't bother to introduce me. So her group invited her to get food with them, very explicitly ignoring me, and she started walking forward and then she stopped and turned to look at me, with an expression like she had literally forgotten I was there. It was so surreal. I think she \*did\* forget that I was there. So I just told her to go have fun and then went home. Later she sent me a text message riddled with ""laugh/sweat"" emojis apologizing for ""ditching"" me. I said it was okay. It was clear I think her friends didn't like me. I don't think they're the type to backbite, but they were definitely very exclusionary. I didn't fault her friends so much as I faulted her for being so thoughtless and hurtful, but I never said anything. Something similar happened recently where we met up with some of her friends in London, and she didn't bother to introduce me. 
4. **She gets threatened when we're together and I receive male attention -** this has only happened a few times. Everyone has insecurities, but sometimes hers turns into something really negative in our friendship. We once went to a mixer together, and I met one of her friends. I thought he was pretty sleazy to be honest. He had a few drinks and he was flirting with my friend. She wasn't into him at all, but she definitely enjoyed the attention. He started hitting on me too, and I didn't lean into it. Later when we were alone, she mentioned that he was always into her and hitting on her. And I told her, yeah it looked like he was hitting on both of us tonight. And the look on her face said it all. It really just...ugh, it turned me off so much. It would be one thing if it was a man she was actually interested in, but she got jealous that he was giving me (unwanted) attention, as much as he was giving it to her. This has happened a few times.
5. **She interrupts me when I'm talking, derails the conversation more often than not to revolve around herself, and then forgets what I was saying -** this one I think doesn't need much explanation. It happens every time we're together. She's told me she's aware she does it but at the same time she makes no effort to change it. Sometimes, when I'm finished talking about something, she'll say, ""Anyway,"" and then change the subject to be about herself. She's also on her phone a lot in and stops listening in the middle of when I'm talking, and a lot of times I've just stopped talking when she does it. It makes her a terrible listener and makes for a really one-sided conversation. 
6. **Double standards -** there've been a lot of instances where she'll do something, but criticize me for doing the same thing. She doesn't realize she's doing it, and when I recently called her out on it, she kind of laughed and admitted that she did do it. But then she kind of doubled down on the things she does, saying, ""You have a problem with that?"" Very petty high school bullshit that I'm tired of. It makes it so I can't really be myself around her. To be honest, it feels like being in a psychologically abusive relationship. 

These are the main reasons why I'm thinking about slowly letting this friendship go. With all of these things combined, it often makes me feel like sh\*\* about myself when I hang out with her. Like she doesn't value me as a person, my time, my thoughts, or feelings, she's willing to laugh it off when I get upset about any of these things and tell me I need to lighten up. Again, like talking to a RedPilled man but worse because she's a woman. 

As I'm questioning our friendship, I'm also thinking about the reasons we became friends to begin with and why I'm having a hard time deciding whether to let her go. Here are my main reasons: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **She's one of few friends I have who are from the same culture as me -** I get that this isn't the best reason to stay friends with someone, but where I live it's really hard to find other Iraqi people to be friends with. It's really important to me to have people outside of my family who I can speak my native language with and who ""gets"" that part of me. 
2. **She's fun, outgoing, and spontaneous** \- I tend to be pretty introverted most of the time and I often crave the energy that extroverted people have. For the most part, she's really fun to hang out with, things never get ""too heavy"" when we're together and we always have a good time. We travel a lot together because we're both the type of person who is down for anything. 
3. **Recently, when I was in a bad spot, she did something unforgettably nice for me -** I won't get into the details but I was in a really bad circumstance with one of my family members and she covered for me when she didn't have to. I'll never forget that she did this for me. 
4. **Overall she's a good person -** she's very generous, nurturing, and ""nice"" overall. But again, I'm finding that the niceness only goes so deep. 

I don't know what to do. There are moments where it seems like if I disappeared she wouldn't even notice or care. I'm sorry for the ranting post, but writing this all out has helped me reflect on what the issues are. Thank you to anyone who read this far.",13Jan2020,1

785,"Current student in an online BA Computer Science program, and I put my capstone off like an idiot. The whole thing has me paralyzed with anxiety, but I'm going to attempt to get this done. I have two weeks left. I haven't asked any friends for help because I'm embarrassed to say how horribly I procrastinated.

The capstone concludes with a 25 page research paper in the theme of my major. Because it's a bachelor in arts, there will still be a traditional thesis to prove. After all the papers I've written, I'm still terrible at developing my own theses. I actually enjoy the research. There's tons of subjects I'd like to explore. And if someone asks me to argue for or against an existing point, I can do it. I just struggle creating an argument that needs to fill specifically x amount of pages, must be debatable from either side, and is not too broad or too specific.

Examples of topics I've been researching:

* Autonomous vehicles - My idea for a thesis was to say something about how the benefit of autonomous vehicles will greatly outweigh the negatives. But I had a hard time finding any opposing opinions to this.
* How to address autonomous power, i.e. who gets to decide how much power we hand over to AI?
* When AI advances to the point of passing the Turing test (behaving indistinguishably from a human being), should we handle it with ethical boundaries?
* How to handle technology advancing faster than we can properly regulate it. Can it be regulated?

I'm genuinely not asking for anyone to make me a thesis. I would rather make it something I'm interested in proving. I'm just hoping for guidance, so I can stop spiraling down all these rabbit holes.",13Jan2020,1

794,"Created this throw away just for this post. On mobile so formatting issues will happen. Sorry. Its also a long post.

Im still keeping it vague just in case.

Some background. I am from a western country. Im in my 30's. I grew up very close to my family. I had the traditional nuclear family. One mom, one dad and a sibling.

My father passed a few years ago and about 2 years after I started seeing a counsellor because I wasnt coping well. Tbh I should have gone before he died. He died of a terminal illness, so its not like it was sudden. He died a bit sooner than expected, but otherwise par for the course. Aside from my partner he was my best friend.

He was also what kept my family together and held my mother and sibling in line.

Things quickly deteriorated after he died. About 6 months after starting counselling I finally got the courage to cut my sibling and mother out of my life. That ended about as well as expected. 

I suppose its important to mention that I was never physically or sexually abused in any way. As for emotional abuse, while I wouldnt say it was abusive there were certainly things that were not good. Controlling is a word that has been used quite a bit. My mothers relationship was always tumultuous with my sibling and one of the things that was the last straw with her was a large incident involving the sibling. Since cutting them off I have gotten wind that they are now back to being sociable again.

Ive continued seeing a counsellor and on a whole am doing better, except for one thing. Every so often I find things that make me so angry at her (for example, im trying to clean up my living space and went through a box of things and found something that she threw in a box to give to me of ""my stuff"" that would have/should have had significant emotional value to her that wasnt even mine ir related to me in any way).

Im tired of feeling angry at her. I want to be done with it. I feel like every time I feel like this she ""wins"" even though I know this isnt the case. I just, dont want to feel this any more. I want to move on but am struggling to do so.

If it makes any difference I live and work in a similar area to where I grew up and due to situation moving isnt feasible for me and my partner, so moving and making a clean break isnt possible at this time. I have brought it up with my counsellor and they haven't given me a straight answer. Mostly just that it took a long time for all these patterns to get this way and it will take time for it to resolve.

My partner has been incredibly supportive of all of this, and he too says it will just take time.

But im ready to stop, and I want to move on.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I know that porn is extremely normal, but ever since we got together, I have felt zero desire to watch porn or even masturbate (I’ve only masturbated a handful of times in these 3 years) so I have assumed that he pretty much gave it up to.

He tells me he almost never seeks it out because of our frequent sex, but now I was just on his phone and scrolling on reddit when I came across multiple porn subreddits.

I have a family and a girlfriend and quite a lot of plans for the future months.  I have been just told that my company wants to send me to Japan to address some issues we have been having.  Originally it was something like 2-3 months and I would be back, i was hesitant but interested none the less.  As i was just coming around to the idea i was told that they were thinking it would be more like 2-3 months there, a week to a month back, and another 2-3 months there.

  
When i first heard this i was scared and shocked and didn't know what i would say, so i just said i would consider it.  I know they would take care of my apartment and lease and many things like that, money is not my concern.  My concern is just a simple what do i do?

On one hand its fun and exciting and new and i would get amazing experience, but on the other hand i would be practically alone (no one in our Japanese office is below 50) in a new country/culture for a long time.

803,"So I don’t drink everyday. I don’t feel the need to drink everyday. I can go weeks without drinking, that’s not the problem. 

I seem to struggle with limits. I think part of it is that I drink fairly quick and sometimes I don’t realize how drunk I’m getting until it’s too late. I go from tipsy to hammered real quick. There doesn’t seem to be an in between for me. 

The issue with limits doesn’t happen all the time. If I’m at home with friends I’m fine. If we just go to dinner/happy hour and have some food and drinks I’m fine. It’s when I go out (like downtown to a show/bar) I seem to lose the concept of limits. I get excited in the atmosphere and just don’t stop. 

I enjoy drinking, but I’m starting to feel embarrassed on the occasions I get way more drunk than everyone else. I’m also getting older and if I really overdo it I’ll spend an entire day nursing a hangover. 

Has anyone else struggled with “when to stop” and if so what did you do to gain more control of it? Stop drinking completely? A glass of water after every drink? Lately I’ve been trying picking a friend and matching their pace but I’m a bit of a lightweight and sometimes end up way more drunk than everyone else even keeping their pace. 

I want to be able to go out and have fun with my friends. No one particularly cares if I’m more drunk than them. Sometimes they don’t even notice. No one has said anything to me about it, I just don’t want to be “that friend” who always goes too hard. 

I would also like to add outside of killer hangovers my drinking habits haven’t brought on any issues. I don’t go home with people, I don’t drive, I don’t make poor choices, I work a full time job and only “go out” on the occasional weekend. Just seems like every time I do “go out” I wake up wondering wtf I was thinking getting so drunk. I would say this occurrence happens once a month, if that.

805,"It's been a while since we're together (LDR), currently both of us are going to take up an exam next month.

So the mobile has been a big distraction for both of us, we decided to study on video call for a while and not to touch it while studying, it was working out pretty well and i was okay with it, but she would still use it instead, but not that much, so it's fine.

But it's been going on since 3 months or so, i usually remind her not to use the mobile etc. So she kinda became over dependent on me, which i didn't expected her to be, but it's not easy as it seems.

I do that because i don't want her to waste valuable time, and she would listen to me.
But last morning i forgot to remind her about it, and i overslept.
After a while she called me instead and said; why I didn't call her etc, she would just hang up abruptly, i even told her i overslept unknowingly.

I got very irritated the way she behaved and i didn't want to talk to her for that thing, when she called in the evening, I didn't pickup because I didn't want to talk to her for that, so she became very toxic, she would start saying things like; ""I'm losing interest for you idk, all she was doing is for my sake so that i don't get hurt etc, why did i come to her life and many more""
She usually doesn't have any control over her temper, she would sometimes say things and forget eventually.
But it was too much this time, she loves me i know that for sure, but that was very immature and not okay.

Next day she becomes normal and talk normally to me, when i tried to talk to her about the previous day, she would say she forgot everything, and said i have to forget too.
It was frustrating to hear, she said sorry last night but just sorry wasn't enough, i was expecting an explanation, she wouldn't, it's very irritating.
That makes me question our love and time together, she said 'i love you' more times than me during our time, and she still does, but why would she say those things, although she doesn't have any control over her anger but it still bothers me.

806,"Hey all,

So recently i’ve been working for at a grocery store as an assistant manager for the last 6 months. The job has been okay, the management is really micro managed, but the pay is the best i’ve had.

My owner is a bit unpredictable to say the least. He’s very high energy, and stressed out very easily. 

I’ve developed a couple close-ish relationships with employees at this job, but nothing too crazy to make me stay because of it.

So the scolding. The other day I was called to the front of the store for a “wet clean up” because a customer spilled a jar of pickles all over a cashier’s till, resulting in the scale ($2500 scale) soaked in pickle juice and pickle juice all over the floor. I walked up to the front to see my owner standing there and yelled “I need your help!” So my first instinct to a wet clean up, was to go get a mop because at this time I didn’t know where the mess was, as I hadn’t entirely seen the mess (he told me to help from about 30 feet away) When I came back with the mop he greeted me by saying “WHY WOULD YOU GRAB THE MOP?” in front of all the customers, who gave me a “uhhhh” kind of look. And I said “because I thought there was a spill.” He proceeded to tell me to “Go get an empty box” and to “be quick” I asked him where I was supposed to get an empty box as i’m still fairly new. He replied with “Go to the back room, where else? Use your head.” And I took offence to this as it seemed like he was treating me like I was stupid. So I said to him “Why are you talking to me like that?” And he told me word for word, “If you don’t like the way I talk to you, then there’s the door *points*” IN FRONT OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS. I was in shock. I asked him “What’s wrong with you?” and he kind of shouted at me saying “I want to go home!!” and I told him to leave, and that id take care of it. He dropped what he was doing and left me to do it all. He then called me on one of the phones from his office, and yelled at me to “FIX THE SCALE BEFORE IT BREAKS, BECAUSE YOURE TAKING SO LONG!”

I was so stressed out and annoyed. He came up to me and brought me into his office to talk. As soon as we got into the office he started yelling at me, telling me that I took too long to clean up the mess, and that i should have been more aware etc, etc. And I lost my shit. I got into his face and told him that “I don’t appreciate the way you talk to me” and that it’s “completely unacceptable” and that he lacks communication skills and didn’t tell me he wanted a box in the first place. He told me to “not be a cry baby” and that he “realizes now that he can’t talk to
me like how a manager is supposed to be talked to because i’m too sensitive”

I was in utter shock and disbelief and told him that he’s crazy. He then apologized, and told me that “he’s under pressure.” 

I worked the rest of my shift, because he left 10 minutes later. The entire night I was so stressed out, angry, upset, annoyed. I’ve never been treated like that before by an employer. I talked to my family and girlfriend and they all told me I should find another job maybe.

I reached out to my old employer who I still have a good relationship with, and told them I want to schedule a meeting for a possible opportunity to come back, and they agreed and are all for it.

The only problem is that I would be taking a significant pay cut. Approximately 40% pay cut. I can afford it, I just don’t know if it’s worth it as I am going back to school in May. So currently I am trying to weigh out all the pros and cons of this job. I feel really miserable here. My schedule is super up and down. I work shifts and cover shifts all the time without even being asked because my manager “expects it because i’m at the bottom of the totem pole” I miss having a monday to friday, 9-5 job (which i’d have if I go back to my old job). I have my personal relationships there as well, it’s just the pay is so low..

What should I do? Stick it out till school, and be completely miserable but make decent money. Or go back, make a lot less, but give up a ton of responsibilities, and be genuinely happy there.

TL;DR: Boss treats me terribly, want to go back to
old job but they pay significantly less (~40%) but I would be a lot happier.",13Jan2020,1

It really started about a year ago, in which she took the rent money my boyfriend and I were paying her and did ??? With it. I'm unsure. My mother has always been bad with bills. I was evicted from every house I grew up in.  

In March of 2019 we were evicted. It was a struggle to find a new place. We came within 24 hours of being on the street, because of her, AGAIN. She sees no problem with her behavior. 

As soon as we move to the new place her car dies. No fix, old car, she gets a rental car. 
 
A month later she gets fired for threatening a fellow employee. 

Fast forward to September, she is living on a withdrawn retirement fund. She still has the rental car. 

One night I go to the farmers market with her and forget my debit card in the car, I walk to the parking lot and open the passenger side door. A police officer storms the car with a gun to my head and orders me to put my hands up. I comply but am treated roughly and handcuffed against the cruiser. 

I am then told I'm in possession of a stolen vehicle. I have no license. I don't drive due to health issues. I tell the officer as such and my mom is brought out of the store. I am freed and she is taken to prison.

While incarcerated she suffers a near heart attack as a result of stress and lack of BP meds, I feel guilty and bond her out (using whats left of her retirement money) 

She is taken home to await a court date. She has no money left. She has had one interview in almost one year. I'm so fed up and I've had so many knock down blow out arguments where she changed her behavior for a few weeks and then goes back to being selfish and manipulative. 

I'm so tired, and stressed. I feel like I need to talk to someone but it's so difficult for me to express myself verbally concerning my emotions. 

I feel so guilty for wanting no contact with my mother, yet I'm not strong enough to put her out. I'm also responsible if she doesn't show up for court dates. 

I see so many post where peoples mother's died young and how they miss their mothers so much and I know deep down I'd miss her if I went NC and put her out. I'm just so torn and depressed and this whole situation is just like a raw and open wound that won't heal. 

My brothers help minimally, but they've all moved on and have their own family. So it's really just to majority burden on me.  I feel like I'm at a breaking point. I need help.",13Jan2020,1
819,"Hey, I am an 18 year male who lives in Connecticut and just completed high school back in June 2019. I graduated from a trade school so I spent 4 years taking I.T. as a trade. I have interest in attending community college but decided not to register for the fall semester and started working to have some money to my name for once. I currently work as a Cart Retriever at my local BJs for minimum wage. For the past year I have lived with my girlfriend who works full time at our local hospital making $16.50 an hour. We recently have been evicted from our home so we moved in with my mom for the time being with our 5 cats. This situation has been really hard on us and now I’m feeling pressured to earn more money so I can help out more. Any suggestions on what my next step should be? Is there any program I should take/do related to I.T. (or Computer Science)? The cost of living in Connecticut isn’t cheap and I really just want to be stable and start making moves to better my life. Any answered are appreciated, thank you.",13Jan2020,1

823,"I am currently working for a federal agency. I got a job offer to work at a different agency 5 months ago, and have been waiting on my clearance to finish.

It finally finished, and they want me to start ASAP. The only problem is that I recently found out I will need to have surgery soon. The doctor recommended 3 weeks out of work to recover. At the end of those 3 weeks, I will be starting my new job.

If I give my notice to my current job before surgery, I will not be eligible for FMLA, which means I will not be able to take all 3 weeks off (I only have 2 weeks of annual and sick leave combined saved up). So I can’t tell them before I take leave. 

If I give my notice while I’m on FMLA, they would be able to terminate me immediately, which means a lapse in health coverage, which is no bueno. 

I already asked my new employer to push my start date back even further, and they said no. 

What do I do? How do I navigate leaving? Do I take the risk and give them my 2 weeks notice before surgery? Do I give them my notice after surgery? Or do I not give them notice at all.

We’ve been friends for a long time but recently we started hanging out outside our usual group, just the two of us. This evolved quickly into us making out but nothing more. He wanted to wait until I was 18 to start anything with me but couldn’t wait because our other friend made a move on me and he didn’t want me to get into a relationship with him. So he’s clarified if we started doing stuff we wouldn’t be doing anything serious (meaning we wouldn’t be in a relationship just fuck buddies ig). 

But now he’s started to treat me a lot different. We’ve started to actually hangout too, not just hangout but actually talk. He tells me he likes to listen to me talk but he’s not good at opening up himself. He calls himself self deprecating things quite often and he’s told me a few things about himself but that’s more than the majority of our friend group knows about him. I opened up to him a lot and told him about my family and when I was high I texted him and told him I wanted to die. He freaked out and thought I was about to kill myself and went on a ran about how he cares about me and he’d listen to my problems and such. He keeps telling me he likes it when i wear his jacket and it smells like me when he gets it back. I left a note to self thing I do for my mental health in his pocket by accident and he found it and instead of throwing it away kept it in his room and told me he cares about me and worries about my mental health sometimes. He also gives me these really long hugs when we’re out with friends when I seem down. He acts different around me then he does with the other guys but that’s probably because I’m a girl. He’s really sweet on me and texts me like three times a day. One time he asked if I had eaten that day and I said no so he drove to my house and took me to McDonald’s at midnight. 

I don’t know if this is just what him as a friend looks like.

My freshman year of college wasn’t completely terrible grade wise, I think around a 2.85 gpa, but my second year was just a collapse. I didn’t get one grade above a C and failed 2 classes. I was extremely depressed throughout the year and found my self smoking pot 3-4 times a day and drinking every night. I had 0 motivation for school because 
1) I don’t retain any information I learn from classes 
2) I’m not interested in any class
3) My goal in life is to start a business in which no degree is required 
4) i dont want a bullshit ass job where will want to kill my self every morning

Not trying to invade your privacy whatsoever, however,  I read it, not realizing it was yours.  Firstly, do you want it back?  If not, may I keep your notes, or would you prefer I destroy them?  I would certainly return the book to you if you had intended to keep it.  Otherwise, being a very spiritual person, and having a higher degree in behavioral studies, I like what you wrote,  am interested to understand the purpose of writing what's there, and would like to keep them.  Not realizing the book was not 100% unused, I wanted it to work on my 4th step in a 12 step program I am in.  I'm very interested to receive your feedback.
Sorry to write so much and in Hope's that I am not disturbing you with my attempt to make contact.
I look forward to your reply.

I have a 30 on the ACT, a solidly well-off family, I go to a private school, I have great grades, and I have less than 4 months to figure out what the hell I’m going to do with my life. I’m terrified. I want to go to college and major in 2D or 3D animation, but I am fully aware of just how inconsistent, unreliable, and risky a career in art would be, but it’s the only thing I’ve ever considered that I think I would enjoy doing for a living. But, very few schools offer the major that I am looking for.  I know that I’m intelligent enough to pick a different degree or major that I would be less happy with but be more secure in, but I don’t know if I should choose financial security and safety, or choose happiness and risk my future stability. I love sports, and I want to run track in college and be recruited to a low-end D1 school, but the only offers I’ve gotten have been from D3 schools that have nothing that I’m interested in. I’m currently planning to hold out until track season is almost over and pray that my times will improve enough to get me noticed, but I know that the chances are slim. 

I’m scared. I don’t want to make the wrong decision by choosing art and finding out that I hate it and wasting time switching to a normal school, but I also don’t want to be unsatisfied with my occupation for the majority of my life. I don’t know whether I should look for more majors, or reevaluate my situation or what, but I just need someone to give me realistic advice and help me channel my options.

838,"My mother and I haven't always gotten along. There are some days where we gossip and joke around about everything and some days where we can't even look each other in the face because of hate. It gets complicated since I can't understand my mother. I've always tried to understand her, but it just makes things worse. Since I was little, I cried and cried because of hurtful things she said, and how she treated me sometimes. I know that some of it is because I had an abusive father which affected her mental health tremendously. She only cared about keeping me safe and healthy, but there never was a mother-daughter relationship being built. I never got affection or the basic attention a child should get when they're little. And I don't blame her, I understand why she did everything and the choices she made when I was a child, she did the best she could for me. 
Growing up, we were very distant, I didn't argue too much with her but I still hated her at times. She would lash out at me for things that don't make sense, and over time it has made me furious. I am now 17, and I am very sensitive when I'm around her. She still lashes out at me and gets mad when I ask for basic things, for example: I wanted to go out because I stayed home all week, and I just wanted to go somewhere to buy food for all the family and come back. She go mad out of nowhere and all the way to the place we went to pick up some food, she was complaining about me and getting angrier and angrier at me. This happens often. And this has made me so angry towards her. I am constantly angry and frustrated when I'm around her. Before I wouldn't say anything and keep my mouth shut but now I always scream back at her at why she gets mad at me for nothing and why she treats me the way she does sometimes. She can be mad at me all afternoon and the next day she talks to me like nothing happened, while I'm still mad and extremely frustrated for everything. Then she gets mad because I'm mad. I just feel like I'm building up so many negative feelings over time and I hate it, because I shouldn't feel like this towards my own mother.

One time we were arguing in my room and I just burst down in tears telling her how she didn't have a right to tell me why I wasn't affectionate towards her. I couldn't even believe she said that since it's her fault that I'm not affectionate towards anyone. I wasn't raised to be like that. And it frustrated me so much because she was claiming why I wasn't hugging her and telling her that I loved her like some of my friends do with their parents.  We talked and discussed for two hours and at the end we promised we would change for the better. She said she was sorry about everything. I thought everything was going to get better, I was very happy about it. It was weird though, we have never talked to each other that way, we never talked about our feelings until that moment. Everything was good for a week, and then out of nowhere the same thing as always happened again. She got mad at me out of nowhere and started lashing out at me. After that I was so angry, frustrated and confused. Everything we talked about was for nothing. I gave up trying to get better and we have slowly gone back to the place we were. We sometimes have our good times and joke around but most of the time she is angry at me and i reciprocate the feeling. I hate being this way with her, because I feel so much hatred building up inside me, way too much resentment too. I want to talk to her but at the same time I really don't, I feel like it's going to be for nothing all over again and make me even angrier thinking that things could ever get better.
Am I selfish for feeling this way towards the person who was given me everything? The person who I owe everything to? She gave me my life, she has given me everything she could and I feel this horrible way towards her.

Sorry this is way too long, I just wan to talk about it, say how I feel. Need these feelings to somehow go away.",13Jan2020,1

Quite literally. I'm barely eating. My friends don't really do much grocery shopping so there's scarce food around the house. Usually a sandwich here or there. Some eggs every once in awhile. 



I'm kinda eating once every two days with money I scrap up on my walk to work. I work at a fast food joint. But I can't really sneak food or ask for free stuff. Because I'd have the chance to lose my job doing that.


I'm homeless because my dad kicked me out in his delusion that he should own my life and force me to do what he wants me to do. He did this before and I made the mistake of going back.

My boss filed for bankruptcy and didn't tell me until the day the bank came and put new locks on the door. I didn't get my last paycheck and he never payed into unemployment.

So, for my Xmas gift my parents booked me and my “best friend” a trip to DC. We’ve been on and off friends since 2011. We are both 18. They booked the Train and hostel. And we just came back yesterday. Parents don’t really like my friend (she made fake hate accounts about me years ago and secretly video recorded my entire family calling them white trash) but they didn’t want me to go with my boyfriend and they told me to pretty much babysit her before we went.

We Took a 17 hour train ride to DC from Chicago and stayed for 8 days. 

On the train - She wanted me to sleep in observation car so she could lay out in our seats. Gave me an attitude when I came back to seats. Got pissy because she brought too much luggage and had me pay for her extra suitcase. 
Kept going up and down aisles while others were sleeping. Inconsiderate and didn’t care. Kept bitching about no service and how she’s bored. I didn’t want to say anything because she’s argumentative as fuck. I was already annoyed on the train. She also kept calling me names and loudly announced how I need to stop sharting my pants and that I smell like an onion patch (neither are true she’s just being an obnoxious jerk).

We finally got to DC. 
She brought her speaker and She starts blasting explicit dirty rap music and porn complete with smacking noises and kept banging the headboard off the wall. You could hear the music from the elevator. When I told her to turn it down she told me to F off. She also opened the window and blasted the music and was looking for reactions from people on the streets. She also mooned people from the window and lifted up her bra and yelled t!tties in a man voice.  

I believe my friend also wiped her a** and smeared feces on the walls in the communal bathroom because it wasn’t there before she went in there (several times) Of course she denied it but that’s something she would do (she did gross things in the school bathroom before) Somebody also took a literal dump on the shower floor itself and there was poopy toilet paper in all the sinks. She was laughing. Absolutely disgusting. 

She kept talking in Australian accent through the hostel hallways and elevators and was yelling fck me baby, oh aching clitoris where are you, cum in my pu**y, I got the strap on waiting in the room and just all these disgusting sexual things and thought it was hilarious. It was embarrassing. It was also at like 1 or 2am.

She also kept calling me a dumba** and just saying all this hateful stuff really loudly and I told her it’s rude and hurtful and she laughs and says she’s just joking and I said I’m starting to wonder. (I believe she thinks self deprecating is hilarious)

She also made us walk to Arlington in the middle of the night from dc. It was freezing cold and it hurt my lungs to breathe and she said “I don’t fkn care about you I’m gonna keep walking bye ya fkn loser” I was irritated.  

I had to keep paying for ubers the entire time when the metro was closed because she refused and I couldn’t leave her because if I don’t see her again my parents would’ve flipped. 

When she gets angry she will walk away and not answer her phone exactly why my parents told me to watch her and why I couldn’t say anything to her. 

She also made us stop at the pentagon when on the metro (to look at the memorial) at 10:30pm and I felt extremely uncomfortable. 

On day we were suppose to come home - She wouldn’t let me see the train tickets (physical copy) and kept talking about how she didn’t want to go back home before it was time to board. She told me the train left at 7:30pm (it left at 4:05pm) she didn’t get back until 6 and goes oh shit the train left and started laughing. My parents were furious that we missed the train and pretty much wasted their money.  My boyfriend paid for greyhound tickets back and my friend was saying how her mom would drive to dc and pick her up and told me to go myself. My boyfriend and parents bought her a ticket and my parents told me so help me if your friend doesn’t come back with you and I had to practically beg her to come back with me on the greyhound. 

Throughout the trip She kept yelling at me to leave her alone  and to stop watching her every move. We were at a restaurant and she moved tables and I was video calling my boyfriend and I look over and she left the entire restaurant. I started crying and panicking to my boyfriend and he said that my friend is an ahole and he felt really bad for me. I told him I couldn’t wait until the trip was over. My dad called and I explained what happened and he yelled at me to go look for her. Long story short she was outside the metro station a few streets down talking to someone and badmouthing me to them. She saw me and was like “oh look the annoying fk decided to get off the phone with her middle eastern fkboy and followed me” I told her that is ignorant and she doesn’t even know him (they never met) and she said and I don’t want to know him he’s a controlling ahole (wtf?) 

We were at the air and space smithsonian and she left without me knowing and wouldn’t answer her phone. I got yelled at for not watching her and I better find her. Or police would get involved. I was crying at that point. 

She also got extremely angry that we left the hotel at like 2-3pm some days (because we were out all night) and she said we didn’t come to dc to sit in a hotel room all day. She was limping around dc because she hurt her leg (too much walking) and was still wanting to go on more forest marches. 

My parents got a $170 cleaning fee because she trashed the hotel room and they are making me pay it back because she’s my friend (but I didn’t trash the room). I also have to pay back for the greyhound tickets. 

This was my Christmas gift and I had a miserable time but my friend loved it and she’s now asking when we are going on another trip again. I left her on read. She has some nerve. I’ve been getting yelled at all weekend and scolded and she’s gotten nothing from her parents (probably because all they gave her was spending money and my parents paid for everything else).

We have gotten into 3 major breakup fights in the past because of her toxic behavior and I think she abuses my forgiveness and kindness for when she needs someone because she has nobody and I’m pretty positive I’m over it and done being used by her.",13Jan2020,1

847,So I've never had a gf really and I'm still a virgin. This has been causing my sex drive to spike through the roof in recent months. All my friends are having sex with their partners by this point and it's making me desire it more. I have quite a few friends up here at college who are girls and every time I'm around them I'm constantly just thinking about having sex with them. I'd never rape anybody for the record and would only have sex if they consented to it. But these thoughts are not good for me to have all the time. I've already bought condoms and am trying to go over to one of my friends place next week. I never planned to have sex with somebody who I'm  not dating but idk how much longer that I can hold off. How can I get out of this strong desire before I end up being stupid and becoming a dad at 19 or something. I know this is a pitiful thing to ask advice for but I really want all these sexual thoughts out of my head,13Jan2020,1
848," I ran into a situation recently that I had a difficult time getting a read on, and wanted to get some extra eyes on for additional perspective and feedback. Apologies for the length!

A few weeks back, I (27M) met up with a friend (27F) that I had a crush on years ago. We've known each other for a solid 15 years at this point, and been good friends for the past 12. She'd disappeared abruptly near the end of 2014 and had been out of contact with a lot of her friends and family for a long time. We started talking again in 2017 after I reached out and got a reply. She'd moved out of state and felt like she'd needed to restart, and we eventually started texting fairly regularly and doing phone calls every few months. The last time we'd talked was this August, and while we'd previously asked each other if we were dating anyone, she mentioned (after hesitating for a second) that she was seeing someone now, and mentioning him as being a nicer guy than she usually dated, which she found refreshing. That bugged me a bit, but we did end up making plans to meet halfway and see each other in October in any case (which fell through on both our ends, unfortunately.) She ended up texting me on Dec 19th, saying she was going to be in town for one day on the 26th and asking if I wanted to meet up for the day, which I immediately agreed to! She texted later after a delayed flight, and said that because of family issues, she'd only be able to do a few hours instead of a full day.

It was the first time I'd seen we'd seen each other in person in just over 5 years, and right off the bat I got a longer-than-expected hug. We ended up exchanging Christmas presents (been doing it annually for the last few years,) and she got me an action figure of my favorite presidential candidate, and a shirt from her favorite brewery that she said matched my eyes. We went for a walk for a bit before we got cold, so we stopped by a bar to hang out. We ended up catching up for a solid two hours, and had a great time. She mentioned that she thought about me a lot, even if she didn't text or call as much, and jokingly suggested that I move to her area. She also said that she thought I was one of the people she'd never have enough of in her life. We talked about how work and school were going, and how things have changed since we were younger. She invited me to come visit her during the summer, and we started getting into what we could do, and her favorite things she recommended.

She did end up mentioning her boyfriend briefly and how he was nicer than dudes she's dated in the past, but also said she didn't know how long he'd last. Apparently he'd been accepted to med school and she didn't think he'd be sticking around.

She ended up having to head out, but we walked around a bit more before she left and promised to keep in better contact. She also wanted a picture together since we don't really have many. We've been texting semi-regularly since then.

We've never discussed a potential relationship, but from the way we interacted, I think it might be worth exploring if her current relationship ends. I felt like I was, at the very least, getting some pretty hefty mixed signals. I'm trying not to get ahead of myself or put anything on a pedestal, but I think that there might be something there and wanted to get some outside perspective. Any (constructive) feedback is appreciated!

TL;DR- Female friend is giving off some more-than-friendly vibes and I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.",13Jan2020,1
849,"For context. I am a 29 year old male with a husband, no kids or pets, no property, etc.  I make around 85k a year before taxes as a high school teacher (I also teach a college class and get paid to go to training workshops as part of that income) for the past 5 years.

My current issue is that I am burning out as a teacher and I want something to shake it up a bit. I am thinking a career change might be the thing. As I sat here I thought about the fact that I really like the vacation time from teaching, and I have never been one of those savior complex teachers but I really do enjoy working with students, but I am just burning out and need some change (thinking quarter-life crisis). I also think teaching just has so many systemic issues right now that I am getting overwhelmed. The lack of respect from other people, the lack of trained administrators to give feedback and evaluations, the low pay for having my master's (I work 3 jobs to make what I do)

I am concerned about changing careers though and losing my retirement, and other benefits, and I also have no idea how other fields work. With the amount of work I have to do as a teacher I feel like I would naturally excel in other career paths as a hard worker who is dedicated. My issue is that if I go for new positions, I am not really sure what I should be doing as a new career. 

The other part is that if I stay for 10 years to get vested (5 more years) then I retain my retirement and health insurance in some form (but I could also solve this by going on my husband's health insurance).

I am really just looking at general advice from career changers and/or former teachers about their career changes. Any advice is welcome and helpful. Thank you in advance.",13Jan2020,1

Me: “hello?”
Guy: “I’m here with you package”
Me: “what building?”
Guy: “x apartment”
Me: “I’m so sorry, I’m currently at x place two blocks away but I can be there in the same amount of time it would be to come down from my unit!”

Me: “I’m sorry I haven’t ordered anything recently and I’m not expecting any packages, I can still come though”
Guy: *mumbles something angrily and hangs up*

What the heck? My parents sent me a package on Saturday which shouldn’t arrive until this Friday or Saturday. When also I checked my tracking number USPS says expected delivery is Friday. Is it normal to get phone calls like that? My apartment building has a call box with a directory outside so maybe someone was doing a prank call and calling random units?

856,"I had to call out of work for a legitimate emergency on friday where I had to see a dr because I believed I was having a bad reaction to the antibiotic. I had just received for a tooth abscess the night before. I was already scheduled off for saturday and sunday but I didnt want to take a gamble on my health and decided it was best to just go back to the doctor - especially because I was told to take that particular medication every 6 hours.

I came into work this morning and was pulled into the managers office. Allegedly one of my coworkers said that I told them I was planning on calling out the night before. I was completely taken back by that and I didn't know what else to say other than that it was a blatant lie. There is no way this is something that they could have misheard me say since I generally don't confide in people like that. My supervisor just said that theyre only ""relaying"" it but I think they secretly believe it. My trust is completely shot by something that completely came out of left field. 

I have an idea on who this person may have been. I've never really gotten along with them but I wasn't expecting something like this. What the hell should I do?! Even if I clear this up with a doctor's note I don't know how to cope with such juvenile drama.",13Jan2020,1
857,"I will continue to post on this thread as time goes by with updates.  I’ve been friends with this girl for probably 3 years now.  We started out as mutual friends and hung out in the same friend group.  Over time the group split apart but her and I continued to hang out.  Initially I never had the intentions of being anything more than friends but I genuinely fell for her.  She’s the sweetest most sincere person I’ve ever met.  As most these stories go, she confides in me with all her issues in life including her dating life.  She’s way out of my league and all the guys she gets involved with just tear her down and treat her like shit.  Anytime I hear about her getting hurt like that it literally breaks my heart cause she doesn’t deserve it.  No even close.  Anyways, I wound up falling for her so hard that it almost physically hurt.  I had to tell her how I felt.

It was about a year ago I told her I needed some time to figure stuff out and that she wasn’t gonna hear from me for awhile.  I was really trying to figure out how I wanted to tell her.  After about a week I finally told her how I felt.  She told me she knew I liked her well before I had said anything. She was crying and apologetic saying she didn’t feel the same way.  I convinced myself for a couple months that I was gonna be okay with it but the more time went by the more it just straight up hurt.  We wound up getting into a pretty bad argument and quit talking for months.  6 months passes by and she messages me.

She messages me saying she misses me and needs me back in her life.  That we should meet up for coffee.  I told her I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea and wouldn’t do either of us any good.  I apologized for messing things up and falling for her and she tells me,”it’s not your fault.  You can’t control how you feel about someone.”  I don’t refrain from talking to her for about a week before I agree to meet up with her.  I was all geared up.  Talked myself into going and that it was gonna be different.  That I wasn’t gonna let my feelings get in the way again.  We were meeting for coffee at a shop downtown.  I walked up nervous.  I open the door and there she was.

Sitting at the first table in the door facing me as I walked in.  As soon as our eyes met I couldn’t help but smile and neither could she.  She ran up to me before I even have the door shut behind me and she hugged me, face buried in my chest.  All the preparation in the world couldn’t have prepared me for that and all my feelings just rushed right back.

We sat and talked for a couple hours just catching up and talking about what is going on in our lives.  I eventually had to get going to a family dinner and had to excuse myself.  We shared another long close hug and went our separate ways.  I didn’t hear from her for a couple weeks when out of nowhere she messages me.

Without details of the location her message read,”I wanna go to (the mountains) and get lost with you.”  I told her I’d love to but it being the middle of winter there wouldn’t be a whole lot we could do since my vehicle wouldn’t make it far through the snow.  I suggest we go to one of the hot spring spas instead.  She agrees and we make plans to go the same night.  We get there, have a few drinks and wade around in the hot springs for awhile having a great time and laughing and relaxing.  We wound up staying until the pool closed.  We went and got dressed and went for a walk around the property and found a place to sit for awhile.  We sat there for a little bit just enjoying the clear night sky and huddling together to keep warm.  We decided we were done freezing and went back to our room 😂. We stayed up goofing around and listening to music before heading to bed.

The room we had reserved had two beds, one for each of us.  I had sat down on my bed and joked that it was a terrible bed and wore out.  She invited me to come sleep with her instead.  I agreed to it and crawled into bed with her.  Both of us dressed to start with but not much later she starts undressing cause she’s hot.  I told her we could take off some covers instead but she insisted on taking off her pants.  I started getting warm too but I pulled some covers off instead haha.  Apparently then she got cold. She turned over and pulled my arm around her.  Threw her leg over me and nuzzled into me.  I was completely caught off guard.  I had no idea how to handle it cause I knew we had been drinking but it had been hours since our last drink and we hardly drank enough to get a buzz to begin with.  We wound up cuddling most the night just talking and being playful.  Playful as in tickling and forehead kisses etc.  nothing particularly sexual beside some booty rubs and neck kisses lol.  We wound up falling asleep just holding each other and neither of us moved until morning.

My hearts completely melted at this point and already thinking its to good to be true and I shouldn’t be getting my hopes up.  We laid in bed that morning still cuddled up not wanting to leave the bed and just genuinely enjoying it.  It started to take a whole new direction though.  All a sudden she wanted me to massage her. I sat and massaged her literally head to toe.  The more time went by the more clothes she took off.  Eventually being fully nude while I massaged her.  Now maybe I read the whole thing wrong but I was seriously convinced there was no way she wanted anything to happen between us so once I finally got tired of massaging her I laid back down.  She rolled over still naked and we cuddle until we had to check out.  Even went back to the pool and and soaked once more before we left but she still wanted me holding her.  We left and for a couple days I just convinced myself it was a vacation kinda thing. Like what happened there stays there.  After about a week though I just had to ask.

“So, what was that about at the hot springs?”
“It’s was nothing”, she said.
“I just wanted to ask because that was... different.  Didn’t seem like nothing”
“I don’t know what you thought it was but it was nothing to me”
“Well I’m fine with that then I guess”

I was so confused and anxious and honestly PISSED, I took myself straight to the gym and worked out harder than I ever had before.  I didn’t know what else to do to calm down.  For the most part I kinda ignore her for the next little while. Still talking but just taking my time to respond. But then I was really caught off guard when all a sudden she started sending me sexy picture of her in lingerie saying it was my Christmas gift. Further just confusing tf out of me. I wound up buying her a bunch of lingerie.  Once she got it she’d send me videos and pictures of her wearing it.  At the time it was a decent arrangement 😂.  I manage to get off of work for Christmas and I decide I’m gonna drive all the way back to town to surprise my family and her.  After working an 18 hour day I hop in the truck and drive 6 hours back to town.  

I visited my family first and had planned on seeing her at the end of the day before I have to make the other 6 hour trip back to work.  I convince her I had gotten her a gift and my father was gonna bring it to her for me.  I get to her house and tell her my dad was there.  I waited full of excitement to see her again and to see the surprise on her face.  I was hiding behind one of the vehicles at her house and waited for her to walk by before popping up. “Excuse me!”  She turned around expecting my dad I suppose and once she realized it was me she ran and jumped into my arms.  She started crying and laughing and I was just smiling like an idiot and laughing as well 😂.  Like a light switch my mood changed in an instant, when I realize a guy had come out with her.  She’s told me about this guy and that they were just friends but when I say I was hurting, I literally felt my heart just drop.  I went from excited and happy to see her and wanting to spend time with her, to just wanting to drop everything and leave.  I still don’t know if she could see how fast my mood changed.  I’m sure she could.  She invited me inside for some drinks and to see her family.  I rejected it at first but she talked me into staying for one drink at least.  That drive back to work was spent just broken and feeling empty.  We stayed in contact though pretty steadily for the next month.  Her continuing to send me sexy pics and even wanting me to come home to do a photo shoot with her in different lingerie and a nude shoot.

Finally off work again and come home.  She messages me one day saying that this dude she had a thing with went and shown a bunch of people at the bar she goes to some personal videos and nudes I’m assuming.  I was already drunk when she told me this. I was heated at this guy.  I got a couple friends to come to the bar he goes to with me to wait for him.  I send her a Snapchat that I was at his bar and was waiting for him so I could make sure he got taken care of.  She said she loves me for it and that I have no idea what it means to her and that she’s gonna give me “compensation”.  With all the shit that’s been on my mind lately and booze loosening my filter, I kinda went off.  I told her I didn’t want compensation,”you don’t deserve this.  You deserve so much more and I’m trying to be that for you.”  I of course went on to confess my love for her all over again and going on about how I don’t understand why I’m not enough for her and that it’s driving me mad.  She didn’t have much to say besides stop and that she loved me.  I told her I was gonna take care of this guy but after that I didn’t know what was gonna happen between us.  I was seriously drunk that night 🤷🏻‍♂️. I apologized to her the next morning.  She tells me she just wished I would of talked to her in person about it.  We agree to meet up and talk.  I told her everything.  I didn’t know what I expected out of it.  She told me that I’m the greatest guy she knows and she has so much love for me.  That the only reason she doesn’t see herself being able to see me like that is cause we started as friends and had the same friend group.  We went to lunch and afterwards I messaged her this...

“I really don’t know what I expected out of that.  I guess I just wanted to hear your side.  It’s just something I’ve gotta figure out for myself.  I just don’t know how.  I don’t want to regret reconnecting but sometimes it’s really hurts, almost physically. Idek how to explain it.  Idk how to even put it in words and it just sounds ridiculous.  I couldn’t even summon it when we were sitting there.  I’m trying to figure it out and figure out what I need to do to get over it cause the last thing I want is to lose you again...  but I can’t just let myself suffer...”

She said the last thing she wants to do is hurt me and if it comes to it I need to look out for myself.  She wound up coming out with me to the bar that night and we still were flirty with each other and everything.

I really don’t know how to handle any of this.  I truly love this girl. Every time I look into her eyes it just melts me away.  I’ve never been so close to someone my whole life and I don’t want to lose that especially considering she’s one of the three people I still keep in contact with since leaving town for work.  If you’ve made it though all of this you’re a saint lol.  I just need some help or advice on what I should do.  I figure at this point I’m just going to actively try and break that friend barrier.  I truly can’t live with this pain so if losing her again means ill be okay again, then I don’t have anything to lose.",13Jan2020,1

863,"**Please Upvote This! I need all of the advice I can get!**

(18 Year old Male) All I do is sit around, playing video games, listen to music, watching Netflix, watching YouTube, going onto reddit and laying in my bed and daydream about a future. I never leave my room. I only leave for work and I only work 5 hours a day (5pm - 10pm). I won’t do anything because I hate having to know that I have to leave at a certain time, and when I come home I would be too tired to do anything except for the stuff I just listed. I’m tired of this empty and unhealthy life choice and I’ve wanted to change it for a while, but I can’t find the strength to do it. Here’s the problems I am having:

1) I go to bed at around 3-4 in the morning and usually wake up at 11:30am. My brother goes to the gym in the morning and if I don’t go with him then I don’t go to the gym at all because he is my only ride.

2) I would like to work out more and build muscle since my torso is fat but my arms are pencil thin, but I am always too tired to work out early in the morning. Also my job involves taking heavy boxes off of high shelves and then putting them back on so when I do work out, I am sore at work. Also I use to work out but never really noticed any difference and that was when I use to eat healthy.

3) I eat like a trash can. I eat pizza, Mac and cheese and chipotle all the time. All I drink is pepsi and have a glass of chocolate milk in the morning and nothing else. I eat pop tarts, salami sandwiches, turkey bagel sandwiches and bologna sandwiches. I eat beef jerky, candy and drink Pepsi at work. I would like to drink more water but soda is very addicting so it’s really difficult.

4) I would like to write a book that I have tried to write 2 times already and haven’t gotten past the first chapter of it. Every time I want to start it my brain is just “It’s just a waste a time. It’ll never get published.” And I end up just dropping. I think seeing a fictional novel that I wrote being published would be cool and I would even make a little bit of cash off of it (I think).

5) I would like to learn how to draw from memory instead of sketching but I never end up doing it and whenever I do my pictures suck and I give up too easily.

6) I would like to play guitar. My parents have even offered to buy me lessons. But I pick up my guitar every once and a while and try watch a tutorial on YouTube but the guy just never goes into it and just ends up talking about other stuff. It bores me and then I lose interest. 

7) I have no idea what I want to do for a career or what to go to college for. Whenever I look up careers I end up not understanding them and just deciding I’ll do it later.

8) I have no friends. I use to have friends but when I graduated high school we moved across the country and now I am always by myself. There’s nothing around that I am interested in. There’s nowhere for me to be social except for work but everyone’s much older than me. Also my parents say we will be moving again in the summer of 2021 so I don’t want to build a life just to leave it again.

9) I would like to start dating but, just read the paragraph above again. That’s why.

10) I want to move back into my hometown back across the country but have no clue on how to move out period. I also don’t have a vehicle to do this in. I’ve thought about just going to college in the west but my parents won’t pay for out of state tuition. Also I don’t want to make my parents pay for college and rent just so I can move out for a bit.

I want 2020 to be the year where I improve on myself and change. I get a 4 day weekend this week and I want this to be the starting point since I won’t have an excuse and all I’ll have is time.

What can I do to jumpstart and do all of these things?

864,"       In in fourth period, there was a joke written on the board that said “How many police officers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?” I had seen the student next to me write that before the bell rang. The teacher asked what the point was, because she didn’t know the punchline, and it wasn’t written. I answered, “None, they’re too busy beating the room because it’s black. The joke was probably written by...,” and then i was cut off by someone in the back of the room, who said, “Hey! Thats racist! I can’t believe you just said that!” I replied, “Well, it wasn’t me who wrote the joke, it was (The person who sat to the left of me).”  He then totally denied what I said, and the person in the back said, “Well, it doesn’t matter if it was you or not. You’re a racist!” Now, the majority of my friends have been refusing to speak to me or hear me out because they think I wrote the joke, and them talking to me would make them ‘racist by association.’
I’m in a tight spot here, what should I do?

TL;DR I knew the punchline to a racist joke that was written on the board at school, and now people think of me as a racist.",13Jan2020,1

866,"I tend to overthink too much. For that reason I am seeking external advice to know if I am right or not. Should I maintain distance with her?

Usually it’s me and my friend. There’s a girl who started hanging with us recently. But there’s something off to me about her. There’s something things I can’t remember.

For example my friend is about to explain something. So this girl interrupts my friend  to explicate  what has happened to her related to the topic.

Another day I was talking about some great notes I have from class and that I could share with them. I said this because I knew my friend didn’t. She quickly proceeds to tells she has also great notes too and that she can share them. 

One day I was talking with a guy telling him I failed one subject. She says she failed one subject ( it was different to mine) implying that the subject she failed was way worse than mine. The guy told she wasn’t right. 

I used to have a friend who was very self absorbed and that drained the fuck out of me. I realized everything after cutting of the friendship with her for another reason. It was so toxic. I don’t want the same happen to me again. Am I overreacting?",13Jan2020,1

That's all par for the course, since everyone has flaws.

I don't feel ready for serious relationships. I want to live in a fairy land where I am in love with girls without flaws. Their few flaws that I know of are flawless, and I can romanticize them into rosy qualities.

""The passive aggressive comments Christina makes are beautiful. Her personality is dynamic. Christina is charming and kind but she can express her frustration more beautifully than most people can.""

My friend insists that my approach is ridiculous and that I'm not living life.

I wouldn't go against my instinct to please someone else (done that enough times, not anymore), but I feel like I might regret my approach years into the future.

869," 

Let me preface this with a bit of family history. My mom has been divorced three times. Her mom has been divorced twice and her dad has been divorced eight times. My mom has consistently cheated on boyfriends/husbands and hasn't been a great example for monogamy for my brothers and me. We grew up living in a different house/apartment with a different guy basically every year through some pretty important developmental years. I repeatedly said that I would never get married because of my childhood.

Fast forward 12 years of being moved out of my family's house, six years living with the girl of my dreams, and two years being 2,000 miles away from my hometown. My fiance and I got engaged in April and I asked my two younger brothers if they'd share the honor of being my best men. They both agreed. The older of the two has been great. He's planned the bachelor party and been a huge anchor of support. My youngest brother has repeatedly told me that he ""doesn't agree with marriage but will support my decision."" He has gone on to make jabs at my relationship consistently since the engagement, has ignored any texts or email I send about setting plans regarding the bachelor party or wedding, hasn't sent back his wedding invitation, and has accused my fiance and I of ""being on drugs and making a dumb decision"" (we live in a legal state and enjoy cannabis). We were all on a vacation together a few months ago while my fiance was battling a tough week of PMS and my brother decided that we shouldn't get married after he saw us arguing (he's 21 and gay so he has no idea what PMS is).

Last night he called me to to let me know that he got tickets for a concert he was looking forward to, his friend is coming in from out of town and staying at his place, and that he will not be able to make my bachelor party. I was kind of shocked and just told him I'd call him back later. His response was ""Well I can tell by your reaction that this means a lot to you so I'll just cancel the concert and be at your bachelor party. Sorry, I never should have asked.""

I'm at point where I want to tell him that he's no longer a best man, but I also don't want to cause a rift between family right before the wedding. I feel like a petty baby caring about this stuff, but not having the support or encouragement of my brother/best man is really fucking with me. I have another friend that knows about these issues and he offered to fly out a week before the wedding, knowing that my brother won't be here. A part of me wants to ask him to be the best man, but I'm just not sure.",13Jan2020,1

872,"A bit of backstory what happend in the last 6 months to our family:

We are a family of 4 (Dad, Mom, Me (16yo), and my sister (11yo)). My parents weren't close for about 6 years anymore. They slept in different rooms, i never saw them kissing, or anything you would expect from a couple. My dad has his own little store, selling jewelry, in our hometown (18k people), and it is going ok. He could provide for everything, our house he bought 15 years before, and its paid of by now. we were never in any kind of serious financial trouble. 

recently my parents decided, it would be easier for all of us if they separate. My dad offered to move out, and give my mom 1000€ a month. He got himself a little flat, near the train station, so we could visit him whenever we wanted (Me and my sister have to use this train to get to school). I talked a bit to him, and asked how hes getting along (money wise) and he said its close, and there\`s nothing left for him, but i should not worry about him. My mom also started working again, for about 800€ after taxes. So we have no financial trouble at home (with my mom), and now both say they are happier that way. Im sure my mom ist, but i cant believe my dad is. He lost everything he built up himself after coming to our country, now hes left with nearly nothing. 

I visit my dad every Thursday after school, helping him out with all the business emails he gets, and im responsible for writing all sales down in a book, which he gives to our tax consultant (i hope the sentence you get what i mean in that sentence, bc im not a native english speaker, and  my vocabulary isn\`t good enough for such a specific topic, so i relied on google translate). I get a bit of money for exchange, what i use for my hobbies, going out, etc. I also stay most of the weekends at his house, just to spend as much time with him as possible. Whatever i ask my dad for, he tries everything to provide it for me. 

My dad is the best person i know. He would give everything, just to make me, my sis, or my mum happy. We all decided that we celebrate xmas separately, first at my moms house, than at my dads. He got me a new GPU for my PC, and bought my sister a lot of stuff for her rabbits. All at a total of about 600€. Money i knew he hadn't just laying around.

2 month ago i started to recognize beer, wine and whiskey bottles laying around at his home, and store. When i spend my day on Thursday with him he usually drinks about 4 beer (0.5 lt), and i always though thats close to the limit. But last week, he was just full up drunk. On Thursday. 2 p.m.. He was extremely rude to customers, just trew them out for not immediately knowing what they want, and he couldt walk home straight afterwards.

So I know that this is something that happens to a lot of people but I'm still struggling a lot with the fact that my mom uses me to let go of her frustration and anger and I don't know how to handle this.

Everytime something minor inconvenient happens to my mom she is extremely rude to me. By that I mean calling me an asshole, telling me that I'm stupid or saying that I only pretend that I'm smart, saying she will hit me sometimes she actually slaps or kicks me and many more things like that.

The problem is that I do not provoke her in any way. She literally surrounds herself with negativity and is always on the lookout for drama, like she always starts random fights with strangers on facebook. Sure sometimes I also have bad days where I may be a bit snappy but she literally starts yelling at me if I ask her simple questions. For example today I asked her if she wanted to watch Netflix and she said yes but didn't know how to log in, so I explained to her how it works. When I  was done she just said ""sorry that I don't use this app often, I didn't mean to annoying you"" (obviously in a very sarcastic and rude tone). She also doesn't take mental health very serious and when I came clean about not wanting to live anymore she just laughed straight to my face and told me ""guess we can all kill ourselves together if everyone in this house wants to die"".

I know she has a lot to deal with right now (lots of debts of being shopaholic, addicted to social media) and I really try not to be mad at her but I feel like I have to set some boundaries. Yes she is my mom and she has done many things for me but she's really starting to make me go crazy. I still love her but her being a narcissist is really something I can't handle well. She only thinks about herself and her social media accounts.

My dad suspects that she might be jealous of me because I am what she would like to be like and I'm really not trying to brag but there is some truth behind that. I just cannot grasp how a mother could be jealous of her own child? 

I know this might sound whiny but all of this has been going on for years and it makes me feel so bad about myself and worry for my sister and dad because she can be really rude to them too.

898,"So I've been in a long distance relationship w/ her for 5 months now. It has been a very insightful and challenging experience for me. Taking into this is my 1st relationship (She asked me out). Here's a quick rundown of the history of the relationship: She was 5 months out of a break-up, and just graduating from college. At the time she was dealing with a lot of the stresses that come w/ being an adult (unable to find job, life outside of college, and the break-up). She began talking to my best friend (M), and eventually worked up to asking him out. He turned her down; he later told me he wasn't ready to deal w/ all of the baggage she was bringing. He then points her in my direction; more of in an effort for me to help her work through her problems (I seem to be the go-to guy for emotional support, and working through problems. I've had a fair share of my own). She messages me out of the blue, and tell me how stressed out she is and how it's getting to a breaking point. I (In my nice guy fashion/genuinely concerned) make a serious effort to help her through this. For the next week we'd contact each other regularly. I'd always take a considerable amount of time just talking about her feeling, and helping her realize that the rut she was in is only temporary. Apparently she likes it, and works up to asking me out. Of course I say yes; I've always wanted a girlfriend, this was almost exactly how I dreamed it happening. The 1st few months go by pretty smoothly; I set things up for her to come and visit me, and we have a good time. She meets my family, and I meet hers. I arrange for us to meet 3 more times (including planning everything), and finally after the last time (and some advice from friends) I tell her she has to come and visit me for once (I set no particular deadlines). This seems like a reasonable expectation to me. Problem is she didn't have a job; but she has a car (6 hour drive between us). She's still working one job up until this point; but eventually quits. This period was the toughest for me. I'm working my regular job (military), and she's just ""sitting"" at home. I drove myself insane w/ worry. The conversations started to become a little generic, and it seemed like I was the one making the bulk of the effort (morning text, asking to face time). Eventually I began asking my friends, and family for advice; and they're all telling me the same advice (essentially to cut-it off b/e I was being used, and it wasn't healthy). A few of my problems at that time was that she'd never pick-up unannounced my calls (always had an excuse), and wouldn't acknowledge that I called unless I sent her a text (I attempted to call her like a week or so, outside of our regular facetime). She wouldn't initiate text (I had to ghost her for her to reach out to me on any day). I brought it up to her a few time, and she just painted it as me being paranoid or bothered by the long distance. Maybe it's my fault for looking into things that much (searching online for signs of losing interest, cheating in LDR). I got to the point where I was making every effort  to track her on SnapChat. I admit I'd have my vulnerable points, but they were few. It seemed like when she needed me I was there, but when I just needed someone to talk to it was just advice to forget about it/it's not really a problem. I verbalized to her that just b/e it doesn't seem like a issue to her, it still bothered me. She would give me the same response; or ask if the distance was bothering me. I really think it was at this point that I began to push her away. Needless to say I was disgusted by the person I had become. I sent her a text breaking up w/ her (coward move); she texted back asking me if I was seriously breaking up w/ her. I began to call everything into question; I called her and she was out eating. She got into her car, and I told her about how I felt how I wasn't being treated properly, and how it seemed like she was losing interest, and loads of other things I had taken notice of/been paranoid about. I ended asking to get back together that same night; we did. She began to call more frequently again, and things were fine for a bit.  Then one night while I was sleeping she blew up my phone with random text. At the time I didn't read them, But in the morning I read it again, and saw a part about her making money in a rent-a-friend service (Experience detailed here):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eeddi9/i\_23m\_just\_found\_out\_my\_girlfriend\_22f\_signed\_up/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eeddi9/i_23m_just_found_out_my_girlfriend_22f_signed_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I sent her another text that night (I don't think I would've been able to do it if I talked to her over the phone), breaking up w/ her right before Christmas. I just could't function w/ that type of thing on my mind. I removed her, and blocked her on all form of media. I was miserable (breaking down and crying in my car, at work, at home). Two days passed, and I was fully ready to follow throw. I come to find out she's been telling my friends, about it, and making dramatic FB &amp; IG post. At this point my good guy senses kick in, and I want to reach out to her...but I don't. She eventually reaches out to me via email asking for an explanation/closure. We get on the phone, and I realize that I may have just be trying to escape a situation that uncomfortable to me (habit of mine), when instead I should be facing the issues; that was all I needed to convince me of giving it another shot. We had a intense argument (she seemed derive a sense of relief from the argument), and she gives me another shot. Things are back to normal again, and she's more attentive about out calls and got a job she enjoys. She began talking about plans of finally coming to see me. She had one episode where she suggested doing rent-a-friend again, and I shot it down. She tells me she feels like i'm too controlling/passive (rent-a-friend being the only thing I've ever told her not to do). Originally I had told her to make sure that job would only be temporary; I had hoped she would use common sense and just not bring it up or try it again. But apparently she wanted me to ""tell her what to do"". So she agreed to not do it. Now i'm here again b/e of another incident. I asked to skip out nightly call on night b/e of a especially bad day at work, and because I was sick. She sends me a ""I smell BS"" emoji, and makes two facebook post that seemed suggestive of potential doubt to me. I apologize to her the next day, and ask to talk to her that night. She agrees. She sends me a text saying goodnight at 3:15pm, and alarms immediately go off in my head. I do something I hadn't done since the 1st break-up and checked snapchat maps again (she's at a ice-cream shop). I'm confused so I call her, and she doesn't pick up. I send her a text asking what's going on, and she responds 5 min late saying she had went to visit her grandma. I ask her if anything is wrong, and she says nothing is wrong and that i'm just overthinking again. I ask to talk to her, b/e i'm ready to explode at this point. She agrees to talk to me 3 hours later (after cleaning, and taking care of her pets). I calm down a bit b/e I realized how crazy I was acting. I actually ended up having a decent 3 hour conversation w/ my roommate about the entire situation. I start off the conversation asking if I had done anything wrong, or if she was upset with me. She says nothings wrong, and that she's comfortable (very brief response). I ask her if nothings wrong then why is she exhibiting these strange behaviors. she tells me she just wanted to be motivational, and the ""I smell BS"" post was just to be funny. Then unprompted, begins to talk about her new job in detail (I've already had a conversation about her job; I did't want there to be an impression that I was neglecting her interest); and how much she admires her boss, and how unimpeded she feels around him. I have to remind her about getting the conversation back on track.  Even though I got answers, it wasn't enough for me. So instead of trying to pry things from her, I began to list of things I think she may take issue with (my episode of paranoia); or how she felt that I was being overly controlling. I am already a lot better about those particular things, but everything that had happened that day was just too much for me to ignore. As i'm getting off of facetime she starts doing her make-up while talking to me; she seems hurried at this point (she does have work at 1030 the next day). She says she just want to practice, so she can look nice for work. I don't say anything; I just tell her I love her and say goodnight. Early the next day (3am) i'm scrolling facebook, and she send me a message providing  explanation as to why she's up this early. I had no clue she was even awake, or on facebook. She says she had a nightmare, but when i ask she says she doesn't want to talk about it b/e its disturbing. She sends me a few memes (she see's it a way to comfort me; but it does nothing for me), and tells me she's going to bed.

I am so conflicted. I know we both deal w/ communication issues, but I've been making a serious effort to be more about talking about the small things that bother me (she told me to stop talking about my perceived issues). She always seems to throw up a wall; unless she's in need (after everything builds up), and she attributes it to her past (I actively ask her to just tell me how she feels). She tells me she wants things to go further between us, and she wants this to be a long term thing. But it seems like unless things are critical (breaking up), she won't entertain any concerns. She preaches working things through together, but doesn't give any (in my eyes) attention to problems I have. I love her w/o question, but I find myself questioning more-and-more if she actually feels the same. I don't know if I am being too ""needy"", but i truthfully don't feel like I am. I only ask for one conversation at the end of the day, and maybe a few text. I'm not usually obsessing over where she's at or what she's doing. But i'm not sure if that me trusting her, or me just choosing to ignore thinking about it b/e I know I'll start to draw lines. I know she just got a new job, so maybe I should just back-off for a bit so she can adjust. To my knowledge; This is the 1st time she's really been out in the world (outside of college). I'm worried/happy that she's out growing me; since we've been together I've seen her mature so much (it's been one of the most fulfilling things to me). But now that she's not in distress, I don't know my place in the relationship (maybe I need to work on myself)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

How do I know if I am in a healthy LDR relationship? Are my concerns legitimate? Am I doing anything wrong? If so; how can I do better?

899,"Hi all!

The past two weeks i’ve seriously been looking at myself as a person, picking apart all the good traits in me as well as the bad. I’ve been speaking to family/friends as my relationship of 8 years ended when I didn’t expect it to which made me really look at myself and what I did wrong or what went wrong.

I was in an 8 year relationship from the age of 14, i’m nearly 23 and have had a great relationship, we went to Australia for a year, rarely argued, understood everything etc but apparently she just wasn’t happy. Unhappy with what? I was happier than ever, had goals in my head for the next few years of getting our own place, getting engaged etc and all of that has now been wiped which put me in a bad place.

I didn’t realise until about 1-2 years ago that I suffer from anxiety, all of my life I have wondered what was wrong with me or why I done/thought certain things until I realised I have anxiety which has put me in dark places. When around people i’m comfortable with, i’m happy, funny, make people laugh, support them etc and I know a lot of people feel comfortable/trusting around me, which kills me at times when I suffer from anxiety but feel the need to put on a brave face for everyone else to keep that persona I have around people and for them not to think differently about me.

Since the break up/few weeks of reflecting i’ve realised what I want to change within myself and how I want to improve to be a better person with a clearer mind. I am lazy at times, procrastinate a lot, there’s a lot I want to do but my anxiety holds me back or the idea of the amount of work/effort it will take scares me/puts me off.

I want to improve on those things instead of procrastinating, I want to get stuff done there and then, I want to be able to go and do something without overthinking or having that anxiety holding me back. Even going out certain places I think in my head how the day/night will go and it will put me off, I want rid of that and can go into any situation with an open mind. I have goals I want to achieve this year which are going to take effort/work daily to reach them.

Any advice or experience from anyone else who has felt like this and how they managed to go about it would be great, any podcast recommendations would be awesome as well as I love listening to podcasts, and as well as any sort of tasks/things which could help daily would all be appreciated.

I know i’m capable of changing, I know it’s hard work but I feel like if I don’t get serious about starting to change then i’ll always be stuck feeling like this and waste more days, months, years instead of making them productive!


Tl;dr;  23 yo, dumped from an 8 year relationship, suffer from anxiety, want to focus on improving myself now and change my way of thinking/achieve goals I have set out, any advice/experience appreciated",13Jan2020,1
900,"Finances question for those who have experience with investing and student loans.

I am attending medical school next year with my husband, and we will both be taking out loans. I think average indebtedness for med students is close to $200,000 by graduation, and that will by x2 because both of us are going. We also have roughly $30,000 of undergrad student loan debt between us. 

I unexpectedly inherited about $25,000 when my grandpa passed away this year. 

Should my husband and I: 

A. Use all the inheritance money for med school expenses to minimize the loans we take out.

B. Try to invest some of the money for down the road. 

If we should invest, how much is ""enough"" money to begin investing? Any recommendations on companies (E-Trade, etc)?",13Jan2020,1

902,"Male friends hired strippers/prostitutes, regretted it, and now I’m angry. Help me dissect these feelings?

Boys trip, they visited legal clubs and brothels. Spent stupid money, some partook in substances and services. Later, they’re talking to one of the girls, who reveals she’s been in the industry (prostitution) full time for years and sends money overseas to family. It’s a sad story, and suddenly the group regrets patronizing the clubs. 

I (female) was ok with this story (although thought it was reckless to be spending this much cash and taking drugs in a foreign country) until I heard the part about this “come to Jesus” moment where they decide that clubs are predatory. I suddenly just felt very angry. It wasn’t like nobody in the group knew that sex workers are exploited all the time, and now they’re going on about how poor these institutions are to customers and workers. (Which is, like duh. This wasn’t a classy place.) 

They know I’m upset, but I can’t find the right words to express my feelings. To some extent, I’m angry that they could be so ignorant about exploitation (or more accurately, ignore what they do know about exploitation), and there’s also a hypocrisy aspect. I almost feel like I wouldn’t be as upset if they enjoyed the experience and aren’t talking about one person’s story.

He groomed and manipulated me from a young age(10) and had a sexual relationship with me at 12-ish until it stopped when I was 14-ish. He was kicked out immediately when it was found out and there was a lot of drama but the only thing my sister remembers is that I hate him and we don't talk anymore and that I don't want to be near him. 

She sometimes ask me why I don't like him and when I'm going to tell her about it. I keep saying that I'll tell her when she's 13 but I don't know. 

When do you even talk to kids about birds and bees? My mom doesn't want my sister to know because she's innocent in all of this and I shouldnt ruin their relationship because of what happened.

My parents decided to build a house but we don't have enough money to pay it off right now so we're gonna have to pay the bank every month until 2040. The plan is that my dad pays until my two brothers and me all get a job to be able to pay off the house. We made it so that everybody has to pay the exact amount of money at the end.

I have been treated so badly by my parents that I am 85% sure that I want to move out when I'm old enough and when I am able to (I'm 14 right now) but the problem is that if I do I'd leave with a really bad consciousness because my siblings would have to pay more and longer and all of that and I don't want harm to anybody, I just want a new and better life. I don't want to make theire lifes harder than they already are.

My cat has been battling with what we thought was conjunctivitis for a while, it went away with drop treatment, went away, we got a refill, went away, and you guessed it came back again.  We took her back to the vet a few weeks ago because clearly it was something more,  as she was now sneezing so we figured, upper repository infection. We ended up getting her an antibiotic shot, and that night she started to seem so much better, she seemed to be doing really well then BAM two weeks later, sniffles, watery eyes are back and sneezing sneezing SNEEZING! 

We now figure its something viral (Feline herpes) and have started her on Lysine supplement

I’m too embarrassed and don’t want to talk to anyone in my life really about this. I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me. 


In May, I was fired from my job. In August, I got another one and things were going well. However, in December, there was a big layoff and I was a part of that unfortunately (I wasn’t let go due to work performance. In fact they said I did a great job there, but it just was not going to work out. They said they would be more than happy to be a reference for me to wherever I apply. I got a severance as well). I have enough money to get me through March. 

There have been some family issues that have happened recently, and my dating life has been absolute crap. Nothing has worked out beyond a month. I have friends who say I can talk to them. That’s great and I love them &amp; I know they want to help, but just saying “stay positive and keep it moving” doesn’t really do anything. And I love talking to them, but I just would almost prefer being left alone. Last night, I woke up around 4 and started bawling my eyes out because everything just came to a head. I want to believe things will be better and that this year is “my year” etc... but I don’t have faith in that at all. My birthday was on the 17th of last month and I didn’t even do anything because I felt like it wasn’t worth celebrating.

I’m currently 22 I began making payments on a 2009 Saturn Aura XR just before my 20th birthday, I absolutely loved and love the car, however a couple of months ago, October-Ish I’d say. I had a few suspension issues happen and I lost my job at the same time so payments started racking up. As soon as I began able to save money to fix it and catch up on payments, my sisters car blew up. So she ended up saying she’d take over the payments and get it fixed. I hated the idea, but I hated losing credit and watching my car go bad anyway, as well. So I obliged. Now I bought a 2003 Lincoln LS and I like this car, however it has a shift solenoid issue, not much of an issue but it does need attention. And now long story short, the Saturn was repo’d and my sister has no intention to pay for it. Now I could sell the Lincoln, get the car out of repo and still have money to fix the suspension issues and start paying on it again. Now everyone is telling me that’s a bad idea. However, if they auction the car, it won’t sell for more than what I owe, so I’ll still owe 2000+ dollars on it, and not have the car, which makes no sense to me.

I am pretty flirtatious, so I normally can pick up when someone is being flirty. Apparently I'm a dumbass because I was so intimidated by how hot he was. Eventually we leave for my room together, and he's being cute and flirty. Finally, he straight up tells me he wants to kiss me. By that point, it was past 3AM, and I'm pretty sure I was disassociating. I made out with him for a bit, but I was so confused, and I said that I wasn't feeling it.

926,"Two years ago, I moved to another country. Ever since, I've been ridiculously bad at keeping in touch with my friends in my home country.
I will occasionally text them, as in send long messages to all of them at the same time when I miss them especially much, but then I get overwhelmed again by all of their answers and I don't text back. The things is, I deeply care about my friends, but with my ghosting behaviour, I can definitely see why they would lose contact with me over time.

I would explain my behaviour with two reasons mostly. Firstly, I am pretty introverted to begin with. I value social interaction with people that are close to me a lot, but I don't have a whole lot of energy for it. 
And secondly, I have so much new, challenging social interaction already every day! New country, new language, friends, university and job in that language, plus I recently moved in with my boyfriend, so I get to see him and talk to him every day too. Because all of this, I just feel... full in a way? Like I don't have energy left to connect with my old friends too. Some days, I am so occupied with my new life, that they don't even cross my mind. But then, something randomly reminds me of them, or they appear in my dreams and I wake up painfully missing them. I then wonder why nobody has reached out to me in a while, and realize that it's because, oh yeah, I never text back.

I have a roof over my head and food to eat and that's definitely more than some people my age but lately I've been feeling very depressed, everyday when I come home the only thing I honestly  want to do is sleep or hurt myself, but because im trying to get better and be better I dont do either i used to force myself to spend time with my family and friends the sadness of course persisted anyways  but I tried, I admitted no longer try because when I leave my room my mother is always there telling me to do shit and depression comes a lack of energy and that's a really big problem for me because my mothers love is not unconditional in order for her to stay nice to me I need to do EVERYTHING she says directly when she says it and I just haven't been able to keep up with her demands like I used too their getting more and more frequent and I'm so low on energy and down I just really cant keep up... but my big issue is everytime i fail to do something she asks me in any regard she hurts me... not physically but she attacks me emotionally calling me a slut or a worthless pig or a stupid troll or really anything she can think of to seemingly hurt me shes done this all my life but lately it's just been so much worse and like I said I cant keep up... it's really starting to effect my mental health more too *I am clinically depressed I've been diagnosed but my mother wont let me get antidepressants* the emotional beatdowns are getting more and more frequent and I am literally powerless. Everytime I try to stand up for myself because I know what shes saying is bull she hurts me in different ways IE braking my things so all I can do is literally sit there and take it or it just gets worse for me in the end I cant do anything and it's really starting to hurt me, I have no where else to go and no one to talk to *she stopped taking me to the therapist after they recommended meds and my friends really just dont understand* I'm stuck and it's just getting worse and worse for me I literally cant take it I stay up in my room trying to avoid it all and the isolation paired with the emotional bombardment is hurting me bad the thoughts are getting more vivid and I'm just getting more and more depressed

934,"So for a little backstory, I (19, F) have known him  (18, M) for around two years. Around two years ago we did get into a relationship (over the internet, we are both young(18/19) and in college, so meeting up is hard) and he ended up cheating on me and told me a day later about what he had done. 

We broke up and lost contact. Ten months ago we got back in contact and started to talk again, which ended up in a relationship. 

Things were relatively okay. I suffer from anxiety, manic depression and Aspergers, so it can be hard for me at times to properly say what I want to say. 

One month ago we mutually agreed to go on break because he felt for the last few months of our relationship he was the only one putting full effort into our relationship. 
I had just started both lexapro and trazodone (anxiety/anti depressant medication) a few months prior. My confidence went down severely so we never video called/exchanged photos as often. My sex drive was virtually none so we were never intimate. He was also controlling at times of our sex life. He of course was in turn frustrated because he would never see me and we would never be intimate properly, if at all. 

I proposed we take some time apart from talking to fix my mental health and get off of my medication because things were better before I had started. He asked me how long the break would be for, and I said one month maximum. 
Here is where I am torn. 
I asked for him to please not get intimate with anyone else, as my trust with him was already damaged, and it is important to me. 
He promised to agree. 

Three days after our break was started, we decided to end it. 
That same day, I found out he had been intimate with someone only TWO DAYS after we began our break. 
When confronted, he lied directly to my face. I had screenshots and the girl backing me up. 

We have had several conversations. 
I view it 100% as cheating. 
He does not at all. 

I would love to remain friends with him because he was the only person I ever talked to for months. He was my best friend. 
Multiple times we brought people into our conversations to explain our story and see who they agree with. I have not had one person disagree. 
I’m not trying to play for a who is right, who is wrong situation. 
I am just having a hard time overcoming it and talking as friends because I view it as cheating, but he completely does not. 

TL;DR/ Ex and I agreed to on a break from talking so I could get off my medication that was causing some issues for us, and so I could fix my mental health. I asked him to please promise to not get intimate with anyone else. Two days later I find out that while on break he had done sexual things with someone. When confronted, he lied directly to my face. I would love to still be his friend but it is extremely hard because I 100% view it as cheating but he is sworn it is the opposite.",13Jan2020,1

939,"Hi,

I am not even sure how to start this post. My thoughts about this topic are as scattered as my emotions.

Basically, I am a female social work student  in Canada, whose graduation is vastly approaching. I am quite ambitious in nature and want more for myself than living from paycheck to paycheck, which I am not ashamed to admit. That being said, I truly love the career that I have picked and helping people is something I have found to be my calling. Therefore, I decided that doing a masters in counselling psychology would open more doors for me in terms of furthering my education/knowledge in the field and career. 

This whole endeavor causes me to hyperventilate as I am struggling to understand how I, as a soon to be 27-year-old female am supposed to finance my masters, actually do it as well as have time to start a family.

I suppose my problem, can be generalized as the Family-Work Dilemma faced by women who seek a career and family these days. 

PS: I am not looking for someone to pity me, however, I do appreciate solid advice and anecdotes from those who have struggled with the same thoughts and situation and have overcome it.

942,"Alright, first of all sorry for my English because its not my native language. And sorry for posting here and not on relationshipadvice but my GF frequents that. 

About us: My(33) Girlfriend (32) and I met 5 years ago when I visited her country. My company gave me a job there and she showed me around town. I got given a job, help with an apartment and spoke the language fluently. We lived together for 2 years in her country but it was a real working city and we didn’t have much friends. 

After being in that country for 3 years, I requested to be relocated back to my home country for better healthcare, education, etc etc. And (luckily) she really wanted to join me. 

Back “home” I have a lot of close friends and a very warm family. Not suffocating in any way but we do whatsapp a lot and see each other about every two to three weeks. Now, heres the problem: My GF does not speak the language, shes been trying but other things have had a higher priority (work, drivers licence, etc). Most of family can speak her language on a reasonable level but my parents are simply bad at it… so at family gatherings it often, quite quickly, goes back to our native language and my gf feels left out but doesn’t say anything to change it. Quite soon she started to just be on her phone facebooking or she would just stand up and walk out. Also, when I am not at home (traveling for work) my family and friends would reach out to her to have her over for dinner or games etc but she (nearly) always cancels (often last minute) and people have stopped to invite her over. My gf is very busy with work during the week and only has time in the weekends, forcing me to choose between her and my friends. She doesn’t like to come along due to the group often turning to our native language because of her lack of interaction (although most of them can communicate fine with her one on one).

Last week she stepped out of my family whatsapp group because it was stressing her out, not being able to understand what is being said. My family has responded very hard on it (they saw it as a build up of problems). They feel like she is abandoning the group (although she had/has good one on one conversations with everybody) and should put more effort herself in becoming part of the group. My sister wants to talk to her about how her behavior makes her feel but my gf is does not want to because she says its my sisters problem. 

Im stuck in the middle as I am also often annoyed with her behavior in groups so I can understand my family/friends. But I also know that shes a good person who would be social to everybody if she could and she is liked when we are talking one on one… we are reaching a point where it feels like I am going to need to choose between my gf and my family and friends and I am terrified with no idea how to handle it.

944,"Dear reddit, I posted about three months ago from a throwaway account about sexual abuse that had occurred when I was a child. At the time I was looking to find out if I had any grounds to stand on for taking action. I was afraid I wouldn’t be believed or taken seriously, but the pain has been crippling in my life. Thanks to the kind words of strangers I started my process. 

Since discussing in my psychotherapy it had been taken very seriously. This week I was taken to a secret location. My account was recorded via multiple cameras in excruciating detail to be transcribed. While someone sat in another room and took notes. The main interviewer had to go to them to see if they missed anything and they would come back to me with more questions.

“You mentioned he had an erection” can you describe that?

A part of my early childhood was in the UK. When I was about 4-5 years old our family moved back to Sweden. 

Before we moved back I spoke nice English with a British accent. As the OCD kid I am/were I said when we moved back  “As we now are in Sweden, we must speak Swedish” (but in Swedish)... 

Now 13 years later I speak more of an American English, rather than the British accent that I’m in love with...

I took 2 years off from Uni for being depressed and performing poorly. I spent that time psycho-analyzing and getting legitimate help.

Unfortunately, here's where I need help. My classes started last week. So everyday I'm not there I'm missing lectures.

962,"Now, this sounds dumb, i get that. Just, listen, please. Im 14 and go to artschool, in there i have a classmate, who is usually hella Fun to be around, but some momentas make me questions stuff. This one time, she found an empty bottle, and out of thin air yeeted it at my forehead. Gonna be honest, it really hurt. Then she just smacked me again, and the her other friend. I have some pain tolerence, plus į dont want her to be angry, because were small class, and Shes my friend. This isnt the only time. She has done this before. Another thing that has happened, is we were joking about stuff, and since it was relate to the Joke, i layed down on the floor(its dumb, i know), and the she fucking steped on me. I was kinda unhappy, because for a while it was Hard to breathe, so i decided to give her a bear hug, but she got mad because i pinched her skin, and tore a hole in my t shirt(it had a decorative hole, but she ripped it way wider than it was supposed to be) should do something about it?

(This is long   so be ready I have to explain everything) and A little warning - this is   all over the place just had to get my thoughts out and for that I'm   sorry.

**This is my first post and I hope I Don't incriminate anyone I talk about on here.**

Im   the oldest of 4 kids. Everything started when I was young. Like 5 or   so. I would move around a lot and never felt at home with my family. It   was like I was watching my whole family through a window. For being the   oldest I just felt like an outsider. My dad always worked as we were   lower mid class or poor as dirt and he had to support all 6 of us. I   never saw him that much and my mom and I always fought. I never had real   friends and tried to sever connections with everyone when things got   hard to prevent myself from being hurt worse, as in moving again, etc.

When   I got a little older around 9 my uncle would come around a lot and  ""try  to be my friend"" He would do stuff to me and eventually he made me  put  my hands on him and jerk him off. When we moved again he didn't  come  around anymore but I still felt violated. I'm 18 now and I have  never  told anyone because of shame and embarrassment. I honestly don't  know  how much of an impact that had on me but my life was a living hell  - and  still is. When I was in my early teens I would get into abusive  fights  with my mom, we both put our hands on each other and verbally  abused one  another. She was a bitch and I hated her, which is maybe the  reason why  I always felt like I didn't belong. My dad barely got  involved in it  other than had talks with both of us. we deal with it  for as long as I  lived there and tried to mend our relationship on many  occasions. My mom  finds refuge with this guy online, hes in Florida.  After she talks with  him she meets up as a friend and fucks him. My mom  and dad separate and  she stays down in Florida with my brother and  sisters and I with my  dad. I focus on school but skip a lot and stay  home ruining my grades. A  year goes by of being separated and I still  have little relations with  my dad, but he tries. My fucking family just  shows up and surprises us,  They want to move back in and live with us  like nothing ever happened.  I'm 15 or 16 at this point.

My   grandma is a druggy, since she was 20 or some. She did coke but mostly   pills and shot shit. Shes 58 now and recovering (barely) but she  ruined  my moms life which is probably why my mom was so abusive to me  now that I  think about it. My mom was in foster care and had a tough  childhood -

my  grandma ruined our  relationship on many occasions. I used to spend my  summers with her,  and she grew pot and sold shit, in-front of me at a  young age WTF.  Anyway I was exposed to drugs and your gonna need to know  about her  later.

We all move one  final time  for a fresh start if you will. We stay at this place for  another year  and during this time I meet my girlfriend we hit it off at  my new  school and we like each other a lot, I start an early college  program  that I cannot leave or will be billed thousands but I need  scholarships  so I'm pressured to keep my grades up while maintaining  high school  and my job at a pizza place...My dad gets into some trouble  (nothing  big but is being sued) we don't have the money so of course my  parents  decide to move past that ""one final time""....and You guessed it,  to  Florida. I don't want to as I'm turning 18 soon, I'm tired of moving   and I'm ready to settle down and grow my feelings instead of flea   again. My parents work something out and tell me if I'm staying, I'm   staying with my druggy grandma. She wasn't as bad as she used to be so I   agreed. Shes a little sick and needs help. I take care of her and do   her laundry, dishes anything she needs. There is no room in this   pull-barn she was living in for the both of us and her landlord finds us   a place for 800 a month a nice older house. So I do all the moving and   some of her friends help, which are only there mind you for her   prescriptions. Shes getting worse and I do everything in our new house.   Her car gets repo'd by the insurgence company and we are forced to get   by. I can no longer work because I don't have a way of getting there.   Whenever we need food she gives her friends pills to take me and I do   all the shopping alone. We live off of her social security to get by   which is around 1200 dollars, 800 goes to rent and the rest to electric,   gas, internet and phones.

Things   get harder as she becomes more dependent on me to do things and  doesn't  appreciate what I do, school and college and taking care of her  becomes  my life with little free time to do anything for myself. My  girlfriend  stood beside me thank-god so at-least I had that.

I'm   still 17 during this point and since shes 58 (have to be 60 where I   live) we cannot get help from the government for any resources and I   cannot get paid for being a caregiver. Her med prices go up and she   becomes crazy... verbally abusing me whenever I walk outside my room,   telling me I don't do enough making my self worth go down the drain. I   turn 18 and go into a little depression.

FAST forward to today:

I'm   physically ill, don't have money, a job, a car (didn't even start   drivers training), and I feel stuck in life.  What food I do have is   canned from churches (not complaining) and I just feel like I can't go   anywhere or do anything. I still talk to my mom to check in but they are   living their own life apart from mine. I'm getting closer to my   girlfriends family (her mom) and she feeds me and things start looking   up for a month. But my grandmas still picks fights and her illness   starts to get worse, she developed these sores that break open and bleed   all over her sheets so I wash about 15 loads a week just to get her   laundry done. I'm basically living off my 16 year old girlfriend since   they feed me etc and I try not to let them know that they are supporting   me but they are. As stress builds up I start to change and take some   things out on my gf. Telling her I just need to be alone and being kind   of a dick. She comes home to her mom crying and her mom shows up on my   door step to talk to me. She tells me she doesn't like me anymore and   has this long lecture about how I should treat girls even though I've   never laid my hands on my gf, Just verbally being a dick (whats new in   my life) Sometimes I feel like its easy to make someone feel how you   feel ig...I don't know what to do because my whole life has been a mess   (others have had worse but I still have shit) and I feel no motivation.   I'm falling back into not going to school. I still feel worthless and   like everything is my responsibility. EVERYTHING is, weather my life is   just starting or not. Ig I just need some advice on how get past this   and how to rebuild and create a better life that isn't self  destructive.  I'm cutting ties with most of my friends and falling back  into old  habits that I feel like I cant help but maybe that is just an  excuse.

IF  you made it this far, I  thank you. You don't have to give advice but  I'm happy to have talked  about it and get it out. School has been hard  with all my time spent on  my grandma doing everything she wants or I'll  be kicked out.",13Jan2020,1

I had no choice at the time but to pay it, so I did. After talking with one of the roommates, she agreed it was fucked up and paid me back. here’s where it gets confusing though. the roommate who paid me back contacted the landlord and I guess he also paid the utilities bill, twice. (tbh I don’t know what happened exactly but this is what I could gather) anyway, months later I get an email saying my account was over paid and they’re sending me a check for $400. I got it today, about 2 months after receiving the email. I don’t want to cash it because i’m afraid that it shouldn’t actually belong to me. I mean, I’ve already been paid back. no one has reached out to me about it, and it’s been months. idk what would you do in my situation?",13Jan2020,1

I'm trying as much as possible to not write a long paragraph because I know you all don't want to read it all. 

alright, so, last week my family and I reunited with other friends of my parents and there is this guy (17M) who came because of me and I came because of him, knowing that we could chat stuff and play video games, as usual. we've known each other for three years and we were friends, even though we haven't talked that much.  we stayed over the weekend. on friday night we didn't talk at all, and in the middle of the night he texted me on Messenger if ""he's the only one who will be so bored around boomers????"" and I said that no, he isn't the only one, I was bored too, so we suggested to meet the other day in one's room. so we did. he came in my room and we first just chatted, we were really quiet, we played csgo a little bit and then started talking more about our common friends, we talked about relationships and stuff, things got much interesting and he started playing with my hair, tickling me, and, then, kissing me. I realised that wasn't right. and we continued for some hours..and..we hooked up, like, for real, and...he popped the cherry, okay? he did. i told my close friends about it. they told me everything's okay. i told my grandma about it because she saw me crying yesterday night...i couldn't handle it anymore. I'm just realising the consequences now. I did it with someone I don't have any feelings for. nor does him. we were both in our worlds when we did it. anyway. my grandma didn't really criticize me as i expected, but told me I should tell my mum these days. here's the problem with her. she usually overreacts and I'm really scared of what might be her reaction. I mean...he just used his fingers, you know? but I'm still scared.

here's the other problem. this guy gave my number to a friend (18M) of his some days ago, with my consent. I started talking to this friend and he seems nice, I wish I could be nice to him too, but I feel like I need to be strong, like a stone, to be heartless around everyone after what happened one week ago. 

I just need someone to tell me what should I do...I feel like I can't take this anymore on my own",13Jan2020,1
969,"The girl is my first cousin. Her birthday is in a little less than 6 weeks. We live 4-5 hours away from each other. My cousin will see me in about a week and a half, as she will sleep over from a Friday to Sunday, and that's when I'm going to ask her if she wants to come with me to a music festival this summer, as by the time I have asked I will have bought two tickets myself (about 130$ for each ticket). One of the reasons why I will do this is so she might want to be my friend, and also because I KNOW it will be the greatest day of my life. Then for her birthday I will buy a 60$ gift, and after I've given her the gift I will ask her if we can plan a day we can spend time together on, like maybe a week or two after her birthday, and if she says yes, I won't use an exit bag (su*cide bag). If she says ""no, I'm busy"", then I will just use an exit bag because I couldn't stand living knowing that my cousin, who is the sweetest, most intelligent and ambitious person I know, will never be my friend. Some might say she'll blame herself/she'll have mental problems, but I seriously, seriously doubt that. My theory is that she'll just be happy. 

I don't know if I should write a su*cide note or not though, just in case I decide I'll end it. Because I for some reason like writing sometimes, it'll be several pages, and I will go on to note that it was my fault, not my cousin's at all, that I did it. 

I guess the one hope for me is if I could become friends with my younger cousin, who's 14, but she'll probably also be really happy if I don't exist anymore. I will ask her though if she can come with me to the music festival instead, if my older cousin says no.

We grow up and now M works in a distant part of the city so he spends most of his time in his girlfriend house, coming home only in the weekend. The thing is M is different than me and L, we both are very introverted and interested in the same stuff like games, anime and even technology and politics meanwhile M is really social and into sports, traveling and usually more of a talker than a thinker and that's the point that always makes us fight. he's always  screaming nonsense while walking around in the house, takes everything personal and doesn't do ANYTHING to became closer to us  or helping in the house while complains about us staying in our bedrooms and not ""doing home chores"" (our mother is kinda omitted in all of this bc she's dealing with her mental health issues) but the thing is our house doesn't have water in any of the rooms except for one bathroom and we have a lady that helps in the cleaning a couple of times in a week. He is hypocritical, annoying  and disrespectful with everyone. Me and L are used to do things in our way when we need bc we spent almost six months living together without anyone else (including our mother) when we're in the middle of a financial crisis. When people came to hang out with one of us, the other stays inside w bedroom to make sure that we're not annoying each other and the most common sense thing to do is cleaning your own shit when you have friends coming over bc it's ur responsibility to take care of your friends and not anyone's else!!!

My client has given me tokens for public transit and asked me to exchange them for cash. Coworker A knew this and advised me to lock the tokens in a safe box for the time being. I did exactly what she advised me.

Later on, I found out that my tokens went missing. Since Coworker A was not working that day, I asked Coworker B if he knew where they have gone. He admitted that Coworker A took the tokens out of the safe box and gave them to him to get cash back for my client. I was surprised because Coworker A never communicated this with me.

Anyways I asked Coworker B If he got the cash back. This is where the story takes a turn. He said that he stored the tokens in his jacket’s pockets and Coworker A witnessed this action. When he left work, he realized that the tokens went missing so he confided in Coworker A who said, “forget it”. 

I was disappointed as my client deserved her money but there is no proof that the tokens were stolen so I moved on. Two days ago, I was going through my file cabinets and found the tokens in a small plastic bag. I immediately showed it to Coworker B who said that it did not belong to my clients because the tokens looked different. I told him to not tell Coworker A because apparently everyone is pointing to her as the culprit for money going missing. I said that I would speak to my manager who would be back in the office later this week. Frankly I thought I could trust Coworker B more than Coworker A. I was wrong.

Today is my day off. Coworker A texted me, “whose tokens did you find? Coworker B told me about it and wants to show me.”

The new semester started and I decided to sit with some of my friends at lunch who I know don’t vape. After 2 days of sitting there, i found out that 5 of the 9 people(not including me) vape/juul/smoke weed, etc. Basically it’s a table full of druggies besides me and 4 other people who are there because our friends sit there. Ever since I’ve found this out, I’ve been in shock because he has a good personality and he’s funny and nice. To me it seems like he was peer pressured into vaping then found out he likes it and is now addicted. I don’t know what to do in this situation. I want to remain friends with him, but I don’t want to be peer pressured by him/his friends into doing drugs. 

What do I do in this situation? Could anyone give me some advice here?

982,"Okay, this content is different from what you might see here on this platform. I had no other place to look for advice.

My mom is a former/retired porn star, she went by the name ''Ricki Raxxx'', it was her alias, her porn name. My mom was born in America but is from Lebanese origin. She met my dad at a very young age, they dated for a while and married each other in 2000. In 2002 when I was born, my dad left me and mom for a younger woman, we were left with nothing, no money and hardly a house to live in.

After the difficult circumstances, mom decided to take photos for small porn studios and make money. She was doing photo shoots between 2004 and 2007. Then in 2008, she took it to the next level and started shooting hardcore scenes/having sex with guys on film for different companies, she got help from an agent who arranged the scenes and what companies she would work with.

I didn't know what she was doing during that time, because I was only 6 years old when she started having sex on film. Mom worked in the porn industry until 2012. She shooted a few scenes between 2010-2012, but did many in the years 2008-2009. After she retired in 2012, I still didn't know about her porn career.

She revealed the truth to me when I turned 15 years old, because she knew I would otherwise find out somehow. My reaction then was calm, I did not like it, but I was calm. However, I was teased and bullied at school, some of the older students recognized mom from her previous career, they had seen her drop me off at school several times and recognized her. She taught me not to care and that I would see her old career as a job, when we were desperate for money, during a difficult period of our lives.

She then told me a lot about her career, she told me about an award she won for a scene she shot in 2008 with a male porn star named Jack Venice. I dropped the anger I had about what she did before, because I thought it was over. But recently, an old friend called her and wanted to talk to her about the porn industry, when I talked to her about it, she said she was considering going out of retirement to do some scenes. I can't take that, I just won't see my mom do that kind of stuff again.

What should I do about this and how should I persuade my mom not to go back?

984,"So if you were to go through some of my recent posts on my profile (about 14 days back) it tells a little story. But basically, my ""friends"" are starting to turn cold on me. Even my best friend, who've I known since kindergarten (and it's my senior year, so basically my whole life) is starting to treat me like shit. And I don't know what I did but I'm scared to confront him about it out of fear that this is all really just in my head. But I've seen the way he acts around people he doesn't like, and I'm heavily starting to feel that vibe.

Everyone seems fake now and I just feel so lonely now. No one to go to and talk about my problems, no  talk to just to talk. And the simple smartass answer I'll get is, ""WeLl JuSt GeT nEw FrIeNdS!"" And those are the people who don't know what it's like to lose everyone in your life at once. It's like I'm going through a heartbreak with multiple people at once. And I have no one to go to and comfort me.

But finding new friends seems like the only option at this point. The only problem is, that's not much of an option. I go to a small school with a graduating class of 60 people. The reason why I call (or once called) these people my friends is because out of the small pool of people to choose from, these were the ones I could click with. It's really not as easy as joining a new group.

So join a group outside of school, right? Yea, no. I live in a rural area in a really small town. There is literally nothing to do around, no communities or clubs to join, nothing. Plus anyone who's even close to my age is in my school, so widening the range to everyone in my town doesn't really widen the pool at all.

So the last solution I could think of was find friends online. And that seems like a pretty good idea, I like to play games, I used to have tons of online friends, so that could work, right? Only, I don't have good internet at all. So playing online real-time-sensitive games is pretty much impossible. My house is located between two hills (basically a valley) and surrounded by trees. We used to get pretty good internet through lines, but as the world quickly went wireless, all IPS's stopped maintaing and updating their lines resulting in not much that I could do. So playing online pretty much became impossible for me, and thus holding online friendships.

It's like the perfect storm was brewed just to ensure that I would become lonely and stay lonely. The worst part: I don't even know if this is all just in my head or not. But it definitely does seem like my friends' attitudes towards me have changed negatively. Its not so extreme that I think I have depression or need to go to therapy, but it still hurts. I hate it. I just want someone to talk to and hang out with... I hate being lonely...",13Jan2020,1

Currently I am part of a 6 form, a rank in the army cadets, and generally happy in life

I'm fearing that i will lose my place in the 6 form, or possible face a sentence due to this being a crime

992,"I work at a fire dept, and when I started here I was on fire(not literally). I was impressing everyone, and getting every job done right and with minimal error. Now 5 years in, I can't seem to get anything right. My job as of now is to drive the fire engine. This involves many things like memorizing all the tools on the truck and where they go, keeping everything clean, knowing where to go when an alarm comes in, pumping the truck, etc... 

I will use just today as an example. I start off the day telling my Captain that we have a certain tool on the truck. Upon inspection, the tool was not there, a tool that looked like it was. Though in my line of work this is not acceptable. I go to pump a small little garbage fire, the pump messes up. The whole crew is staring at me waiting for water. (this may have not even been my fault, still very awkward.) So after these few things happen my capt. ask someone else questions about my truck later instead of me, as he cannot trust me I guess. Immediately after that, we are going to a alarm to a regular address we always go to. I turn out of the station and go the wrong way. I know where the address is we go there all of the time. We get to the address and even though I went over the truck this morning with a fine tooth comb, and swore everything was there. I get to the scene and we are short 1 traffic vest. We can get in big trouble for not wearing traffic vests. At the scene I proceed to jump over some sort of spill from an 18 wheeler(non-hazardous) and i step right in it instead, everybody laughs. Why do things like this keep happening to me? This has become a constant thing. I NEVER used to be like this... NEVER!!! 

I also recently started getting random, maybe, panic attacks going to fire alarms. I've never been scared of a fire in my life. I'm just so afraid of messing up since it keeps happening all the time. How do I break this?! I mean its been happening so much all of my superiors have lost trust in my abilities. I try so hard, yet always coming up short in one way or another.",13Jan2020,1

anyway, one of my friends (call her B) said she could set me up with his number and try to get me closer to him, maybe even tell A I like him right off (if I say she can, ofc) not that I wouldn't love that and all, but I feel like for me and A to have a good friendship and maybe even more eventually, shouldn't it be more natural? Like, I do want his number and stuff, but I want us to at least be friends first. Yeah we are aquatinted but what we have right now isn't enough for that. agh, I'm so confused on everything. I would talk to A but I just am incapable of talking to people god dammit. 

B says that A would probably like me if he knew about me liking him which ofc could result in us dating but I feel like that wouldn't last long, if I just right up started dating him without knowing him enough, right? (don't get me wrong, I do know him, just not well enough.) I would love that but I just want to be his friend first.

The advice I'm asking for is, am I right for thinking this, or is it just a waste of time? if I wasn't so shy an awkward it would probably work out of I just told him right off, but it takes me a really long time to get comfortable around people. agh. Idk, fuck

994,"Had to make a throwaway for this one.

So my dad and his wife left for another part of the country to visit family for Christmas and they returned last week. 

Today I was going through my dad's wife's phone looking through the Christmas photos (with her permission) and I guess since we both have the same iPhone I kind of forgot that it wasn't my phone and went on Safari to Google something.

I was greeted to maybe 7 different bestiality websites that were in the ""recents"" page and it kind of shocked me. I knew I should of just turned the phone off but I knew for sure that my dad's wife wasn't the one who was watching these things so I checked the history tab and saw that only on 2 occasions were these websites visited, December 18th and December 25th. No other dates going all the way back to February of 2018 which is when she bough the phone nothing apart from typical old people Googling can be found like ""funny jokes"" and ""pierogies recipes"" so I'm quite sure that it wasn't her.

What do I do? I know that she was visiting family so I'm assuming when she wasn't supervising her phone someone was able to get into it and watch these things on the phone.

I went ahead and deleted the search history incase my dad finds it (he's alittle more tech savvy than her).

I'm honestly thinking that the best thing to do is not tell her about it, no real harm was done to her apart from someone using her phone without her permission.

She's probably the type of person to blow these types of things up if she found out about it.

What should I do?

TL:DR
I found animal porn on a relatives phone which I'm sure wasn't her doing but someone elses. Should I keep it hush or tell her that someone watched Animal porn on your phone?",13Jan2020,1

I currently work two jobs one I work a minimum of 16 hours per week the other varies can be 8 can be 30 if I want.

The only reason I want to stay, comfortable, anxiety is always a fear for me, my best friend is there etc.

What I want advice on really is how to keep this and juggle a second job one I am yet to have with my current one without pissing of my current employer (retail).

I am nearly 30 I need a serious income/change to be able to move out soon, hense me wanting a proper 2nd job / progression in the latter

996,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

For context, when I was a child I would often stay with my cousins because my mom got sick very easily and very often and my dad was already out of the picture. Last month I was talking to my friend and making jokes about silly stuff and somehow the topic shifted to sex and I made a joke saying something like “pee tastes salty” and my friend was taken aback because the topic wasn’t about something as weird as that. After ending the call and going to bed, I began thinking about that phrase and berating myself for making things awkward as per usual. Then I was like “wait a minute, why the hell do i even know that?” because even for a joke I don’t normally say stuff like that. 

And then I began thinking back when I was 8-9 and my brother was peeing in the toilet and I believed his pee tasted salty at the time which made things even weirder because why would a child think things like that, right?

So I thought back farther and I vividly remember my cousin making me suck his cock in his bedroom when I was like 4-5. I don’t know if my mind is playing tricks or me or something but I remember he came and kid me thought he was peeing in my mouth and all I could taste was something salty and the puzzle pieces just clicked in my mind.

The problem is I really want to think my brain is playing tricks on me and that I wasn’t actually raped or anything. I heard false memories are a thing so I want to know if this really is just a case of false memories and not reality. The other problem is I have another memory of the same cousin bringing me into his room to show me a porn video of a giant pizza party orgy but what if that’s just a false memory as well? Or what it’s true and that’s what made my mind create the memory of my cousin making me suck his dick? Was child me emulating what she saw in the prom video into her mind and that me now is taking it as a real memory?

It’s not exactly like I can ask my cousin either. I moved far away from the state the summer after fourth grade. I don’t think he has any social media as far as I know, either.

He’s like 10 years older than me so he’d be a preteen at the time he sexually assaulted me. That is, if he did at all. 

My question is, does it seem like he did? I idolized him the most when I was younger because he was the “cool, chill cousin” so maybe I’m just trying to deny it. I really don’t know anymore.

998,"I never talk about this kind of stuff, so please 

I'm in my second year of uni with a full time job to boot and I just can't understand where my head's at.

Since I can remember I've suffered from a confusing mix of emotional and mental issues which I have been trying to weather out on my own, but feel I now need some r/Advice. As soon as I get one malady under control, I seem to develop a new, more convoluted one which is more difficult to get rid of. GPs have historically put me under the category of ""mixed anxiety"", fed me a few pills (to mixed effect) and called it a day. If you were to interact with me in person, it's not very transparent that I'm suffering and maybe that's why the doctors see me as ""just another young man with depression+anxiety.""

Now though it's getting bad. I really dislike my life and have very little respect for myself. Add to that the fact that most people (myself included) see me as being in quite a privileged position with my career and education doing well, I'm feeling crap for ""ruining it"" and not being able to figure out how to quash this chronic anxiety and fatigue. And it's the fatigue that's really hitting me now.

I'm not enjoying uni life. A few low-level friends, a room with flatmates who don't speak English/don't talk and a degree course which is so poorly taught and organized it's beyond laughable. Relationships are undoubtedly off the table. My only ex left when she saw I was becoming ""more miserable."" The only family I really have is my mother and she suffers from similar issues to me (so if anything, we're probably bad for each other). The coursework is mostly half-baked and bores me to death. (This is another issue - I'm pretty darn nerdy and have historically made academia my main focus, neglecting, more than anything, my own well-being)

Something which has only been appearing in the past six months or so is absolutely debilitating me - the chronic fatigue. (I've often woken up in the night every couple of hours feeling physically sick and needing a glass of water - they feel like mini-migraines before bed - it's quite disconcerting). 

I can wake up - feel right as rain. Go a few hours in the day, then BAM. I can hardly keep my eyes open. But I'm not tired per se, just my head has decided it wants to stop functioning. Take a 45 minute break/nap, then I can go on for another 1.5/2 hrs. But it is destroying my studies and my work life.

A few other things to note:

* I'm petrified of hairdressers because I shake to hell when anyone's doing any ""precision work"" on my body. (So same for dentists, with sometimes disastrous effects). I can literally leave both establishments, sweating. I need to sleep after going. The more I try to resist, the larger the spasm.
* I get obsessive with, mainly the following things: Turning the computer off/logging off. I can click in and out of the menu tens of times before I commit to turning the computer off. I start sweating and cramping my hands. It's stupid, I know. I can't stop. Checking zips on bags, mainly my backpack. I usually do this at least once during a walk. It's even annoying me.

If anyone can relate or offer any advice, it would be truly appreciated.",13Jan2020,1
999,"So I’m turning 19 this Friday. For some reason, this number is hitting me extremely hard. It’s like I suddenly woke up and realized if I keep living the way I’m currently living, I’m going to waste my youth and end up living in my parents basement until I’m 30. I didn’t graduate high school, I have dyscalculia and it went undiagnosed until I dropped out my senior year. This made school incredibly difficult, I felt stupid and helpless, and most of the teachers were useless and just told me that I didn’t show up enough or that I just needed to study harder. On top of an undiagnosed learning disability, I’ve have agoraphobia and have dealt with anxiety since I could talk.  I’ve also had depression since I was a pre-teen, and all of this made school and life in general miserable. All I want in life is to live on my own with my cat and have a stable job. I don’t care if I end up in a shitty apartment with rats, I just need to get out. But the problem with this is: the only jobs that are readily available in my town all have to do with money, such as working a register. I cannot tell you what an impossible task this is for me thanks to my brain not working well with numbers whatsoever. If there is a job that doesn’t have to do with money or overly complicated numbers, it requires a high school diploma or GED. This may sound immature and spoiled, but I would rather break my own leg than return to any sort of school environment, just thinking about being in a situation again where I feel stupid and out of control makes me break out in sweat and itchiness. I also don’t drive because of my fear of doing things completely alone, I can barely drive with someone else in the car with me (I’ve only had a learners permit for a little over a year now) let alone driving to places all by myself. As I write this I’m realizing that I sound like a gigantic baby who can’t do anything for themselves, fantastic. I guess I’m just seeking advice on what to do with myself and my time, how to figure out what I want to do with my future, how to accomplish the things that scare me the most, how to feel motivated to do anything at all when everything just feels so goddamn difficult.

1000,"Hey there. So a little background on me, I'm a 19 year old female at a large state university.

I notice that whenever I'm at college, I feel overwhelming sadness.. almost like I'm depressed? But when I'm home for breaks I NEVER get this sad feeling. I'm not super close with my family or anything, and I honestly don't even like my home environment too much, but I never feel sad or depressed or lonely when I'm at home. 

I have no friends at college. I think I've pinpointed the issue.. loneliness and isolation. I don't have one person here that I hang out with or talk to. My roommate (we have separate bedrooms but share a bathroom) is really bitchy and dramatic and we hardly talk. I don't know anyone in my dorm or on my floor. Nobody is ever out. I hardly see anyone walking around the dorm. I'm starting new classes on Wednesday and I have no friends. 

Most days, the only person I'll talk to is a cashier at Starbucks. Aside from that I'm on my own. I call my long distance boyfriend (online, meeting him for the first time in March) every single day and he's honestly been such a blessing. He cheers me up and I have no idea how I'd manage this school year without him. He keeps me company and loves me and it gives me someone to laugh with.

I just came back from winter break yesterday and I already feel the sadness settling in. 

I know everyone says to join clubs or organizations, and I was thinking about joining a club for horse riding. I do have bad social anxiety and I'm pretty socially awkward, so it makes things more difficult. I'm overall a sweet and funny girl though.

1005,"So a little backstory. I'm 25M, had only one GF for 6 years. Broke up with her for over a year Dec 2018. I'm a very conservative and introvert. I hate to socialize, I have a few friends; and they're all trustworthy.  Surprisingly things have turned out well for me since then, I'm better position in life (financially, mentally). I mean 2019 was by far the best year I ever had. Now comes the issue, most of my friends have moved to different states due to their jobs. So, I'm left out by my self; but we do meet over long weekends or whenever we get office work in their city . Like I said I hate to socialize or make new friends (I have major trust issues since my breakup). Now, things turning good in life gives no reason to be mad/sad, right? Well at times I get the urge to ask someone out or date someone. I honestly have no dating skills anything whatever you call it which makes it harder for me to make a move, and as I mentioned about being conservative. It took 3 months for my last GF to convince me to be in a relationship. Breakup is a completely different story which I believe is not the best interest of this post. On a side note, all my friends have a +1, and I'm like the third wheel in their relationship (they treat me like Joey). So now the problem comes to meet new people I need to socialize which I hate, or go or ask someone out which usually happens in pubs/bars which is not my kind of place. How do I cope up with these feelings? I'm happy the way I am right now. Like everything in my life is good, I have a stable full-time job, financially doing well as my first car turned out to be my dream car; also supporting myself and my parents. I know it's not a big issue but might turned out big later on, so I better deal with it before it's too late as my parents are kind of worried if I would ever get in a relation. They are not pressurizing me for marriage or anything close to it but I'm sure that would happen soon in \~3 year.

1014,"I am an underweight 20M from Canada that want to learn how to fight and beat someone up(as self defense).

**I've been a nerd my whole life and was never athletic.** While I am getting good grades and was almost never bullied in latter high school and uni now, **I want to turn that around.** I want to learn and practice combat skills in all aspects including hand to hand combat, improvised weapon, actual(martial) weapons, firearms, combat tactics, etc. Or, jokingly put, I want to become a 'full stack fighter'.

I cannot just join the army since I have school, job, etc., and the Canadian army wouldn't accept a skinny guy like me, as is, anyways.

I had attempted working out with limited success(because I do not stick to a routine or very precisely calculate my calories and proteins) last year, but then when on a hiatus as school got busy. Now that everything settled down I want to work hard on this part of me.

So here's my plan I devised that I need help with:

I am planning to stick to the r/fitness beginner's muscle building routine with aggressive weight progression and less loafing around, and am looking at advice on whey powders or supplements in general.

Then, I am eager to try taking Krav Maga lessons, as I now have a job to pay for it anyways, though I need help finding good and affordable ones. I also want to know if it is possible to learn it from a book and online, and only go to the club with the instructor once every 2-3 weeks like how some people learn the guitar or piano.

After that, I need to learn to deal with actual weapons like swords, spears, firearms, grenades, etc. This part I am completely blank. How does one go about it without joining the military. And would I even need this knowledge given that I am certain I will never fight in a war and the unpopularity of firearms in Canada. So this may be optional.

So these are my plans, if you think this is childish, I agree, but I really need to stop being a nerd.

I would need all the advice I get, thanks in advance!

1020,"Hey, I'm a teen male living with my parents and my younger brother.

Sometimes I get in these really Debbie downer moods for weeks on end and I take it out on my family. Recently I just got a guitar and I love it but yesterday a bit that is glued onto the guitar came off. I'm very emotional and take everything quite literally so I immediately started spamming my mother messages about how I hate the guitar and it wasn't worth it.

My mum (Being the amazing person she is) saw I was upset and tried fixing it. She even rang up the place where she bought the guitar from to ask how to fix it. Long story short it's an easy fix but I continued to downplay it saying that it wasn't worth it and it was garbage. 

Just 20 minutes ago my mum and I talked about it and how it upset her knowing that she could have gone on a holiday but she instead decided to spend her savings on me and my brother so I can be happy, but for me to go say it's shit hurt her. When she started telling me this my brain finally clicked, I realised that I was hurting people without even realizing it. I feel an immense amount of guilt and I know that it's all my fault.

This has been a recent trend for me and similar situations like this has happened in the past. I'll be happy for a while then a few bad things happen and I go haywire. 

I want some advice on how I can control my emotions better so in the future I don't lash out at family and friends away and end up pushing them away. I want to be a better person.",13Jan2020,1

It was an app that could create captions on pictures (Ik there's a bunch of apps like that) but I really liked the style of it bc it was kinda like Snapchat (the font and the way the words are laid out is exactly like how it is on snap, no like fancy wording or anything like that).

I had to pay rent there and that's is perfectly fine with me. But when I got fired from that job, and moved back in with my parents, I had to pay rent. I am fine with i guess.... But I am not fine with is that my parents have a tracking app on my phone. And they check it constantly, and they don't want me to delete it (they have threatened to kick me out of the house, which they know damn well that I don't have the money to pay for an apartment). They question me on where I went and why I went. They believe that I am always smoking pot (tbh I am but I sneak out at 2am to do it) and will make jokes whenever I buy snacks, saying things like "" I guess you got the munchies"". I mean I was caught once, mostly because I was high when I thought to smoke more weed before I went back in to hangout with my parents. But that's not the worse part, they try to use religion to try to keep me from stuff like going to parties, sleeping over with my girlfriend, forcing me to go to church etc. And if I don't agree they either threaten me with being kicked out or buy raising rent.

1026,"When I graduated high school I didn't really have much of an idea of what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I picked up a part time retail job and did general education classes at my community college with the idea that I would figure something out eventually.

It's been sixteen years since then. The part time retail job has become a full time retail job that I loathe that doesn't pay me enough to let me live independently and I have no marketable skills that will keep me employed when they eventually automate out the crappy job I hate. 

I took a stab at my ""passion"" and did a year at art school immediately after community college. I never went back after learning that artists in general are treated like crap and paid even worse and doubting if I even had the talent to hack it. I entertained the notion of developing video games up until I learned what developing video games was actually going to be like.

My most recent attempt at learning something I can sell to someone for a paycheck was to take a single class back at the community college which was in essence an A+ Certification training class. I passed, barely, and the experience has me questioning if I'm cut out for IT work and if I should keep going or if I should pick a different direction and get a trade job since everyone is clamoring about how ""we need more people in the trades."" But then I get to wondering if I'm even cut out for a trade job being a 34 year old who is out of shape and overweight.

In summary: High school ended and for the last sixteen years I've been unsuccessfully trying to figure out what to do while my support platform erodes from under me and the fear of being broke and homeless looms over my shoulder.",13Jan2020,1
1027,"Hey 

So after years of being single, I got back on tinder about 3 months ago. 

I met up with 2 guys in 2 weeks on the app who were both pretty keen on me. 

Since then, I’ve been casually dating. Only 1 of those relationships has turned sexual but I feel like they’re both getting serious too fast and as a commitment phobe I tend to freak out and run at this stage. 

I feel like the lines of being in relationship vs casually dating/ seeing other people is really blurred because of tinder. I don’t feel like I’m in a proper relationship with either guy but also feel really sketchy about the situation as if I’m some sort of player/ cheater.

So as the title says I made friends with a group back in high school and I’ve always felt like an outsider. They’ve always been friendly and I like spending time with them.

But there’s another side of me which I don’t get to let out when I’m with them because they’re your stereotypical guys. I like playing video games (PC and Xbox), watching different films and want to try even more things down that route and explore that side of myself.

1041,"Hi everyone. I'll try to make this brief. 32 Male here. I've separated about 6 months from my wife of 13 years. We've been very distant for the last several years and finally decided to pull the bandaid off. 

I moved a few hours away, took a new job and decided to start fresh. I thought it would help me work out my own personal flaws and depression. So far, it's been horrible. 

I've hooked up with about a half a dozen women, and dated a few more on top of that. Each time its ended poorly. I've done a lot of thinking, I think it's just me.

Basically, I feel like I am just worthless fuck boy who has led on women to think I'm something special, they want to be in a relationship, and I bail. I seriously hate myself for it. I've toyed with the emotions of women to achieve the gratification and benefit of wanting to be wanted, then let them down when it gets to the point of commitment. 

I have to stop this cycle. I genuinely feel like its probably the worst thing I could do to someone. The only solace I can take is that it's never been for any material gain or investment, but that's about it. If anything though, I probably insist on always paying for everything and treating them because 1, it selfishly makes me feel better, 2, it's just another way to intice them in, and 3, when I do walk away I least know I havent put them out financially.

The last instance of this was the worst. This girl genuinely loved me, and I let her think I did. I never said I did, but I sure made it seem like I did. It broke her heart when made up a reason to break up. I let her think it was her. Fuck I hate myself. 

I talked to her the next day, apologized, tried to convince her I did her a favor, and that she deserves a lot better than me. I told her she was special and I am just a whore. I tried so hard to make her feel better because she truly didnt deserve that. 

I've decided I need to be alone. Literally 10 minutes after the break up I was making out with a random chick at the bar. I got her number and immediately went into thinking how I might be able to get a date with this one too. I am a serious piece of shit. 

Please help. Every time I think that maybe I need to be alone, work out my shit, and try again down the road. Except every time I even think about that, I crack. I cant stomach the idea of not having some one wanting me. I cant bring myself to think that if I take time off from dating or hookups that I'll be missing out. That I'll always be alone. That I have to keep this shit show on the tracks or I'll never be with anyone again. 

My family that lives close seem not to want to have anything to do with me. My friends all have lives and SOs, children, and apparatnly a much better level of maturity. Most dont really seem to want to hang out lately. It's probably because they've figured out my MO and also think I'm just a whore.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far, and if you have any advice I could really use it. I dont feel like I have anywhere to go.",13Jan2020,1

1043,"This is obviously not my main account because I'm afraid these harassers know my main account's name.

So this is more about someone whom I'm afraid can harm me. Short story relatively long: I was a part of a community, an online forum community (not reddit), where there were some people I mistook for edgy people, I thought they were trolling. These people self proclaimed to identify as child abusers and I thought they were elaborate trolls.

Turns out that's not the case, and two of them are sexually predatory female pedophiles, who've been victimizing and harassing people. These women attempted to make my life a living hell because I called them out and told them they were disgusting, and repeatedly gaslighted, verbally abused, and stalked me across various platforms. I reported their accounts on various sites to the sites themselves, but little was done for the longest time. Never the authorities. I got ahold of one of their dox and considered reporting them to the FBI, however, at the time, I was afraid the FBI would disbelieve me and not take my screenshots or any of my evidence as evidence. These people repeatedly admitted to having viewed child pornography and child abuse content on discord, and I was able to get one of them yanked, however, discord doesn't IP ban, so she was able to remake her account easily.

I have numerous evidences including one of them plastering all over their profile that they promoted pedophillic content. I can only assume the site itself didn't do anything about this because it was two female users involved (then again I don't think the forum does enough to combat male predators either). Nonetheless, something occurred in 2019 where these people found out *my* dox, and they tried to get me expelled from college and fired from my job, and harassed my family members. They were later *finally* expelled from the forum when the moderators told them to stop talking about pedophilia, and the doxing only made the people in my real life concerned for my mental health, as well as the people on the internet who later found out (I only told one person at first before going public about my ordeal). My mental health was going down the toilet because these people were harassing me and I never want to deal with it again. They seemingly disappeared for months and I thought I was in the clear.

Unfortunately, the fallout is that I've recently learned they've cropped up again in other communities. And active in those places. They were outed as being predators on a public forum and you think that would be enough shaming, but unfortunately they've changed their aliases, and they have new stomping grounds. At this point, I'm contemplating reporting them to the FBI, but I need a way to do it anonymously with some kind of IP changing software, and I would prefer not to have to give the FBI my information to avoid being chased after. I have a feeling that they may've been reported to the FBI before but they did nothing. They solely admitted to viewing child abuse content rather than distributing it. When I asked my dad, whose father has a background in legal, if the FBI would be able to pursue any action against them, he said they tend to focus more on the distributors of child porn. However, these people are still in communities with minors where they can actively abuse children, and I do not think that's safe. I've informed the communities of their identities and implored them to get them off their site, given these communities evidence of their abuse and they are currently processing my claims. But I am afraid for my own safety if I get these predators taken down off the internet without them being arrested by some kind of authority, because they know where I live, and they are deranged enough to come and harm me if they truly have the drive to, or attempt to do more damage to me from afar. How should I go about this? Should I report them to the FBI, or any kind of government entity, and is there any way I can do so *anonymously?*",13Jan2020,1
1044,"I recently left a 6 year abusive relatio ship. Right now 80% of my belongings are in a storage shed in Place C (each place is a seperate state)

I am currently in Place B, staying with my parents, 32 hours away from Place C, 6 away from place A. I have two kids and a finical plan, but my parents are very well off people so while I am with them I dont have to pay rent or for food and utilities (so basically all that is left is stuff ror my kids, and anything I go do on my own and my phone and streaming services). While I am here I help take care of my sick grandma who only has about 2 years left, and do house work and errands for everyone and cook. My parents also are able to watch my kids for the occassional appointment and so I can go out here and there (rarely). However, I have a particular way of raising my kids (minimal technogy and lots of healthy food, lots of time outside, open ended natural material toys, ect) and being here highly hinders that. The house is set up in a way that means we have to have more rules, which leads to more arguments, our routines get messed up, between my parents and grandma my childrens eating habits are being destroyed, and i can not turn around with out someone shoving a screen or tablet at them. But staying with them for another year and a half or 2 allows me to save money, obviously, by a lot, and gives time with my grandma I cant get back. But it takes a huge toll on my mental health, with the interfering with the kids thing. Also i have no friends out here, at all, and have made great effort to make some and it does not work out. But there is an option to move to the basement (completely finished with extra kitchen), my parents rather me do that than move out (they love having me and the babies there) but my mom still is sad at the thought of me moving down there, and painted the kids room that is upstairs (this is a huge house btw) and we have a whole set up there already. This also means I can work (all online and at home) less so I can focus on my entrepreneur/ big dreams more. Also if I wait to move and stay here, I will be leaving at the same time my little sister goes to college. Then there is the simple fact that: i cant do adult things here, like have sex or smoke (not cigarettes) and while that isnt a huge deal, it is frustrating. I also can not bring a partner here, but can have very close friends over and honestly there are a lot of fun things (a fancy dinner club, a pool, a tiki bar, ect)

Place A, I have thought about moving to over summer. I would rent from my grandma, my rent would be lower but I would be responsible for maintence unlike a normal renting situation. I already drive to place A 1-2 times a month, and that is where all my friends are, many of whom have similar parenting practices and kids my age. I also have a partner there, but it is a new relationship and they arent a huge factor in my choice, they have not met my kids yet (and I wouldnt want them to until we have been together for 6 months) and I was thinking of moving there before we got together. While this would be good for my mental health, I obviously wouldnt be saving nearly as much money, and I would not have my parents to babysit (but I have one relative and 2 friends I trust with my kids, which I am very picky over who watches them). I would have to do more work, which takes away from my other focuses but more importantly, my kids. Because I already drive here 1-2 times a month I could change that to place B, so my kids can still have a solid foundation with my parents, sister and grandma. I know that I would be very happy and it would be so good for my mental health and give me the space and ability to parent my own way which helps my relationship with my children but I feel like giving up the opportunity to save up money isnt fair to our future. My parents also really dont want me to go, so I feel guilty about it.

1047,"Hi, i'll try to give mercy and spare the longevity of details. My short story is that I live in a place that is inevitably unhealthy for me and is effecting my health. I need to move out. I tried contacting homeless shelters but none that didn't require specifications that wouldn't apply to me nearby were available; whether it's paying, working to stay, getting a job after x time, being married, etc. I called a help line and they concluded there were none they could find anywhere near. I tried to contact police and their advice was none the more groundbreaking. I've lost over 8 jobs due to problems I have and it's improbable for me to suggest i'll be able to keep one.   


 I am looking to do any kind of freelance work to leave this place. I've gotten a lot of things set up strategically. I purchased inventory with the money I had including shipment items/items to assist with shipping. I've set up different freelance accounts, etc. But my issue is to start these things. I can't seem to do these things. My problem with my jobs was not that I was not complying with work, I worked overtly and with passion. I worked hard and I definitely think I worked well. The reason I lost said jobs was because I quit almost all due to my issues and got fired only by one for them.   


 I have tried medicine, yes. I have acute ADHD symptoms. But pills are not working. They normally force focus on things that are not productive. At least I force focus on non-productive things and focus on them even more. Not only that, but i've been on multiple ADHD/antidepressant medications and have had adverse reactions for each. Hallucinations, anger, manic episodes, etc. The very ones I was just on I experienced acute serotonin syndrome symptoms that I am very certain were just that. I fear they are simply not safe for me. I get a similar effect from coffee but less severe, and I keep drinking coffee trying to get the same feeling, I fear that the medication is going to become addictive. I almost passed out the last time I took them.   


 I need to focus on these things, but I keep on inadvertently jumping to something else. If anyone can give me ideas, i'd really appreciate it. I'd also appreciate things to do to make money online.",13Jan2020,1
