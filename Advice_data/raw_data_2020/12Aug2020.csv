1,"Is the age 22 too late to join the US Marines/Army? I think it’s what I need to do in my life because if I stay in this small town any longer, it will be the death of me. I’ve been arrested, overdosed, fights, drugs... I’m sick of letting my family down because they spoil me so I’m asking can I join the marines or should I just go to rehab and potentially keep on doing the same ole shit here in this town and ruin my life?

Thanks.. seriously 
I need some advice",12Aug2020,1

4,"So, I’m a volunteer leader on a farm, although I just started to volunteer there so I’m still trying to get into the flow of thing. There was another volunteer there who has no animal experience, who I was helping and teaching her just general things about animals and how to do things around the farm. One of my friends also volunteers there, and she has a similar background to myself so she doesn’t need animal training like the other girl does. 

We were all in a barn that had chicks and a rooster, and my friend who has animal experience had said she was gonna clean the roosters pen, and I told the other girl that she could help give the chicks food and make sure their water was clean and where that was and what not. As that was happening, I realized I forgot to water some plants and also left things at the upper barn so I went up there to do those things and assumed that everything would be fine. Well, i came back down and the rooster had gotten out, which wasn’t an issue because those things happen so I helped to catch him and then they both told me the other thing that happened. Pretty much, the girl who was taking care of the chicks put their heat light onto a carrier and burned a hole in it. My first worry was to make sure we cleaned the plastic off of the light so it didn’t burn, and I totally forgot to tell the person who in charge that it happened cause of that and the rooster thing and just generally making sure everything was cleaned up and where it should be. 

So today she texted me asking about it, and I told her what happened and that I was sorry that it happened and that I forgot to tell her. I think this is because of anxiety, but my mind is going to the worse place possible that she’s gonna ask me to not volunteer because of what happened cause the other girl was my responsibility. She said that we’re gonna have a meeting to talk about ways to prevent this from happening again, which implies that they won’t ask me not to go anymore, but my mind is still racing. 

I know that I need to make sure not to leave them alone again, but any other advice would be greatly appreciated.",12Aug2020,1

7,I’m going to be attending a university as a freshman in college and I am currently stressed giving current circumstances with covid. I am going to a university full time with classes online everyday some alternating obviously. But I was just curious about going to a community college instead to relieve some stress for me. Because I know at a community college you can have a more flexible schedule. The financial aspect is not a problem for me because my fafsa covered a lot so going to either would be about the same price for me. I’m more concerned with sitting in front of a computer screen all day long almost everyday. Both colleges are online but i figure going to a community college will let me have a more flexible schedule while allowing me to work as well. Thoughts? Advice please?,12Aug2020,1
8,"Hi... well the title makes it seem like it was intentional but we think it happened while they were playing and the older dog accidentaly bit down too hard and crushed the pups chest area basicly killing her almost instantly... It happened on  saturday at 23:44 and all we heard was the short cry of the pup so we didnt exactly see what happened and the older dog was standing above her and he looked kinda confused. We believe it was an accident because if he did it out of spite he would have ripped her apart and growl ect. And now i cant bring myself to face the older dog. Im afraid that if i show him affection or anything like that he will take the accident as granted and that he'll think he did a good thing but at the same time i dont want to push him away since hes a good dog and this is the only bad thing he has done since 2009 when we got him.
Ill appreciate any advice if someone knows how dogs behave and how should i treat him.
We had the pup for only a month but she'll forever stay in our memories....",12Aug2020,1
9,"NO SPOILERS

I made a throwaway account to ask this. Two nights ago I watched The Call Of The Wild and it was an amazing movie, but it was super sad. I never really cry over movies, but this movie made me ball my eyes out for an hour. I know it’s embarrassing but it was a beautiful movie. Usually when I see a sad movie I get over it in a day, or I just reassure myself “it’s just a movie” and I’m fine. But for some reason this movie really got to me and whenever I think about it makes me really, really depressed. Like some scenes were so sad and beautiful and depressing at the same time, but I just can’t get over it. I try to distract myself but it’s hard to not think about it. It really ruins my mood and I just want to sit and do nothing. For example, today I was playing a game with my friends but I thought about the movie and got in such a bad mood that I just had to get off. I know it might seem stupid because there are way more important things going on in the world right now, but I just have no idea what’s happening. It’s so embarrassing and sorry for ranting, but idk what to do. :(",12Aug2020,1

12,"My mom is about to turn 57 this month and she is easily over 210 pounds. I'm scared even saying over 250, but it wouldn't be hard to believe if that was the case.

She spends most of the day on the couch watching tv or on her phone. She will get up to take care of my God daughter (2) and nephew (4)  (she gets paid to babysit) when they need her or they're being trouble makers. She doesn't cook like she would when I was younger. My sister and I do most of the cooking. She will do chores every Saturday and water the grass, then spend the rest of the day sitting down again.

I've had conversations with her telling her to join me on walks and that she should eat healthier. If that was to difficult to do, at least eat less of the junk food she does now. She acknowledges that she needs to change for the betterment of her health, but to no avail.

She had an injury at work a few years ago and at that time she had lost alot of weight, but since the accident she gained a lot of weight back. She complains that her foot hurts and her lower back hurts. I wouldn't doubt that it would hurt and I believe her. It's just difficult seeing my mom that way. I feel like if she she just sits around her muscles will get weaker and weaker and she'll struggle more in the future. (She can walk. She isn't disabled).

My dad who is 61 eats super healthy, he goes to the gym, he goes jogging, he gardens, and is a truck driver. My grandma who is 78 has had knee surgery, cooks, cleans, walks, gardens, and lives alone.

14,"Hi there ! It's the first time i'm talking about this, i have never brought this up and i hope i'll feel better after that, because it's really hard to keep this kind of things for yourself..(also excuse me if my english isn't perfect)

So...Let's start by an example. Let's say that i'm hanging out with my friend, enjoying life and having fun times...But at some point of time, my brain decides to worry about a stupid detail that'll make me question if i'm really enjoying it, or even worse, that'll make me doubt our friendship..Then i'll start asking myself a lot of questions and have a ""debate"" with myself which will make me, for real this time, stop enjoying the moment and maybe lose a friend.
this is basically how i have been acting, i don't even know when it actually started, but it did at a point in time and it's kind of ""ruining"" my life. sometimes it makes me stop liking games I love, movies, songs etc...I just don't know how am I supposed to deal with that, all I want is to stop worrying about stupid random things (they're usually not even negative, but my brain decides that they are and i start to kind of fight/debate with it to convince myself that it's not...i know it's weird) and focus on what i'm supposed to focus on as a normal human being. The fact that I don't know what to do makes me cry. Thanks for reading ! 🥰",12Aug2020,1
15,"For the past month or so, my two bestfriends have been dating and I genuinely like them together. Lately, let’s call them Anna and Ciara, Anna have been acting a bit strange around Ciara. A few days ago, we were all in a discord call with friends and Ciara went to go have a shower. It became quiet because it was quite late so I was like asleep. I woke up to hear Anna say “man, I want to hold Leia’s hand” randomly. Quick back story, Leia is Anna’s ex girlfriend. And I was quite confused since Ciara hates Leia with a passion since Anna and Leia cuddled without Ciara knowing. Not once or twice, on multiple occasions they have met up and cuddled. I stayed quiet and I clicked off the call to go be utterly confused. A few days passed and Ciara doesn’t know that Anna said it, and it hurts that Anna said that without hesitation. I know that things are better off not said like this but when it comes to wanting to hold hands with your ex girlfriend is weird. I mean, Anna and Leia both cheated on their old partners to be with eachother and they felt no remorse for doing so.  I just don’t want to see Ciara hurt by someone who she loves and have Anna constantly secretly going over to Leia’s house to cuddle. The only reason why Ciara knew about the whole cuddling  is because Anna’s snap map location was on and Leia posted a pic of her cuddling Anna and one of Leia’s friends sent it to Ciara. I just don’t know what to do and it’s making me feel guilty knowing that Anna wants to be back in Leia’s arms again despite her and Leia being taken.",12Aug2020,1

I started talking to a guy the other week, and honestly I really like him, and he has said he feels the same. The problem is, the more we talk on the phone, the more real the possibility for a relationship seems—which SCARES me. We'll be on the phone chatting for *x* amount of time, making each other laugh and having genuine conversations, but once I hang up, that happiness I felt during the call turns to fear and feeling like I'm going to cry (I'm assuming that's from being a bit overwhelmed).

21,"I'm so sorry of thid doesn't make sense, also delete if not allowed 

So I have these group of Internet friends that I gathered years ago and we're still going strong. 

We talk about deep stuff, make fun of each other jokingly, start calls, helping one another, venting and all that. And when they seek advice/comfort I'm gonna be there,and they're gonna be there for me. 

Lately I've been distancing myself from my friends even if they have been nothing but nice to me, we rarely even fight.

But sometimes I just have the urge to get rid of them in my life, or even come to the point where I act more of an asshole, or even hurt them at some point but I'll stop myself from doing so and just leave them there hanging. The moment I get sad I'll just go away, and when they try to contact me I spat out stuff about how it's so hard to trust them, and questioning if I even belong in the gang.

22,"Hi guys, I have both a gaming laptop and desktop, and am looking for some advice on if I should sell the desktop.

It is also connected to 2 monitors and a number of usb devices/speakers. I usually use my laptop for all gaming applications and the desktop for school (bigger monitors). I realized that if I could dock my laptop to all of my accessories I would no longer need my desktop. Side note, it is a prebuilt with personally upgraded ram.

24,"Hi, I should probably post this on a technology security page but I need advice to ease my mind more than anything. I'm a very anxious person who gets very paranoid and worried easily especially regarding online safety so would just love someone to put my mind at rest. I completely understand that my issue is nowhere the worse thing ever or any where near some of the situations in here but I don't have anyone else to ask. I don't even expect anyone to be able to help really since this might not even be a big deal but I was hoping someone could put my mind at rest 

I've had the same email account for years and it's always been fine but a few months ago I got an email from instagram saying someone had logged into my old account who wasn't me, so I changed the password and eventually deleted the account since I no longer needed it (but I made a new on with the same email &amp; password) a few days ago I got another email from Instagram saying the same thing happened again for my new account so I deleted the account again just to be safe and since I never used it.  The next day I had an email from Snapchat, as welll as a few other social media accounts and websites letting me know someone had logged into my accounts with the same email. I changed all those passwords and deleted some unneeded accounts. So I was already thinking someone was playing around with my email and then yesterday around 10pm I got an email from a random account from an email server I've never heard of - it wasn't hotmail or gmail or anything. The email had no subject and just said ""Goodnight"". That was pretty weird and creeped me out a lot. It just shook me up since there was suspicious activity with my email anyway it just panicked me. I remembered a friend got a similar email before a few months ago from a different address. It got me worrying someone had even gone as far as hacking my phone / phone camera and could see that I was in bed which was why they emailed me goodnight? 
Does anyone have any advice, I just want my mind to be put at rest and stop panicking about it? Any help is appreciated thank you. :)

Edit- I forgot to add that I found my email listed on a website which tells you if your email /passwords and data have been pasted on a data sharing website so  that could be where it started. The website didn't say when my email information was posted and the paste has since been deleted.",12Aug2020,1
25,"Hi all,

This has been bothering me for a while. I like played it off as a joke before but now it's just getting to me. I am 20 years old and have never had a boyfriend or any form of physical touch so like no kiss, hugs or even holding hands!!!! A complete virg...All my girlfriends have been in a relationship or flings and come to me for advise. I am usally happy to give it to them too but I just feel like I am getting bitter so I am starting to judge them for their choices instead of being helpful. This has been the case since highschool and I thought I'd have a better shot in college. I am now in my last year and still had no luck.

Is there something wrong with me? Why am I never approached by guys? What can I do to be more approachable as I've been told I am stand-offish? I am also totally bad with flirting and have zero clues on how to do it or like when someone is flirting with me (which I think is highly unlikely because of this I feel I am very undesirable)

I guess one difference I've noticed between us is that they're skinnier than me. I am slightly overweight and wouldn't say I am fat maybe chubby is a better word. I know I need to lose weight but will that make a difference?

28,"The backstory, I want to understand what you would have done if in my situation. Sorry for length.

I took a stroll on the beach with my wife and metal detector at approx. 22:30 BST, quite dark and very quiet. The beach (Aberporth) is split into two sections, we was on one side, and in the middle a group of rocks separate us from the other beach. We started to move to the other side of the beach via the roadway when we heard loud sobbing, we thought it was from a van parked up near the rocks and walked over to make sure no one was in danger, the sobbing was then found to be coming from the sea.

We shined a light to the ocean and there was a woman wading waist height and crying hysterically. I asked the missus to call 111 as I dropped everything and hurried over to check on her, she turned and screamed at me to get away and ran down the beach to the other end.

A man from the van came out to check what was happening (he was trying sleep at the time,) I updated him and he stayed with us while the operator put us through to the ambulance service.
The lady remained sitting in the sea, and started to lay down while the tide came in. We went back down after getting the thumbs up from the services operator to try and get her out again. It was only us 3 on the beach at this time.

It took a lot of coaxing to get her out, she smelt of alcohol and kept saying she wanted to swim and she was sorry for slamming a door. In the end she let us pick her up as she could barely stand, two cops were walking to us as we were getting closer to the steps that lead off the sand, and took over. Soon six coastguard crew members turned up and also helped.

When my wife and I went up back to the rocks, a crowd of around 15-20 people had formed, and they soon started asking why cops were there and why we called the services. It took me back, and now I'm questioning myself if we should have dialled 111/999. 
I felt I had to defend my actions against this hoard of people.

What would you have done? The cops and coastguard didn't tell us off for calling them.


TLDR: I thought I might have saved a lady by calling emergency services, although the locals have made me question if the choices I made were right",12Aug2020,1
29,"thank you for reading! i (18f) have a superficial relationship with my dad (51m). i recently had my first fight with him, and now he’s ignoring the fact that we need to talk. 

for context: my parents divorced a few years ago. it was never a happy marriage (they mainly got married because they had me), but my dad was emotionally absent for most of my childhood and my mum essentially raised me in terms of parenting. my dad has a high stress job and would end up drinking every night, and though he was never ab*sive, seeing my dad drunk every night wasn’t exactly great for my character development lmao.

i’m also the eldest sibling and ended up shouldering a lot of stuff (i obviously am still very privileged and grateful but yknow it’s still hard to deal with), so i’ve always been very demure, and i pretty much always concede to anyone (especially my dad). i let myself be talked over, learnt not to express my opinions, and kept to myself. he’s also not great at communicating and thinking about how his actions harm others.

my dad recently remarried and moved into the pre-divorce home with his new wife and her kids. i go in between my mum and dad’s houses weekly and i find my dads house a very stressful environment as i have severe OCD/anxiety and though i function reasonably well, it’s still very hard to live there. 

okay, so recently i’ve worked really hard on bettering myself (speaking up, calling people out, just practicing self-love, etc) and i’m so proud of myself for the woman i’m becoming. this has led to me standing up to my dad for the first time. the fight started as him saying something horrible that i won’t go into detail about, but i essentially called him out on it. he then explained that i took his words out of context and it was a misunderstanding. i then pointed out that he needs to work on communicating and recognising the harm he does. he got angry at this, and things escalated as i described some of the ways his lack of communication harmed us and our mum during their marriage and afterwards. he took this as me taking my mum’s side in the divorce and was very upset/mad. he told me to call him when “i was ready to listen to his side of the story” and hung up. my main point of the argument was that he needs to work on himself, get some fucking therapy and stop the emotional harm and trauma he’s causing my siblings and i.

i avoided him for a while by staying at my mum’s, he got mad at my mum for “bringing me into the divorce” (even though we’ve always been part of it), and he was passive aggressive about me not going to his house. he “apologised that i felt that way” and essentially avoided the actual elephant in the room. i’ve recently started going to his house again and he’s completely ignoring the problems we have. he’s very awkward with me. 

i feel like i should bring it up, but my dad isn’t a bad person. i love him dearly and he has lots of good points even with his flaws. i feel like whenever i say them out loud, the issues i have with him are trivial and i’m blowing things out of proportion. however, i feel so sad, stressed and anxious around him and whenever i stay at his house i end up waiting to go back to mum’s. 

i feel like i need to have this conversation with him, but i’m scared of hurting him and losing our relationship. furthermore, i don’t know if i’m justified or just being too sensitive. my dad is very sensitive and vulnerable underneath his actions and i feel like i’ll hurt him irreparably, but i just can’t keep conceding to him and being demure. 

i’m thinking about talking to him tonight, any advice would be much appreciated :) thank you!",12Aug2020,1

34,"Hello,

I'm in my first year of college in England. I have felt like I'm behind / less knowledgeable than the other students in my class right from the start. This has only been increased by the online-learning.

After fighting the college, I have been given the option to retake my first college year, and start college again. However I'm just not certain of what I want to do.

I feel I'm really behind, so it *may* help to restart. But it means I've lost a year of my life, I'll lost the friends that I've made, and I'll have to resit literally the exact same lessons for another year.

I was offered this a couple of months ago, the deadline to decide is the 26th of August. I've been ignoring it up until now, as my mental health has been fragile enough as it is, and this is just pushing me over the edge.

I have never been able to date because I'm short which led me to using escorts, I have become addicted to it because for those few hours I like to pretend I'm as attractive as a tall guy as stupid as it sounds.

I have also started to drink more and more to cope with my depression about balding and being short, I realized that I'm out of time, I won't ever be able to have a family of my own because of whats wrong with me physically.

But having to see escorts every time I want just some intimacy keeps making my depression worse. I don't know what advice I'm looking for, I just wanted to post this since I don't have anyone to talk to.",12Aug2020,1
36,"So a bit of a back story, I am a 16 year old from a low income, not very sober family. I live in a town in which I live 20 minutes away from a place to work, with my mom refusing to provide transportation (it’s “inconvenient” but whatever it’s not the point). 

So I really like to do art, and other crafty things. So I have an idea, to start making cute lil earrings, like gummy bear shaped and dinosaur shaped, or cannabis leaf shaped, or any shape really(via epoxy resin). I also may include a few things in it like special stickers, candy maybe, just a cute little package that so many people can enjoy and just a fun way to make their day :) 

However, I’m a bit stuck, considering I’m starting with nothing right now. I’m trying to scrape together money; no one wants odd jobs done due to the virus and every other teen in my area doing that too. 

Please don’t be mean, I really am trying my hardest to find a way to make and save money so I can improve and eventually escape my bad situation. Any advice is helpful. Cheaper molds/resin, advice for jump starting a online business, spreading love- anything helps. 

Thank you for yourc time. Remember that y’all are loved and to stay strong and positive &lt;3",12Aug2020,1

39,"So this last semester before my college went online, I was in a science lab with this guy— I will refer to him as Alvin. Behind his back (and occasionally to his face) I have referred to him as “Hot Alvin”— for reasons I’m sure you can guess. He was my lab partner, and he was the best kind of lab partner, because he was smart, hardworking, knew what he was doing, always let you copy his work in a pinch, etc.

In chem lab I am a bit of a goof. I love to joke and sing along with the teacher’s music; however, Alvin is completely stonefaced through all of my shenanigans, and he only cracks a half-smile every now and again when I double down on teasing him (always a victory for me). I’d like to think the majority of people find me amusing to some extent, and to me, this fact just makes Alvin’s lack of amusement towards my nonsense so much funnier. 

Anyways, I was just thinking about him today, I decided to follow him on Instagram, and I thought about texting to say hi and see what he has been up to all summer. The problem is we have never talked about things other than lab, and in just about every sense of the phrase (minus my S-tier lab-humor) Alvin is “out of my league,” so I don’t want it to seem like I’m simping. I think the only time we ever interacted outside of lab was when he snuck up behind me and scared me while I was in line in the dining hall— then he just walked away without explanation.

I know if I express this concern towards any of my irl friends they will just assume I am thirsty and have a crush on him, so I am asking you guys. How does a normie talk to a popular without the ‘desperate’ connotation? 

I honestly just want to be nice, see how he has been, and maybe start a soft friendship that will bloom into future ochem-lab partnership, because let’s be honest, if I am going to survive ochem, I’m going to have to lock one of those smarties down LOL. Otherwise, I have no devious ulterior motive.

Thanks for helping :)",12Aug2020,1

It was closing time, I was setting things up in the back room and he comes in and stands really close to me making small talk. He started caressing my face down to my chest and was kissing me. He pushed me up against the table and started rubbing my crotch and grabbing my chest. I was in more shock than anything, but I let him do it. I don’t think I can get him in trouble since I let him do it, even though I really didn’t want it to happen.

41,"So I want to go on a trip, not even far from where I live, like 4 hr drive, with my boyfriend to a different state. My parents are somewhat strict. Here’s the thing tho. I’m pregnant, and they know. They know my boyfriend is the father, yet won’t let me even spend the night with him and I’m confused as on why. Every time I ask they just say “Bc I said so”. I am in school, as well as currently also working, so it’s not like I’ve gone completely off the rails. 


How do I convince them to let me take a 3 day trip. Seriously just a weekend with him before the baby is born. I don’t ask for much, I don’t do much besides try to spend family time and boyfriend time and squeeze time in with friends. 

Should I just tell them the day before? 
Should I just text them when I’m on my way?

43,"backstory: myself, A, and B have been close friends for a while. A has a friend group of her own and B and I are “bestfriends”. A has been a good friend of mine for a while but she was always on the caddy side. recently i’ve realized how much crap and personal information she shares about her other friends, so i stopped opening up to her knowing she most likely talks badly about me aswell. B and i never gossip together. A noticed how i distanced myself and was upset about it so one night i screwed up and called her for support. that night she did nothing but remind me how much i screwed up, claimed it was tough love after i asked her to just support me in this moment that i knew what i did was wrong. 

Now, I am moving and it has been incredibly stressful for my family i’ve given my full attention to my family. Instead of asking why i have been distant she just assumed it was about her. i explained to her everything going on and how personally i have come to be very content by myself. it went in one ear and out the next because all she insisted was i “don’t prioritize her after years on friendship”. i told her her feelings were valid but she doesn’t respect or respond to my honest reasons.

Recently i found out A and B have been talking alot of shit. I ended my friendship with both, A has been hindering my self growth for so long and makes me feel small. I confronted B saying that if she continues to talk badly with A we are no longer friends. she said “um okay” so I’m just walking away it is truly not worth it to me, especially since I am moving.

How do i deal knowing my two closest friends have been and will continue to talk badly behind my back? I already left both friendships but it still bugs me. i know A is bending the truth because she talks that way to me about others all the time. I don’t bother to defend myself for it will cause pointless drama for two people i’d rather not even keep in touch with. it hurts how B didn’t care to ask my feelings on everything. how do i get over this? i assume it’ll just take time since it just happened today but still any advice is loved. 

TLDR: my closest friends have been talking shit about me, they don’t care to respect or even ask what i have to say so i chose not to cause more drama and just leave. how do i deal?",12Aug2020,1
44,"I’m currently in college, doing Civil Engineering. I’m on my 8 month co-op term right now (internship basically) and I am working full time right now in my field as a surveyor. I still need to go back into my final year in January and I should get my diploma in August. By the time that happens I’ll be 24, so if I do go to university right after, I’ll be 24 and graduate at 28-29. Which in my opinion is a very late start at life and this feels like a disadvantage.

I can’t help but feel like I wasted my time here in college, and I regret not going to university right away. I could’ve been starting my third year at university by now but instead I’m in college. A technologist diploma is nothing compared to an actual bachelors in engineering in the long run.

My mom is telling me that I should just try to get a full time offer at my current internship as a surveyor, so I can go work full time right after college. She says it’s too late for university and I should’ve done it instead of college. Instead I should focus on setting myself up for a full time job.

This internship will allow me to pay off my college debt entirely at least and still have a few thousands of dollars leftover. So if I do go to university then I could do it without any college debt at least. But I am mostly worried about rent and food, if I go to university. My parents likely won’t help me out financially and as far as I know, the student loans and grants give enough money for just tuition, so I’ll be all alone for rent and food.

So, should I go to university right after college? Or forget about it and just go get a full time job?",12Aug2020,1

49,"So I have social anxiety and naturally it affects how I am in public but worse it affects who I am around my friends / people I’ve just met 
As a teen I had the same group of friends for years, we are all introverts who don’t go out like most teenagers and so I got used to not making friends and not socialising. so i was out of practice by the time I went to university and I realised how awful I was at making friends   
My high school was small and I never did outside school activities so never made friends there. 
Basically I just get so insecure whenever someone has a better personality than me or has the personality traits I want like being loud funny and confident and I revert into my shell and find it hard to be myself. 
Idk why I’m so insecure about my personality and I worry no one likes me and I’m just the person whose there on the sidelines that no one would care if they weren’t there. I don’t add anything to the group and no one would notice if I was gone
Sometimes I feel so different to the friends I made at university and I can’t help but shut myself away but when I hang out with university friends I can’t help but revert into myself and think I’m so annoying and that No one likes me I have such a bad personality but then when I distance myself and don’t hang out I worry I’m being distant and I’m missing out 
Bc I never had a massive friend group or loads of friends I got so used to my friends and got too comfortable in my comfort zone which makes it harder to make new friends. Some of my uni friends had huge friendship groups and as there were so many of them they had to get used to being the loudest and talking the most to be heard above so many other friends but bc I never had a big group I never had to and I always knew my place in my group but I find it so hard in big groups. Ive never ever liked big groups some people thrive off it and I just don’t. I’m an introvert I prefer small groups of like 3-4
Also I’m cripplingly self conscious and I hate attention on me in a big group there nothing worse than saying something in a big group and everyone looks at you I feel so awkward. 
Anyway I don’t even know what I’m asking advice for I just don’t know how to ever feel comfortable meeting new people.  I feel like I’ll never be happy with my personality and that I’ll always compare myself to other people who are better and funnier than me. It’s got so bad that I can’t even hang out with my friends because I worry so much that I’m just boring and I can’t stop comparing myself to the loud and funny people in my group. So I shut myself in my dorm room and ignore everyone but then I miss out on so much and I get further away from my friends and gradually less close with them but there’s nothing I can do.

I’ve recently gone through two breakups. I was the one who ended it both times. These men I were with did nothing particularly wrong to make me do so, its just that I’ll wake up one day and totally change my mind about being with them. 

I didn’t have much trouble breaking things off, despite having being extremely emotionally invested, vulnerable, and kind of obsessed with them at one point

So, when he messaged, it just started with a 'hey' but then he tried to get me to go to a party and try shrooms with him (which i don't do any drugs) and was pretty suggestive with what he wanted to do afterwards. I used to do a sport with the girl he's now married to and so I checked his profile like ten times just trying to make sure that he was *actually* the same guy so I didn't cause any drama and he was definitely the same guy, the engagement post was still his last posted thing.

However, I still have the girl on my socials and I don't want to unfollow her but she is always posting about how happy they are and everyone is always talking about how they'll be one of those couples that last decades and the guilt of having not told her before the wedding is kind of eating at me.

I need 4 history classes to pass, and I only have one of those so completed far. Two of those history classes are half a semester, so I was going to take one class this year and the other two next. I also need an art credit. That s h o u l d be easy, but a lot of people fail art because of the teacher losing all the papers, and I can't risk taking it my senior year and failing, so I was going to take it this year. However, I wasn't aware ACT Prep was a class I required too (If it is? They put it on my schedule without me asking for it, so I'm assuming it is.) I also am in Family Studies, which I could replace because it's the last class of the course as of right now. But they are thinking of adding another class to that course which I r e a l l y want to take more than any other class I've had the chance to take.

So, the choices I've worked out for right now are I can:  
A) Take art class next year with the chance of failing it  
B) Replace my history class this year with art and take a l l my history classes next year  
C) Replace my family studies and take it next year with a group of people I don't know, and not be able to take the class I really want to. My least favorite choice, but maybe a fitting punishment for fucking up freshman year.

So I’m scheduled to live into an apartment near my university for fall classes his Friday. For reference and go to school in a big city and live about 45 minutes away.

My friend/roommate is now saying she doesn’t want to live down to school for the semester bc of Covid ( I completely understand) she lives a couple hour drive away so she doesn’t have as easy access to her family and her parents are hesitant to have her go. She told me today that she wants to not move in this semester and to try to find a lease for the spring if things are back to normal. We were supposed to sign the lease this week so legally we can still get out of it. 

I don’t really know what to do bc I have a hard time concentrating from my house and my parents what me to get out and live on my own, even if that’s just in a small apartment by my self or with one other person. I don’t party or see other people out side of my family and I’m not interested in not social distancing if I were to move in to an apartment. While I understand that she is nervous about moving down right now I don’t think we should get rid of the appointment bc of next semester but she disagrees. I want to move for my mental health but she want to not get it got the same reason. While I think if we do keep it she should pay for partial rent (not all of what she would owe) to help me out. I have almost everything needed to move in already and now I have been cut dry.

It was us and 3 other people that i dont feel quite comfortable with and dont interact with on a daily basis. I am quite shy in nature, dont have many common intrests and dont like to share my personal life, so me placed in this setting where I dont feel in place I went quite and didnt interact much or added much to the converstation. 

After we left my best friend asked me if I was ok. I said I was fine i just dont fit in to that group of people. She seemed to not understand the concept of not being able to fit it (she is quite sociable and malleable) and said that when she asked me how my day was i just said” it was fine just played videogames” while everyone else basically told every detail of their past week and telling stories of how theyre brother fell tripped a month ago and was the funniest shit theyve ever seen. I kept trying to explain i dont fit in i don’t feel comfortable with them I cant tell stories of my life however insignificant cause I dont feel comfortable. She answered by saying “well i think ur a bit autistic”. 

I want to say this because I dont want people to misunderstand there is nothing wrong in being autistic.

Im not going to lie Ive been called autistic all my life but by bullies not by my best fucking friend. Someome so close to me saying something that felt so almost intentionally hurtful has really messed with me.

Recently, things have become somewhat strained between myself and my significant other but I know that a majority of the blame can be placed on me. At times, things have become petty but in order to truly understand the situation, I need to go way back to my childhood. 

When I was a lot younger than I am now (I am currently 18), I had a lot of issues with my father. He was a mentally abusive person. For example, he would take credit for/undermine my achievements, talk down on me (try to make me feel dumb), and play victim when he was called out on something. He's an arrogant and manipulative asshole. Eventually, my parents were divorced and about 3 years ago, I stopped living with him (my parents shared custody but in time I was able to stay with only one parent). During the first year, I only saw him during one weekend which had reminded me I made the right choice. During the second year, I had decided to work for him in order to make some money to go on dates with my ex-girlfriend. I felt like I was somewhat repairing my relationship with my dad but after some time, it became too overwhelming on my mental health and I quit. Another year passed, and my ex-girlfriend and I had a nasty break-up that I used to think was her being crazy but now I realize I definitely share a large portion of the blame. Fast forward to now, I am currently in a relationship with someone I love dearly and have been with for about 7 months. Due to the global pandemic, I lost my job (I had gotten a new one after I quit working for my dad). I decided around the beginning of July to work for my dad again. Although it has been normal for the most part, I am worried his sheer presence has been mentally draining on me. In the past, I felt like I had successfully moved on from him but my previous relationship, and the one I'm in now have showed me otherwise. I've noticed how petty I can be: my ex and my current girlfriend both felt/feel like I can sometimes come off as arrogant, shoot down their aspirations, and just flat out be condescending. They have also said that I have trouble admitting fault and victimize myself. These things are extremely reminiscent of my experiences with my dad. Obviously, it'd be immature to place the sole blame on him; I'm old enough to make my own decision and I have to take responsibility for them. I don't want to follow in his footsteps. I feel like I've made major strides in improving myself (ex. I feel like when I do mess up, I have become better at admitting my mistakes, listening to what the other person has to say, and giving both myself and the other person space &amp; time to think instead of rushing into something). But there is still so much more to do. I've tried to do these things on my own with a little help from my friends and family but I wonder if it's taking me too long. What should I do to change myself and avoid losing my girlfriend or anyone else I love due to my poor behavior? Sometimes it feels as simple as just needing to remind myself to act a certain way but I oftentimes forget. 

Notes/random thoughts:
I have never been to a therapist in my life.
Should I quit working for my dad again? The shift in my behavior has coincided with me working again but I still feel like I should know better. I also know the fact I haven't seen my girlfriend in a long time due to the pandemic has been very stressful on me.
I have no desire to have a relationship with my dad. Yes I know this seems unhealthy but he has shown he cannot change.
I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness. 

I am open to any suggestions.

70,"My boyfriend (19M) lives in Reno, and I (19F) go to college there, but originally am from Vegas. Due to COVID, I’ve had to spend my entire summer back home and I haven’t seen my boyfriend in 2 months. 

So, the weekend I move back up there also happens to be our anniversary weekend. I’ll be moving into my apartment on Friday, and our 1 year is on Saturday. My mom really wanted to go to Lake Tahoe, and I talked it over with my boyfriend, and it sounded like a pretty good idea. This was going to be my mom’s second time meeting him, and my dad’s first. Also, our families were going to finally meet. My mom also wanted to take pictures for our Christmas card. We didn’t really have any original concrete plans except for maybe a nice dinner. 

However, my boyfriend has been to Tahoe once or twice this summer. He said it’s been extremely crowded (more than usual) and that it’s impossible to find parking. He and his family are really concerned about health, rightfully so, but his family has officially said he’s not allowed to go to Tahoe. I tried coming up with another plan, which was to go to Donner Lake, a much smaller lake nearby. I figured we could avoid crowds there, and I did a lot of research about what’s open and where to go. However, he says that whiles he’s allowed to go there, he doesn’t want to because his mom’s friend said that the bathrooms were closed and people were pooping in the lake (my findings determined that the bathrooms were still open). He also says the water will be way colder and it will be just as crowded. 

My boyfriend said he honestly just wants to chill with me that day, and honestly that’s what I want too, but I’m afraid that can’t happen. I don’t know how to put this, but my mom kinda has been driving me insane all summer. She kind of expects things to always go her way. My boyfriend and I both also get the suspicion that she doesn’t like him, even though there’s no reason for her not to. 

I know it’s my boyfriend and I’s day, but it’s also the last day I’ll see my parents until Thanksgiving. My mom has always had a sense of power over me, and I often feel helpless and that I have no say about things around her. I have hard time standing up for myself. 

I’d hate to be a buzzkill to either party. I’m such a people pleaser and I just wanna make everyone happy. 

Please help. Any advice is appreciated. Also, any COVID-friendly ideas of how we could spend the day.",12Aug2020,1

He seemed to be a little more physical this date in ways such as wanting to cuddle, trying to make out alot even when I tried to express thats not my current intent, and over all really like being in my personal space. I didn't mind that much because I can be the same way but with people that I am a lot more comfortable with. Later that day however I found out that 2 of his previous exs and him used to make sex tapes. For one partner the videos were private, while the other partner was ok with the videos being posted online. There was also a file on his phone that he refused to open because it apparently has multiple nudes of himself on it. This was strange and made me uncomfortable. When I expressed that these things made me uncomfortable he became super apologetic and said that if we were together he would take down and delete every video he has. He also apologized about being so much in my personal space and that he never intended on making me feel uncomfortable. He expressed how much he likes me and dosent want to screw stuff up.

Theres a few things that have been bothering me to feel this way. My mother and I have been living with my grandmother for about 5 years now because my mom couldn’t pay the mortgage on our house. Im in college/university, out of state, coming up on my 4th year. I currently should be on campus at school but due to COVID im stuck here for the semester. Im grateful for having a roof over my head but its not the most comfortable living situation and since its “grandmas” house theres always so many people in and out or a lot of people in the house at a time. One of my cousins also live here and we use to be pretty close until he started to date my bestfriend then me and my bestfriend stopped being friends because I just felt uncomfortable with her knowing all my family business and her being in my house all the time. And now its not only her but also her younger brothers come over to the house and stay. Its a very uncomfortable feeling. We ended up becoming 2 different kinds of people anyway. But because of that I feel like I dont belong. Most of my friends are now my college friends so they’re from different states. And due to covid i cant see them, and I feel so alone and bored and its causing me to feel depressed and anxious. It also feels like a lot of people in my family don’t necessarily like me (my cousin) and my ex-bestfriends family.

81,"Hello,

I'm a 21 year old transwoman, if that's relevant. I live in Minneapolis, I moved here from a city halfway across the US to escape an abusive relationship. My ex had me strung out on Xanax before I switched to gray-area legal RC benzos in an attempt to taper off safely. Also, I tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday, I believe, for the second time. I had it back in April. It's been killer this time.

I could go through the plethora of mental issues and things I'm dealing with, PTSD, anxiety, an overwhelming apathy towards life, waking up to my friend and roommate being dragged out by paramedics for attempting suicide two days ago, but I'm seeking practical advice. This may not be well-structured as I'm not thinking too clearly right now, apologies.

In terms of finance:

I work for a small, entirely remote startup as their Linux Sysadmin / DevOps girl. Contracted, part-time; I make $1,000 a month at $20/hr for 50 hours a month. I work far more than that. My savings have drained down to maybe $2,500 in the bank and $300 in BTC. My cost of living is around $1,300-$1,400 a month. My other assets include an 05 Civic in perfect mechanical condition (I've poured seven fucking grand into the thing) with some nice QOL upgrades like an Android head unit. It could sell for maybe $4,000. I don't want to get to the point of needing to sell my car. I have an expensive DOTA special edition gaming laptop with two graphics cards I could get rid of, a 40"" TV, I think those are about all of my assets and valuables that I could quickly liquidate in a short time-frame.

The minuses are that my cost of living &gt; my income, not to mention, I'm a contractor, not an employee. I intend on getting a second (main) job in IT, so I paid nearly $700 for CompTIA Network+ and Security+ exam vouchers that I intend to earn within the next two months. The plan is to get a job on top of my current one, using my current/ongoing experience and the certifications that I'll be acquiring, but I'm still not even sure exactly what to shoot for -- my skillset is a bit odd. I don't code at all; I mess with Linux servers and containerize everything possible with Docker at my current job, that's about it. It's hardly DevOps and it's hardly Sysadmin beyond the job title. I am a quick learner, however, I learned Docker in maybe two weeks tops for my current position. I'm supposed to start working again tomorrow, after taking a week off for COVID. I'd usually be looking forward to it but I don't feel up to work at all.

In terms of addictions:

I'm not new to RC (research chemical benzodiazepines). They're gray-area legal because they're so new the DEA hasn't had time to regulate them yet, so they're available for purchase freely online; the downside of that is that no legislation = no regulation, so sometimes you get bunk. I had been using diclazepam, an analogue of Valium and the ideal benzo to taper off of addictions with, since January 2020, to taper down. Right before I relocated to escape my ex, I ordered five bottles from my usual. reliable source. They were all bunk. I panicked, because I had run out of my last batch. I couldn't find another diclazepam vendor so I ordered anything I could to stave off withdrawals and gran mal seizures. I priority shipped a *lot* of clonazolam and etizolam, using bourbon to stave off seizures until they arrived, and that's what I've been using since. I have stopped keeping track of my usage since I switched from diclazpeam to these RC benzos.

I feel like everything is a catch-22. I need to get off of benzos, I need to study for these exams, I need to perform my current job duties, I need to get a second job, and I feel like it's all a ticking time-bomb due to my finances.

I'm scared shitless of not having money. I was kicked out at 18 with nothing but $60 in my pocket and I refuse to ever fall that low again.

83,"I’ve lived in a four-person student apartment for the last year and am getting two new roommates this week. This apartment comes furnished with a couch (fits 3-4), a chair, and 4 dining chairs and tables, etc..

When I moved in last year the whole place was already decorated so me and my roommates didn’t have much choice in what it looked like. Some of these decorations included one of those huge bean bag chairs that took up all of the window space in the living room. This made the apartment look super small and dark (we have a view of an alleyway and it partially blocked the little bit of sun we do get.)

I didn’t want to be like that roommate so I’ve been in contact with the new roommates to see what kinds of stuff they have/want to buy. One of them has this loveseat type couch that she wants to put under the window (there’s really no where else for it to go.) My other roommate that renewed with me and I don’t really want it there because we know it’ll make the living room look really small and I currently have a cat tree and one of those fancy covered litter boxes that look like end tables over there. (Important note: I made sure all of my roommates for the upcoming year were okay with me getting a cat and the furniture I have.)

So I’m struggling pretty bad right now with a depressive episode (I don’t have diagnosable depression, but I have had an episode before a few years ago). I do have anxiety and OCD, however. 

Anyways, I messed up TWICE in a row at my job due to this- my depression is making me sleep at incredibly inopportune times and yesterday I woke up 20 minutes after my shift started. I got a text from my boss saying that it was technically a no call/no show because they had to call me first, and that I can’t do it again. I was upset but figured it was a one-time thing. Cut to this afternoon when I fell asleep completely randomly and woke up late AGAIN. I was mortified. I came in late feeling so embarrassed and terrible. My boss is on vacation right now, and I’m so worried he’s going to hear about it and fire me. I can’t afford to be unemployed right now.

It’s just such an embarrassing mistake to make TWICE IN A ROW. And my boss is a really crabby older guy who I don’t really have a great relationship with (I think I’m a good employee but we just don’t get along). And I don’t feel like he’s going to give me a chance to explain myself at all.

I decided on a room rental because everything is included and I am about to sign the lease on one today. I was looking for something clean with a large room and parking.

93,"In short my dad died, life’s sad and I’m very torn on whether or not to go to university. Theres a lot of reasons coming into play as to why so hopefully this doesn’t end up being too wordy. 

So I had a full ride scholarship to a university about 2 hours away from where I lived with my parents. 2 weeks into the start of last school year (I was an incoming freshman) my dad died very unexpectedly. I withdrew from my classes and took the year off aside from some community college courses I took in the spring. 

Before covid happened I decided to come back to the university in the fall of this year and started the process of getting my scholarship back. It worked out, I got my scholarship back and am currently living up here “ready” for school to start. Everything will be online for one month and then mostly in person after that but I’m not counting on that because no colleges seem to have anything totally figured out. 

A couple weeks ago, my friend mentioned her mom is willing to buy a condo for her and two other people to rent. It would be extremely cheap, I’d be living with my friends and I’d be a lot closer to all my other friends....but if I’d did this I would not continue going to this university and I’d be giving up a full ride with no chance of getting it back. 

So, this is my dilemma....

I feel like going to live with my friends is the better decision for me right now, In the short term. I feel like I’m gonna be unhappy up here and because of covid I feel like it’s gonna be hard to make new connections. After my dad died I had a really hard time for a while and I have heavily relied on my friends to support me through that time. If I lived with my friends, worked full time and eventually took some community college courses I truly feel like I’d be happier. But long term I’m giving up a free four year degree. I’d also have debt if I decided to get a four year degree and I could be closing a lot of doors for my self in the future if I just got an associates degree. 

But  spending the next four years here feels daunting right now. If it wasn’t for what I was giving up I know what I’d chose, I’d do what is gonna make me happy. But it’s really difficult because of what I’m giving up. At the same time tho  it doesn’t really matter what I have at the end of the four years if I wasn’t happy in the process. 

I’m sure I’ll still end up doing something I’m happy with it’s just matter of how I get there. 


Another thing that makes it difficult is that this was what I’ve always wanted to do. I’ve always planned on going to a university and I had my heart set on this one since sophomore year. On one hand I feel like I’m giving up on a dream I’ve always had just because I feel sad. But on the other hand I feel like it’s reasonable that my goals and my path to get there is gonna change, given that my dad died. 

For now I’m going to start my classes and see how I feel, there’s always a chance I’ll love it and decide I wanna stay but i feel like I need some outside opinions.


TLDR: I have a full ride scholarship but my dad died and the last year was pretty hard. I’m suppose to be going back but am considering living with my friends instead and just giving up my scholarship because I feel like I’d be happier that way. Good short term decision, questionable long term decision.",12Aug2020,1

95,"I'm not sure what I want to gain from this post. My life is at a crossroads of sorts. At 27 years old, life is the direct product of a past which is often difficult to look back on. My inner struggle is that of low self esteem, anxiety, depression, and a misunderstanding of how I am viewed by others in relation to how I see myself through my own eyes.

Honestly, stagnation like feet entrenched in water, moving in slow motion is how I exist. How has it come to be that I am at a dead end job, have never had a girlfriend, have never had sex sober, and feel so estranged from what it is to be a man? DO you ever feel like a character in someone else's movie? Life circumstances have me feeling like there is an invisible force that's translucent yet ever present, barricading my human form from various experiences and states of being that everyone around me seems to so naturally achieve. Sometimes, I get the sense that I am almost inhuman or cursed to a life outside looking in. Maybe it's better to explain it like a ghost looking on just outside the reaches of the human dimension. Even better, like an alien observing a populace for the first time in which their norms and experiences are not yours yet they feel so native and yet out of reach.The only way for anyone to get a better picture is for me to summarize my major life experiences. Maybe someone will relate to this or offer some incite. 

When I was five, my sister, brother, and I came down with the E-coli virus. I was five, my brother was eight, and my sister was three. My sister was rushed to a major clinic and was in a life and death situation for nine months. I was later rushed to the same clinic and was able to fight it off in a week because I was older. I then went home and was raised by my grandmother for nine months. When my sister finally made a recovery, sadly my mother had not. She was a shell of herself suffering from ptsd. My sister went down to thirteen pounds and her respiratory system and kidneys had failed. The doctors proclaimed it as a miracle. Basically, the whole situation took a huge toll on my mother. As a result, my grandmother moved in with us because my mom could not function. Meanwhile, my dad was busy running a business and coming home to a wife with problems he didn't get and could not fix. He also has anger problems so there was yelling and lots of crying.

Fast forward a year and I'm in first grade suffering from anxiety especially separation anxiety from my mom. However, I end up having a pretty normal childhood with the exception of a few bad periods. 

***Middle School***

I was much bigger than everyone else and started shaving in sixth grade. Also, I was very athletic in basketball, football, track, soccer, and others. In seventh grade it was apparent that I was the best athlete in the grade and I even had a full thick beard believe it or not. All the while, I was suffering from anxiety yet high functioning. In eight grade I broke the long jump record with 18.6 feet at 14. Also, I ran for 28 tds in football in seven games and over 2,000 yards. However, I was pretty shy around girls especially but was popular and social. I remember getting a lot of attention from girls but I found it hard to pursue them.

***High School***

I was switched to quarterback freshman year and I was informed that I would be brought up to varsity the next year to start at qb and also in basketball to start at forward. I was told this at a time when my anxiety was getting bad and I essentially had a mental breakdown during the football season. I lost 30 plus pounds and suffered from constant panic attacks. I somehow finished the season and the school year but I was done with sports and this caused tons of problems with my parents and family who wanted me to play. every day friends, teachers, girls, and other people would ask me why I was quitting sports? I come from a small town in which football is everything lol. I started smoking weed and gained a decent amount of weight. All throught high school, I never got attention from girls and I had such low self esteem that I almost never tried to form a relationship.

***College***

I went to a small state school 2 hours away and roomed with 3 good friends from high school. We were very social and drank a lot. However, only had sex three times in 5 years with two girls I had zero attraction to. I was hammered for every attempt. Fast forward to 2017, I graduated with a shit degree and moved back to my hometown and started working for the family business. This is when I started to actually try to date. I went on a decent amount of dates that never went anywhere and have been ghosted and stood up too many times to count. It has been an absolute nightmare. To make it worse, people are constantly telling me, you are handsome, funny, smart, and nice, how come you never have a girl? I never have an answer for them. I have put in considerable effort and have lowered my standards so low that people close to me can't believe I would even talk to some of these women even though they reject me every time. All the while, family members and friends keep suggesting I go after women who are really beautiful. I look at them like they are crazy because they don't get that literally all women reject me except a few who were literally morbidly obese and extremely clingy. One girl who contacted me was actually mentally slow. I'm not trying to be mean I'm just being honest. 

It's come to the point where family is begging me to try [match.com](https://match.com) or e-harmony lol. All dating apps have failed and I even have showed friends, family, my sister, female friends, and cousins conversations I have had with women and they always say, I see nothing that you are doing wrong. All of this has made my depression and anxiety worse. I am to the point where I want to quit because when 99 percent are rejections and the few that aren't end up being the dreaded, you're nice but I don't feel that way about you. My grandma literally thinks this is all a plan from god to make me a priest haha. I have posted pictures of myself on reddit and people 95 percent of responders tell me I am good looking and that it must be my personality. This makes me even more confised because if I was very obviously ugly, I could accept this failure more easily. At this point I'm just rambling. Sorry for the long post. Does anyone relate to this?",12Aug2020,1

97,"For some context: 
before quarantine, I my best friend (16 M) and I (15 M) had an amazing friendship and I was also very good friends with his girlfriend (16 F). Then, when quarantine happened, we all seemed fine until about mid-May. A while back, I posted about my best friend (16 M) when he and I went through a rough patch. It resolved after a while but it left some emotional scars that took a while to heal. He basically stopped wanting to call me as often and he stopped telling me ""I love you"" as a friend which.

Now, about their relationship
Their relationship hasn't always been the best. But it took me a while to find out just how bad it is. 

My best friend's girlfriend, who I'll call Katherine (fake name) for clarity purposes, has these frequent episodes of self-doubt and insecurity. They'll appear about every two weeks or so. She essentially collapses in self-pity, proclaiming that she is ugly or overweight and dumps it on my best friend, who I'll call Mark (also fake name). And, like any good person should, he'd try and calm her down and support her. However, she'd get mad at him for support. She has literally said ""cut the crap, I don't care what you say even if it's supportive, your wrong. I'm NOT beautiful. Stop saying the same stuff over and over again"". And she'd get very angry at him and he'd feel terrible for not being able to support her. It's gotten to the point where he can't even disagree with her or she'll get mad. I understand that lashing out on him is a defense mechanism, but it happens far to often and it damages Mark absolutely horribly. 

A little more context: all of us met through our high school band. So once, Katherine gave Mark an ultimatum. It's either band or her. And that crushed Mark, he really enjoys band and it is absolutely unfair of her to make him chose. They got past that, but still, I don't think it was justified at all.

They've had many more petty incidents, she once got mad at him for not commenting on a picture. She takes her anger out him all the time. It's just completely toxic. 

And, in there most recent episode, I was there trying to help Mark through it, and he said the words ""if I was acting like this, we'd have broken up by now"" and that's just proof of the imbalance in their relationship. How he allows her to get away with treating him so terribly.

Then recently, much later I found out things about him through a mutual friend of ours (18 F) who I'll call Allison. I found out that their relationship has affected their friendships. Roughly two months ago, Katherine told Allison that she doesn't like Mark hanging out with me. Which pisses me off because I was really really good friends with her a couple of months ago and all of the sudden she just dislikes me. That, too coincidentally, lines up with at the same time as when he and I had problems. I also found out that Katherine gets jealous when Mark says ""love you"" to me as a friend, which was something I liked and think is normal for close friends. He denies that it's the reason he stopped, although I disbelieve him. I found out that Mark compared Allison's weight to Katherine's to make her feel better. That changed Mark's relationship with Allison, even after they made up. I brought this incident up to Mark as well as most of the things I learned from Allison. He felt awful and he wanted to change things for me cause he feels bad for the way he's been treating me. 

But... I realize that he just has a bad influence. Katherine is possessive and manipulative and terrible. Allison tried bringing this up to Mark recently, he denied that she was toxic and manipulative. He said ""I know it seems that she's manipulating me, but it's not cause whenever she gets mad, it's for a reason. She's really trying to get better"" but that doesn't justify her behavior. He is so used to accepting her emotional abuse and rationalizing his position that he can't see how bad this is. He is completely in denial and I don't know if I can get through to him. 

But I haven't talked to him yet, I'm waiting until their next episode until I can sit Mark down and tell him just how bad this is. I don't know if it'll work though... It must be so easy for him to just say that I'm trying to spite Katherine for all of the sudden not liking me, and that I'm just trying to keep him all for myself or something like that. 

But, I don't want to do that. I really am genuinely concerned that my best friend is being manipulated and mistreated and that he doesn't see it. 

So, when I do tell him, any advice for what I should say or strategies to see if I can help him?",12Aug2020,1

I currently live with my Mum and sister. Our Dad left a few months ago during quarantine and now my parents are going through a pretty tough/financially demanding divorce.



My sister [19F] has uni accommodation and is moving out in September. She sometimes goes to her apartment for a few nights. Im living at home as I expected to leave uni for a job, but I won’t be taking the job until April next year now. 



I previously agreed to live at home because of the job, but now that’s not happening I see no reason to stay. I want to move out.



However, I’ll be leaving my Mum with my pet (who she bought me as a surprise and I didn’t want) who she isn’t great at looking after and alone. She has a few mental issues (not too demanding but doesn’t cope too well on her own) and is pretty needy. She’s not really great at looking after herself.

I am a college student who due to quarantine has been at home for the past couple of months. Over quarantine I decided to download tinder. Back at the start of quarantine,  I matched with a girl and ever since we have been talking. Yesterday I decided to hang out with her and wow was it amazing. She is honestly one of the coolest girls that I have ever met and we share a ton of the same interests. On top of that, she is extremely attractive. The only issue is that I leave for college again in a couple weeks. Despite only seeing her in person once, I got a different feeling from her, one that I have never experienced with any other girl. I think she felt it too as we hung out for hours on end and there was honestly never a dull moment. I don’t know if this is due to my lack of interaction with other girls my age over quarantine or if I found someone really special. I do believe in soulmates and I know it seems quite silly to even suggest something such as this but I can’t help but feel sad as we go to college in completely separate parts of the country and it kills me to think that I possibly will never see her again.

104,"This is kind of confusing me right now, so I’ll try to explain the best way I can.

So, I took this acne medication called “accutane” over a year ago. I stopped taking it a about 8 months ago as I was noticing hair loss and I had really dry skin which was absolutely destroying my confidence. I couldn’t go into school and I ended up leaving because it was that bad. Ever since then my hair loss has gotten worse and worse. I started taking Rogaine just over a month ago and I’m noticing a bit of regrowth. But my self esteem has not improved. Not one bit.

I realised how bad my confidence was, so in an attempt to maybe fix it I got a buzz cut. As a sort of “no more hiding” kind of thing. So I can start being myself. It’s kind of worked, but I still find myself comparing my hairline to other people’s hairline, and I still have that gut feeling occasionally that I’m worth less for some reason or that no girl will ever find me attractive because my hairline is shit or my hair is thinning at 18 years old, and I’m going to college soon so that’s a real cause for anxiety right now.

When I first started taking rogaine, I felt as though I was doing something I shouldn’t be doing. At the time, I didn’t quite realise what that feeling was. I maybe thought it was because I was trying to reverse the natural course of things? Maybe I’m meant to lose my hair? But now looking back, I might’ve figured out what it was.

I watched this YouTube video, as a way to help my confidence and to stop comparing myself to others. The guy said that “worth” doesn’t exist. Worth is, literally, a concept made and invented by humans, in order to fuel their selfish desires. Literally, no human is more valuable than another human for vain reasons such as their hairline or how much they weigh or whatever. I hadn’t ever thought of things that way. It made me think whether or not me taking this Rogaine which is marketed and designed to make money off insecure people losing their hair is maybe me doing the opposite of what I should be doing. I should be rejecting that idea. Instead I’m literally funding it, I’m putting fuel in the fire, I’m making it worse. I’m supporting this idea of vanity and I’m endorsing it. 

Now I don’t know what to do. Because I want to have my hair, because I want to seem attractive. But at the same time, I also want to reject that system because I think if I did I’d be a much more free person and I’d enjoy life more and I’d therefor be much more confident.

I’ve got about a bottle and a half of Rogaine left. Should I toss it? Or should I keep going and use the rest of it and then never use it again? Please help.",12Aug2020,1

I'm 19, I live in France. I've always had good grades at school. I live with my single mother and two sisters. I have friends. But the thing is I just don't see the point in living. I don't want to live a life that's been lived and is being lived by millions of people.
Like do 5 years of study, get a job, build a family... It seems so depressing to me that my life is already drawn.
I want to live something else but I have yet to find what I want to do. I play video games all day to make time go faster but I feel like I'm wasting my time.
The only reason I haven't killed myself is because my mom doesn't deserve this.
I really want to find a purpose in life but when I look at the world around us, how things are getting out of hand, people hating on each other, I don't even know if it's worth it to put a lot of time and effort into something that could get destroyed or taken away from you at any time...

Anyways last week I spent the night with her. We talked a lot cuddled and did the deed. It was all really genuinely nice and we felt so natural together. We click on almost every level when it comes to beliefs, religion, personality, humor etc. We are just on the same level as everything. Well, then the other day (a couple days after we hooked up and had unprotected sex the first time) she sent me a lengthy text apologizing and saying she has herpes and hope it won't effect our relationship. Well, it threw me off. I wish she had said something beforehand though. But that's not the advice I'm looking for. I guess what I'm looking for is can you actually have a good sexual relationship with someone who has herpes, without getting it yourself? I need help.

I've been told all my life that I'm going to be a doctor, and that I don't have any other option, but, I've always been fascinated by computers and I wanted to major in CS, and I feel like if I don't I'm going to regret it for the rest of my life. I feel like there are so many benefits to becoming a doctor because, I'm guaranteed to get a job, and it pays so much more.

110,"So I got back with my on and off boyfriend of three years a few months ago. The beginning was great and then he lapsed into a bit of a hard time and had a problem with drugs which he is now coming through a strong recovery. I have been by his side the whole time, I Understand that addiction is a mental illness so I made allowances for the times that he was quite shitty to me. 
Fast forward a few months, im still paying for mostly everything , I’ve mentioned it to him a good few times and he says he knows and feels bad. 
It’s like one extreme to the next with him. He’s mostly all over me wants me there and texting all the time and then some days it’s like he’s a different person , he’ll be highly irritable and giving out to me for nearly everything. 
If I’m upset he goes on about how it annoys him and he doesn’t want to deal with it. 
I think that’s quite unfair after all the stuff I just swept under the carpet when he was at a low. 
I do feel we do everything on his terms. 
Today I asked him if he wanted to meet for tea and his message was “I only do things if you want to do it cos I’m not really pushed” and then when I asked him what he meant by that he asked me to not look into things. 
I feel the way he’s gone on has made me really anxious. He’s told me I’m the person he wants to marry, has brought me to meet the family etc but he’s so hot and cold. 
Every time I try to express how he hurts my feelings he takes it as an insult and starts to go on how he doesn’t want to argue. 
It’s starting to feel like a one-sided relationship, I  feel it’s my fault as I constantly apologised and made him not feel bad about some of the stuff he did and said to me during his low point. Perhaps he just doesn’t give a shit about my feelings because he knows how much shot he can put me through and I won’t leave. I do love him but I need this to change because it’s made me so self conscious. 
Part of me thinks when he gets in one of these moods I should just ignore him and not be at his every beckoned call so he realises he needs to step up a bit and work for attention.

My mom is available to provide free childcare and really wants to help. Boyfriend suggested we build a guesthouse behind his house a few months ago. I went and bought the blueprints which weren't cheap. Boyfriend has since stopped doing anything to prepare for baby. We haven't worked on the two rooms which need redoing in a month. He's been immersed in several new project for his hobby which he says he wants to get done before baby arrives so I'm not mad at him for working on them when we have a newborn. There's no time to be working on this stuff. He says my nagging makes things worse and makes him not want to work on anything. My dad has offered to come over and help on house projects and pricing materials for guest house. Boyfriend gets irritated now when I ask if they can come help because he says my dad isn't detail oriented enough and doesn't like his craftsmanship (my dad left a few paint drips on the room he painted , and didn't cut a tile to boyfriend's liking). We have so much left to do inside boyfriend's house. And haven't even started on guest house which needs to be done soon because you can't pour concrete when it gets too cold. I told my boyfriend if we can't get the guest house done in time, then I want us to move into my house which is 10 min from my parents. He refused. He said he's not put all this time and effort into his house to leave it. I'm not asking him to sell his house. I'm simply wanting him to stay at my house with me and baby during the week or most of the week. My mom was willing to watch baby 5 days a week at boyfriend's house (they live an hour away).

He said I can quit my job, but I just got a raise and I like my job and I don't want to quit...he wouldn't let me stay at home forever. So I don't want to quit for a year and then have to job hunt later.  He's been doing his hobby every night almost or playing computer games. I don't know if I'm acting crazy because of my hormones, but he says there's enough time for stuff and I turn everything into doomsday. Even if I did do daycare, they have a wait list and I need to get on it soon and put down a deposit. I'm so irritated with him I could scream. I've stopped nagging him and am not saying a word about which projects need to be done. He says the reason we aren't working on stuff is because I'm always in bed. I'm in bed because I'm tired / depressed and he keeps the temperature so cold in the house. I told him id get up in a heartbeat if he said he wanted to work on projects with me. I told him I wouldn't say another word about it, since he says my nagging makes him not want to work. He hasn't worked on anything since. He's done two or three 1 hour projects on the house in a whole month. Anytime I bring up that we need to be working, he says I don't recognize the things he's done. I do his chores and laundry and stuff to give him more time to work on the house projects ...I can't help with alot of it anymore because I'm getting big and can't lift things .

122,"So this is going to be a different post I know some might find this confusing, some might understand. I’ve only had extremely abusive relationships my entire life from my parents to my partners. Since I was 8 years old I’ve heard how I needed to loose weight and how disgustingly fat I am from my friends, family and etc. Eventually it lead to me becoming anorexic although I’m still overweight and not under I’ve lost over 120 pounds from my ED. I’m currently actively suffering from and now my doctors have prescribed me a weight loss medication while being aware I don’t eat weeks at a time but that’s a story for another time. I’ve been single for over a year I’ve been doing counseling and some serious work on myself. At the end of the day the only persons happiness I’m worried about is my own. Sorry for the tangent back to the topic.


I took a year off from hook ups or any intimate contact with anyone. I’m suffering from PTSD from my abusive ex’s and it’s manifesting as self hatred. Specifically during sex. I just started back up in the dating game and I had hooked up with someone but right after it was initiated I couldn’t enjoy it anymore. The only thoughts that I could process during it were how disgusting I was and how fat I am and they’re just with me because they feel bad. It really fucks with me because I start pulling away from them because I become so scared I’m so gross I don’t want them to see my skin under my clothes. I don’t want them to pity me just to leave and block me. I know honestly the answer is counseling which I’ve been doing for over a year but I just wanna feel like I can at least sleep with someone.",12Aug2020,1
123,"A friend of mine lost his job, being accused of different things that he lost his status in a lot of communities, lost friends, co-workers and even family because of certain news that a ""friend"" of his keep on saying undercover.

So this ""friend"", a motherfucking narcissistic manipulative bitch who lied, cheated and stole pretty much her whole life up to now with us knowing about her past just after shit hits the fan. She accused my friend of being abusive and a ton shit of lies online and through word of mouth. The sad fact about this is well we can't get any evidence, as she will post stuff slandering my friend without mentioning his name then deletes it, sadly we can't get any screen shots of that. It has been happening prior to to the bad things that started to happened. She was able to manipulate a whole bunch of communities to ban my friend and up to the point of bullying with fake accounts with additional death threats and with a lot of harassment that is incognito.

My friend out of nowhere in the beginning of the year just got a call from his boss saying he was fired for reasons that his ""friend"" told his boss of all the ""bad things"" he has been doing. He lost his job and went in a deep depression literally barely going outside or talking to people, even to me, when this happened. He then started receiving death threats from unknown people, fake fb accounts, and was made fun and bullied online by various communities that was hard to pin point and verified due to the subject, him, not being mentioned by name but with we are sure that those posts that were always taken down is downright the effect of that bitches doing.

His siblings stopped talking to him because of the said  posts which was already gone by the time it happened. Same tactics were being done, post then delete, and even up to now that ""friend"" of his is still posting stuff that well in a court hearing will not suffice as evidence.

My friend is already trying to recover from his depression and now has another job thankfully. By the time of this posting, that bitch is now posting stuff acting all victim and all doing a reverse-smear campaign-ish thing and the sad thing is a lot of people are believing her to the point that some establishments and people in power are avoiding or declining him. A new batch of fake news started coming up again in local community groups, with the same technique being done , post, get a few comments, private message then delete.. 

We only got the true light about that bitch when a bunch of ex friends of that bitch suddenly messaged us, ex friends that were just mutual with that bitch and didn't knew each other, saying that my friend wasn't the only one who got this experience.

Some of that bitch's ex friend were not paid with debt then suddenly when the time that they were trying to get the money, that bitch freaked out and said they were rude and all out of nowhere and pretty much experienced what my friend is experiencing but as he/she said my friend's experiencing far worst. There was one of them that literally lost a brother due to suicide because of the manipulation of that bitch. The last words of that brother being, ""You said to kill myself, then I will.""  

The lists of all the bad things she've done is too long, involving a lot of people, powerful people in the communities, that has no idea of what really happened. Some of which got shut up due to black mail.

We tried to talk to these people but we were just ignored.

I'm worried for my friend and this bitch's activities have gone too far.

The part that started this all was when my friend told that bitch in a kind way to stop manipulating a certain man to give her money and to stop lying that she's single when in fact she has kids and a husband.

My friend kept quiet all this time, alone. That bitch's propaganda already included questionable people in power, not in the political way, but in terms of influence.

So basically one of my closest friends at the time added me to this group chat with people that i knew from middle school (its a kpop group chat for more context). At first it was ok and then they started ignoring me, cutting me off, arguing with me. The thing they'd do most was respond with lmao or haha and talk about something else. I told them about how it hurted me, adn they apologzied.

Now i dont really talk to everyine in the group chat, but im a group chat with 2 other people who were in the other one. One person in it has been doing the same exact thing that they did to me word for word, and honeslty tho i dont know how to approach this situation because ive already told her about it. Thereforr, I texted my friend about it, and she said it was her texting style and i should stop being so sensitive. I told her that i got that, but ive already stated that i dont like this so why is doing this and it still hurt.

132,"Regarding a friends wedding that has been 5 years in the making and a huge stressor in her life for years as it’ll be the event so far of her life

TLDR; I was complaining on snap about my body image (and yes me and my therapist talk a lot about internal fat phobia and how my worth effects other people) and accidentally sent “not to be rude about it but what if I didn’t go to this wedding because I don’t want to be the biggest person there not cuz of Covid” not to my Boyf but to my friends fiancé. I apologized to both of them immediately I’m worried I’ve done very long term damage. Thoughts on how to fix? 

Long story long - the couple are dear friends from college which was hugely traumatic experience that led to a very deep depression and many bad choices. They’re also best friends with my ex who I was in a toxic relationship with - I was the toxic one but I’ve grown up. I’ve known about this wedding for the 5 years I’ve graduated but I’ve only gotten more and more stressed over it and it consumes all my thoughts as I don’t want the guests to think I’m the same horrible person I once was. Obviously, I won’t prove that on a wedding night so my appearance feels like the one thing I can control. I was NOT trying to make light of their wedding as I’m excited to celebrate their love just a poorly phrase snap to my BF who is aware I’ve done some deep therapy over all this shit 

I had already kind of messed up this wedding and our friendship when I told them I wouldn’t be inside without a mask for close up makeup and the ceremony that would have more than like 5 folks inside and they removed me from the wedding party. I’m sure they were feeling hurt already i ruined their big day and this compounded the fact.

134,"Hey guys, how're you doing? (You can skip to the situation below the background if you'd like)

**Background**

So I'm a freelance graphic designer with enthusiasm for social media marketing, I also like to help. Which means in most areas of my life, I may put myself in some uncomfortable situations, so I can make someone else's life easier/happy. (Don't get me wrong I don't necessarily cut off my own hand but I do sometimes put myself out). Whether it's working more hours at work, sacrificing my schedule to help others and losing out on sleep, putting stuff off till another day, etc etc.

So, my friend asked me to do a logo for him, I usually charge $80 for a logo because I'm just starting out. I sketch up a bunch, show them, talk, and thin the herd while improving. I also include a color scheme, fonts they could use, I show them a mock-up of it in various situations with different styles. I then go on to give them material for social media.

I do the work, I make my own set of logos WHILE still digitizing his own logo he brought to the table for which I didn't charge, I just added it to the work. I do my stuff, I do his stuff and I present it. His members weren't fully behind the logo and some weren't behind the idea. He then came to me and asked if I could make more designs, I told him it would be an extra fee. He said he couldn't afford it and then made one of his own they're now using.

**The problem**

However, since it's COVID and they're not working and their family isn't working, their sole income is his scholarship money. (Whether this is true or not, I don't know, it's not my business whether he's lying or not). I take off $30. He now owes me $50. After learning they didn't pick the logo I made, I decided to help him out again and put the price down to $35. So I gave him my account number to which the funds should be made out to.

So a week passes by and now he's ready to pay me (this happened around 5 in the morning) he shows me a picture of the funds with a green tick showing he sent them. However, I never received them. I went up in the chat and I noticed I gave him the wrong account number, I mistyped one single number. Shit, my bad on that, he reacted in disbelief, stating he can't get back the money because of something he read, and he can't out another $50.

I told him I didn't expect him to pay another $50, and that I'll call the bank to see what can be done. So  I stayed up to call the bank as it opens I explain the problem, I then visited the bank directly to talk to customer service, as well as messaged their social media sites. I was told the sender would have to talk to the bank to solve it. I told him this, he said he can't do it at all this week due to classes and he can't afford to miss them, he needs to attend them all. I asked him to call the bank, he says he doesn't have any funds on his phone.

He hasn't made any effort to contact the bank on social media/email. I have done it solely alone, even my friends asked me why **I** was the one doing it and not **him**.

I realized the fault was at me for mistyping the number, but would it be wrong of me to feel like he should've or could've confirmed the information before sending? As this is the behavior I'm used to with my other clients/friends, they confirm every detail. Am I also wrong for feeling like he's making excuses? As the bank is 10 minutes away from him and our mutual friend even offered to give him a lift to the bank. He also could use their phone to call the bank. He hasn't responded to him with a date.

What can I do? He transferred the funds since last week. I'm honestly upset more so from the fact, he doesn't seem to care or offered zero help/assistance in contacting the bank.",12Aug2020,1

Anyway, I cant stop reminiscing, I cant stop thinking about how pretty she was to me, and how funny and sweet she could be. We became very close, had sex a couple of times and I thought we were going to be something more. Then, just like that, she was upset with me, and i get ghosted.

i’ve found meth pipes in her room while she’s there, she just leaves them around, she never thinks i see them because i pretend i don’t but i’m just afraid to bring it up. at first i thought maybe it was her boyfriend that was doing it because he keeps one under his pillow(yes i’ve seen it multiple times and and he’s really bad at hiding it) but the other day my mom asked me to bring her a spoon and when i asked what for she just told me to mind my business, i’m convinced she thinks i’m stupid, and that i don’t know what she’s gonna do with it. i didn’t want to do it because i feel like that makes me part of the problem, i had a friend over at the time and i was genuinely embarrassed that she would ask me to do something like that.

I(20m) have a little sister(15f) who recently told me that she was pregnant since she trusted me not to judge her.

I supported her when she got an abortion but apparently she didn’t take out her trash in her room and our parents found it. They told her that she had to carry the baby and my sister told them that she had a miscarriage but they knew she was lying. Ever since then I’d come home from work to find her hiding in her room crying. She told me that our parents have been calling her a child murderer and a bunch of other hurtful things.

I do my best to comfort her and confronted our parents about it. We got into an argument that almost ended in a fist fight. They told me that they won’t allow someone who supports murdering babies to live under their roof and I have to move out within a month. I’m worried that once I leave my sister will have nobody to go to for comfort when they treat her like this.

I’ve never made a move, but fantasize about it all the time, to the point where I can’t even focus on my own GF. We have a great relationship and I wouldn’t trade it for anything, but I honestly don’t think that I will be able to put this fantasy to rest until I do something about it and get it out of my system. 

I am a confident man, and never have problems with girls, the only reason I am so hesitant on this one is because one wrong move and it could ruin everything, and being her relative is a very volatile situation, not just some random girl you met outside which has no ties to her. The SIL flirts often, compliments and does subtle touches, always find her staring at me and making eye contact, smiling, and I can tell the attraction is there, but the footsie the other day was the most anything has heated up. So nothing crazy has happened yet. Can someone give me advice how to deal with this? I really want to be with her just one night to get it out of my system and move on.

153,"Hey all, 

I am in need of advice of whether or not to ask my teacher to change my grade? or if I'm being overly picky?

 So the assignment I'm referring to in this situation is out of 10 marks. On my rubric sheet, I recieved a 9-10 range. Considering its out of only 10 mark, I immediately assumed my assignment should be at least 90% out of 100%. 90% is considered an A+ at my school, however my teacher gave me an A. I usually wouldn't be bothered by this but it's my final year so everything counts, and people within the same range and very similar feedback all got an A+. 

I have already asked my teacher but she said that A and A+ are both in the very high range, but the thing is no matter what I get between 9-10 I should still technically get 90% minumum.

Should I continue to push for a grade change or just leave it as it is?

Thanks for any advice :)",12Aug2020,1

When I take the gloves off my fingers are usually pruny and uncomfortable for a bit. I’ve been wearing the gloves for about 3 weeks now, and about a week ago I’ve started to develop some issues. All of my finger nails are brittle and are peeling at the tips in layers, which has never happened before. The fingerprint area of my fingers are also peeling very badly, not every finger though but a few. The peeling is starting to cause pain and I’m worried this is going to continue to get worse.

159,"Hey. Here's the basic jist of what's ahead: I want to do something, but I need to learn something I'd rather not learn to do it. I'll go into a bit more depth below.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to become a game developer. Solo, for the most part. I have a whole host of ideas for me to do, but none that I would be able to do if I can't overcome the hurdle of learning to program. Don't worry, I'm not asking for programming advice. I've done that already. Unfortunately, nothing that I've been told helps me. 

So, here's my problem. I don't want to have anything to do with programming. It's nothing but a tedious, arduous slog of typing in mindless words until it works.

160,"Hello

26M Canadian. I have been a regular with a sex worker at a massage parlour over the the month of July and a few times so far in August. I had before not partaken in this before except a couple times in January. Last session a few days ago, she told me I was her best client, that I was generous, and that I put her needs before mine. Indeed, I always made sure to treat her with the the highest respect, ask before doing anything and make sure to ask if she's comfortable as all the acts ensued. I habitually tipped $40 for $300 full service and last times tipped $100, $90, and $75 respectively. Treating her well was extremely important to me. And, it was great to hear that from her. However, during the last session, After all was done, she was adjusting her hair. So, I commented: ""you look much better with your hair this way"". I honestly only meant to compliment her and my intention was really well meaning. However, a few days later, at home, it occurred to me that this statement may not be construed as a compliment since it includes a qualifier. I honestly feel bad I worded it this way. I should have said: ""this hairdo is good"" or something. I fear this statement, unperceived to me, may have been somewhat disrespectful as I uttered it when I only ever meant to compliment. I really really meant to praise her but the way I worded it may have removed from that effect. I cannot stop thinking about it and I feel bad I should not have worded it this way :( especially after she told me how she appreciated me as her best client. Do you think this may have been displeasing in any way? I have no way to tell if she was displeased by it. However, the meeting ended on very good terms as I remember. I also remember I followed up this statement with ""you're so beautiful"" so I don't know. I don't have her contact information so I cannot contact her and apologize. So, I would have to see her again to do so. However, I do not feel the need for another session. It was my 7th session for the period of July-august and a number of times, I felt compelled to go because I did not want to disappoint her if I didn't show up again. I wasn't planning on going again after the last session or perhaps I was planning on maybe going for another session some months from now when actual need arises (sexual urge etc). But, now my anxiety found another reason (this statement I told her) to go again and apologize but that also means paying for another session I don't need. Tbh, I don't even know if she would remember it or even that she minded it. If I wait until a potential next session, if it is to happen, say months from now, then I may stress over this in the meantime. Should I really go for another session to apologize? 

Thank you very much in advance. I overthink everything and thus I really apologize for this question",12Aug2020,1

""OP, why would you lie about having a girlfriend?"" Because my mother mistook a joke, and I thought she was joking too over the phone.

*""Hey, any partners yet?""*

*""Yup! Head over heels with a girl!""*

*""Oh my! Have you taken it to the next step?""*

*""Depends what you mean by next step.""*

And then we laughed and then continued on with something else. And then a few months later she asks about my girlfriend.

My whole other family except her knows that I lied, but they kept it a secret since my other siblings are very much single, and she was so happy when I told her. 

I live across the country (Not entirely, just like a day away.), and my mother came to surprise me for my birthday by driving herself all the way here. She texted me to look outside my porch, there she was. And she excitedly brought herself in to see my girlfriend.

162,"[English is not my first language, sorry for bad English] 

Hey bros,

So I(22F) met a guy(20M)  2 months ago while working for an organisation. He is one of the nicest man i have ever met in my life. From day one he respects me, treats me well , helps me in work. I also can't deny that he is such a hot guy. I fall for him. After few weeks i asked him out and we were in a relationship. We moved in together. He is such an husband material. He cooks, cleans and he takes a lot of care of me. (It doesn't mean that i can't do anything, he just doesn't let me do anything)  He never even wanted to touch me by himself, if i insisted then he makes a move. He always makes sure that im comfortable with everything. 

We are still togather. Few weeks after i moved in with this guy I realized that Im in deep love with him. So we had sex for the first time last night. He is an excellent kisser. Also he was also great in bed last night. But the problem occurred when he realized that i didn't came. Also he came a bit too early not gonna lie. But guess what i had a great time last night. He is so great with kisses, dirty talking and fingers. 

Right after he came for the Second time he started to say sorry to me, apologizing for not holding it for too long. I felt really bad that time.

 I started to say ""look it doesn't matter, I had a great time seriously!  Also it is super hot to me when i see my man can't hold it too long while having sex with me, its like a great win feeling "" 

He still said sorry to me. Then we kissed and slept. 

Please any advice on how i can make him understand that it doesn't matter for me?  Thanks.",12Aug2020,1

164,"I’m a 19 year old male and I’m currently working a minimum wage job in a bar but with the way it’s being run it’s likely I’ll be leaving soon and I’m hoping to finally be able to find something I like doing. I know it’ll take time and I’ll have a few side jobs on the way but I’m starting to get pretty determined to plan ahead since I’m already 19. 

Bit of context, I’m in the UK so it might get somewhat confusing. I went through high school passed everything apart from Spanish with pretty decent grades, went to college and passed both sociology and law but I don’t think this is even what I want to go into. I’m pretty hyper 99% of the time and I’ve got a LOT of energy so I don’t want a job of sitting behind a desk I need something that’ll keep me on my feet. 
A few career plans I’ve been thinking of lately:
-Criminal psychologist (Dream job) 
-Something in law enforcement - only issue is i have a phobia of blood. 
-Circus performer- Sounds stupid but honestly I love the circus, I’d love to perform and I think it’s something I’d always love doing (Obviously id need to do a lot in order to pursue this)
-Fire service- obviously the blood again would be an issue but I’d be more willing to get over it in this profession, I’m a pretty skinny dude but I’d be willing to bulk up since I want to get into shape anyway. 
-Something Army based, I need to get my head in check and honestly the army sounds perfect, but I couldn’t harm another person in my life so I wouldn’t be able to do front lines but something engineering or tech related I’d be into 


I’m a pretty smart person In general, I hold info pretty decent and even when I had a 52% attendance in college I still passed somehow. I however have no common sense whatsoever. I’d love to do something that would always keep me intrigued but wouldn’t become boring or just sat down. Another initial plan would be a lawyer but my morals would most likely get in the way, I couldn’t falsely lock someone up or let someone get away just for my job.

Something that I’ve also been doing is trying to get attention of other TikTokers with singing. There’s this TikToker I wanna talk to, so while I happened to be recording already, I recorded a song for her as well.

168,"Serious post here: I recently started a new gig working a deli. Simple work, just prep and a little service here and there. It's in a grocery store I won't name. A few of these people have real food experience, and I've around 6 years in the business. most of these guys would not survive in an actual restaurant. 

I've been having some trouble with disrespect from my coworkers. Sometimes I've had bad days and been a little short with people, but I try to be friendly and have a good shift. They're training me, but going particularly well. Basically I'm figuring out everything on the fly and they're not really telling me how to do stuff. until I package something incorrectly and get bitched at instead of being shown how to actually do it. 

There's not thing wrong with a little light ribbing - we all fuck with each other a little bit in biz and it's part of what makes it such fun. But management has been condescending, and rude, the store manager thought I was being rude because I asked him if he was certain you have to be excluded from and operation for 24 hours if you have been vomiting, because I wasn't certain if that was still the case. I got into the publishing business for a few years cause I was getting burnt out and forgot a lot. 

So, how do you guys deal with disrepectful management and coworkers? I'm normally a pretty easy going and supportive guy with my team, since I actually know what management is, and i know how to do it correctly, and it kind of seems list a lost art. but if you fuck with me I'm damn sure going to give it right back to you, yet I'm the asshole. Plus instead of talking me to clear the air, they're talking about me behind my back on shift and going to management to solve their problems because they can't handle conflict like adults. It's literally the most toxic environment I've ever worked in, save for when I was in telecom. I've always told my guys that I can be a bit reactionary and abrasive when we get into the weeds or if I'm stressed, but if we're having problems, lets step outside, have a smoke, talk about it. I've done that many times to great success. 

What do you guys think I should do? Right now I'm just keeping my head down and keeping my mouth shut and doing my job the best I can.",12Aug2020,1

Recently, I met my very elderly neighbor who told me she died of TB and asked if I knew where she was buried. I told him that I could not find that info anywhere. He smirked and said, that’s because she’s in your backyard under your deck. Needless to say every hair on my neck stood up.

My sister is on SSI and her husband is unable to work due to narcolepsy/cataplexy/ehlers danlos syndrom.  He passes out and/or falls over at random.  We've slowly worked on this house to make it our home and been painting and redecorating all the kids rooms.  A few months ago we did an ocean theme in my nieces room, she also has EDS (ehlers danlos syndrome) and has already had to give up on two of her dreams due to her physical condition.  My older nephew has high functioning autism and just started high school after working so hard for so many years to be able to understand and interact with people and make friends.  Two weeks ago we got my younger nephew some sticky tile flooring as it had just been cement prior.  He has EDS (ehlers danlos sydrome) as well as immune deficiency and isn't allowed outside save for doctors appointments.  We've been stuck in the house since March due to Covid 19 and done everything we could to keep the kids happy/healthy/busy.  Someone gave an old above ground pool and we fixed it up and the kids love it.  We had to tell them about the notice.  It went poorly, as expected.  Lots of anger and crying.  We live off of about $2000 a month and cannot afford to rent anywhere.  I am a full time student and recently recovered from agoraphobia (fear of the outside) and have one year left of school.

194,"I may regret this later (drinking). Obviously none of us are psychologists but I'm wondering if anybody has experience or might know a thing or two about what could be my problem. Wondering why I'm like this.

I've been obsessive since I was like 12, 13. My mom sent me to a therapist at that age and I had many as a teen but nothing was helpful cause I wasn't interested in telling the truth and I don't think my therapists saw me as a person. If I liked somebody, I'd get secretly obsessed with them, I'd hate people who tried to get with them, my childhood best friend and I had a dysfunctional on/off relationship and I started repeating this with other friends. I'd randomly say ""I don't want to be your friend anymore"" or start drama. I wasn't very nice, but I also wasn't happy at all.

I would get called a stalker sometimes because I have such a great memory. I remember almost everything, little moments, people's names from years ago, etc, and people would call me a stalker when I remembered things they forgot about. Stupid. But then I actually became a stalker. I sent ""prank letters"" to people's houses I was pissed at, I got their info from the student directory. My school stopped publishing it but I found an old copy online and most people still lived at those addresses. 

I had obsessive thoughts, still do, really is a miserable way to live sometimes. I can't forget most things no matter how hard I try. Hurtful things are etched into my brain. I would collect info on people, ""intel."" I liked knowing people's secrets. I got really good at online stalking, finding people, tracking people down. Frankly i could be a detective with how good I am at spying on people or finding out information. Most of it is available online and then you can piece together the puzzle. I've fucked with people by pretending to be somebody else, I've fucked with people by dropping hints IRL, although I wouldn't openly talk about this IRL.

 I got my first girlfriend when I was 17 and I was obsessed with her. When I like somebody, I overanalyze everything and it causes me misery and annoying bullshit to deal with. I'm like a stage 5 clinger except on the down low, I try my hardest not to make it obvious how obsessed I am with you. There are people out there who have no idea I exist, but I know all about them. Like my current girlfriend's ex. I know everything about her ex but he has no idea who I am and she doesn't realize I know his name and info. 

My current girlfriend is an angel tbh. She has her own issues and understands me a lot. She knows how obsessive I am. We've been together 2 years. I've sent her endless texts before when I was upset, I've gone to her house unannounced, she knows about all that shit and forgave me for it and understands it's how I am but the miserable part about being in love is I cannot get shit off my mind when I'm mad. It repeats on an endless loop in my head and I want to keep calling and calling but then I force myself to do something else so I don't look insane.

Why the fuck am I like this? Other people make me so fucking pissed off, like I don't care about or like almost anyone, yet I used to constantly online stalk people I hated, nowadays I try to focus on my girlfriend and family but I cannot shake my general obsessiveness.",12Aug2020,1

198,"hi. i am a 15 year old with depression. and yesterday, one old online friend of mine reached out  to my cousin and i decided to friend her.

so, after that we got to talking. i felt kinda bad bc we had some bad history before with another friend. so i already knew that i shouldnt have joined her.

now, fast forward to a day after which is today. so, she started talking bad about my friend to another one of my friends in game. so i was like this is another red flag.

then, i decided that i had to tell my friend because it would be bad if i kept that from her. so i told the girl that i had to and that we couldnt be friends anymore.

but i let her down in the nicest way possible. i said that she could contact me whenever she needed something, that it was never my intention to hurt her, and that i had to put myself first because she brought up some negative feelings from the past that made me feel badly about myself. she’d also always make me feel bad for something that happened in the past.

so she told me that i broke her and that she would cry herself to sleep.

me being a sensitive person was like i shouldnt unfriend her, im such a bad person-

so i unfriended her telling her that i had to put myself first and i put herself first more than i put myself first. 

she said that we should have never talked and that i broke her. i said hmu if you need something and unfriended her.

now i feel like crap. i dont know if shes gonna kill herself and im overthinking. should i have done this?

I was on the verge of quitting my toxic job in a niche market before the pandemic hit. Now I can’t afford the instability of no health insurance and my career opportunities are slim. I don’t even know if I want to continue in my career path. I apply to jobs when they pop up but they’re so few and far between and I’m getting no bites. I wake up every day panicked to sign into my computer and dread getting emails from my manager.

Moms prognosis seems promising and I’m so happy but I’ve been exerting all of my energy into spending time with her and keeping her preoccupied so she doesn’t think too much about her cancer. 

My fiancé and I had to postpone our wedding due to COVID. I love him so much and I’m so blessed to have him in my life. He’s been a godsend during this time but I’ve been so emotionally drained I haven’t been able to express my love and thanks. I can barely get myself out of bed in the morning and showered.

is there something i can do. i hate having these dreams. i don’t like killing or death and some people i told this to thought i was insane or wanted to kill people. i don’t want to hurt anyone but i keep getting these dreams.

208,"So, I’m a brand new medical student (started last week). Earlier today, some really cute girl sat next to me in one of our labs. The professor had us do an exercise with the person sitting beside us. This meant that I was partnered up with said cute girl.

Much to my surprise, (I think) I hit it off really well with this girl. We hung out for about two hours after lab. We had a fun time and I honestly thought that she was pretty relatable to talk to. She asked me to go with her to pick up her materials from the campus bookstore, she asked me for my phone number, and she even gave me a ride back to my apartment. We are also planning on studying together for our exam next week.

The thing is that I’m really, really bad with girls. I’ve never had a girlfriend in my entire life. Hell, I’ve never even been on a date. It was literally easier for me to get into medical school than it was for me to go on a date, as cringeworthy as that is to admit. Truth be told, I’m a rather awkward guy around girls.

It honestly still feels pretty surreal. I’m the kind of guy where a girl showing any interest in me is unheard of, let alone a girl I find really cute and relatable. Naturally, I really don’t want to fuck this up.

I was screaming, my parents needed to hold me down to get me to relax. I couldn't catch my breath on multiple occassions, until i breathed into a paper bag. I am humilated and embarrassed that i got like that, but retelling the story with her today we really couldn't see the either persons perspective. I tried to defend it and said that this had to be an accumulation of me not being heard/seen by you, constantly feeling like everything i do is always 100x worse than what she does, but she thinks that not only did I instigate the fight (i did, but we were drunk... i didn't put a song on that she wanted to listen to so she screeched at the top of her lungs and things only got progressively worse from there)

216,"It's going to be pretty hard to explain this, but i'll try to keep it short. I have this cycle in my life, it's kind of just how I work and I've tried to change it but I don't know how. Whenever I discover something new, like a hobby(i.e. making earrings, drawing in a particular media, playing a certain video game), I become absolutely and totally hyper fixated on said hobby, often spending money and resources on getting the means to do it. I obsess over it for anywhere for the next 3 days to 2 weeks, and it's all I can think about doing. Although, after that period of time, I lose all interest, it's just *gone.* Thus, I have to find a new thing to obsess over, and in the process I feel bad over spending money/having those I love spend money on something I'm never going to do again, and I also feel as if I'm never going to improve because I'm never going to stay with it or find what I want to do in life(I'm not out of school yet so I have time to decide, but the deadline is coming up fast.) It's not just hobbies that this happens with either, it's just general interests and sometimes even people too. I've done some research on this too, and I can't find much, other then this being partly due to ADHD or anxiety. I'm not about to self diagnose, but anxiety has always been a problem for me, although I've never had issues with any sort of ADHD that I know of. I just wish I could keep up with something, and actually improve so that maybe I could be really good at a few things instead of mediocre at everything.

 As a child i had a pretty rough childhood abusive dad and absent, he also alienated me and overall made me feel like i wasn’t normal bc I wasn’t and couldn’t be who he wanted me to be , even as a little kid i remember having to physically get my drunk dad off my mom, fast forward a couple years of abuse and constant anxiety that i might come home from school to something awful they got a divorce! 

My dad somehow got custody of me and it was obviously to get the last laugh and i lived with him for 2 years where i was abused by my older siblings and him constantly physically and emotionally but i finally went to live with mom unexpectedly ( he went to jail) .
  
 my mom is like my angel on earth and it was just us two i decided to forget about everything that happend and suppress it and look at the positive only because every-time i thought about it i wanted to  punch a wall and scream at the top of lungs. 

5 months later in january 2020 i start feeling like a weight on my shoulders and lump in my throat and neck tightness and even started getting acid reflux from food etc.. and for some weird reason my brain seems to have deleted those memories when it was barely a year ago i literally can’t remeber it that much .. 
( keep in mind i was getting a couple flash backs here and there in the shower but i’d ignore them ) 

and nothing i am trying is fixing all the pain until i stumbled across a video of how people get chronic headaches and some people even hip pain etc .... so i’m thinking if the acid reflux and neck tension and forgetting stuff is because i just ignored it and wanted to forget it / suppress it ? 
 
what do you guys think? i really need help bc the tightness and stuff is causing me so much more anxiety bc i sometimes also feel like i’m choking .

It all started when I (21F) moved into a house with a roommate four days ago. (Another roommate will be moving in next week.) 

My mother drove down to help me unpack and started making small talk with my roommate. It was no big deal at first, but it started to bother me that my roommate has a lot of similar interests as my mother. She’s also majoring in a science, which my mother always loved studying in high school and stuff. (I’m majoring in an arts-related subject.) My roommate is also taller and thinner than me, which I know my mother was at my age. I didn’t say anything at the time and still haven’t told anyone, but it bothered me a little that she and my mom got along so well. I’ve been a bit of a screw up in life and it was just weird to watch my mother meet someone who would’ve been the perfect daughter for her. 

I think about throwing myself down the stairs every time I have to walk down to the kitchen. 

My boyfriend is visiting in a few days. I mentioned it to her just because it’s the polite roommate thing to do. She casually asked what he does for a living and I said that he works in computer administration. She said “Oh, I can talk to him about —- and —-.” I honestly didn’t even mentally register the words, but it was something technical that I know nothing about. I don’t know why she’s so interested in talking to him anyway. 

I’ve been eating less, but I’m scared of starving myself too much because I don’t want to pass out at school when classes start. 

The A/C is in her room and she seems to prefer to keep the house too warm for my comfort. I have a small fan, but it doesn’t do much. I’ve gotten a few zits in the past couple days just from sweating so much. Part of me wonders if she’s keeping the house warm on purpose. I know that can’t be true. Can it?

I’m scared that when my boyfriend visits he’ll like her. I have nightmares about jumping out the window. I keep getting weird flashes of like the image of myself cutting myself. I accidentally cut myself while unpacking a kitchen knife on my first day in the house and I keep having the sensation that I’m still bleeding when the cut was very small and the wound has already healed. 

I self harmed a little bit like 8 years ago, but I haven’t thought about doing it in forever. I have depression and anxiety, but I’ve never had delusions or hallucinations before. I’m not even sure if the blood thing counts as a hallucination. I don’t know if I’m delusional. It seems pretty real to me that she’s up to something. I met the girl who lived in this room before me when I purchased some furniture from her. She warned me that this roommate was “competitive”, but she seemed to be holding something back. What was she hiding?

I don’t know how I’ve unraveled so quickly.

Can someone tell me what’s wrong with me? Why does she want to talk to him about computers? Would my mother love me more if I was thinner? Why is my hand still bleeding? How has it only been four days?

I promise I will not cause any harm, but I am scared if I am having delusions or hallucinations.",12Aug2020,1

229,"This event happened years ago when I was 15 (6 years agoish). I had a good friend who lived over seas, we will call her Lucy. I met her on her ask.fm advice page and we seemed to have hit it off and became great friends. We talked for months and really seemed to be best friends. 

The reason why I was on her advice page was because I was horribly depressed and needed help. So she helped me through my struggles and I helped her though hers (she also had depression). 

One day I seemed to just crumble, I was bullied in school and thought about ending it all. I asked her what to do after writing a suicide note and she told me to go to the school therapist. I did and I was sent to a hospital for several days. When I came back we resumed our friendship, but she seemed to be taking a downward spiral when it came to her own mental health. I kept talking her out of cutting and suicide but it was becoming to much for me. 

So I went anonymously on her advice page and asked her what to do if my friend is suicidle. She told me to report my friend to the school they attended. After much debate with myself I told my school and they contacted hers. She messaged me asking if I was the one who told her school and I admitted to it. She told me that she had to go and it would be a while before I heard back from her.

Months went by, I saw her ask.fm page was back up and running and I messaged her. She ignored me. I messaged her countless times to get nothing back. On Christmas Eve I message her one last time, she lashes at me saying how I'm a traitor and a horrible person for what I did and how I ruined her life and that she would never do that to someone (even though she did give me the advice to do it).

So now here I am six years (nearly seven) later. And I still think back to those days and my good friend I lost. Was I wrong? I know I betrayed her trust but I felt it was the right thing to do. I could never have forgiven myself if she had killed herself when I could have saved her..",12Aug2020,1

231,"Me and some friends (A and B) lived together for a few years back in the day. At the beginning of 2017, friend A moved out with his girlfriend. B and I found another roommate and stayed at our place until August 2018. At that point, I moved in with my gf, and B moved somewhere else with the new guy. 

Despite the 3 of us being best friends for so many years, A and I never heard from B again. We tried texting, calling, and reaching out to the new roommate. No answer. The nail in the coffin was when A invited B to his wedding. He didn’t just get a No on the RSVP, just no response whatsoever. B ghosted us. 

When the 3 of us lived together, A and I loaned B some money after he lost his job (several thousand dollars combined). A also had a turntable and an extensive record collection he left at the home after he left. B took it with him when he moved later, but A didn’t mind because he figured he could get it back at any time. But now that B ghosted is, he made off with over $1000 of records. 

Here’s where I need advice. Years later, B’s mom has made a Facebook account and friended me. Do I tell his mother about everything that went down to try to get our money back (or at the very least, figure out why a good friend of so many years ghosted is)? Or should I let dead dogs lie and forget it?",12Aug2020,1

233,"Okay so I am friends with an online person and she can't create this post due to her parent so I offered and she said yes. And this is how she worded it:

""Basically my dad keeps getting mad at me if I go anywhere or try to do anything but if I try to listen to what he says to do he still gets mad at me saying that is the wrong thing to do and I'm losing all my friends to this. I can't do much because I never finished high school due to a family death and I have nowhere to turn for major help but I also can't get a job.""

Side Note: I have told her to try to talk about it to her dad she has done this at least once to her dad   
 and he just said to her, ""You're just ungrateful."" She doesn't have that much money and therefore she can't move out. I can't do anything to help her because I am 10 states away from her. She does have another friend who is local to her in which I too am friends with but is quarantined because of COVID, but he said that once he isn't quarantined anymore he shall help her to the best of his abilities.

235,"I’m positive I met the right person for me but at the wrong time. Long story short I was dating her best friend at the time and we met at a surprise birthday thrown for me by my ex 5 yrs ago. And we couldn’t take our eyes off each other. Over the next 6 months my ex (my gf at the time) would invite her to hang out with us constantly. And this was torture because the chemistry was so heavily there and we’d both be in denial and intentionally blind about it since I was in a relationship... 

a couple more months go by &amp; my friend (female) asked me to go with her to Virginia to meet this guy she had been talking to on Xbox. We spent a week in Virginia basically going behind her husbands back (failing marriage) and helping her meet the man she’s now madly in love with &amp; happily married to.. 

this all inspired me to basically do the same and confront my ex’s best friend about her feelings for me.

She confessed to everything and how the night of my birthday she went home and her mom had asked if she had found any cute boys to which she replied “the birthday boy” and that’s where it kind of all got out of control. Before you know it we’re both up all night till the sun rises texting each other non stop, talking about all the things we really like about each other and just letting it all out, wishing the other was here etc... this was all going on during my week in Virginia and every single day she’d FaceTime me in the morning and at night and it was just constant non stop. It was really nice honestly. I was so happy and our humor was on point. But also incredibly guilty.

So I knew I had probably already broken the rule of cheating on people and knew that when I got home I had to end it with my ex in person and giver her closure &amp; explanation. Obviously, strategically this was the wrong thing to do because I kind of just told my ex everything.. no filter and ended it right there which in turn made everything explode and I lost both my ex and that girl in one fell swoop because they were best friends. 

I don’t really know what I was thinking.. but that girl genuinely had strong feelings for me. I could read it all over her body language &amp; mannerisms and her choice of words and all the times during the “explosion” that she’d cry. 

When the shit hit the fan (they came to my house to confront me for closure again) I figured that the best course of action was to try to save their friendship by saying in front of both of them that I had no feelings for her and that it was all lust. (My hope was that years later once the wounds heal I could make another attempt and keep their friendship in tact)

Plot twist.. Over the years my ex became best friends with my friend that I went to Virginia with. So in turn I have spent a lot of time with my ex as friends and she has completely forgiven me for everything and even told her friend that she could pursue me if she’d like.. but she never made any attempt. As a matter of fact she told me to never contact her again when I reached out earlier this year once I found out my ex told her she could pursue a relationship with me.

I was very confused by that because over the past five years since I met her I’ve contacted her pretty much yearly letting her know how I’ve really felt all this time.. I’ve also deff drunk texted her... I’ve bumped into her in public... she followed me on snap and insta and like all my shit etc... then she had a bf for a couple years (I respected that) then she contacted me at a convention we both go to every year right after she broke up with her boyfriend saying she was in her hotel with a picture of snapmaps saying how “close we were” (this was 1 yr ago)... hell shes even blocked me on social media then unblocked me when she finds out I’ve broken up with a gf... oh and she now won’t block me and tells me to do the blocking.. lol

Anyway.. this has all caused me a lot of failed relationships because I can’t think of anyone but her. I literally compare everyone to her because I’ve never felt so right with anyone else except her. And it’s destroying me. I know this is pretty much an unhealthy obsession at this point. I currently have a gf and I was so happy for a little while but my god the memories of this girl just keep coming back and then I get so lonely and sad because I can’t be with her.. then I end up resenting my current relationships. And falling off.. idk if I’m just missing out on solid closure or what. But I’m honestly afraid to talk to her anymore for fear of any further damage.

Lastly a few key points. I know she suffers from mental health issues. I don’t know what exactly but I know it’s depressive. She would tell me how she was sad all the time and that she was once admitted to a mental help facility. The last time I saw her in person, she did not seem happy (depressed). I haven’t talked to her in about a year now. She made it very clear that she had no interest in a relationship with me but I was &amp; am very confused as to why because of her conflicting actions. She told me that it was a mistake and that her friendship was more important to her and that she shouldn’t have let it get to the point that it did.

So I’m like all over the place with the ups and downs and just trying to figure out how to move on from this and make it stop hurting so badly. It’s made me so incredibly depressed and Un-satisfied with life and anything I do over the years to the point I find myself with sleepless nights like tonight struggling to make my mind stop. Then just getting overwhelmingly sad about it. I feel like my life isn’t worth anything without sharing it with someone so I just feel in limbo wasting time while approaching 30 because it’s not with her.",12Aug2020,1
237,"I'm 26 and this is my first time moving out completely on my own. I've always lived in the same home as my mom, and I'm her only child. I have a very bad relationship with my dad, and they tend to argue as well so I always find myself being the mediator trying to calm both of them down and convince them to speak to each other respectfully rather than break shit and yell.

Me leaving has been long in the making considering this volatile situation. Plus, in the last year or so I've felt like a loser living at home, single, not doing much else with my life. It was time for a change. 

I finally found a place that I loved, that wasn't run down like most, and in a great location. I applied and I got it! 

Suddenly, reality set in and I knew my mother would be sad..  but I didn't know it would be this bad. 

She cried, and said things like ""who will tell me they love me now and hug me before bed?"", ""who will be there to make you food when you're too tired from work?"", ""I've lived so much of my life with you. I didn't even live this long under the same roof with my own parents."" 

I hardly ever see her cry, and then this on top of it. I can see how much pain she's in and it's making me regret my decision. I can't stop crying, and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help her. She's had such a hard life, and she's been hurt by my dad so much... I don't want to add to that pain and disappointment. It's breaking my heart to see her this sad. 

How do I handle this gently without hurting her more?",12Aug2020,1
238,Okay so I (16f) have this huge fear of intimacy and it ends relationships with friends and people I date or get interested in. I have a huge tendency to automatically push people away once I start getting close to people and generally end up putting them emotionally through the ringer and It makes me feel really guilty because I don't realize I've done it until to late. I don't understand why I have this fear because I have two loving parents and such. But I also don't like hugs or being touched unless someone is sad. Like yesterday was the first time that I just hugged my friend without her initiating it. But other than that I barely hug people and have huge trust issues but I honestly don't know where they came from and thats what confuses me most. I don't really know to go from here because I do like being around people and I like dating and stuff like that but I just put up so many walls so fast and it's frustrating for everyone.

idk if i'm just scared of commitment or intimacy or if i'm just so wrapped up in myself that i dont wanna feel obligations to someone else. i also considered for a sec that maybe im just a lesbian (i currently identify as bi) but it's hard for me to try and explore that possibility bc i still live w my parents and theyre pretty heavily homophobic ://

I felt like I had lost literally all of my closest friends, I reached a point of depression I had never hit before. I spent months inside not wanting to go anywhere (which was convenient bc I couldn't anyway 😅) I laid on my floor totally numb almost every night to the point that I couldn't even cry anymore and barely able to move because I was so broken.

And I was riding a massive high and I felt like I could totally achieve it and that I could prove it to myself and get there. But then everything changed and I totally lost that when my girlfriend broke up with me. And it was like all the positivity and confidence all disappeared.

The problem is, now I can't find the motivation to do anything.

I hate the fact that I'll have to get married whenever my parents want me to and ""obey"" my husband my whole life. I hate living in this misogynistic society. I keep questioning everything I've ever been taught and I feel like everything's just so fucked up. Women are so oppressed in Muslim societies, it fucking sucks.

I'm 23, male. After high school, I got with this girl I met at work. We were together for 4 1/2 years. About a year into it, I felt bad for her because of her living situation. She was living with her sister and her boyfriend, kids, and brother. She didn't even have her own room. I felt bad, dropped out of college and got an apartment for me and her. I was in love. We spent 2 1/2 years living on our own and it was great until halfway through it. We even got engaged. Then she stopped working out of no where, refused to get a job, was mean to me and much more. After a year of this, I couldn't afford to keep paying 2 cars, 2 insurance bills, rent, etc, all while I was going to school because I started back again so I could have a future. So were forced to move out  Me with my parents, and her with her sister again. She didn't like that. 3 months after this, and still she doesn't have a job, one day when I got my check, she immediately told me she was gonna take my money out and pay her car. I told her I can't keep doing that and she needs to get a job. She then took the money anyway. I had to pull my money out of the bank account. After a couple days of fighting and silence, she broke up with me on christmas day 2019. This was when the suicidal thoughts started to form. It wasn't serious at the time, but it crossed my mind. I was heartbroken for a bit, but then realized this was really good for me. I realized how toxic of a relationship I was in, so I pulled myself together and told myself 2020 was gonna be my year.   
I was back in college, single, and ready to get my life together again.

I should bring up that when I was in high school, I was around 170lbs, pretty healthy. And at the beginning of the year, I was at 260lbs. Huge weight increase, I never wanted to meet my old friends from high school again out of shame and embarrassment.   
Fast forward to January, 2020. There's this girl that I was best friends with in all of high school. We were close friends, always laughing and talking, and I might have had a slight crush on her, but nothing too serious. I just didn't want to ruin the friendship or make things weird and it was fine by me. And she was amazing. Literally the perfect girl. Smart, achieving, down to earth, beautiful and a great friend. Well, in January she decides to visit my state again because she went to school out of state. She invited me and some of our old friends, and we hung out and I had a great time, other than being ashamed of how I look compared to everyone else. And she hasn't changed a bit. This is where the problem starts. That slight spark of a crush I had on her has now expanded to a fire. It's terrible. There's absolutely 0% chance that me and her would ever be a thing, and like last time, I don't want things to be weird and ruin the friendship so I let it go, but it's much harder this time. 

Fast forward to now, I've lost 30 lbs, so I'm at around 230lbs. Better, but not where I want to be. I recently got accepted to a university I've wanted to go to, and life seems great so far. That girl that I like invited me and another one of our friends to hang out one more time before she goes back to school. This was last night. We actually had a great time, other than of course, my weight. We talked a lot more this time about our past and what we've done since high school and all, and I told her how I gained weight because I worked at KFC as a manager so I got free food all the time, and that's why I got fat and all. 

Then today, we were talking, just about normal stuff about our family and so on, and out of nowhere, she randomly sends me a gif of a kfc bucket with hearts around it. At first I was confused and asked why she sent that, and she didn't respond even though she saw my message. Then it hit me. She was making fun of me to someone else. Probably talking about my weight to them and making fun of how I look, hence the gif. She still hasn't responded and I've just been sitting here speechless for hours. It's like my worst nightmare come true. Out of everyone I didn't want to see me for who I am now, it was her. She was always the one I wanted to impress and I thought she would understand. It's like I have no one now. No one to show that I'm worth it. Oddly, she was an  inspiration to me because of how much she's achieved in the past 4-5 years. It's what motivated me to push myself and go back to college.

Now instead of having suicidal thoughts, I'm legit contemplating it. I feel worthless, like a failure. My fiance left me, I'm broke, living with my parents at 23, I'm unhealthy and look terrible, I doubt I'll be able to get through college, I feel like a burden to everyone, and then this happened. I'm just useless now. I'm probably going to delete this after a while because this feeling only lasts for a couple hours then goes away. But it keeps recurring. I'm sorry.",12Aug2020,1

255,"Ihave a hard time being happy as a girl. I am not transgender, I have already tested those waters and I learned it’s not me. It won’t ever be, but I keep coming back to it.
I used to think I was a guy. I had short hair, a binder, a masculine wardrobe. But I discovered that the anxiety inside me was because I was being someone I was not. I have since grown my hair out and have bought clothes designed for a female body. It’s great that I’ve done that, but I still struggle daily. 

I keep coming back to it. I’ll look at it on social media. I think I’m jealous of their confidence of knowing who they are and getting there and I want that, too. 

Something else is what influences my thoughts is how I am treated in the gaming community. The guys I meet are quick to think I’m a “gamer girl” and don’t take the stats I share seriously in the games I play (until I showed them; “Oh, I didn’t think you actually played this game”). They’ll tease and joke about how there’s a girl in the party until I’m done and make up an excuse to go. I have met good people and we’re friends now, but it still happens time and time again (not with the good people, randoms). 

When the thoughts get to me, I have to clearly think and remind myself that “I am a girl, I am a girl,” and I’ll calm down until it happens again. I let go of the transgender stuff, but I keep trying with a masculine wardrobe or getting buff enough that my body will look as masculine as I can make it. I look at that stuff online, thinking I want it, because it’ll make me look like a guy. If I look like one, I think, I’m treated like one. As an equal. Bonus points if they were to think I was a lesbian (I guess) and they wouldn’t hit on me!

But deep down, it’s not me! I like semi/ feminine/feminine clothing. I have a gender neutral wardrobe, I want to throw it all away and buy all the clothes that make me happy, but all those thoughts are swirling around in my head. I am deeply embarrassed about my problem, I haven’t told anyone about it because of fear of judgment. It’s a weird problem and I don’t know what to do. 

Even more. I want to get back into this video game when I get the chance and I was thinking of what name I would tell people befriended for them to name my character (you name the people you befriend, so I would tell them what my preferred one is) and I was already trying to find a gender neutral/masculine name because I didn’t want them to think I was a girl because  the name I wanted to use, my name, is feminine. 

It’s so complicated!! At the same time I love my name and it makes my stomach churn when I think about telling them a fake name because I don’t want to.. I feel weak as a girl and not an equal to everyone else. Sometimes I forget about it, all these weird thoughts, but it catches up sooner or later. How to I start loving who I am? I know I want to love who I am, but I just have a hard time doing it for reasons mentioned above.

TL;DR I have a hard time accepting who I am and try to fix the problem by thinking I am a guy so I am seen as a general equal.",12Aug2020,1
256,"I know this sounds hella petty, but hear me out. [14M]

But I’m a musician, and I’m constantly trying to put out content for various reasons. Sometimes I’m just trying to put my name out, sometimes I do it for the attention I of other TikTokers I wanna talk to (not in a creepy ass way). Like sometimes I just post myself singing (I usually take it down like a couple of days after I post it because I have severe perfectionism when it comes to things I like doing) and it’ll get absolutely no views. 

Something that I’ve also been doing is trying to get attention of other TikTokers with singing. There’s this TikToker I wanna talk to, so while I happened to be recording already, I recorded a song for her as well. I already established the joke that she “owes me a DM back” so what I did was I said I had a reason why I deserve a text back, I have 12 reasons why I derserve it. Then I went into the intro of 12 Play by R. Kelly (I put on the video it was a joke) and I asked everyone to tag her if they saw the video. The video has 32 views, 8 likes, and only two people tagged her. I do only have 36 followers, but I really want her to see the video before I find a reason to private it. Any advice?

258,"I'm getting a gaming computer and I'm very excited about it as I've pondered getting one for a while, but I can't help but feel like I don't deserve it. There are some present and past things weighing on my mind about it. 

Starting with the present issues, it is a large purchase that my dad is paying for at the moment, however, I will be paying him back in the future. I feel guilty about this since now that I've decided I finally want one, we're in the middle of a pandemic and I don't have a job, plus my parents are also paying my college tuition. My dad is incredibly generous and just wants me to be happy, even saying I don't have to pay him back since he had bought one for my brother, but just such a large ""unnecessary""/pleasure/entertainment purchase on top of (currently online) college tuition makes me feel as though I've already ""picked my gift"" in a sense? Even though I will be paying it back, I just feel unproductive and bad. My brother remarked to me that I don't even need a gaming pc because I only play a few games and could just play them on my laptop. While, yes, I can play some of them on my laptop, some are incredibly laggy and my laptop is 5+ years old. Even though I only play a few games now, there's still games I'll play to come and I wouldn't just be using the pc to game, I decided to purchase it now because of the pandemic and nearly all of my classes being online now.

Delving into the past, I had a friend, whom I've now cut off, make some remarks to me when I had expressed wanting to get a gaming pc someday. They had ridiculed me, saying it was a waste of money and how I'd only play a few games on it, etc. There's a lot more trauma from this person, but I'm not getting into the rest of it today.

Logically, I know that it's my money and I can buy whatever I want with it, and I know that you don't need to play a minimum number of games in order to buy a gaming pc, etc. I just don't know how to get over feeling guilty and spoiled. I know I'm privileged, I just can't get over past toxic friend trauma that told me I should feel guilty about my privilege and be miserable and repent for it. I also just don't know how to deal with my brother gatekeeping gaming pcs just because I don't play a whole bunch of fps games like him. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with emotions that aren't logical? Dealing with ""false guilt"" I guess? This would all be better talked through with a therapist, yes, but I don't have one at the moment due to the pandemic. Thanks in advance.",12Aug2020,1
259,"Look I know from that title you are thinking that this is probably one of those bullshit ""life hack"" things. But this ain't that. Let's get started...

Does this describe you or someone you know?

""Sometimes I think people judge me because of how messy my house is.""

If that sounds like you, then you need to read this:

It's okay, I got you. You need to chill, but it's not your fault. Just know that your friends and family have already judged you. They already know the person you are and they love you anyway. Either because of it or in spite of it. They love you. So chill.

This is not to suggest that you can go full Hoarder. I'm just saying that you shouldn't give a second thought to the dishes in the sink.

Now what about this. Someone you don't know or a new friend is coming over to your house.

Simple, pick up a little bit, your not a slob. And you have to ease new people into your personality, they don't know ""you"" yet and the real ""you"" could scare them. 

Never Ever Ever tell people to ignore the mess in your clean house!!! I used three exclamation points like I'm typing a work e-mail to a female. \[not sexist, I'll explain below\]\* I did it for emphasis! Because so many people do this and it DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE! Your friends and family already know you and have judged you. Picking up this time isn't going to impress them. 

Think about this too, ***WHO*** are the people that would ever judge you based on your clean house?

**Bif:** I don't know Buffy... Those Johnson's are nice people but, boy they have not cleaned under their fridge in a while.

**Buffy:** Oh my God I KNOW!!! And what about their mismatched glassware?!

Now, to the best of my knowledge, **Bif** and **Buffy** do not actually exist. But on the off-chance that you know somebody like them or you are them. Then tell them to read this.

It's okay, I got you. You need to chill, but it's not your fault. Just know that your friends and family have already judged you. They already know the person you are and they love you anyway. Either because of it or in spite of it. They love you. So chill.

One last note. 

If at any point you wonder if your family and friends really love you, then think about what they mean to you. Not the other way around. If you love them then you need to Understand them. Understanding them will take time, and it probably wouldn't hurt putting in some effort.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*You read that and thought, for at least a little bit, ""that's not right."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Look I get it, I totally understand. The world right now is a crazy place, we've pushed everything to the extreme. I mean what is appropriate any more? 

No, I'm really asking, I mean do you know?

Does our opinion matter if it differs from what society thinks?

What if I don't agree with what society thinks?

What if I don't think that professional sports should mingle with politics? If I said that would some people label me a racist? 

If they do then they don't know me, they don't understand me at all. 

This is the problem, society does not get to dictate what I think is appropriate. I get to. I don't care what the majority of twitter or 4Chan want me to think. I know it might seem hard to believe, but the majority of social media do not reflect the majority of society, merely the extremes.

 But really this is not a conversation about sexism, but instead about two sides of the same coin. 

Well shoot. Now your thinking ""Jeez, I came here to find out an easy way to keep my house clean, I mean come on. Now, I'm thinking this would have been better if it was some bullshit ""Life Hack."" But then again, another part of me is totally down for this."" 

Well, read on then.

What I'm saying is that there is a divide in our world, something that pushes us to extremes. We take a side of the coin.  some of us on our side of the coin are pretty deep into that side, others not so much. It is this pressure that keeps the coin flipping slowly.  It's a metaphor.

You ready? Twitter and 4Chan are a microcosm of the sides of the coin. Wow, that is insane, I mean did I really just compare Twitter to 4Chan? But I did, and in a weird way it all makes sense. Because you can say the same thing about both of them.

You will not find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. 

Because without Cancel Culture, the rise of Social Justice Warriors, or any other important group or major social movement that has come out of there... it has the complete opposite on 4Chan. 

&amp;#x200B;

The puzzle fits together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then you really understand the concept that we are two sides of the same coin. It is not just Twitter and 4Chan, it's the opposite sides of Facebook and Tik-tok and every other window into humanity that exists. It's not just the political stuff either. There are extremists that don't even talk about politics. They are just the extremely sexist, woke, feministic, Homophobic, narcissistic, toxic, vegan, gun-loving,  intellectual, racist assholes that you just happen to know.  What I'm saying is that there is a divide in our world, something that pushes us to extremes. We take a side of the coin.  

If you noticed, I saved racist for last up above. I did that on purpose, because this is the fundamental cause of our divide. I'm not talking black and white, well not nearly as superficially as you are thinking.

There are two separate races. the deserving and the undeserving. These races exist outside of skin color or any other physical feature.

Before you fight me

Does any of this describe someone you know?

they don't work hard enough, they don't try hard enough, they didn't come from the right side of the tracks, they don't look good enough, they are bad at selling themselves, they are stupid, morons, total imbeciles. They don't have the right name, they don't have the right stuff. They go to the wrong church, they go to the wrong school, they study the wrong thing, they worship the wrong God, they listen to the wrong music, they are in with the wrong crowd,  They voted for the wrong President... 

Now read all of those again... and ask yourself if anybody thinks this of you?

If so you need to read this.

Just know that your friends and family have already judged you . They already know the person you are and they love you anyway. Either because of it or in spite of it. They love you. So chill.

But it's true, there are people out there who think they are above us. Even if they only think it a little bit.

So how do we balance the coin? 

What is the opposite of hate? Love.

It is that simple.

We have to love everyone as much as our friends and family love us. Every person, ever.

That doesn't mean that you have to agree with any single thing a person does or says. You can completely disagree with a person down to the molecular level, every tiny fraction of their existence is in complete opposition to yours... (Deep breath) And you can still love them as a human being, you still believe that they are deserving of being human.

And if you believe that then read this.

Love is understanding. If you are incapable of understanding somebody than you do not them love them as a human being. 

In that case you need to read this.

It's okay, I got you. You need to chill, but it's not your fault. Just know that your friends and family have already judged you. They already know the person you are and they love you anyway. Either because of it or in spite of it. They love you. So chill.",12Aug2020,1

262,"Background: I(17) live with both of my parents (50s) in the house. I have a physical disability (hypermobility spectrum disoders). My sister is leaving soon for college. 

I live at home and with COVID I'm stuck in the house more than I'd normally ever be. My father for  all of  my life has always had a nasty temper he would yell at me and my sister ever since we were born, the littlest things used to set him off and he'd hit sometimes. My mother didn't step in and do anything. As I've gotten older he's gotten a little better but still yells frequently and as well as degrading comments about myself, what I do or whatever of myself. 

This, along with genetics has caused me to have multiple mental health disorders: panic disorder, anxiety, clinical depression. So when he yells it triggers a panic attack sometimes. And then I'll just go in my room for a while. He also tries to control and intimidate us , he gets alot worse when he's not in control. 

Recently it's come to light that it's not normal to not remember the majority of your childhood (still a few memories), then while I was reading it triggered a possible very very bad memory. Which makes being in the same room as him almost painful. After he yells or has one of his episodes he acts like nothing happened never apologies. Sometimes he's bearable, I can talk to him and won't get mad but it's not a matter of if but when he'll blow up again.

I am tired of living in this cycle where I try to have a normal relationship with him but then he yells, the does the whole thing again where acts like nothing happened. It's so painful and I don't want to live with him but I don't have a choice at this point. My relative whom I would go and live with has a high risk person at their home so my plans are delayed until the pandemic is over.  The other relatives are all too far away for me to live with them (still have to finish school) . So I don't know if I should just minimize contact with my dad but then he'd most likely get mad and start targeting me more. Or if I just go on like normal and hope he stops. 

Mentally it's been feeling like I've been driving a nail in my head.  I want this pain to end (this situation I'm in I'm not suicidal)  I'm exhausted with having to deal with all this shit, it's degrading my self esteem and chipping away at my resolution. There are days where all I can feel is kind of a cold rage for the things that happened in the past and what I have to go through. 

Financially I am dependent on them, transportation I am dependent on them, medically dependent on them.

265,"So basically this guy is my oldest friend and I love him like a brother. But unfortunately we’re not seeing eye to eye at the moment due to some of his actions (and mine as well) 

My friend had a really tough up bringing and I know it plays on his mind a lot and I know the root cause of his actions are due to his childhood. His father was quite abusive to him. He left home when he was 16 and his life spiralled out of control for the next few years. Doing drugs pretty much everyday, not working and getting involved with the wrong people. During this time I stopped talking to him because not matter what I’d say or do to try help him, he wouldn’t listen and I didn’t want to go onto the same path as him. During the time of me not talking to him his life got worse, but eventually it seems he got his life on track and moved away 

Cut to about 18 months ago we started talking again after he told me his moving back to town. Everything was really good for a good year, he was back to his somewhat normal self and got himself a job. But for the past 6 month his gone back down the rabbit hole..

His gotten back onto the drugs, smoking a ridiculous amount of weed everyday (don’t get me wrong I think weed is fine just as long you treat it like anything else, by not going overboard with it). His also gotten onto medication for his ADD (which is basically speed) while his smoking. I tried telling him multiple times then he needs to slow down on everything his taking, but wouldn’t listen. 

He started becoming very angry with everyone and everything, blaming people for stuff that doesn’t even matter. Expecting people to do something for him right at the moment his asks and if they can’t they’re the worst person. Always thinking his right even tho his clearly in the wrong. Tearing relationships apart by his actions and blaming the other person for everything. 

I stopped talking to him again about 2 months ago after we had a fight because everything he was doing was really starting to affect my life (also I’ve had my own personal things going on in life so I was dealing with that) But his fails to see how. The past couple weeks we’ve been talking on and off which has been good. But the other day he asked if we were all good. I tried explaining to him that everything is okay, I just needed space from him while I was dealing with my stuff. 

Then he just snapped.. 

Accusing me of being a shitty friend and that it only took one fight for me to stop talking to him. I tried explaining yet again that it’s just not one thing but multiple things. I told him that I love him like a brother and I’ll always care for him but he needs to sort himself out. But yet again his just spits in my face, saying that I’ve abandoned him at his lowest point again. 

I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I have abandoned him but I really don’t know what else to do. Everything I say just goes in one ear and out the other. It’s honestly getting to the point in his head we’re his the only one that should matter and everyone else problems/life don’t. Nothing I say or do can change or help him

266,"Hi all. 

My uncle was diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago. It had gotten bad. I don’t know too many details as the family has been private about it for the most part. I get details from my mum once in awhile; my dad (it’s his brother) gets phone calls every now and then. 

Lately, it seemed like he had started losing hope (with the things he has been saying to my dad). A week ago, they were told he had ~3 weeks left. Today, they were told just a couple of hours. 

Today happens to also be my cousin’s birthday (my uncle is his dad). I’ve been speaking with my cousin on and off for awhile now, and he hasn’t brought his dad up at all. When I wished him a happy birthday (before I knew the news), he replied with a really chipper message. 

Obviously, I love my uncle and I love my cousins. This sucks. Anyways, if my cousin isn’t bringing up his dad, should I even check in with how he’s doing with all of this? I want to, but I don’t want to bring up something he may not want to discuss. I want him to know that I’m here for him and the family... even if I’m not physically there.  

TIA. 

TL;DR: Uncle isn’t doing well... he doesn’t have much time left. I can’t physically be there for the family or my younger cousins. My cousin seems to be putting up a front (or is either extremely positive). How do I check in? Should I? How do I show love and support? Thanks.",12Aug2020,1

269,Would you warn your friend of the red flags of your ex-boyfriend (who they are currently dating) when they are already invested in the relationship (I just found out this morning)?,12Aug2020,1
270,"**TL;DR: There is no TL;DR.  You have to read it all for you won't get a clear picture.  Sorry. 😕

Fair warning: I put a lot of detail here in hopes of getting the most accurate advice possible.  I have kept it organized and readable.

I am 34 years of age, veteran, married twice (first during the service, toxic marriage, one son from it that I have no contact with sadly; second marriage is more successful, have a good wife and two children).  Since leaving the military, I got divorced, spent five years being underemployed or unemployed, going to a crap college, and being a lazy mess; got married again and continued the process for another five years, adding to the quota two bouts of homelessness.

I suffer from bouts of depression, likely environmental.  I find that my enjoyment for life and things in it gradually get less and less, and I worry for the day when I wake up and no longer care for or feel anything.

My wife, 23, has an aggressive eating disorder that controls her mentally and emotionally, damaging her body and draining her energy and emotions.  She smokes, eats 2-300 calories a day, and goes through significant mood swings. She's clinically bipolar.  She's on medication that dampens her emotions significantly - they call it a mood stabilizer.  Her life ambitions right now are either vacant or, on a bad day, just wanting to fall asleep and never wake up.  She has intense abuse baggage from her childhood and teenage years. We also recently lost a baby to a birth defect.

In regards to my wife: I love her and am dedicated to her, but the environment can get toxic and draining easily. Between her ED, bipolar, depression, her inability to let go or forgive... sometimes it's a bit like walking on eggshells.  She is owned by her baggage and disorders and getting her to care enough to recognize and want to address the problems has proven difficult.  Still, I'm in this with her to the end.  I'm mentioning all of this because she is a factor in my overall life, and I need to find ways to address her without losing my will to function.

In terms of my family, I feel that for the majority of our life together, I have failed them, as my father failed me.  Worse, perhaps.  I have not provided a stable home for much of our life.  I have trampled on my wife emotionally while struggling with my own past issues, baggage, and a voracious porn addiction - all of which had done damage.  It took me a year to care about my son (4 now) and I feel I've been entirely too harsh with him, not unlike my father.  Our second, my daughter (just over 1 yr) is a delight and melts my heart, and makes my want to be a better person for her.

Due to the depression and pursuant anxiety, I haven't been able to keep a decent job for almost ten years.  I've never made more than $15/hr, and rarely worked more than part time.  I presently do security making 12.50/hr, full time, but it's hardly rewarding work, has no real future, and we still need section 8 and food stamps to make a go of it.  I donate plasma twice a week to try and afford other things, but it's still a rough existence.

So, that's the history up until now.

I don't know what to do with my life.

I am an INTJ left-brained person. I'm clever, sure, but I have a hard time operating outside of the rules and structure that my life exists within.  I have followed the path of least resistance for much of my recent life.  I feel like I have no energy.  I dream and hope, but I have no vision of how to get from here to there.

I'm either too discouraged to move ahead, or lack the energy to take a step and maintain course, or feel I don't have the right directions or knowledge to plot the right course.  This is how it's been regardless of what part of my life we're talking about.

I have considered a few options for my life, and I have a few things I want to do:

I've thought about re-enlisting, going Reserves this time and getting a brainier MOS with a security clearance.  It would give my family good Tricare insurance, which could help a lot, and I could use the clearance likely to get a better paying job, probably in the public sector.  To this end, I've been working with a recruiter to cut down some weight to meet prior service rules

I've thought about becoming a cop.  I'm concerned that I won't be content, but it would give me an opportunity to help people and serve my community.

My personal dream has been to have a design studio one day, where I lead a team to make tabletop games and products.  I've been working on concepts for years now, but progress has been slow and ultimate progress stops due to my previous chronic issues with discouragement, or lack of vision, or lack of energy.  I often wish I had a partner or two to work with, and I've had one partner in the past (he helped keep me motivated and on task, gave me a sounding board, and I got more done in two weeks than I had in 5 years), but life issues got in the way.  I still hold on to the hope of being a tabletop game designer.

I also love tabletop RPGs, like D&amp;D, and I have enjoyed DMing in the past.  However, it's proven difficult keeping a group together, and I run into my old friends *Discouragement* and *Lack-DIscipline* there as well.  I would love to work on systems and do writing, retrofits, and asset creation for a tabletop RPG, but I'm overwhelmed just thinking about it.

If you made it this far, I appreciate your patience.

Summary: I wish to overcome *lethargy*, *confusion*, and *lack of vision*.  I wish to be a better husband and father.  I wish to be a man who can accomplish hard things and who can think creatively once again.

So the story is me and my friends are all going into the 11th grade this year, and we heard from some close friends of ours that our friend who’ll I call “P” for now played 7 minutes in heaven, now this wouldn’t be so bad, except the part where he did it with a 5th grader and it escalated to them having sex, one guy has video proof of it, I never would’ve thought he would do such a thing, and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to make assumptions but my little sister is in the 5th grade and she is VERY impressionable, so I’m just stuck between a rock and a hard place I suppose. Thanks for reading

No message in my mailbox or on my door saying what this is. No-one informed me this was happening (mind you if they'd knocked on my door I wouldn't know cause I do shift work so I'm always either at work or sleeping for work with earplugs in). It's also zip tied right to my back gate so I can't even open it now! Called the city and they have no idea what it is and said they won't deal with wires that aren't theirs. Called 2 internet/tv providers in my area and they said it's not theirs. Do I just cut it?! I don't even know what kind of wire it is and if it's live or not?! And if it is some small internet/tv provider who did this today, is that even legal to zip tie it like that long my fence and block my back gate??

279,"Hi! I’m hoping to get some advice or help with my crazy landlord...
So I moved into a rental room, sharing a bathroom with another girl, and landlord and his wife are in the same house, in the master bedroom with their own bathroom. We share living room and kitchen as well as garage.
When I moved in I was really excited. They seemed to be a great couple, and I got along with the other girl very well. Then Covid hit, and the other girl moved back home, understandably. During the first two month, I sometimes hear them argue, but couples argue, I believed it to be normal, and also I was so exhausted from work I usually fall dead asleep. 
Then I started to work from home, and they began to argue more and more, and it turned to the point that I called the police (the landlady then begged me to tell the police not to come, she was never violent and was always helpful, while during their argument the landlord is always yelling) The landlord is the biggest loser I have ever seen, he does not have a job, brags about having millions of dollars, and sits on the couch and watches TV all day. Above all that he is a genuinely bad person. 
I tried my best to help the landlady out, offering her help, and she told me couple times that she plans to move out but never does (she has a relatively stable job and family around) 
Our last encounter was truly horrible, I have videos and audios recorded (I know it does not act as evidence but usually are useful with police) The landlord was drunk, yelling my name, accusing me of owing them rent, and threatening to kick me out. At that point I decided to move out as soon as possible, and I’m lucky enough that I have friends and partner to count on and was able to move out in only 15 days. I was also under the impression that they were separating and would not rent the room out. 
I just now found out another girl, possibly two, will be moving in soon. The landlady once told me tenants have been forced to move out before me, few times, because of the landlord, and as far as I know, abuser does not stop, especially since he is not even trying to get better. 
My heart felt in my stomach when I learned about this, and all I could think about is how I could stop this...above all, whoever move in, probably young girls cuz that’s what they look for, will have to go through what I went through, witnessing abuse, and being forced to move out.  But I genuinely can not think of anything I could do, especially since I have moved to another state...",12Aug2020,1

286,"My boyfriend (24m) and I (22f) have been together almost 10 months now, and there's a very good chance I'm pregnant.

We both have anxiety, let me throw that out there, so we are jumping the gun discussing our options right now, as I still have a week before I can take a test and know for sure.

Obviously we have three options. 1) keep it. 2) adoption. 3) abortion. I don't really consider number 2 an option as it would be too hard for me to just give my child up.

I've always wanted a big family, so I'm definitely leaning towards number 1, but on the same note, since covid, we have both been out of jobs and are struggling to find work. He is out of college and will be paying back loans soon, and I'm in my last 2 semesters.

We do plan on having kids later in life, like 5 years minimum. Just want to get a significant amount of our school debts paid off and have a permanent location with stable jobs.

I am stuck in the middle between option 1 (keep) and 3 (abortion), leaning more towards 1.

Boyfriend would rather I get an abortion. He grew up with very poor parents, and his father eventually abandoning him and his siblings, and doesn't want his children growing up poor and struggling like he did. He also said he will obviously stand by and support my decision if I were to keep it. He would obviously stay in my life and the child's life, even if it would be super hard for him (financially and all that).

I agree it's probably the best choice to get an abortion as the child would not have a good life as of now. It would be a huge struggle to raise it.

On the same note, I've always wanted children, that's what I want most in life so this possibility is super hard for me to think about.

Of course I don't want to force my boyfriend into something he doesn't want, and I don't want the child to grow up and have to struggle like we did when we grew up. 

I also worry about if I have to get an abortion, if I'll regret it. I know it will be hard for me to end a pregnancy, too.

(If this helps at all, my boyfriend and I believe that it's the woman's right to choose. I believe once it has a heartbeat, it is alive. And he believes when it breathes on its own and isn't inside of me, it's alive.)

Idk. Any advice would help. What you think the best decision would be in this situation. If you had an abortion and regret it. Whatever, any advice is welcome.

Thanks in advance.",12Aug2020,1

I want to get myself a job I find fun which seems really difficult. There are jobs I would find boring and would dislike that pay well. So I guess the issue is I don’t really want to have a boring desk job or something that pays well. I do want money but not in a job I would hate and couldn’t stand. 

I do think opening a few restaurants would be fun like opening a Dairy Queen or Starbucks or something. I also think working with kids would be fun.

290,"Two weeks ago I didn't get much sleep one night due to the fact that I had to pee like every 5 minutes. Only small amount came out and it was stinging after I finished. Then discomfort as I felt like peeing again. I noticed a pinkish stain every now and then on my toiler paper. That had to be blood mixed with urine. I got really concerned and finally fell asleep at like 7 am. I woke up later that day and I felt fine. It did sting a little bit after every urination but no blood and that discomfort. It has gotten better so I thought it's fine. Who knows what it was but it's over now.. But I'm noticing it's happening again. Not as severe. But im currently at work and I feel so weird again like I have to pee even tho I just fucking peed. No blood. Which leads me to me next question.

Now it's late for five days if I remember the last date correctly.

Our parents are great but the reality is they can’t relate to what it’s like to be a college student in today’s age like I can. That said, I was at a complete loss for word and basically just cried a little bit, hugged her and told her I was proud. 

I plan to write her a letter and send it off to her this week so she can have it before classes start. I want to get her excited about college, while also lightly warning her about some of the more dangerous things she could encounter (such as drinking “jungle juice” at a party. Once I went to a college party where the girls could ONLY drink the jungle juice and it was spiked with everclear.

So I bought a MacBook Pro back in 2018, 2800€ something like that, and I had only problems since then. After owning a small MacBook Air 2011 for 4/5 years without problem I thought tripling the price would give me some confort. What a mistake. 

My problems first began when the touch bar started not working briefly sometimes. For some reason it would block when I was trying to change sound or light, and suddenly unblock after a few seconds. 
Then the SSD started to make a lot of noises but i read online that it was the case for all MacBook Pro apparently. 
Even after a few month I noticed I couldn’t multitask as to use photoshop and watch a live on twitch for exemple, or photoshop + illustrator, because it would become too slow pretty fast. Lately it started getting worse, I tried to delete a lot of stuff, applications, resetting the smc, removing the case for better ventilation. Nothing worked. I took a video 10 minutes ago while only watching a stream, everything goes south. I really don’t get it, I treat it pretty well but it really doesn’t pay. I’ll link the video in the comment, I hope it’s allowed by the rules.

Here are the specs of my MacBook :
- macOS Catalina (10.15.4)
- MacBook Pro (15inch, 2018)
- 2,2ghz Intel core i7 6core
- Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 mo
- 256gb SSD

296,"Hello, everyone as the title states I'm 25 years old and looking for some direction. Long story short I come from a very poor family we literally had no vehicle and lived in a $2000 mobile home. I also lost my mother when I was 17 due to a drug overdose which caused me to become depressed and drop out of high school. After dropping out I sat around depressed and did nothing until I was 18 when I finally got a job making $8 an hour at an RV dealership detailing RVs. Knowing I had to get out of the $2000 mobile home, and buy a car to get to work I stuck it out at the dealership. I eventually moved through the ranks and made $11 an hour which allowed me to save enough money to purchase my first car. After purchasing my first car so I could get back and forth to work I set my mind on the goal of purchasing a home. I purchased an $85,000 dollar home after saving up $5000(first time home buyer), and luckily after a very stressful 5month closing period + almost losing my RV dealership job, I closed on the house. This was the best decision of my life as this home is now worth almost double 5 years later. 

I worked a few other odd jobs in between the RV dealership job and here I am LOST at 25.  Luckily I wanted more out of my life and I obtained my high school diploma, and am now almost 1 year done with community college on track for Computer Science Degree.

Now for what happened.

See that relationship is toxic and I’m not just saying that because I’m her ex and am still in love they always fight, he is VERY clingy, controlling and manipulates her and she told me that she sometimes wants to break up with him.

I highly hate when people do this type of stuff as kids I think you should wait for marriage (that’s because I’m Christian) but she talks about how she loves me but does this and I don’t know if I have the right to be angry and I don’t wanna bring it up but it hurts to know that she would do this to someone...

301,"Me(21M) and my girlfriend (20F) have been in a relationship for so long (like 4 years) that people are looking up to us like we're some perfect couple. But the thing is, we are not perfect. Let me tell you why

From hour highschool days, whenever I did a mistake, she always go physical(just scratching and slapping) and verbal to me because in her defense, it would stop me to making mistakes again. There are times she would punish me by making a fool of myself infront of my friends. It really pains me inside whenever she wants my friends to laugh at me so that I could feel humiliated. I don't want to be upfront with my friends about it because it could be just like a typical ""friend joke"" and it shouldn't be serious. She always say to me that she envy other relationship because their man always gave them gifts or they are there all the time. I do give her gifts but it's always not enough because my money is not enough to satisfy her. She does understand me that I'm not very rich but it sucks to hear her that she feels disappointed that I cant give her anything she wants.

Then college came. We go to different universities and I was hoping that she would be mature enough to understand me emotionally(since we never talk about our feelings because she feels uncomfortable to talk about it, so I let her be). She got more overprotective. She doesn't want me to talk to my girl classmates, doesn't want me to interact with them in social media and she wants all break time(if possible) to be her time and that I should go to her university to spend time with her (which is very okay for me as I understand she wants us to have more time but I don't understand why I need to be there in all of my break hours if I dont have any projects to do). She even wants me to quit meetings(some important) because she says she is more important than those meetings It's got to a point that when we argue, she keeps calling me a ""dumbass"" or ""idiot"". I actually never heard of her admitting or saying sorry for her mistakes because I guess that would bring her pride down.

I have never ever talked to her down and calling her names. I never even made a physical attack on her. I admit I do make mistakes, it sucks that I try my best not to commit another mistake and if I do, she is tired of hearing me saying ""sorry"". It really breaks my heart because I don't want to commit mistakes because it leads us to fight.

302,"It all started when I wanted to leave my hometown for another school. I was mostly bored with that place and wanted to start somewhere new and fresh but just a few weeks before moving my best friend asked me If I would like to live with him and I willingly said why not. Mostly I am an introvert I guess? but I had a couple of friends in Junior high we seemed inseparable. We were a group of six let's just say there were two particular friends 'X' and 'Z' who I believed in blind-foldedly. We used to tease each other and do the stuff middle schoolers do but somehow it got worse at some point I found myself always at the centre of jokes, I was always teased, taken advantage of cause I was the quiet kid but back then I was naive and I really cared for them so I never spoke a word about it and gulped these thoughts down my throat. Friend 'X' used to get in fights a lot and I particularly never liked fights, I even stopped talking to many of my good friends because of him but I regret it now. Cause of these happenings I started to harbour some feelings which I was uncertain of but it was a feeling that didn't like my friend 'X'.     Now, when I moved in with 'X', I started to see what his true nature really was up close. In that particular new city we met a familiar figure let's say 'Y', we used to know him from school. I got close to 'Y' I liked his personality. Back then 'X' liked a girl and since she was particularly in a different state he used to chat with her online and call her awfully lot. 'X' asked out the girl an awful lot of time but the girl never gave a straight yes or no so he always used to cry at my shoulder whenever they had a fight or something happened but it kinda got included in their daily schedule. I was glad that I could be there for him. Once I suggested that maybe you should just get over her and he said yes I should but then every day the same thing would happen again. He never really tried to be better at things he would always just say that he would. Once me and 'Y' tried helping 'X' by talking to the girl but some friend of 'X' he was kind of like the school punk asked 'X' why someone else is using his Instagram and next thing we know 'Y' got a threatening call from the punk guy. 'Y' and I felt betrayed as we were just trying to help and 'X' said that he just gave us his Instagram account to see not to type anything but he came to us for help regarding a situation with the girl and his account so we can talk to her. Cause of 'X' and his daily dramas my academics started to weaken even tho I am a decent student. Things got awkward between us. Once I was coming back from my hometown on a bus and something happened I was looking out the window at the beautiful setting sun between those green fields and I felt something that I never had and made my decision to move out of 'X's place and I ended up in Y's apartment as it was hard to find a new place at that time of year. 'X' misunderstood he thought I left the room cause of 'Y' so he kind of started manifesting hatred towards 'Y'. Now here comes the 'Z', Z was my first friend in school and later we met others. But since 'X' and 'Z' lived close they kind of were partners in almost everything. 'Z' had a troublesome sister and she used to create all kinds of troubles with boys 'X' always used to get involved with their problems and not only his others problems too and fights(actual fights) and then he always used to complain about how he gets screwed up for butting up into another people's business. And 'Y' got tired of 'X's complains and said something bad about 'Z', believe me, I was angry on 'Y' too for that but 'X' said that he would kill him, he even went to the length of cursing every family member of 'Y'. But I know Y only wanted to help I got pissed off about it. But it was just that me, X and Y had so much fun together when things were normal. So I tried to make things alright by calling them to parks and places and Y apologized like a lot of times to 'X' and 'Z' but they never really forgave him. 'Y' was a guy of pride too but he put his pride aside just cause I asked him too just so he could apologize to those two. Things got worse, even I apologized to him but lol I didn't know what I was really apologizing for I was desperate to not lose my friends but nothing worked and I once asked him that I did everything I could have to make things normal but what should I do now? He said that I didn't do anything and I was never there for him when he needed me and that hurt me real bad. Things got worse my childhood friend died and I kind of liked her, she taught me many things one of them was to never take your own life cause she had been through stuff. I became depressed real bad, my academics were falling, I felt like I lost a couple of friends and even felt like that I didn't even know a couple of my friends although I spent years with them, I also lied to my parents for a couple of things world seemed like a strange place somehow and I felt lost not knowing what to do. I tried different hobbies but nothing worked but I got into novels and decided to be a freelance writer with whatever job I will do in future and decided to write a novel which I am working on right now. I use discord awfully lot and have some good friends, they and 'Y' were the only ones that helped get over my depression. One night I just started crying cause I just had a quarrel with a friend I knew online and I cried for hours literally the whole night like all the bottled up feelings just burst out and it helped me get over my depression somehow.   
While I was really in need of help my friend 'X' decided to play fake depression and suicide game. He posted a photo of him with a bandage around his wrist. Me and 'Y' rushed to his apartment as soon as we could but it turned he just wrapped a bandage around his wrist so that the girl he liked would message her and he wasn't even concerned that we ran straight from our apartment to his. We tried talking to him to see if something was wrong with him but all this time I was suffering while I never expressed it. And then I grew distant from 'X' and 'Z', I stopped meeting them and stopped picking up their calls, I don't know but they hurt me in some way real badly. Now, I have a lot less drama and can focus on my studies and doing pretty good I would say.  
But I always doubt myself to this day that whatever I did back then was it right? Was it right leave his apartment? or am I doing right by ignoring them? Was I selfish?

I've dealt with depression my whole life. Tried therapy and antidepressants but nothing has really helped long term. I usually try self care to help knock it down to more reasonable levels but it's not working this time around.

I've tried to deep dive into why, for I've was a pretty independent person before we moved in together, but alas nothing. But maybe that's the depression talking..

305,"I broke up with my ex boyfriend in January, the relationship wasn’t working out and we had a lot of communication issues which was inevitably our downfall.

Recently after the break up he had a “thing” with one of my close girl-friends, who I quickly cut off as well as a lot of my other friends at the time (my mental health wasn’t at its best and I didn’t have the best group of friends as well)

Now about 6 months later my ex is in a relationship with one of the girls I used to be friends with (not the girl he was talking to after we broke up) and every time I hear about it I feel sick to my stomach. I try to avoid the topic with our mutual friends but it still comes up.

I know that if he offered to be in a relationship with me, I would decline because I’ve changed a lot and he isn’t someone I want in my life anymore... so why do I still feel this way? Is there anything I can do to feel better about this? (I also haven’t been in a relationship since my break up)

306,"About a month ago someone pried the USPS key lockbox off the back of the building and broke in but didn't actually steal anything. 

A few days after they changed the locks somebody's bike got stolen out of the bike room. We were all pretty confused how that could have happened.  

So my landlord decides to put a keypad lock on the bike room door for added safety. I put my bike back down there and it had been fine for a few weeks until I go down there this morning and my bike is gone. 

I reached out to my landlord wondering if it could be a maintenance employee or something and she is the only one who knows the code aside from the building tenants. 

There are 10 units in my building and I know basically all of my neighbors to some extent.  Most of them are middle aged affluent types. So now I'm just super confused, one of the tenants here is stealing bikes from the bike room. 

Of course I hope to see somebody with my bike, but I'm doubting that will happen. Would it make sense to knock on doors and ask around? I can't really think of anyway else to try to figure this out.",12Aug2020,1
307,"It’s been under a week since my ex-girlfriend told me she didn’t love me anymore, I’m 27 and she’s 31, she has 2 children from a previous relationship and we have 2 year old. I’ve come to terms with the fact that we aren’t getting back together but I have a suspicion that she was talking to another man before the split. 

When we were together around 2 weeks before the split I called her from work and asked her if she was ok and what she was doing, she said “I’m at the park with a work colleague” I found this strange seeing as how she knows everyone she works with by name, I asked who it was, and again got the “just a friend from work.” I pushed it and just asked who it was, she caved in and said it was some new guy she was training at work with his daughter. I got pissed, not because she was out with a guy but because she really didn’t want to tell me.

Now that it’s all over I feel like I have a right to know if she had been speaking with him, I just want to start moving on but I don’t think I can without knowing the truth.",12Aug2020,1

My brother has just turned 13 and has been considered an ""emo guy"" at his school. Some consider good looking, but what you guys should know is that he has been oing martial arts for more than 5 years now, i dont remember. He isnt a ripped guy, but he has muscle and skill, understnad that this isnt a compliment, its a warning. These past years, it turned into what i consider abuse. I have more knowledge about these things than most very young females. He already had tried multiple times to get my pants off, while i try to get away from him. He tried to make me hump a pillow too. This is literally a  serious problem. Every day he finds a way to complain and hurt me when my parents arent there. Today specifically, i was watching a movieand paused it to get food. He started with his stupid annoying jokes of me killing myslef and kept unpausing it. I got mad, took the remote away from him, and heslammed it into my neck. He then proceeded to punch me in the backof my skull mltiple times, which is now giving me a massive headache. Then, he lied to my parent, and since im an ""annoying lying brat"" to everyone, they grounded both of us, me with the bigger punishments. And since i yelled at him to stop lying about ""just eating cereal"" im even more grounded. I get away with posting this on my laptop because my dad cant control it. Yesterday, i was told to go kill myself and no one cared if i died. All the hundreds of bruises on my weak body are from him. He takes advantage of me every day. Usually, after all of this, he would say it was ""just a joke"". He said this the time he tried to takemy pants off, and all the times hes told me to kill myself. I cant talk to my older sister, (17) because she doesnt care enough. I cant talk to my parents bacause they didnt see it, so its not their problem, its both our faults. I know this sounds stupid, and an adult couldnt care less if i get punched in the skull hundreds of times a day, but PLEASE HELP ME FIND A WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS.

312,"Hi Everyone! So the simple version is that when checking my phone I get stressed out in a way that feels abnormal. I wanted to ask for advice on how to cope with it. 

Longer version...

For years now I feel my phone has been creating more anxiety than I see with other people. I can get a text from a friend and if it isn’t 99% positive I start to feel anxious and attacked. I worry what the persons true intentions are and why the persons text feels so mean...even tho it can be a tone neutral text in many other peoples’ eyes. 

For instance, one of my best friends who has been there for me and nothing but positive our whole relationship messaged me about how a meeting I had went on longer than he expected. My heart immediately started racing and I felt a knot in my stomach. I had to calm myself down and focus on deep breathing and remind myself of the good times we had together. I and reassure myself of our relationship and how he wasn’t trying to attack me personally or send “negative vibes” my way.

But it’s not even just for one to one communication but just holding a phone. I could be having a great day but when I start checking my phone I instantly get into a bad mood. I could be on Pinterest just fooling around and still get anxiety or into bad moods from my phone. 

It’s exacerbated sometimes if I eat something processed or have some weird quality coffee but for years..different vitamins, different environments, different people messaging me, different apps open I feel this anxiety. Even when I start off the day listening to gospel music or just chill Lofi after a few hours I feel anxious like time is moving so fast and I can’t keep up. 

My explanation/added context:

Personally I think it’s from traumatic events in my past. I’ve had crazy experiences with people that all took place via my phone. I had a toxic girlfriend for 2 years Where we would fight for hours on the phone, especially thru text. You’d go through every emotion -especially frustration - but also There was a sense of it being never ending. It was two years of texts back and forth every 5 minutes or so. Often times angry or emotionally charged essays that blew you out the water as you tried to understand how she came to the views she had. She would always accuse of me hurting her in ways that just didn’t make sense. That relationship was about 2 years ago now. 

In addition to that, I’ve had experiences where mentally ill family members have threatened my life over text out of nowhere. And harassed me like a stocker via email, text, etc. all through my phone. Those situations are over now but I can’t help but wonder if they’ve “ruined” phones for me.

I’ve tried avoiding using my phone but my work life (business development) and family life demands it. It’s hard NOT to use a phone nowadays. I’ve gone to therapy related to a lot of these experiences and to my core don’t feel like I spend much energy on these past experiences in the day to day. I’ve spent times just meditating with the phone in my hand and it didn’t do much. I feel best when it’s off or I *think* it’s off. Meanwhile when it’s on I feel *too* exposed as if I can receive the complaints, attacks, or vibes from anyone. Like it invades my space. I’d love to hear if anyone else has had these type of experiences and just advice in general on how to handle this since I have to use my phone for work.",12Aug2020,1

Also apologies for if this is written terribly, since I'm not even quite sure what's going on, let alone how to explain it, lol.

So the last few weeks, maybe a bit more it's hard to tell, days are blending together at this point hah, I've been feeling just- *weirdly* upset all the time. Like I'm used to feeling lonely or just sad in general in the evenings and overnight and I know that it's probably being amplified by the whole lockdown situation regarding COVID-19, but I feel like there's gotta be something more to it. This is cause while normally I'll just feel sad/lonely from like 8pm until I wake up whenever the next day, but now I just feel like I'm empty, I don't enjoy or feel up for things I'd usually love doing, seeing friends, playing games, going for runs, etc. just don't feel the same, and I don't find myself wanting to do any of that as much anymore.  
I've been wanting to meet new people but I know that just isn't reasonable right now, besides a lot of the time when I get the chance to talk to someone new I'm suddenly not feeling the idea anymore, not saying I get a lot of chances, lol.

Anyhow that's sorta been my last two weeks or so, but since like 4 days ago it's abruptly and again without much reason gotten worse, it's kind of fascinating cause it's some super weird feeling in my stomach that I've never really had before, just feels like a pit in my stomach, I can't describe it but it feels heavy yet empty or something I don't know lmao, kinda interesting but overall I am not enjoying it. It's getting more unappealing to get out of bed by the day, not in a cozy kinda *""Damn I just wanna snooze""* way it's more like my body just won't follow through when I want to get up, again, fascinating yes but it isn't fun.

No idea what I'm asking for but it does feel like a weight off me just putting it into text here, I've got no confident ideas as to what's really causing this escalation, my girlfriend was super patient and helpful dealing with my rambling a few days ago, though she's seemed a *little* distant and not too much her usual talkative happy self and got a bit annoyed at me yesterday, justified I can only assume, wasn't expecting it but I understand, so I'm just gonna give her a few days of space, unless she reaches out before then, but I don't wanna be a hassle y'know, in the meantime I've been talking to my dog- and myself, a lot lmao.

I guess that about does it, Idk, any ideas for *anything* to mitigate this would be great cause it feels worse everyday and it's really starting to get to me, so uh- thanks, that's me, be here all night folks.",12Aug2020,1
317,"About 2 years ago I was a manager for a retail department. The demands were unbearable, as it was me running my own department, by myself for over a month.

""Hey we can't accept your vacation time"" but little did she know I already had another job lined up. And I put in my two weeks right there.

Not long after we met a couple years ago we started talking and had a thing between just us for a few months but nothing that was really serious, and eventually we separated bc she just didn’t wanna be tied down n we still remained friends all the way through her most recent relationship, and a few days ago we were hanging out for the first time in a while n at the end got onto the subject of being fwb while she’s single and we both agreed to it. My problem is, I’ve always had a tough time getting over losing her as a partner but over the last few months I’ve been doing a lot better with it. But ever since we started talking more, and especially since we talked things out and became fwb, I’ve felt a much stronger attraction to her, almost like my feelings picked up where they left off with her, even though I know she still doesn’t wanna be tied down, that’s why she’s single again.

First and foremost, let me know it this is in the wrong subreddit, I didn’t know where else to post this.

I’m having huge problems finding a new hobby, interest or passion. A very Important fact to know about me is that for almost my whole life I used to be a (pro-)athlete. I was very good, best in my country and very successful internationally. But as I got older I realized I can’t really earn money with it and I had to focus on my education and a job. I was 22 yo when I quit and now I’m 23 yo. Obviously this left a huge gap in my life because I trained every day for several hours.

Now I’m desperately trying to find something to dig my head into and have the same passion for as I used to have for my sport. But there Is one major problem and I don’t know how to solve this. Since I’m very competitive, everything I try to pick up in my head I want to do it on a high level. Even if I just want to enjoy watching sports I get this weird feeling of regret that I haven’t chosen this sport so I could be that successful 23 yo athlete…and even weird things like Formula 1. I was never interested in it so far. But I’ve started watching this Netflix series about F1 and I can’t rly enjoy it because I almost get mad that I’m not part of it but just some lazy dude that is watching it on his couch and eating snacks. I feel like its very hard to explain what I mean but hopefully you get what I mean. And I hope you can give me some advice so I don’t feel miserably anymore.",12Aug2020,1

I also don’t agree with many Muslim practices. While Zakah (giving 2.5% of your earning to the needy) is something that seems reasonable, other things just don’t. 

Ramadan sucks. I get hungry quick so the long fasting hours don’t cut it. 

Salat is ass. I never actually pray. I just pretend. 

Also, Muslims don’t like you fucking cursing. If you couldn’t tell, that isn’t something I agree with. Bullshit. 

I don’t like wearing the long ass covering up clothes that Muslims like. I don’t like the ducking hijab. I actually ditch these as often as possible, even if it does sometimes result in me getting in trouble. 

All I want it to be normal. To go out with friends and wear crop tops and not cover my hair. I want o be able to fucking curse whenever I god damn feel like it. I don’t want to pray, I don’t want to do Ramadan.

What should I do here because my family will most likely hate me when I do reveal this to them.",12Aug2020,1
331,"Hi. So when I was about 14 my sister her boyfriend and their friends threw a party at our house while my mom was gone. Everyone left, my sister passed out, and I went into my moms room to watch tv. My sisters boyfriend went into my moms room and started talking to me and kind of flirting. He then started to kiss me and I kissed back. We kissed for probably 15 seconds, then I told him to stop as he was trying to touch me other places. I told him to get out. I felt horrible and didn't know what to do. He texted me the next day and said "" I had a lot of fun last night"" I was like ""wtf don't text me?"". We then never really spoke of it and neither of us told my sister. They are still together 8 years later and have a child, my nephew. I think about this almost everyday. Im shaking even thinking and typing it :( I feel horrible, I feel like everything bad that happens to me in relationships is what I deserve because I did that. I should have told her, but I didn't want her to be sad. I also don't want a weird relationship with her. I am just haunted by it everyday and don't know how to cope with it. I get constantly cheated on and treated like shit and I just stay with them because I feel like its what I deserve. I never really told people this but its honestly just really getting to me.

337,"Hi Reddit, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

English is not my mother tongue so please excuse my mistakes, also I'm writing this on my cell phone.

To keep it (hopefully) short:

I have been with my now Ex almost 5 years. We are separated vor 1,5 years now but there is something still bugging me and I'm still processing everything that happened during our relationship.

I once found several files on his hard drive, each having a woman's name on it, including me. I didn't open them all, obviously mine and one or two others. One of them was an Ex that has been his first relationship, dating back to when they both were around 14 years old. 
I can't recall the other girls, one or two of them I actually knew from school. I don't remember exactly what was shown, but at least the girls were naked and maybe even showing both of them having sex. 
When we broke up, I made him delete the pictures he had of me, but I don't know if he may have any copies or if he could get those delete ones back somehow.

My question now is if it is illegal for him to keep said pictures? Should I get involved and inform authorities? 

I don't think he would post them somewhere, I guess he keeps them as trophies and to fap to them.",12Aug2020,1

Everyone I knew has told me I'm toxic and manipulative and then dropped me, which was true. At the time that happened I really was, but I'm trying to be better and fix everything wrong with myself. I don't know how to begin trying to forgive myself or if I even deserve it. What do I do?",12Aug2020,1

I am mostly doing all the work such as watching the CCTV replying to emails granting access and attending meetings during my day shift for 12 hours and I don't have time for lunch I eat out the locker where I put my bag in. My co worker just sits in reception gives people masks and has time for lunch we both do 2 patrols each during the day. During the night shift because we only need 1 person to watch the CCTV I work from 7pm till 1am while he does 3 patrols after his patrols which last about 25 minutes he rests in the lounge area. Once he has completed all his patrols we switch so he then watches the CCTV from 1am till 6:30am and I make sure to do my 3 patrols from 1am till 6:30 am I have been working with him since may 2020 during which he sleeps while he is supposed to watch the CCTV in the night shift I caught him nearly everyday with his eyes closed and sleeping he has even done this while he is in reception. He has a car and lives 5 minutes away from the workplace. I have to take 2 buses which takes 1 hour to get to my workplace. Recently he asked me if I could if I could change our night shift patrols so he could rest in the lounge area from 11pm till 5am he told me it was not fair that he does all the hard work what should my response be ? He has already be caught sleeping and reported to my manager by another employee. He has difficulty using computers which means I have to do anything computer based.

343,"my boyfriend (now ex) has been dealing with substance abuse problems for a year or two. When we met and got to know eachother he hid it really well to the point I thought he was clean. he would drink still, but was off of coke. 

fast forward to 7 months into our relationship he started doing coke again. me &amp; his family found out. I supported him &amp; his family did as well and we got him in a rehab program. things were very rocky with us and I couldn’t trust him because he had been lying to me about his use for months. I had no idea and he would be really mean to me when he was coked out and drunk. I stayed with him thru his rehabilitation process but I could feel my mental health deteriorating so I broke up with him. I told him of course I care about him but I need to put myself first right now. 

so it’s been two days since we broke up &amp; I decided to go out with my friend. I walk into the bar and he was sitting there with his friend he would always do coke with. he saw me put his head down and walked out of the bar without saying anything. I went up to the friend he was with and basically said this: 

“ you are literally one of the shittiest people on earth you know your “friend” is trying to get sober and you take him out drinking? how fucking stupid are you and I know you were one of the people who would do Coke with him behind my back he was literally in rehab you are literally like one of the most selfish people I’ve ever met you obviously only care about yourself and not the well-being of your friends. Yes we broke up I tried to help him as much as I could and support him in his journey to be sober but obviously you can’t do the same you’re not his friend you’re one of the people who are bringing him down karma is a bitch and she’s gonna bite you in your ass when you least expect it.” 

he tried to blame it all on me for breaking up with him and said I was a toxic bitch

I decided to study at the library today, to do my lectures and start the readings for an assignment. I told my sister where I was, and she said:

&gt;No, come home. You're not allowed to go to the library.

They believe that when I am going to the library to study, I am not actually studying. They believe I am going there to read fictional books, and waste time. They think this, because I have failed two units. Unfortunately, I have failed one of those units three times now.

They say I can study at home, but not really. I have to study on the dining table, with everything going on around the house. They have also commented on my online classes:

&gt;Why do you talk so much during lectures? When is this class finishing?

I came home, and my sister and my Mum made a big deal about me going out. 

My sister has gone out to dinner with her boyfriend while my Mum was asleep. My brother has gone all the way out to the coast with friends without announcing it... I have no friends, I have a broken heart, AND I am not allowed to study.

346,"She said she found it in her bedroom closet, which I find hard to believe, although she's been doing a lot of renovation upstairs so I guess it could have ended up in there.

I don't use it regularly to be honest, but it took me months of hard work to save up for it while working part time and going to college full-time. It had years of invaluable schoolwork on it that I spent a lot of blood, sweat and tears on.

My brother didn't know it was mine, and he said he 'flashed' the operating system and everything is gone--not sure what that means tbh. Anyway I'm trying not to hold it against him. I told him that he should have known to ask me before just taking a random laptop that was given to him by my mother. Now he has a ton of his work projects on there and he uses it daily, so I'm happy he's making good use of it.

My mom gave me all kinds of excuses as to why she shouldn't have to pay for it (e.g. I live with her, the laptop hasn't been touched in a few months etc). I'm probably forever in her debt for giving me a roof over my head while I went to college, but at the end of the day I'm really hurt about this situation.

I'm hurt that my brother feels guilty about having the laptop. I'm hurt that my mom would give my property away and try to justify it. I'm hurt that all of my schoolwork is has been lost (I know I know, always back up your important files). I'm hurt that I have to ask my mother for money when I know she doesn't have a lot of room in her budget.

So I text her, because talking to her in class would have not been a good idea, my friends always screamed/cursed at me for doing so, throwing stuff in her direction etc.. So we text and we dont really talk. I develeope somewhat a crush for her. Now mind you I was not very experienced with the texting game and overall the tricks she was playin on me. It was obvious that to an extend I fell for her.

Fast forward 1 year, I learned a lot abt her and it had me cry few nights... I had decided to shoot my shot, because I was damaging myself by having feelings for her, but she never stayed even a week without a boyfriend, there was thaf. She broke up with her at the time bf and I decided to try, but I didnt want to be the bastard that tries to go after a girl while she is feeling like shit for her past relationship. So  I didnt, turns out someone else did. I left it at that, decided I had enough of this shit and regained some of my self-respect back.

This brings us to now  1 year later. There has been a bit of texting, which I always make sure to end or cut off. I sometimes fantasize about her.. Or check her social media...

How do I finally get rid of her from my head?
What do I do to finally get over her and never think about her ever again?

354,"I have been dating my now boyfriend for around 14 months and we’ve always gotten along. I’ve always felt like we were a peculiar couple, always so close and intimate but we don’t have sex? Maybe that has something to do with out sexualities. But on a different note, we’ve been distant from each other for about almost 6 months now due to having almost utterly and completely different schedules. We had class at the same times so we saw each other during our lunch and before we got there, so those 30 minutes were always fitted in somewhere. So that was good. But before this point, we kind of spent every other breathing moment with each other since we lived in our parents houses (we’re really close neighbors). The 6 months between then and now was a huge shock after all this time and we’ve slowly just been respecting each other’s existence and asking if the other is doing fine or not. This all came about with covid-19 and that schedule change and I’d never ever want to hurt his grandma or family with the virus. 
   Anyways, I just wanted to share that we’ve become distant and I regularly complain that we can’t see each other because it genuinely frustrated me. It filled me enormous guilt to ask for a break because I needed time for myself to get my shit together for once. I wanted to be better for him, but I think he’s taking it as something different. I can’t be too sure. I just never want to hurt him and I feel so greedy for what I said since I’m usually that person to forgive and forget.
I feel like I’ve made a huge mistake more than anything.

363,"Backstory:
March 1st, we let this man (21) lets say Ryan, into our home. My boyfriend and I (we are younger than him, 20 &amp; 19)at the time have a 1b1b apartment, and it's a decent place. We upkeep it, have rules in place, and we pay 1.3k a month for this place. 

Ryan has a lot of problems. For starters, his dad is crazy; like, one day he pointed a shotgun at Ryan, and tried to kill him. His dad also poured thousands and thousands of dollars into a failing business where he hired four people and paid none of then. Of these four people are say - his son Ryan, J, D, and Z. They become great friends. They worked for 6 months at this project, 12 hours a day, all labor, and a $100 weekly allowance for food between the four of them. That's it. They finally tire out, everyone  decides one day to get up and leave this terrible situation.  Ryan, at this point,  has no safe place. No home. No money. Nothing. So I hear from a friend that Ryan needs help. 

So, that's where we begin, and we invite Ryan into our home. We lay down that he is going to be paying a third of the rent, that he will get a job,  and that he will be doing some chores around the place. Ryan accepts the offer and promises he'll be a ghost and stay out of our hair.  He promises to pay us back, and he wont be a hassle, and he starts to sob. I tell him to take it easy, as hes been through a lot.

Fast forward a couple months, Ryan is doing alright now.  Hes past most of his PTSD, and he's still highly depressive. We give him daily pep talks, we try to get him back on his feet. We ask him to try his best to be productive and to try to get rid of some of his addictions. Because now he's smoking weed on the daily, he's drinking every other day, sits around and vidya games,  and another rather, private issue. Problems start arising here. 

Soon enough, Ryan starts skipping work. Starts getting crossed quite frequently.  Becomes extremely lazy, starts giving us an attitude when we ask him to do simple shores. He ends up not being able to pick up after himself 75% of the time. He doesnt return laundry,  he doesnt told his clothes, doesnt make his bed, etc. He ashes his j's into our couch. We in return continue to be EXTREMELY patient, knowing how difficult the struggles of depression can be ourselves and we start trying to be assertive. He then brings in a cat that he used to own, and the cat has fleas. 

We ask if he can pay for the treatment and help out with it, as it was because of his cat that caused the infestation. My boyfriend and I end up shaving the cat, getting it treated, and treated our own cats. It took three more months to do this. He owed us over $120 for this. 

We're almost at the end hold on. So recently, it's a new month. He tells us his family is struggling so hes giving them some money, and we say that fine. We ask if he can pay rent and he says sure he can. He'll help pay with his next paycheck.  Okay. Well he goes to work and he gets sent home sick.His boss said hes showing symptoms of COVID-19. Okay, cool. Let's all quarantine I suppose. He gets his next paycheck tomorrow and he said he will get it to us then. He said he feels fine the next day, and he just had a headache. The same day he says hes going to go camping. Ok? He said he was going with his friend G. Ok. Well, what did do was he went and camped with friends A, B, C, D and E at the same time. He comes home in a panick, with  his friend D.  Says he has to leave.  Ryan quickly packs up his stuff and said he was being chased by some gang that his dad got involved with, and he has to leave immediately. He tells us that even we could be in danger and he doesn't want that for us. (Yes I know, it sounds crazy,  but Ryan's  dad is one TERRIBLE  business man and fucks with the wrong people.), I ask for Ryan to please help us put some money towards a new couch and towards the fleas when he can, because we personally need that money at this point. Ryan agrees, a little quietly, and that's when Friend D gets involved and says that Ryan personally doesnt owe us shit. My boyfriend gets pissed off at this and starts listing off everything we did for him in the last five months. Friend D backs down, the room settles down and we come to terms. I see that they're packing some of our stuff in the haste and I know we will be able to sort through that later once it's all over. I'm mostly unconcerned. Ryan and D start to get the cat, and they force the cat into the kennel. The cat is already stressed due to the high energy in the room and refuses. Then scratches up Ryan and D and obviously isnt very happy. The cat also suffers from coughing fits quite frequently and ends up having a severe one during this chaos. They continue to try to shove the cat into the kennel. But they cant.
 
I intervene and calm the cat down and console her.  I help her with her coughing fit, get her some food and catnip to hopefully calm her down.  I pick her up and finally get her into the kennel, qnd she freaks out inside. I have no control though at this point. It's Ryans cat.

We tell Ryan that we're sorry he has to go through this and that we wish him well. We reiterate how we need the money and it would be great if he had it now and he can give it to us before he leaves for good. He says sure he can. We hug goodbye and we seem to be on good terms. He goes to his moms house.


Well here's where I'm confused.

They blocked us after that. All of his friends. I tried to reach out, and I try to contact someone that can get ahold of Ryan. No one. I get blocked.  No one answers. Nothing. 
I cant get a hold of him,  and hes not answering to me. Hes blocking me. 
Hes got our stuff, he owes us money, and he wasted our time. I don't know how to get any of that back, I dont know why he did it. I feel so utterly fucking betrayed right now. He got out of doing everything. We cant press charges. Theres nothing. I feel so defeated. So backstabbed for this.  We gave him so much time and energy. We helped him as much as we could. We tried so hard to be patient. I dont feel like we were wrong for anything we did. I dont even know what happened?? I just need advice man, anything",12Aug2020,1
364,So the title basically says it all and it only started doing this 2 hours ago and I can't afford to get it fixed if it needs to be fixed by computer person but my brother was a IT person for years so he might be able to fix it but I wanna know it there's an easy fix. I tried to just see if it was stuck but it did nothing,12Aug2020,1
365,"So I admit I'm privileged. I never had to work to earn money, always had my school tuition paid for, spend an above average amount on materialistic things, and have an expensive hobby (photography and art). Even though I never worked, I've spent years volunteering and building skills that landed me an acceptance in a competitive program which has a high employment rate upon graduation. My success is largely made possible due to my family's financial support; I completely own up to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend on the other hand is very frugal and had many financial hardships in the past and has worked for a large majority of his life. I really admire that and I find it awkward that I can never relate to the jokes he makes about his student loans, beat up car, and uncertain career path. Even at the very beginning of our relationship, I started downplaying my financial situation and tried very hard to never mention money or ""flex."" I would consciously wear the same clothes again and again even though my closet is unique enough to wear a different outfit every day. Yes, I have a slight shopping addiction (but I know my limit!) and my mom and I frequently trade clothes. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I kept slipping up and now it's just really awkward and I think it's creating a divide between us. I picked him up once on a date in a new car that was gifted to me as a graduation gift, but I pretended it's a shared family car. I understand this is a big fat lie, but what sort of 20 year old has her own new car? When I introduced him to my parents, I didn't realize they picked an expensive 5 star restaurant to meet him at. For his birthday, we went shopping for some new gym shoes and when I went to pay, I paid $200 in cash. He was really shocked when I pulled out all these bills and went like ""I've never seen this much cash in my life"" and I had no idea how to respond to that. Then another time, we were planning a trip with friends and 1 friend paid for our all accommodations and was like, just etransfer me $140. I sent it over asap and the friend decided to troll me by saying, ""WAIT YOU JUST ETRANSFERRED ME $1400.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I freaked the fuck out but he quickly said it was a joke. My boyfriend saw the messages and joked back saying ""haha I wish I had at least that amount in my bank account."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my biggest fear is him thinking I'm just a spoiled rich girl when I'd like to think I'm not. But at the same time I've had everything fall into place in my life so far. Maybe I am spoiled and I'm just in denial. My boyfriend and I also agreed to pay for things 50/50 and that has worked out really well so far. I sometimes wonder if he resents me for hiding my family's wealth and wants more of a 60/40 thing instead - at least until he has paid off his student loans. Even if he thinks that, he has always been very loyal to the 50/50 rule and has always been generous with his time and affection. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess some questions I have are:

&amp;#x200B;

How can I be tactful when I approach the topic, if at all?

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things I should keep in mind from his perspective?

&amp;#x200B;

How can I even approach the topic without sounding fucking crazy?

&amp;#x200B;

Other than finances, we are super super open and have really good communication. I guess this is just an awkward topic for the both of us.",12Aug2020,1

He asked me out on a date but obviously I had to decide till Covid is over. So anyway, I mentioned to my mom I met a boy on bumble that I like and I told her he goes to my school and also some facts about him and she went crazy. 
She got mad that I gave him my Snapchat and that I talk to him. And ik he’s a real person btw bc I ft him. She threatened to take my phone away and she’s going to make me live w my dad.

She told me to stop talking to him but I don’t want to bc I know there’s something there and I’m really into him. I also told him I can’t go out till covid is over and he’s okay w just texting and stuff like that. I told my dad the situation and he’s not even mad!

I'd someone asks me the simple question:
Hey, where're you from?

This question just destroys my thinking ability.
On one hand I have the country I was born in(Nationality) and maybe lived there for a month.

Then I moved to country A and picked up their culture and language. I lived here for 9 to 10 years. Cool I can just tell people where I lived the longest..right?

We move again. Country B lived here for about 6 years and I'm like this is my new home..yay. Ima just say I'm from here now.

Then we move to country C. 2 years pass by and I am always conflicted on how to define where I am from.
If I do the country I am legally a citizen of..I get the:
I would have never guessed you're from here!

Country A is kinda controversial(Middle East) now so I don't like taking it's name.

Now everytime someone asks me where're you from:
My mind just goes blank, because I can't come up with a short answer.

I have some friends who know the long version so they understand.

My question is where do I belong. The country where I am a citizen. The country where I lived the longest or the country where I lived the second longest.

Thank you for reading this. I would also like to know if you ever dealt with this type of thing. I'm 18 btw.",12Aug2020,1

My boyfriend and his female friend used to like each other, he pursued her for a while before she turned him down and they stopped talking.

Him and I start dating, and not long after, she is back in the picture. She is still interested in him and he has told me this.

I have been harassed anonymously online and I don't think it is anyone else but her, but he always defends her and says it isn't her. He's always on her side. I'm really annoyed about this, and about the fact that they are still friends even though he knows she still likes him.

I started to develop a crush on him, even though he is in the opposite side of the world. Anywho, a few days ago he started to act really immature, rude, and demanding. I didn't like it but I still had a crush on him. But he isn't my crush now which is good, but today I decided to just stop being his friend. He was acting very rude to my other friends, so I decided that was enough and ended the friendship. I blocked him, and unfriended him because I didn't want to see him again. But, I really miss him.

So, my mom asks if she can tell this story, and I clearly say, ""No. Absolutely not. I'm not ok with you telling that story."" Well, she proceeds to tell the story, putting me in the most degrading, horrible light possible.

*(Basically, when I was 16, I tried taking home 3 baby mice from Minnesota. Made it 7 hours before my aunt called another aunt who was with us on the trip. 7 hours later, my mom and my aunt were straight up attacking me for not being upset and crying for being caught with the mice. So, super toxic, terrible people.)*

Anyhow, my mom proceeds to tell the story, completely disregarding that I clearly said no (everybody in the room heard me say no), painting me in the worst light possible, and I know it was not a fun experience for her. She then proceeds to say that she tells her students that story all the time and later backpedals to say she only told one class.

What can I do to get my mom to actually listen to me and not publicly humiliate and degrade me and disregard me like this?

My parents are amazing in every aspect, I've been very successful in school for as long as I can remember. I notice that the only time my emotions are consistent is when I'm around my extremely judgmental sister (she just moved out, and our relationship has gotten MUCH better recently), i would always be upset in some sort of way. However, I am always in a good state of mood when I listen to music and talk to my friends. Because of this I'm ALWAYS listening to music. When it comes to talking to friends, I'm not extremely social, but I truly feel at peace with my self when I talk to them. I said I don't know about my future, but I do have an idea.

Stuff like YouTube and different artists have been my biggest inspirations aside from my parents in my life, and I know want to influence others. I wouldn't consider myself a nervous person, but when I think about this stuff I get extremely nervous and have this complex that there is no chance for me to do what I want, if that is even what I want. I get deep in my thoughts a lot. Its just who I am. This doesn't fell like depression or anything, as I typically can be happy from day to night for days on end, and my 'pain' isn't so much so 'pain'. Maybe I just need to get stuff off my chest.

381,"I'm gonna start off by saying that dedication isn't a problem. If I have a steady program to follow, I'll dedicate weeks of time to it until I feel comfortable changing said schedule.

The real issue stems from the fact that I am currently a junior in high class, am not continuing on to take the Spanish III class offered at my school due to a conflicting class schedule, and the fact that Italian and Spanish is are so hard to learn simultaneously because they're so close together. And there's also the fact of the matter that Duolingo is actually kind of a shit teacher.

When I was 13, I started trying to learn Italian by myself on Duolingo. I was so excited, was dedicated, and got decently far while making sure to take breaks and study up to make sure I wouldn't forget everything as soon as I moved onto a new topic. What I didn't know about languages at the time was that knowing the infinitive tense of a verb (may come back and correct this if I find that infinitive tense isn't the right term) is actually kind of important. I don't know about now, but it sure did not teach you that tense back then. Then comes how Duolingo can't explain concepts worth shit unless you already have some experience in learning a language, know what to look for, etc.

Then I'd often find myself searching for hours for the right concept and a better explanation. I believe this was before Duolingo came out with the ""lightbulb"" feature where it has charts. I certainly don't remember having those.

Then I got into high school and started learning Spanish. Now, despite my previous struggles with Italian and Duolingo, my self-taught experience made learning Spanish really easy for me. Because I fought to make sure I understood all of what I was seeing when studying Italian, Spanish was easy for me to pick up, and the added help of having a physical teacher didn't hurt. Then I was learning both at the same time and sometimes having a hard time discerning one language from the other.

Now, I know how to learn a language the best way for me. This definitely includes being taught the infinitive tense of every verb before learning how to conjugate it properly. A list of irregulars would also be appreciated. I guess now I'm asking: what do you think would be the best course of action for this? Has Duolingo changed to cover the issues I mentioned? I've checked back a few times to no avail so far.

Any help or recommendations would be highly appreciated!",12Aug2020,1
382,"I'm going to try my best to summarize this.

My little brother has endured a sh\*tshow of a life, on top of having special needs. Our family always thought he might be on the spectrum, but psychologists and therapists have just said he has sensory processing issues. Anyhow, my stepdad (his bio dad) has been a crack/heroin addict on and off our whole lives until deciding to finally quit hard drugs \~4 years ago. My brother still doesn't know why we were always moving and hiding, or why my mom and stepdad always got back together.

He was a senior in high school this year, at a special needs high school. He's the most purely kind boy I've ever known and I'll always protect him, just like when we were kids. 

When I was a senior in HS, my mom took me on a trip to Sedona, AZ and my brother requested that him and my mom take the same trip (which was supposed to happen this past May). COVID happened and they cancelled the trip. He missed out on a formal HS graduation, normal graduation party, and the senior trip that he very much deserved. He's only travelled out of our state twice his whole life to visit family.

Is it selfish to try and raise money to surprise him for an eventual senior trip, with everything going on right now? In mid-September, 3 tickets (for him, my mom &amp; I) would be $607 round-trip from our state to AZ. I want my brother to experience travel and celebration as he deserves it, and Sedona would be perfect because we could explore trails and social distance responsibly.

The guilt is real because I know many people and organizations need the extra money right now. But my brother is so worth it, I dunno how to feel other than wanting him to experience a normal senior year.",12Aug2020,1

On discord a group of our friends always tried to prank each other (saying we can't hear each other on the voice chat) then one time we said to our friend that we couldn't hear him in the voice chat (even though we could) and he believed us so we wanted to see how far the prank would go until he caught on and realised. It went on for a week. We told him maybe 5 times in total we couldn't hear him to the point he uninstalled discord and contacted discord.

Another guy who is in the discord but isn't in our friend group (just a friend of a friend) knew we were pranking and called us out. He told our friend he was being pranked, called us genuinely cruel and bullies. He said if it was him he wouldn't have anything to do with us.

For the longest time I thought what I was doing was preserving our relationship but in reality I was straying it away. At the beginnings of our relationship we were extremely happy. 

Everything was great, but I started going through a terrible depressive state. I didn’t realize at the time but that affected everything: my feelings, my satisfactions, everything. I started using him as my emotional crutch. Many times I made him feel like he’s not enough. A long time went by and he told me how much the past had hurt him. I completely understood. Deep down I knew what I was doing was wrong but I for some reason continued acting so manipulative and controlling. 

I regretted that so much, especially knowing that at one point everything was SO GREAT, but it fizzled out over time because I was so close-minded. I apologized to him and he accepted. We realized that we both have internal issues that need solving and decided to find our own individual therapists. We brought up the possibility of a break but my boyfriend felt no more from the relationship. He said he hasn’t felt anything out of it for so long, and although he misses the beginnings, it probably is best to separate. I don’t blame him; a long time went by before I became aware and ACCEPTED my wrongdoings. I still feel super strong feelings for him, but here was our decision:

We have a bond that no one else has. We are BEST FRIENDS. We are so close, closer than we’ve ever been with anyone. Ultimately, we decided to break up, but remain best friends. We also decided to keep our sexual relationship, which includes cuddling and holding hands. Essentially, we changed almost nothing of our relationship, but we reassured our feelings that we’ve had deep down. Even me, I felt at many times that breaking up would be the best decision for us, but I had a fear of losing him overall, which is why we feel comfortable with our decision because we still share the exact same bond as before but it’s just simply not romantic. I just don’t know if it’s a bad decision to come to. Part of me says, If we are both fine with being like this, then what’s the issue? We also acknowledged the fact that if we were to get back together in a relationship, then so be it. If it’s bound to happen it will. We aren’t opposed to that at all. 

I like to say that we fell in love in the wrong time. The environment we were in and mental state I was in, just simply didn’t allow us to build our relationship. Only time will tell what the future will bring us, but what is for sure is that we are there for each other, we support each other, and we will never break this amazing bond we have.",12Aug2020,1

There is ***NOTHING*** wrong with her memory, she just doesn't give enough of a shit to actually hear my answer and definitely cannot be bothered to remember anything I ever say.

For example, back in November, she asked if I had health insurance because I just had to switch insurances. I told her several times that I did have insurance and even what type of insurance. Well, since then, she's asked multiple times if I had health insurance. About 2 weeks ago, she asked again, and honestly, I'm just sick of being stuck in her question loops, so I simply stated ""I've answered this numerous times before."" Not trying to get an attitude, just ""the sky is blue, I've answered this a bunch before."" She asked again, and I said ""do you remember what I said the last time you asked?"" She just stared at me for about 10 seconds, kinda pissed off, then finally said ""you said you had XXXXX insurance."" She'll just ask the same questions so she doesn't have to remember what I said.

I'm just at the point where I ***will not*** answer a question more than once. When she asks a second time, I just flatly respond with ""I've already given you an answer/I've already answered this.""

She's also the type of person who, when I mention a friend of mine, she'll ask ""Where do they live (street address), what college did they go to, what degree did they get, what job do they have?"" and when I tell her I either don't know, or that's personal information and I have no idea how private they want to be, she gets mad at me and stalks them in Facebook and says ""I found all this info, they're not that private!!!""

399,"Hello, this is a throwaway account.

As a background, i am a software engineer and i started working at this new company at the beginning of the whole covid 19 problem and the lockdown. I faced some issues at the beginning with learning everything since this is my first job in this field but i think that I'm good now and I'm learning at a fast pace. I consider myself to be good at what i do, I'm not the best but i believe that with time i can get there. 

Last week, an explosion hit beirut (where i live), thankfully i didn't get hurt and everyone i know is safe, but mentally i haven't been there.

I've suffered from anxiety and a mild depression before but it was manageable. But ever since the explosion, I've been anxious and all i want to do is stay in bed all day. I've lost my motivation to work. I'm worried about losing my job because i really need it but at the same time i have barely done anything since last week. I took a few days off in order to rest but that didn't help.

401,"I know, this might sound weird and honestly, it is not a huge problem to me but I have this thing that I can only eat much troughout the day (like small things every few hours) but not 3 Meals a day or I will be full and feel really bad.

Usually when I go out to eat at a Restaurant and when the waiter brings me the food I already know that the portion is too much but I mean what can I do about it? 
I am 19 (f) and not thinn at all, also not fat, rather average but I can only order children sized portions it it is not an all-you-can-eat-Restaurant. It is kind of depressing when I am out eating with friends and I have to wait for everyone else to finish eating because I can only eat half of what they served me (lets say we eat dinner, that means I have to skip lunch so that I can fit most of the Restaurants dinner inside me)

And If I manage to force it all in, I will be so tired and full for the rest of the evening.

and sometimes, if I really just eat how much I want without being full, within 2 hours after that I am hungry again... what is up with that?

I sometimes say things which I regret saying or that I realize where expressed wrongly or honestly just something that is not valid anymore at the moment. This happens on WhatsApp and Instagram mainly and a lot of people seem to be annoyed by it. I really don't think there's something wrong in deleting a message or an IG story, I'm a human being, I have my insecurities and I make mistakes, when I do I realize that and try to correct myself If I can. I'll put some examples down here to help understand what goes on.

\- I'm planning to see a friend a random day of the week and I text them with the place and time of when to meet, later that day my plans change and if they've haven't seen the message yet I delete it and simply tell them the final time and place without too much back and forth - my friend laughs and gets annoyed at me deleting some messages and tells me straight off the bat that it's not normal to do it.

\-I post an IG story, without much thinking maybe, a friend makes fun of it (this particular friend likes to make fun of his friends/ I tend to take things personally so sometimes it bugs me but I think really he's just making fun of his friends actions and not the people per se) and I realize it was kinda stupid and I didn't think about it too much before posting it. I realize it's stupid, I don't want people to associate me with stupid, I could've kept t myself so I delete it - this happened many times and when I do this friend goes like this ""I KNEW IT!! I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DELETE IT!!"" as if was something strange anyways he gets annoyed, laughs when I do it too

\-This other time my gf told me to not delete my messages but she does it all the time and she actually defends me when I do it 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it's just these two friends from the example above who always mention it (might be because they're closer to me so they feel like they can tell me) anyways again making mistakes is normal, maybe I do it more than others, I try very hard to work on my insecurities through therapy and self-help, maybe that is the reason I do it more than others and it's ok a lot of people maybe just don't get that but I really don't see why they mention it so often. Am I doing something wrong? Should I just think harder before I post/say something to avoid that? Is it really something so weird?

404,"I have this issue with trying to do everything perfectly.

Even if i don't want to do it, i want to do it perfectly, which results in me putting both the things i want to do *and* the things i don't want to do off because i either feel like i don't have time to do them as perfectly as i wish, or i don't trust myself to be able to, or for the things i don't want to do: i simply don't want to put in the effort that i feel like i MUST put.

The problem is, i kinda lost the ability to do things ""just good enough"", or rather i can't see the line that i can reach and be ""finished"" per say.

If i do something and i feel like it can be better, i want to make it better or it feels like i slacked off, or didn't put in the effort i could've, so if it turns out sub par i blame myself for knowingly not putting in enough effort.

For example, let's say i have a digital sketch of a drawing and i want to line it.

Internally, i want all the lines to be as smooth as possible, but technically i need more practice to be able to do it well and quickly.

But i also know that if i put enough time into THIS piece, i can make it look smooth enough to fit my standards.

So if it doesn't look super nice and smooth, I'll think im a slacker and a failure, but if im aiming to make it look nice and smooth, I'll put it off and procrastinate forever.

Basically, i want to ""do my best"" while at the same time not spending so much time trying to ""perfect"" it. I literally can't seem to find a balance.

And it doesn't even end there. I can finish the lineart, then follow a colouring tutorial. At first i struggle with it and if i do it many times I'll eventually get it, so i should just try it on this drawing, then move on to the next drawing where i can try again.

....OR if i just keep doing it over and over again on the same drawing, i can eventually get it to look nice, if i just focus hard enough, if i just do it perfectly stroke by stroke.

But, again, that probably means I'll put it off forever, only getting more and more intimidated by the fact that if i go back to it, i HAVE to do it as best as i muster, and i might not be able to deliver this time, because maybe i had an off-day, or i forgot how i did it last time, etc etc.

So again, i can't find a balance. I want to be able to do things well enough and improve each time without carrying the weight of ""it has to be perfect"" on my shoulders.

How do i do that? Where can i find the line of ""good enough"" without always feeling like ""i could have done more, if i just tried""?

I fear not being able to properly assess my skills because i always stopped at ""good enough"". Going back to an ""art"" example, i may one day be good enough to draw the Mona Lisa, but because i always stop at ""good enough with just a little bit of improvement"" i might never be able to see that, because i didn't put in enough effort.

I don't know, maybe it's silly. But does anyone have any advice?",12Aug2020,1
405,"Ok, I must say this is hard for me. I am not used to opening myself in this sort of spaces. I have watched all these Reddit videos and I decided to try...Right now I am insomniac and anonymous. 
I (32F) feel I haven’t felt love in my life. To sum things a little: I come from a broken home, dad was an alcoholic and left home when I was 3 (told mom wasn’t married), mom with antisocial personality disorder submitted me to physical, psychological and sexual abuse. Dad came back just in time for mom to get pregnant. They had my brother, I practically look after him the first years of his life. I was just 10. Witnessed abuse between them and my home finally broke when I was 17. Now, I am studying abroad (master’s in Education), I have just called off my engagement (less than a month ago) because I found out my fiancé had a b-side life and started right when I packed my bags. We had our bad episodes as well. 

You’ll see, this is not me portraying myself as a victim. I present to you what it seems to be my background (getting used to handling matters as research). It’s been hard for me. I am an empathic person. Used to work as a teacher for children and adults back home. I only have a few friends (I spent all my 20s working 12 hours a day to support my family-brother and mom), I have made friends here but it’s not the same. 

I feel like it’s hard for people to commit to friendship with love, support and sacrifice. I also feel my closest relatives and the person I was going to marry didn’t/don’t love me. I wonder why. 

I have dealt with OCD, depression and generalized anxiety my whole life. Have suicidal thoughts often thinking “I wasn’t made to be loved”. 

I know I am not the greatest: I have self-esteem issues that probably tire people, I feel insecure at times. I have surrendered. Sometimes, I feel sparks of self-appreciation after therapy nevertheless in nights like these, I can’t help but to feel hopeless. 

Do you think I’ll get that chance in life?

406,"I feel like I deal with failure (I die in a game, I botch dinner, I can't get code to do what I want) pretty well. Sometimes I immediately hop back in and try again, sometimes I break for 10-15 to catch my breath, sometimes I just decide today is not the day to accomplish this task and table it for later.

Bigger failures (a poor job interview, wasted supplies on a large expensive project) I usually carry with me until I fall asleep, I try learn lessons, but more importantly I try to forgive myself for the failure.

Until I met (and married) my wife, I thought that my relationship with failure has pretty universal -- I was wrong.

For small failures, my wife will sometimes let it ruin her entire day, for large failures it can take multiple days. She's so afraid of failing she procrastinates things she's not good at, even if the real world cost of failure is nil. When she does fail, she takes it very personally -- ex: she botched a dessert and brooded over it for at least an hour.

I can understand brooding on big failures, I do that too. That s&gt;aid, if possible I'd like to help her understand that failure is ok if you learn from it. If you don't start something because of fear of failure, you'll never be able to accomplish it. You can forgive yourself for failing.

409,"I live on the fourth floor in an apartment I rent with my girlfriend. The apartment directly beneath me is empty and has been for some years. There are people living in the apartment two stories below me, and an office below them. 

On Friday last week, the caretaker of the building knocks on my door and is quick to tell me the downstairs bathrooms in the apartments below me had flooded due to a clogged pipe somewhere on the 3rd floor. I was told not to use the sink in my main bathroom, as all the sinks below share a common pipe for water running out of the sinks and to the bottom of the building. She (caretaker) informed me a olumber would come to fix the clog on Tuesday (Aug 11).

It was horrible timing to be told not to use the bathroom sink as my girlfriends grandparents and two siblings arrived friday afternoon to stay with us for weekend. We have another smaller bathroom in our master bedroom, so we made due, but it added stress to the weekend for sure. 

Anyways, we didn’t use that sink after we were told not to, and we had been told it was okay to use the bathroom and shower in that bathroom as they didn’t share pipes with the apartments below. 

So tonight around 12am I have a shower in preparation for bed, and I go to brush my teeth. I am in the main bathroom with the sink I’m not supposed to use. I’ve been playing video games all night and am admittedly quite stoned and tired/ zoned out, and I use the bad sink and let the water run for a solid 2-4 minutes. I don’t even think about it.. it just slipped my mind and I used the sink. 

About 10 minutes later I get a text from the building manager/caretaker saying all the apartments below me including her office had flooded due to me using the bathroom sink in the main bathroom. She texts me saying it’s a lot of water and that she had told me not to use the sinks until a plumber showed up to fixed the clog. She says “that’s a lot of water and it sits in the walls and costs more than ten thousand dollars to clean up...”.
Tuesday has passed and clearly the plumber didn’t arrive on the day I was told he would. What do I do here? Am I liable to pay for damages? The apartment building is a condominium, or each unit is privately owned. 

I made an honest mistake and certainly didn’t mean to cause damage. Will I get in trouble from my landlord? It’s 1:16am here now so I don’t think my landlord has been alerted of the situation yet, or if he will at all, but I think the caretaker might let him know. My landlord lives a long ways away so he’s not around the apartments ever.

416,"Before You Read: this post is political, and no way intended to be hate towards conservatives. this post is strictly just about my family’s political beliefs and hate against others. 


so my family is conservative. like they love trump, and my dad is leaning towards alt-right. my mom and my sisters are okay, but their views are conservative as well. i’m the only democrat in my family. 

i always knew that i had different beliefs than the rest of my family, but we’ve kept things civil, and usually respected each other’s opinions. 

until this year. 

lately, everything has to be political in my house. when covid broke out, i wore a mask outside, per my states rules. i have severe anxiety about getting sick, so i did whatever they recommended because i didn’t want to get sick. because of that, i her called “libtard” or “snowflake” by my dad and some of my sisters.

i also expressed that i wasn’t sure if i was voting for trump this year, and that i didn’t really like any of the other candidates, so i wasn’t sure who i was going to vote for. my dad proceeded to argue with me about how “dumb” i was not to vote for trump, and that he was “ashamed to have me as a daughter.” 

i thought i blocked him from my socials, but he found a post where i explained that i supported blm, which resulted in me getting kicked out and having to spend the night at a friends because he said he never wanted to see me again. it’s been a month, but i still haven’t really forgiven him for that. he acts as if nothing happened. 

like i said before, these have all happened within the last month. before than we would get into the occasional fight about politics, but everything’s basically exploded. i’ve tried talking with them in a civil manner, but it always ends up with him telling me that i’m an “asshole” or a “dumb bitch” 

i’m just so tired of fighting with them all the time. i’ve basically made this routine of seeing them as little as possible because i know i’ll end up arguing with them. 

i’ve been thinking for awhile of cutting them out of my life. it’s hard though, because i love my mom; she’s my rock, and because i’m the oldest, i don’t want to miss my younger sisters milestones. but my dad is so toxic and cruel that i just don’t want to see him anymore, and i know that i can’t just cut him out of my life.

430,"So I was on my alt-Reddit (porn lol) and someone had posted her picture to an onlyfans related subreddit. It didn't show her face, just body, and in my horny state i went to their page and subscribed to see some more. I saw in her bio it said she was from the same city as me and that was kinda a turn on lol.

But then after subscribing I saw their face, it was my friend from work, who happens to be one of my managers. Although our relationship is definitely that of friends rather than just colleague and manager.

The account was under a fake name and the profile had no face before subscribing. Also, i feel like i need to point out that i was aware that she had an onlyfans as she is very open with that kind of stuff but didn't make the connection as i'm sure there are plenty of OF users in my city.

Should I tell her that I've seen it? Or mention that someone is posting her to Reddit without her permission? I have since looked at the Reddit account and it is definitely not hers.

This feels like an odd situation so i'm appreciative of any help.

Let me give you some background for this. I am a 15 yo and I have participated in 3 national science camps, won many awards, been 1st twice in state level science camps and met many scientists such as Manu Prakash\[ Really cool guy, Look up his Ted Talk\] who also gave me his pocket microscope. I also stood first in my state in my 10th grade exam. I just joined a new school for my 11th,12th grade. They offered me a 95% fee scholarship based on my score in the entrance test.

My problem is that I am unable to concentrate on my classes at all. The teachers are great. We have online classes for avg of 4 hours a day. I dont listen to them for even a single minute. I know this is bad and I am doing something really wrong but I cannot let go of it. As soon as the class starts I open reddit or watch gaming streams on youtube. My parents dont know this as I stay in my room. We had an exam this week and I knew I couldnt solve a single question. For the first time in my life, I was really scared for the exam. Then I cheated. Our school conducts exams in an app. I found a loophole in the code and exploited it to show me all the answers for the questions. I scored well. I am not able to let go of the guilt that came with it. I know I should listen to the classes but I am always driven to wasteful things. This never happened in school but my house is full of distractions. I tried to get rid of them but the greatest distraction lies infront of me. My laptop. As I already said, I start browsing the internet. I made up my mind one day to stop doing it but I returned back to normal the next day.

He was my first real relationship and I wanted him so after finding that out I felt like i should give him my virginity so he stayed.

He’s now dating this girl that seems to be very left wing and she’s retweeted something about Brock Turner.

436,"Tl;Dr: Trying to find a place to live in LA with $1200 monthly budget. Work graveyard shift and need a place that'll best suit my needs for sleep. Current situation effects my work and need to move ASAP but I am discouraged and overwhelmed. Should I settle for less than ideal circumstances by staying or in a new place? What resources have worked out for you when trying to find a space to rent?

Hello r/Advice. I (25M) live in Woodland Hills, CA (Los Angeles) and get completely overwhelmed when searching for a place to move to. My current living situation isn't working as I'm woken up daily by blaring music or television. I consistently try to reaffirm my boundaries by informing my housemates that they've woken me up. I know they pay to live there too so I'm extremely passive about it. At this point my only option is to move out. This will be my first time looking for a room to rent without assistance.

My shift is from 11:00PM-7:30AM five days a week. I try to sleep from 9AM-5PM on my work days. Three of my housemates do not leave the house for work. One of them does leave to work part-time but his hours are random. Sometimes the aforementioned housemate will make phone calls right outside my bedroom window which wakes me up occasionally. I've mentioned to him that this occurs but the change is short-lived before he inevitably will go back to his desired spot to make phone calls.

When I begin searching for a place on any of the various internet resources (craigslist, trulia, roomster, etc.) for rooms and apartments I am immediately stressed out. The conditions I find that are preferable (housemate work schedules, number of housemates, type of housemates, and location) are never within my budget. Ideally, I would like to move in with as few individuals as possible between ages 25-35 that work full time. I ride my bike to work because my driving record makes insurance too lofty. That said, I'd like to stay within a 5 mile radius of my work.

Am I better off sticking with my current circumstances with housemates that won't respect my sleep schedule? Should I gamble moving to a new place that doesn't fulfill my desires of a living space? Any resources you've had success with finding a new place? Any general advice on searching for a room to rent would be greatly appreciated.",12Aug2020,1

446,"For clarity I'm a male and she's a woman. We're both 22. I posted this on r/relationship_advice but it's not about a romantic relationship so I figured it wasn't the best place for it. 

I've been friends with her since secondary school but only in the last two years did we become close. We message each other maybe every other day and we have shared very personal stories between about romantic relationships, depression, and other mental health stuff. Usually I'd consider us to be one of my strongest friendships. 

Normally I would never question our friendship, but as of recently I've started to reevaluate things. We hang out alone quite a few times which is really chill, and sometimes one of our other close friends (who is also a woman) turns up. This never changes the dynamic between us. But whenever a man (other than me) joins us, ive noticed that she begins to treat me differently. She'll occasionally ignore me or not really engage with me or look at me.

If this was because we were with a man who she found attractive then it would make sense, but this is the case with any other guy we are with. Its like she subtly treats me with less respect. 

The thing is, I should clarify that I have never flirted with her once and to my knowledge she has never flirted with me. I usually think of us as like brother and sister. I don't mean to ""friend zone"" her or anything it's just that I've never thought of her sexually or romantically. And I doubt she has thought the same of me, I don't look like her past partners at all and I think I'm not tall enough for her to consider that. 

On the note of height, she sometimes makes jokes about short people which I know aren't directed at me but they still hurt regardless. It's not the most sensitive topic for me but it does make me feel a bit weird anyway. 

I just don't get why she treats me a bit rude when around other men. It's really frustrating and it makes me feel sad because I don't think of our friendship like that, and I don't do the same to her when there are other women around us. 

At another point yesterday she talked about another of her male friends, where she jokingly called him a ""simp"" because he hangs around her and another friend who's a woman. This kinda hurt because one of my groups of friends is a group of three, comprised of me (a guy), her, and another woman. But the thing is I don't think of either of them sexually AT ALL. I'm not the type of person to hit on my friends. 

Maybe I'm overthinking it but it feels like my friend thinks less of me, and it's been playing on my mind. Does anybody have any advice? Has anybody been in a similar situation? I'm sure the best option is to tell her how I feel but how exactly do I bring that topic up? Or do you think I really am just overthinking it",12Aug2020,1

452,"We’ve called each other best friends for 4 years but lately I’ve just felt like it was a bit one sided. I’ve realized that I invite her to all of my plans like parties, hangouts etc etc, but she never invites me along to anything. 

I will say sometimes I invite her for selfish reasons. Like I’m planning a trip with some friends to London and I asked her if she wanted to come, mostly because I don’t know these friends THAT well and I was afraid they might leave me. When she agreed to come I was excited to share a room with her and go shopping etc though. 

Anyway a few days ago our mutual friends snapped both of us asking if we wanted to come drink with him. I couldn’t, but if I could I would’ve asked my best friend if she wanted to come too, just in case she hadn’t been asked. Yesterday she said that that mutual friend had asked her if she could come, and she almost did but something got in her way. Then she asked if I had been invited. It was pretty obvious she wouldn’t have asked me to come. If I’m honest I’m a little hurt by it. She doesn’t invite me along for things but then if she hears that I’ve been talking to someone a lot or begun to hangout with them it’s like she gets a little uptight. As if she jealous or something. 

I don’t know what to make of it. I don’t feel like I’m clingy at ALL or that we spend too much time together because we don’t. I took some distance from her for other reasons and I could tell she was upset by that too but didn’t say anything about it. I can’t tell if it’s normal or if I’m overthinking things sometimes.

M had a crush on a girl named C. They were friends for a little bit until one day she blocks him. Not sure why maybe she thought he was annoying or just didn’t want to be with him. This was 6 months ago and M still continues to bring up her name and talk about her around me and all his friends. He keeps wondering why she didn’t like him and just continues to bring her name. Ive asked him to move on and stop mentioning her name but he continues to talk about her. Recently he’s done even more creepier things such as visit her workplace(KFC) with me( I didn’t know she worked there) but she wasn’t there. He also keeps asking a mutual friend for all of us to watch a movie at his apartment. I’m guessing the real reason he wants to go is because she also lives in the same apartment. I try telling him that going to her work is creepy and not normal but he either ignores me or tells me I’ve got it all wrong. 
Other than this issue, he’s a really good friend and I don’t want to just leave him. I’m a socially awkward person so I barely have any friends. Him on the other hand has a bunch of friends. He often makes me come hang out with his friends which I love because I try to socialize and work on talking to people.

I feel like such a bad person but it’s between a) say no and hurt his feelings while he mourns and b) potentially get mad at him IRL (I have BPD and it can be hard to control my frustration)

I’ve had an acquaintance/friend for about a year now we’ll call R. R lives 2 hours away so I’ve never met him in person, but we snap every day/every other day. He’s nice and I like chatting with him but I don’t want to meet up and hang out. He’s good in short bursts and over text but I don’t think I could handle a day with him. It’s just that he’s annoying for a few unimportant reasons and it really frustrates me sometimes.

His friend ODd a few days ago and he’s been incredibly sad since. He doesn’t have a lot of friends so he doesn’t have much support during this time. It’s been hard to talk to him about it, because every single time I go into my messages he is asking me to hang out. He’s willing to take the train all the way down here just to hang out with me. I live in the country and don’t drive/have a bus that goes to my house so I would need to get a ride into town and I couldn’t just go home when I feel done.

I’m extremely conflicted because I feel really bad for him and I know he’s dealing with this alone, but I *don’t* want to hang out with him, I really don’t, he’s annoying and I just don’t. I’m sorry. I’m not even sure what to say in messages because I don’t want to hurt his feelings and make him even more sad on top of this.

Any advice?

Anyway, I've called in sick A LOT recently, like once or twice a month, and during our centre was in lockdown I worked too, but I called in sick like three times during it. But basically they sat me down and told me that I need to stop because they'll have to let me go and I was like ""shit yeah ok"" and then I called in sick again, and then the like boss lady (she's not the actual boss she's just badass) sat me down and asked me if anything was wrong and I told her I was sad n shit, like told her shit that went down (she just easy to open up to). It's been a month since we had our talk and I called in sick due to period pains and msg my manger about it but then the badass lady called up and was like ""you're supposed to be in a 10:30"" and I was like ""sorry, yeah, I texted (insert manager's name)"" and she said ""we really need to help"" and I turned her down, I feel really guilty.

Maybe I'm work shy? But I used to be a very reliable employee before the lockdown idk what's happening, well obviously I'm really down and but that's kinda how it's been these past five years. 

I'm going to ring up for a doctor's appointment about my mental health but should I look for a new job?

470,"There’s no easy way to say this, but I can’t hold it in any longer. From the ages of 13-18, I would occasionally masturbate to bestality porn. I didn’t do it because I was attracted to animals (I’m not). Instead I did it because I was turned on by the thought of women who were so desperate for sex that they’d resorted to doing it with animals. I also kind of saw it as the ultimate form of degradation, which was something that had been a turn on for me for a while. At the time, I knew it was wrong, but I ignored it because I was horny. However, the other day (which was probably a few months after my last “incident”) it kind of hit me just how horrible my actions really were. Since then, I’ve felt so disgusted and ashamed of myself, and all I can think about is how guilty I feel for having done something so horrible. I promised myself that I would never look at it again, and have even decided to try to quit porn all together. However, even after making these promises to myself, my feelings of guilt and shame have only gotten worse. I know that this is something that would probably cause others and myself a lot of harm if I were to admit this to them, and the only person I think I could tell this to would be somebody who I get in a long term relationship with in the future. Yet, the thought of having to keep this a secret from my friends and family for the rest of my life is killing me. I’ve felt so guilty, disgusted, and ashamed the past few days, and I’m scared that I may never be able to live my life without constantly feeling like this again.",12Aug2020,1

472,"Lately I have been thinking i am gay or bisexual. As a BAD overthinker, I always let the little things get to me, as well as insecurities were quite common. I acted as if nothing has been wrong, and carry on with my life as normal, and people never suspected a thing to be wrong. (Ok not the point, mught be decent context but who knows)Anyway, i have debunked all of my theories of why I thought i was gay or bisexual, but these thoughts just sort of randomly pop up in my head. Now I would be okay with being either, gay or bi, but honestly if it were up to me I'd rather be straight, but i have looked at guys and naked and they are all turn offs. I have experimented with a guy, while I will admit it did feel pretty good sucking me off, i didn't feel anything for the dude, and i thought maybe it was a fluke, and tried again, but to no prevail it still didn't do anything for me. Now I had a dream where I fucked two guys, but in the dream I didn't enjoy any of it, like i was not happy with the life I had been given. Now I have this girl that I have had such a huge crush on, and it has been that way ever since summerschool, I fell hard for her personality, every time I was around her or talked to her, I felt happy, and i can still say she makes me just as happy. Now of course she in my eyes is absolutely perfect to her laugh(her little giggle is always great to hear), her smile, her shortness😂, her personality, her loving videogames and enjoying siege with me( I play on PS4 and was the former 15 champ in phantom sight, the name is ImFuzingRTE if your interested). I loved her so much and I still do. It has to be said but it has been quite evident that I have a chance with her, but she is waiting for something, nkt exactly sure though.. Im sorry if I went off topic btw, anyway to the point, I have been fantasizing about having sex with short female. In the dream in standing out in the open in a bedroom where the girl runs up to me and jumps right on me and I catch her and hold her onto me, then we fall onto the bed and start making out then we start taking out clothes and inevitably have sex. Sorry if it was explicit btw, I'm hoping you get the point that im tryimg to make. Well even though i have just been debunking my theories, the thoughts still come up in my head that say I'm gay, even though I'm not, and sometimes ill just start making a story of what would happen and what I would have said if I was gay. I know its all nonsense, but im just confused as to why those are thoughts are still in my head, so in the end after all of that, my few questions are
1. Has anyone else gone through this? 

2. Should I seek professional help about this? 

3. Why haven't you subscribed to Who'sFuzing yet😂? Jp, you don't have to if you don't want to, it's completely up to you, it would help to grow out my channel though a.d it would be much appreciated if you did end up subscribing. 

Well i wish nothing more for anyone who reads this a great life, and for those who are 3rd and 4th wave feminists, I hope one day you'll learn, you know it and I know it, putting it simply you honestly just hate men and wish to have further power and superiority over men. Oh and the gender pay gap is a myth, it has been debunked several times in the past 30 years. Now if there was unequal pay, then i would be standing right there with you until you got equal pay, I despise of most of you though. I will admit there are still people who advocate for equal rights for men and women, and for those people, i do have to say that i hope you stay amazing, but you should look more into the laws of divorce and child laws specifically who gets the kids, and who doesn't, as there are many men who are getting screwed over by the system and mothers who are not fit to raise children mooching off the child support they get and i won't say that it isn't the other way around but some of the time it is that way. Yeah, I like going on rants and having debates, I usually win in most of the debates I participate in as I hate it when people form am opinion without knowing everything there is to know about the subject. Just like how I don't like it when children are put in protests like dude, let them get older, let them start to form their own opinions, your setting a terrible example for your children, i mean you may tell them what it is your protesting for, but who knows if they will understand it properly, plus children don't even need to be a political protest in the first place if you ask me.",12Aug2020,1
473,"Need advice let me please know if I’m wrong. So to give a bit of context, I've (22f) known by boyfriend (25m) for almost 2 years and have been seeing him for just under a year (became exclusive 10 months ago). So everything about this relationship I find is my idea of an amazing relationship. So one of my uni friends (23f) has known my relationship since the very start. She and I aren't extremely close but I consider it to be just the usual friendship (not very close). I'm not a confrontational person I am quite introverted but with the right people, I become extroverted. She, however, is very opinionated, out-going, and flirty to any guy she can get her hands on (even guys in relationships). We have had quite a few hiccups along with this friendship and she has this ""block list"" which is scroll worthy (I've seen it).

So after reading that, this is the current problem bringing it back to our main point she knows of my boyfriend but she has never officially met him in person. She always asks she wants to meet him and I said okay I'll plan a day to meet which was going to happen. So one day she comes to me and says im gonna friend request him on social media and message him about making it exclusive with you. And I answered please don't do that I can handle it. Anyways so she friends request him (after I told her not to nicely) and practically begged her not to message him about the exclusivity (she sorta made it her business). Anyways so my boyfriend messages me an hour later he screenshots her friend request and sent it to me and said do you know her (as I was the only mutual) and I was like yeah that's my friend and he goes ill accept it then which I was cool with anyways.

So right after she messages me and goes hahaha he accepted my friend request trying to insinuate I was wrong which she said right after. So after that, about a month later my boyfriend posts a car photo and she comments on the photo. And to be nice my boyfriend told me he replied to the comment. Anyways she then starts to tag him in random posts. And all in all never replied to my tags. After this, my boyfriend told me you know he's finding it uncomfortable that shes tagging him in all these things and he doesn't know her. And he was like could you please bring it up to her, to which I was like yeah sure shes my friend, ill fix it.

So I message her and go “hey how are you, im so sorry to tell you this, I love you but I just have to tell you that Zac is finding it really uncomfortable that your tagging him in all these posts and if you could please stop it’ll be great” (mind you she doesn’t know him she hasn’t spoken to him a day in her life before these tags). Anyways she doesn’t respond to it after being left on read. So I message her the next day and go “hey how are you, just checking in to see if you’re okay” and she instantly responds with “I can’t believe you message me that, how dare you, im your friend you should be sticking up for me” then goes “he should be saying that to me” and I go “look he wanted to but he doesn’t know you he’s never met you” and then I go im sorry your hurt but this is my relationship and I just thought you could respect that so that it wouldn’t go further. Anyways she responds with calling me stupid and pathetic and saying that never liked me and then proceeds to block me straight after. All in all I made the block list guys hahah. Please let me know if im in the wrong in any way I’d really like to know. Thanks for the read guys.

tl:dr uni friend made my relationship her business, starts tagging him in posts and commenting on his posts despite not having met him. Boyfriend told me he finds it uncomfortable to which I was like no worries ill let her know. She replies the next day after my second message to see if she was okay really angrily and says how I could I do that to her and that I should be sticking up for her and she wanted him to tell her and not me . In which I responded with he doesn’t know you and this is my relationship you know as much as I care for you I also have to have his back to. She responds harshly again and blocks me.",12Aug2020,1
475,"I am a 30 year old cis woman in a relationship with a trans woman. We’ve been together for almost a year and when I’m with her, it’s bliss. I’ve never been with anyone romantically who has shown or given me the love she has. I think she is beautiful, smart, funny, talented and even after all this time I still get the butterflies when I see her; almost as if I’m seeing her again for the first time. It’s true love and I’ve never fully experienced this before. It’s magical.

I’m also going through a separation and divorce. It was one of those relationships that was over before it was actually over. It was over about a year before we officially called it quits. We tried to make it work for our child but were both miserable so decided to just be done and wipe our hands of it. But now, he wants to work on things and I’m very confused.

You see, I moved out of his house back in May (he and I split up last August but continued to live together for financial reasons and to ease our son into this whole thing) and I lost my job due to the pandemic in June. It was an incredibly stressful situation to say the least, but he’s been the one to pay my bills and help me pick up the slack. My girlfriend was furloughed back in April and has struggled to make ends meet since then and definitely hasn’t had enough to help me financially, not that I’m expecting it. (Included that bit in the story just in case you were wondering - and yes I’m desperately looking for a job) Anyway, my ex husband was extremely bitter about my relationship and me moving on so to make our relationship better for our child (and, not gonna lie, my situation) I broke up with my girlfriend. I ended it. Brought her over to my house and ended things. Until two weeks later when I realized that I can’t be without her. I seriously love her so much. We got back together and I haven’t told anyone. She’s told her friends, but no one on my end knows.

Because it’s easier for me.

I’ve never been in an open relationship with a woman. I’ve dated women in the past, but it’s always been in secret. Now I’ve met the love of my life and feel like I can’t be out about it due to judgement from my friends and family. Especially my ex husband. My relationship with him is so important because of our son, that I’m willing to sacrifice my happiness for it. I’m having to sneak around with my girlfriend at night when I don’t have my son because he will talk about my girlfriend all the time and I can’t have my husband knowing about this right now. I’m afraid if he knew I was bringing her to my house while he’s paying my bills, he would blow a gasket. And honestly, rightfully so. It’s disrespectful. He’s wanting to work on things and try and get our marriage back together which is something I’m allowing him to believe for now.

And this is where I’m stuck. I have her telling me now that she wants to marry me some day, as soon as we can, and I have him telling me he wants to put our marriage back together and honestly I don’t know what to do. On one hand, if I got back with my ex husband, I would have financial security and I would never have to go a day without seeing my child. However, I don’t feel like my ex husband will change. He’s a very cold person. I was always treated like a second class citizen in our house. I went through horrible postpartum depression and he held it against me. Didn’t even bother trying to understand what I was going through, just made me feel like less than because I wasn’t rainbows and sunshine all the time. He’s not loving and affectionate like my girlfriend. Which brings me to my next point. If I chose my girlfriend, I get all the love and warmth and affection and the fireworks and the magic. I get the sense of wholeness (not codependency) that I’ve never felt before romantically. She is truly my match I feel. She checks just about ever box for me. But.... she’s trans. Which is not a bad thing!!! I love her beyond words. My friends and family will never accept her. She talks about our wedding and having her family there and I think to myself that I will never get to have my family at our wedding because they flat out wouldn’t come, even if I was brave enough to invite them. These are people that I have loved my whole life. I normally don’t care what other people think, but I care what my family thinks. Right now, they think I should be back with my ex husband.

I’m just so torn and I don’t know what to do. I’m sure I’ve probably left a ton of gaps in this story and it’s long so I’m sorry for that. If you made it this far, thank you. Please ask any questions for clarity. Again, I feel like I left some stuff out but I’m too lazy to proofread.",12Aug2020,1

478,"I live with my parents, and my bedroom is the attic. It's hot af in here right now, and my mom and I are fighting over whether to leave my window open or closed.

My mom says it should be closed. She thinks opening it will ""let in"" heat from outside, and that it'll make my room even hotter. She says the only way to combat this is to keep the window and curtain closed. She also tried to argue that heat doesn't rise, but sinks instead. 

I don't think so, though. Heat *does* rise (after my mom's comment, I googled it multiple times phrased different ways just to be sure, but I was right) , so in my mind, all the heat is just trapped and  gathering in my room and making it unbearable. I'm honestly pretty sure it's hotter in here than outside at this point. Opening a window would, in my mind, allow this heat to escape. I do feel like it's a bit cooler with the window open, but my mom says I'm just imagining things.

Just now we had a small fight over whether I'm allowed to open my window, which ended with her saying it's her house, so her window, and it will be closed if she wants it to. I think that's a bs argument, since she's not the one who has to try to sleep in this place, but whatever, not much I can do about that I suppose.

Anyone here know who's right?",12Aug2020,1
479,"M16 currently attending school. 

So yeah, I’m scared to stand up for myself, and especially other people. 

Why? Because I’m going to get hurt.
I go to a pretty bad school. Kids are involved with gangs, brings drugs to school, and even weapons.


There’s been loads of instances of guys getting too friendly with girls, and it’s obvious the girl wants him to stop. But if I try and intervene, you get a punch in the face, followed by a group of his friends trying to beat you up

As a result of this, throughout school, I just keep my head down and try not to get caught up. 

In the case of myself, I wouldn’t say it happens a lot. It would just be somebody saying “you’re quiet” 
Another instance, I was on a table with some ex-friends, and a girl (who only cares about makeup and boys _-_ ) says to them, “stop bullying him” they weren’t bullying me, we were just talking. But I wanted to say “I appreciate you standing up for me, but they aren’t bullying me”, but I just say there in silence

But I’m done. I’m sick of this shit. I don’t want to be that guy who just turns a blind eye. I want to be there to defend a person, or defend myself. 

I’m scared of doing it because I know that a majority of the time, it will end with me being physically hurt.",12Aug2020,1
480,"About 3 weeks ago or so my cousin, who is someone that my boyfriend m29 and I normally talked to everyday and played video games with everyday, has stopped talking to us completely. He’s my boyfriend’s “best friend” and my closest cousin. He’s even gone as far as not liking or responding to things we share on FB when he normally would. It’s been a total blackout without any explanation as to why. Me and my bf have tried talking to him but he ignores us. 

As well as I know my cousin, I’m almost certain I know why he’s doing this. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened either, it’s happened twice before in the past. Each time he would go years not talking to us over stupid shit. The first time it happened, he randomly showed up at my house after a couple years of not talking and it was awkward af. I had learned he was in the middle of a break up which is why I believe he broke the silence back then. The second time it was me to break the silence, I hadn’t seen him for a couple years until my dad died and obviously due to the circumstances I started talking to him again and he started hanging out with us again. 

If it was up to me, I would rather discuss whatever the issues are maturely but I feel like that’s just not possible. Because if you knew my cousin, you would know how stubborn he is. It seems he prefers these complete blackouts which make absolutely no sense. Me and my boyfriend are the only people that he has that will hang out, play video games and talk to him as often as we do. Not to mention he seems to do this over the stupidest reasons. The reason this time? I believe it’s because my boyfriend and I didn’t show up to his house twice in a row when he was planning to watch movies on this outside projector while in the pool with us. He went all out and bought a ton of glow sticks for the pool and a movie projector. We had planned to come over but I was in pain and having cramps and just felt run down and over all shitty. So my boyfriend told him we weren’t coming over that day. My cousin didn’t seem upset and went ahead and still watched movies in the pool with his brother and little cousin. The next day he wanted us to come over again and do the same thing, but I honestly wasn’t up to it yet. I wasn’t in that much pain as the day before but I still felt run down and tired. I pretty much slept those two days away. (I have chronic health problems.) Days later, we noticed he wasn’t responding to our FB posts and shares. He is obviously upset we didn’t come over. It’s been 3 weeks now, if not more. And if it’s anything like what happened in the past, it will go on for years. I was thinking of trying to reach out and talk to him again. But I honestly don’t know if it’s worth the effort anymore. Just the fact that he does this kind of childish thing on occasion when he could talk to us. But that’s just how he is. He doesn’t talk to us whenever we have conflicts. He rather talk about us behind our back than resolve it. He does the same thing to others and talks to us behind their back. Not to mention I think he’s narcissistic. He always talks about himself and doesn’t seem that interested when you speak about yourself. I really loathe it and that’s not even all of it. For as old as he is, he still reminds me of when we were kids. He was so stubborn and would run off to his room when he was mad and throw a fit when he didn’t get his way. It still feels like he does that. Except now it’s these silent years long blackouts. 

 I don’t know what to do. He has a toxic, self-absorbed personality but me and my boyfriend has managed to have fun with him and laugh a lot. Some of the best memories are with him. I just wish he wasn’t so toxic would grow up. I honestly thought he was passed doing shit like this and wouldn’t do this again. But nothing has changed. What should I do? Is it worth the effort to try and salvage this? Or should I just let him do his thing and not talk for years again?


TLDR: My cousin is a stubborn narcissist and likes to randomly stop talking and hanging out with me for years over small problems. Recently, he has stopped talking to me again and it’ll probably go on for years. Despite his toxic problems, I still have fun and like hanging out with him sometimes. Is this worth trying to save? Should I try talking to him even though I don’t think I didn’t anything wrong?",12Aug2020,1

484,"Hi everyone,    


(tl:dr at the end)  

I (20M) have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 7-8. I had good grades until 8-9th grade, where I basically started dropping out/going to school on and off till I was 16 I could legally drop out (I live in France.). 


I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 6 (started because I was a “high potential” kid and I needed one to skip 2nd grade) until now. I’ve been diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder 1-2 years ago by my current psychiatrist. The diagnostic helped a lot, now I know why I am like that and that there is others like me out there. Now I’m in a stable state, I don’t take any medicine (I’ve tried), I don’t smoke, don’t do drug, don’t drink, I can manage my breakdowns, I know how to say no when I don’t feel like doing something and know that my heavy suicidal thoughts go away eventually. So, everything is better than ever (mentally that is).


Problem is, one of the things my condition causes is that I have no drive to do anything for more than a few days, or after I hit a point where I need to work hard to get over it, I rather give up. BUT I’m basically interested in everything, I invest some time in everything, but when I know what I wanted to know, I don’t look deeper, I just change the subject. So, I can’t find anything that attracts me enough, for a long enough period of time to make it a job (I’ve worked 1 months at my brothers shop 2 months ago, it was so draining and I was so relieved when my contract ended, even though the work environment was great and I was only doing 20h/week).


Last example: I’m learning how to drive, I am 7 hours in, starting to struggle with the clutch and feeling drained, depressed and close to just saying f it I don’t need to drive anyway.


So, I’ve just been playing games, been on social media, since I was ~12, and I don’t even like it that much, it’s just the thing that makes the time go faster and don’t cost me any energy. I’ve also started working out 4-5 times a week since the beginning of the year.


So, I’ve been trying to find something to make money and hopefully be able to live alone (I live with my parents, they are really understanding of everything and are well off so I’m not rushed, nor kicked out, but I prefer being alone and doing my own things.) and also visit every country in the world (which is basically my only long-term goal before dying) 


Do you guys have any idea what I could do or anyone I could to talk to, in France, even better if I can do it from my bedroom, that could help me keep my heads up for a few months? (Not counting in years yet, I find it incredible I was able to maintain a job for a month). I speak French and English.

There is a side of me that really wants to want to live but I really don’t know what to do.

I apologize for any typo, and If you need further information, feel free to ask.

486,"Throwaway.
So, my bf of 2 years is a ginger and has previously told me I'm not generally his type but he still loves me and finds me beautiful. I believe this is true as he has never shown otherwise. To get to the point, his type is ideally a ginger, or a blonde, and pretty skinny. Now, I am a brunette and got some curves. The thing is, he follows a lot of pretty, ginger, skinny girls with either erotic on non-erotic feed. Not like influencers but just like random girls with less than 200 followers and from all over the world. I guess he just followed every ginger girl he found... I know he loves me but this makes me insecure because he likes all of their pictures... and only when they are in it, like if they post a pic of their dog, or a landscape he won't like it so i believe he isn't really interested in their lives but their looks. I don't know exactly how and should i bring this up? I mean he isn't doing anything wrong but it's bothering me a bit and i can't even compare myself to those women so it's making me insecure about why he has the need to follow them on instagram and like their pictures. Or does he go and look at them at times? I really don't know and i'm too shy to ask him that type of question... So any advice on how or should i even bring this up?

Before this situation happened, Amy and I were also chatting on Facebook. For a while, she never answered me back after this discord incident; 2 days later, i don’t hear from her; Now my heart is racing that I actually made her upset, so I asked my other friends if they think I upsetted Amy, but didn’t give me a clear answer. Then, I decided to hit up Amy on Facebook and asked if everything was okay. She comes back saying she’s been alright, but has been feeling a bit agitated and moody lately that she was able to vent to with an old friend from her high school. Also, she said to not take what she said “personally.”

I would like to note that this isn’t the first or second time Amy has been feeling “agitated and moody.” Possibly, it because of quarantine, Coronavirus, America going into a recession, etc. that has put everyone into depressive mode).

Anyways, i didn’t respond until a day later because i didn’t know how, but i just came back with a lousy “glad to hear you’re feeling better.” If you couldn’t tell, i kinda did take it personally, but i was more sad than upset. I was truly scared that i upsetted my friend so much that she isn’t responding to me (having trauma from failed friendships in high school, but that’s another story). 

Then, we start to talk again, but it feels “formal” if that makes sense. I start to fall asleep and when i woke up, I saw a notification from Amy asking if “I” was alright considering I have been acting a bit off since she sent that message in discord. As usual, I lie and say I’m doing just fine when I’m not.

It’s quiet; We aren’t chatting everyday on facebook now until the break of dawn like we usually do. I was originally supposed to go over her house, but i don’t think that’ll happen because I feel “weird.” 

All in all, I’m not sure how I should feel or handle this? Is this just me overreacting? Am i at fault? Is Amy at fault? Are we both at fault?",12Aug2020,1

Hey, I’m 19 and I’ve been living without my family since I was 16 but first at a host family, then at a boarding school and then with 18 my first apartment. So I would say I’m pretty independent. However, I’m moving out and I just realized that my contract is actually so shit and I ask myself why did I sign this?!? Hahaha. I just kinda feel I’m slowly becoming an adult but I don’t understand what is going on around me and to be honest I’m scared of asking for help because I just feel stupid.

494,"I graduated from high school this year and got a real good result from our country’s university entrance exam (I am 1864th out of about 2 million people who took that exam). Now I have a chance to go to my dream university, but there is a problem. I always wanted to study computer engineering and if I did that I would pay a lot of money every year to the school. But if I study maths and do a double major (it’s more like dual grade but university translates it as double major) in CE that would be free and the only problem would be the heavy workflow I will have. I can’t make the decision here because everyone I spoke to says that maths is an extremely difficult subject to study and it is hard for me to finish both of these majors. But because half of the students in maths department are trying to get a double major and 13/52 students are doing that with computer engineering, I believe I can do it too. 

My family already said that money wasn’t actually a problem and they have it ready for my university expenses. But I can’t stop but thinking the upside of the other option. 

I know that is a choice that I should make but it is so hard and I am running out of time and I still don’t have an answer. 

Which one should I choose and will the burden of paying money to school every year go away at some point?",12Aug2020,1

I had invested most part of my life in my family business where there was no growth and I eventually decided to move on. When I was 26 I decided to move to Australia and I'm pursuing a masters degree in Business Analytics, I would graduate next year when I turn 30 (took double the time, started with accounting had health problems in between and then switched to my current degree) but have no prior experience in the field and not much professional experience on my CV, My grades are not very good as well, mostly credit but my university is top 30 in the world.
What steps I should be taking by the time I graduate next year to make the most out of my degree and land a well paying job?

496,"I am in the final months of a rigorous doctoral program and trying to finish my thesis while facing delay due to covid-19. There's an anxious 2nd year grad student ('Lucy') who has a pattern of seeking my help on every minor issue she faces in her research since she joined. She asks everything in a panic and finds it difficult to process what I tell her. 

&amp;nbsp;

I helped her a lot in her first year and by now she has enough experience to work independently. We also have a very supportive advisor who makes time for us, but I suspect that Lucy doesn't want to look stupid in front of her so she comes to me for everything from finding literature to drafting emails. Everything is top priority, a 5 minute question becomes a 20 minute discussion, a planned meeting of 1 hour becomes 2 hours, because she is too anxious to understand what I explain to her. Before covid-19 she would come to my desk every day (sometimes as soon as I walked in), now I get instant messages asking for help. I feel that it's not really about the questions but about managing her anxiety. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our advisor also see that Lucy has anxiety/confidence issues and wants me to help her on one of her research projects even though it's not my responsibility and I have enough stress trying to finish my own dissertation. We agreed on a few specific tasks I would help Lucy with but that doesn't stop the stream of follow on questions. She backs off for 2 days but then she's back to her usual pattern of seeking help for things she should be asking our advisor.
 

&amp;nbsp;

I can tell that Lucy knows her excessive need for help is a nuisance and she told our advisor that she feels guilty about asking for my help, but I feel it just gives the impression that I'm not a team player and don't want to help her. The truth is I think she's a nice person and I want to see her succeed but right now I only care about finishing my phd. It's come to a point where I just want to ignore Lucy's IMs and let her figure things out on her own.

Reddit, please tell me:

1. Am I being unreasonable in wanting to wall myself off from the outside world for the last 2 months so I can finish my dissertation and graduate?

505,"Disclaimer I don’t have anything against my best friend or her new best friend.

I just want to know if we’re still friends.


Things I noticed after she meet her new best friend:

She doesn’t call

She doesn’t text

She doesn’t ask to meet up with me anymore

I know some of you are thinking why don’t you just ask her all this yourself instead of waiting for her.

I did call her twice, she never picked up or just forget to call back.

I did text her twice, i sent her funny vidoes which is a thing we do, all she did was liked them but before she would send one back or say something.

She was meant to come over and help me and my family move, but she instead went out with her new best friend.

She said she would come the next day to help us, but instead she once again went out with her new best friend.

Another thing was that she never told me she was leaving the country for 2 years, I had to find out through my mom.

She didn’t text or call to say she was leaving instead she went out with her new best friends, like 3 times, what’s weird is that even though she went out with her and said her goodbyes to her new best friend.

My best friend decides to bring her to my parents home, so she can once again say goodbye to her.

She said it was because “it would be the last day I would seen her”.

I had nothing against this, but I’m confused she posted pictures she took straight away onto snapchat showing her hanging out with her new best friend multiple times but still brought her along on the day me and her were suppose to say our goodbyes.

So she brought her friend one the day we were suppose to say our goodbyes and talk and catch-up. We couldn’t do that.

So her and her new best friend went out to get drinks, but instead they took an hour because they were talking and walking around.

The thing is that her and  her parents came late which meant I didn’t have a lot of time to catch up.

So we had two hours with them. One hour she spent with her new best friend, and other hour which I was busy with cleaning up when they ate food, so I had 30 minutes with her.

Another thing is that, they were meant to leave the day after she came to see us, but they didn’t because something happened.

She didn’t text me to tell me what happened. 

Another thing is that, me and her didn’t talk for a whole year. We didn’t meet up or text.

But she didn’t make the effort, I was am the one making the effort . 

While everyone was suppose to be on lockdown, my best friend went to see her new best friend multiple times, she got in a train and went to see her so they can hang out and talk.

I am a train away as well.

While in lockdown and after lockdown, there hasn’t been a day they haven’t meet up.

She never even told me she got a new job.

She never calls me to tell me her good news, instead she is telling all her good and bad news to her new best friend instead of me.


I feel like I’m being replaced. Like my best friend isn’t my best friend, instead where two people who see each other on family occasions.


I just want you guys to tell me what you think of this situation? Whether you guys think I’m overthinking or not.


The thing is that she never texts me, even my other friend who is friends with my best friends new friend, told me that my best friend and her new best friend text all the time, talk on the phone all the time. Meet up all the time.

What really hurt me was that when I found out when she came over to say goodbyes to us, was that she told her new best friend about something I told her and only her because I didn’t want anyone to know.

Why would my best friend tell someone I don’t know my business? Why? 

She has a lot of stories she could’ve easily told those instead of mine.


She deserves the best in this cruel world.

506,"I’ve always been pretty quiet and spent a lot of time on my own. I (23F) have a couple of close friends I’ve known since childhood and see them regularly. I get along pretty well with most people and they seem to like me, but I rarely move beyond the “acquaintance” stage with people, and I don’t know if this is by choice or because I’m bad at relationships. I’m reserved and don’t trust people easily. I’m 23 and in college and spend a lot of time on my own, reading books and stuff.

My parents seem to think I spend too much time alone. I don’t live at home but when I talk to them it seems like they always ask questions about my social life and imply that I don’t have many friends. It makes me doubt myself very much and feel like there’s something wrong with me, and think that I’m probably more lonely than I think. I have college friends but seem to have drifted apart from them, and it got worse when the pandemic began. I did nothing to prevent that happening, and justified it to myself with thoughts about how they’re immature and don’t care about me anyway. But maybe that’s not completely true. 

So, I wonder how to be better at building trust with people and have deeper friendships. I only know how to be the smart and witty, but reserved person whose outer shell is impossible to crack. So people are drawn to me but can’t get very close. I joke a lot, but I’m also very serious, which seems contradictory, but it’s true.  I think am a little eccentric too, but not in an off-putting way.

514,"Hi, everyone. I just created this account to write this and not sure where and what to start from, but I'll try my best to articulate everything. 

My family and I used to travel around a lot every couple of years because of my dad's job. Taking advantage of that situation, my (older) brother and I ended up becoming an international student abroad. Last January (2019), my brother and I, just the two of us, started living together since our parents flew back to our country, and that's when we started having intense conflicts. It actually started with me arguing about his tidiness and hygienic issues- how he made me clean up and wash the dishes all the time. There were bugs everywhere in such a luxurious flat, but he didn't seem to care at all. He even told me that he was going to pay me money every time I clean up his dishes and trash, but I personally couldn't condone that. We're siblings, not some kind of maid and house keeper. We started drifting apart after a month or so we started living together. We ended up getting speechless and only conversed whenever we had arguments. We argued up to the point that my brother, who's very physically fit, literally just threw me around and made me get bruises and almost a concussion (I fainted when he threw me into the bathtub). It turned out that my brother had severe anxiety and depression, and hence kind of threw all his stress to me whenever he came home. He's really nice to his friends and others, just not to me and mom. He only pretends to be nice to dad because he needs the money to graduate. He detests dad and cusses about him whenever he's not around. Anyway, I didn't know he had such severe symptoms until it was just the two of us. I got really stressed because of him that my period cycle was very irregular, experienced insomnia and lost more than 5kg. I was really terrified and felt like killing myself ( he told me to die) that I had to call my parents sometimes. Whenever I called my dad about it (since he's accountable of monetary issues), he would just react with something like ""oh... I see..."" and didn't really take something into action. I knew that, our family isn't that rich, but I asked desperately if we could live separately, but he wouldn't just reply or respond with a positive manner. I even asked if I could take a year off for school but again I heard a negative response, since my brother was already spending more than 4 years at university. 

You might be wondering, why I am talking all about this, when I mentioned my grandmother in the title. Well, it's because I basically think the fundamental problem arises with my (paternal) grandmother (and my dad as well). My mom got mentally and physically abused by her mother-in-law when she conceived my brother. Back when my mom was my age, it was somewhat a ""culture"" in my country for the mother-in-law to mistreat the daughter-in-law. But, what my mom experienced was one of the worst. My brother, who sometimes visits a psychiatrist, says that the first thing the psychiatrist mentioned when he/she heard about my brother's symptoms was ""How was your mom's mental state like when she had you?"" meaning, his current mental state might have a relationship with my mom's mental state when she was pregnant. My mom was 43kg before she had my brother, and wasn't even over 48kg when she was about to deliver my brother, because my grandmother wouldn't let her eat much with her precious eldest son's (=dad) money. She's also been constantly telling mom to abort the baby (=my brother) before it grows any bigger. You could be saying, oh, but you weren't even born when that all happened and that's just what you've heard from your mom, she might be lying. No, it isn't. My grandmother kept tormenting my mom whenever our family came back to our country and paid a visit to her. I also remember my grandmother always talking behind my mom when us siblings were younger, by saying things like ""your mom earning no money at all just frustrates me"", ""tell your mom to lose weight"", ""all that matters at the end is your dad, not your mom"" as if she was trying to brainwash us that my mom's a useless human being. 

You could be also wondering, what did your dad do then? First of all, he was never a ""domestic"" type of person (patriarchal) so I don't really feel much emotional connections with him. He's never been on his wife's side whenever she had conflicts with her mother-in-law. In fact, he hit her whenever he drank and came home late at night. There was even this time once when my mom was half-deaf because my dad slapped her too hard when he was drunk. My brother at least doesn't get abusive when he drinks, but his misogynous behaviour seems like he's unconsciously learnt it from dad. They tried to get divorced last year and even went to the court, but it came to nothing because my dad apparently didn't have the money to give my mom in order to get divorced. Also, turned out my maternal grandmother and uncle were planning on snatching the money mom gets when my parents get divorced. My dad's a lot better now- he still drinks a lot but at least, *at least* doesn't physically abuse her- but I'm planning to help her out once I get independently financially settled. And there is actually a lot more to unveil, but then I'd have to spend days writing.

Now, my parents and I are living together at a new home in our country. I came here due to COVID and is planning to take online courses this coming year, and my brother's staying back in where we used to live. I'm glad that I don't have to bear that pain with my brother now, but I still have nightmares and thinking about him just makes me tear up. 

Recently, I've heard that one of the relatives on my dad's side are about to pass away, and that my grandmother is also very ill. Dad's really depressed these days and occasionally asks me if I could pay a visit to my grandmother, but I... don't know. I never liked her, and I can't condone what she's done to my mom for 26 years. The person I care about the most in the world is my mother, so I technically can't bear with anyone that bothers her. She looks fragile on the outside so there's been so many people beside her family attacking her throughout her life. I do feel sorry that things are not going well in my dad's side, and (it might be surprising to some of you but) it's not like I hate my dad 24/7. However, I still care about my mom more than anything else. I don't think I would even able to be smile in front of my grandmother when I see her. I haven't seen her for roughly 5 years now, and she's probably in her 70's, but I... just don't know if I should. My conscience tells me to, and not to, simultaneously. 

I would need to of course mend the situation with my brother too, but this is what I would have to resolve first. Do you think, that I have to see her at least once before I leave my country? I hope I prefaced and clarified everything as clear as I can. Any advice and plausible criticism with kind words would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",12Aug2020,1

This is a problem because i have a bunch of older male relatives that are like that and i also get aroused by them and i also fantatize about feeding them food or beer and i'm constantly starting at their grey beards, blue eyes or huge belly and i would get a raging bone r when they up their shirt and see their hairy belly.  
I just don't understand why i have this fetish if i'm a straight guy...i feel like i'm a creep/pevert and i just want this fetish to stop",12Aug2020,1
518,"My parents went on vacation for a month and said I have to survive on my own. They gave me $50 but I was dumb with the food I bought and basically got to $10 and nothing in my fridge. I asked them for more money and explained I have nothing to eat, but they told me that's the consequence of my own actions. I agree with them, I should plan my spendings better.

Maybe I’m taking this harder than most because I usually do not have this issue and I’m the one who always does the leaving-but I never ghost. Because it’s hurtful and disrespectful imo, have human decency to give someone answers.

We have 5 cats and 5 dogs all which have certain domains in the very small house. 

I have had to put up with this since age 6, and the animals just keep on getting replaced.

My symptoms are as followed: itchy eyes (incl. Skin and nose), bad wheezing/poor breathing, susceptibility to infections, trouble sleeping, tired during the day, ezcema, psoriasis, hives and other rashes, sore throat... Etc. 

So I have tried to make my room allergy free but there's two problems,

1) I feel stuck in my room (as the animals have free reign)
2) I track in dander, dust, hair.. etc. Into the room anyway.

My parents are in DENIAL! I tell them about my problem and they ignore it.

I feel like they care about the animals thany personal health.

526,"Soo, i am a college students and my parents are broken up, living at different apartments in the same city. I am in my college city right now, not doing any vacation the next time, but thinking about where to stay and work on my college stuff.
My mother is on vacation right now, my dad will go in like a week. It is hot as crazy and i live under the roof in my college apartment. 
Now here are the options: 

1) I stay in my college apartment this month. It will be hot, but otherwise regular student life.

2) I go stay at my dads empty place while he is on vacation.  Has lots of upsides, but downside: Its kinda weird staying alone if my mom is right there in the same city and i could be staying with her...

3) I go stay at my Moms place, while she is there. She has a pool. She also has cats and an overall bigger and dirtier place than my dads apartment. Downsides: I really dont like the feeling of a dirty place. I dont like cats, the place smells weird, i just dont feel as comfortable there. Also, it will be weird with like shopping (Do i shop my own stuff, or tell her what to get for me, do i cook all my own stuff, cause i eat vegan and she doesnt...) , Another downside: She just came back from vacation, which means she probably was near a lot of people, which makes me uncomfortable cause of 2020. 

I would prefer staying at my dads place alone, cause i enjoy alone time and it has a nicer feeling. But i also dont really want to hurt anyones feeling by being in the same city and not staying at my moms place. Its weird, right? It kinda sends the message that i prefer being alone over spending time with her, but really its just about the living situation.

527,"My wife has been my rock and had my back the entire time. I don’t know what I want to do with myself. I even had a thought of just ending it for the first time and it scared the hell out of me. Now I’m dwelling on it. 

Around February of this year I went from a job I knew and was good at to a job that was less money but better benefits. Covid hit and they started to restructure. I was given no raise and just kinda thrown at more and more things as they laid people off. Eventually there as an opening at our local county. I applied there for a maintenance job. I got it and started yesterday. 
Upon arriving I was placed at our Judicial center and was told go fix stuff. I legitimately had no idea what to do. I was around prisoners, furnaces, dryers, plumbing, electrical, and all sorts of other things that I had no idea how to work on. 

Since I started the receiving job I kept in contact with my old boss and his family. They were good to me. When my mom died they paid me for unexpected time off and it even made me cry. When I mentioned that my receiving job had been put on hold because of a Covid scare for a few days he finally offered me a job back doing something a little different. 

Am I just a fucking mess? Like I don’t know what my problem is. I worked for him for 4 years before and was happy. I didn’t like my co-worked or the retail aspect but it was fine other then that. Even in the winter I got my 40 hours. Some of it I even got to spend just browsing YouTube.

528,"Last application round, a student at my high school got accepted into the honors college at a some-what selective university. I came across his profile on a career networking site, and after talking with the current board of a club, we are fairly certain and have evidence that his claim to founding (and participation in) the club is not true. The club is a chapter of a well-known student organization, and related to this student's major.

The board had a lengthy discussion about taking action, but ultimately decided not to take up the issue, because of personal reasons (his sibling was still at the school and they didn't want to jeopardize his/her reputation)\*. I'm not sure if he added the activity on his college application, but if he did, that would be a serious legal issue.

I don't know what I should do. There are several possible outcomes, with the assumption that anonymous reports do not carry weight: 

1. If I bring up the situation with our counselor and he did in fact lie on his app, he could get kicked out (worst case scenario, but is it too late in the year for rescinding acceptances?) or lose financial aid, but at a relatively smaller moral/social? cost to me. 
2. If I bring up the situation and he didn't lie, I would be/seem like a real asshole.
3. If I choose to not act (bystander), it would go against my moral principles and he could get away with a lie. Idk if it would be better for the student to learn earlier, rather than later, in life.

530,"Many celebs and models have fan pages for them, some of the fan pages who are big, they get followed by the celebs, many of them get a chance to meet, many of them even get to talk and they share things with each other etc etc. 

So I thought to make 2 separate fan page for these 2 models, they are basically not very famous, one has around 300k followers and the other one has almost 100k, these 2 models are best friends and even live together, I just started to collect shoots and I started to post them.

I won't make this story long, I have had these pages since 4 months now, I post new pictures of them everyday, every 3rd or 4th day they message me to ask for more pictures, It is surprising how come they don't have these shoots, I always share with them, when I try to talk to them, they ignore me, when I even ask some general question they give a rude reply, but when someone else asks them a sexual or a vulgar question on their stories or comments they reply to them.

These are not those nude models or anything, these are just models who do shoots for clothing brands. I always help them, but they don't even appreciate, many times they don't even give a LIKE to my pictures but they give a LIKE when someone else takes it from my page and posts them

I know all of this sounds so dumb and stupid, but I help them so much, but they don't even appreciate my hard work and they ignore me most of the times, there are other celebs or even models who are so nice to the fans and they appreciate who have pages for them.

I have so many shoots of them then I just feel addicted to post them everyday. I just feel sad that I do so much for them and they don't even care to appreciate and when they want something they message me. 

TLDR - I run 2 fan pages for 2 models, they always ask for my help, in return they hardly give any LIKES, they don't even appreciate, they don't even share my posts on their stories, I feel used.",12Aug2020,1

She is sneaky. She tried saying I need to give my son up for adoption, that ""I don't take care of myself"" (I pay rent, unlike her). She tried claiming my roommate said it. She has a history of stealing and there was a day my brand new makeup disappeared, my roommate's winning scratch off disappeared, and $150 went missing from the neighbor's wallet.

545,"Hello everyone,  


I work at a restaurant as a manager, the company has been great to me and offers a lot benefits, i've worked there for 7 years and like i said, almost 8 in november. I think is worthy to mention is still my first job, started when  I was 18yo. It pays very well for someone on my life situation, but I dont see it as a permanent career, which it feels like this kinda job expects you to be, 100% commited.  


For the past 2 years or so, I feel extremely unhappy about it. For several reasons:  


\-I work 50h a week. Its a open 24h place which causes it to give us managers overnight shifts pretty constantly, and scheduling is most of the time, awful.   


\-For that same reason I feel out of energy most of the time and on my days off I just dont feel unmotivated to do anything productive. My sleeping is actually not horrible in terms of amount. I most of the time sleep 7-10 hrs straight, but on my days off or when my scheduling changes, is VERY erratic and sometimes I wake up with neck pain and feeling not rested at all.  


\-Being part of management puts a lot of stress on everyone thats part of it, especially with our current situation with the pandemic. New regulations and on procedures keep coming on, just making the job harder and harder. But even though, like I said, i've thought about it and due to my personality I feel management is just not the job for me. I've learned a lot of new things and have changed myself quite a lot to accomodate, and I wouldnt have lasted this long if I wasnt a good worker, but I still feel I cant force myself sometimes. Demotion is not a bad option but my scheduling will continue to be bad since my superiors will expect me to still be able to work those hours.  


\-I've recently started to also feel lower back pain especially on my lower right side, when I start getting tired or when I do certain positions like reaching for something. I also have become antisocial in a way, I dont feel interest in hanging out with friends or going out even though maybe we should during the pandemic (hehe. I laso have lost interest in hobbies i was very passionate about before.  


That sums up major reasons. On the good side of things, I am single, I dont have any children so if I were to quit and get a less demaning job, which I feel I could get not that hard with my experience as management for the past  7 years. Even with less pay and not part of managemenet, which I wouldnt even want again anyway, I would still be able to survive paying my essential bills and rent (have done some math). I wouildnt have as much money for leisure, which is maybe what I'm scared off since I have accustomed myself to it, but at the same time I currently dont even enjoy all the things I have been able to buy.  


Im just in a predicament, I recently got back from a vacation which I just spent at home since travelling wasnt a good option, and I just found myself getting more depressed having to go back. I want more free time to focus on myself more, and feel healthier and hopefully find motivation on doings things i am actually passionate about.   


I hope someone with a similar situation as mine I would have some words of advice. Thank you for taking the time to read the long and not so well done post.",12Aug2020,1

He seemed out of it from the anesthesia but later that night we couldn’t find him even in our small tiny apartment. He didn’t reappear till Tuesday afternoon after I got home form work. He looked worse so I called the vet to ask what I should do they suggested a quite place so he can rest or bring him in for fluids. I opted to wait to see how he does since it wasn’t even fully 24 hours after his surgery. We lost him at 7:30 last night. And I’m so distraught. I feel like I should have know he wasn’t able to move, he was so limp, and breathing really fast. I feel like it was my fault I should have brought him to the vet as soon as I got home. He also had a small heart murmur so maybe it was that combined with the anesthesia that killed him.

Went to jail after an altercation with his ex wife. Skips court dates. Probably still has warrants. Has not had a job in well over a year. Ive caught him in dozens of lies. He has blatantly disrespected me and my home on multiple occasions. All of this has been taking place the past two years.

I offered help and urged so many times to get counseling or go to AA. He lost the great job at my company where I got his foot in the door. I've helped him move all of his shit out of his house after his wife kicked him out. Gave him a bike so he could more easily traverse the city for employment. And most recently, have been supervising the visits he has with his child.

His ex wife stipulated he can see his child if a supervisor is there to make sure he isn't drunk. I agreed to be that supervisor and have been doing so for sometime now. I know its a load off of her mind knowing the child will not be in any danger. As far as I know, he has been sober for a minute now, but addicts are masters of hiding their addictions.

The visits are an annoying drag on my weekends because I don't really want to see my brother at all anymore. It stresses me out, and saddens me, and angers me to see what a failure he turned out to be. He's my big brother and I used to look up to the guy.  And also, if I'm being perfectly honest, I don't like kids. As much as I love my nephew and all, he's still a two year old and I just don't like kids. Yuck.

I don't want to do these visits anymore. I'm so sick of having to put effort into this grown ass man's life when he puts about zero into it himself.  I want to tell my brother and sister in law that I am not gonna supervise anymore.

And I feel like a dick because then I guess they'll have to find a new supervisor and until then my brother won't see his kid.

I dont know what to do. Sometimes I think I am too nice and am being a doormat. But then other times I think its my duty to help.

Why do his problems have to be my responsibility? That just doesn't seem fair.

551,"I feel so embarrassed even typing this out (hence the throw away account). 

I am 25 year old women living in the UK. I’ve got good friends and a good job and enjoy those aspects of my life. However, my whole life, I’ve never been in a relationship. I use to have one night stands, but haven’t done that in many years. 

Now that Covid is easing, I’ve begun attempting to date again. I have great dates with guys, and often times get told that they want to see me again / like me etc, but these have never once materialised into a relationship and i don’t know what the reason is? it’s difficult now to not think there is something wrong with me and i am driving people away. All these dates seem to end in me being ghosted or rejected, and all i have to show do these is a list of failed attempts. 

My friends tell me that i’m not the problem, and these thing will happen with time, but that just feels impossible when i have 25 years of rejection backing me up. 

I don’t bring this baggage with me to dates and i’m a really positive person, so i don’t think i’m moping or anything that could put people off. 

How can i identify what is going wrong? Is there tips that people can give on identifying something in my behaviour ?

Otherwise, how can i stop feeling like i’m such a failure? I find it so hard when many of my friends are in loving relationships and i’ve never come close to something like that. 

i’m just sick of feeling so lonely. I’d be grateful for any advice.

552,I (21M)had a fling with her last summer and by the end of it I was hooked on her. We agreed not to catch feelings because she was on a break with her boyfriend and we both go away to college anyway so there’s no shot it’d work. Not to forget we’re in a similar friend group when we’re home from college. I stopped talking to her/hanging out with her for almost a year when I got up to school. She tried snapping me many  times in that span saying she missed me or tried to get out streak back again but I left them all on open. In college I’d see other girls but it would never be the same as her. Finally once quarantine was over around July I started hanging out with her and her group again because I felt I got over it. Slowly it’s been getting worse again as I’ve been seeing her more and more. She initiates flirting sometimes and we’re starting to get closer again. I’m certain she’s crazy/toxic or just keeping me as a backup. I’m far more attractive than her current boyfriend and out of her league to be honest I know that doesn’t mean much though,12Aug2020,1
553,"Every roommate relationship I’ve ever had has turned very sour by the end Becos I don’t do enough cleaning. This has been something I’ve wanted to improve for a while, so in my current situation, I’ve taken lengths to always do my dishes, and sometimes even other’s dishes as well, pick up after myself and not leave things in public spaces, periodically do house chores when I recognize they need to be done, etc. My perception is that I’m doing fairly well at this, and holding myself to a standard of cleanliness previously unprecedented in my life and I feel healthier for it. But my roommates are still constantly angry with me because their standards are much higher than mine, so they end up doing much of the work because they think the floor is dirty before I recognize that the floor is dirty, that the fridge needs reorganization before I notice it does. I’m trying to keep up with them but much of the time I simply don’t notice the work needs to be done until they’ve already done it, and then they resent me Becos I haven’t held up my side of our relationship.

554,"So to start we live in Missouri, she lives rural and checked every box on the aspca animal hoarding section. I visited for the first time since January and was appalled. She has at least 10 dogs and 10 cats. I pet them all and every one was scabbed and rough from rampant fleas. She says the flea meds (that she splits doses to save money on) don’t work. You can see them crawling everywhere on them. She also has an old dog that now has tumors everywhere! She yelps constantly but my mom just says nobody here has the heart to put a bullet in her, and she can’t afford to put her down. Every animal is crazy thin, not to the point of bones showing yet but I don’t want to wait until it gets there. They look towards my teenage brother to be the executioner, and won’t get rid of any of them. She says she’d put a bullet in whoever tried to take them.

Sorry for the vent session. Anyways, what should I do? This is something both my brother and my dad despise but can’t do anything about. They’re too poor for fines to do anything but make the situation worse or turn it into an animal graveyard. The house they live in is literally collapsing with black mold everywhere and holes in the floor. Taking money from them is just as inhumane.

 Is there a place that’ll take the animals? Will the police put charges on my dad, who trucks and is never there but has no say? I don’t know who to call or what to do.

My younger sister (15) is gay. I had dreams of her holding hands with other women and something clicked in my mind that she was gay. Yesterday I was searching for my notebook but I came across hers and opened it (I know I really shouldn't have because it's an invasion of privacy I really regret doing it). In it were diary entries of her feeling gayer everyday and heartbroken that her crush doesn't like her back because she's straight. I ended up feeling depressed because I didn't know what to do as her older sister. In the end I told my mum and she thinks she can change her by getting close to her. I don't know what i should do. Can anyone help me please? She keeps drawing pictures of women naked and says she feels vulgar.

558,"So I'm a gifted boy 21 years and I also having both add and adhd.

School started out fine until I finished my year and am allowed to progress to the next year.

I really liked my study Biomedical engineering yet around march doubt start kicking in. Do I want to end up in a company while already having so much trouble with handling orders from uni or when I'm not the leader of the group? 

Why is school so important?

How come people that study something still can't find a job?

Why do I have to live in the conventional way?

Where question I started to ask to myself and my friends and family.

They all kept saying because you want to have security in life and if you want to own a company you can work your way up.

Then corona came and had lots of time to think.

So I thought maybe I'm jus bored so joined a the business team of a student team and I was already part of the debating association. Besides I started doing some thinks aside and found out that I enjoyed the things I did next to study way more pleasant and fulfilling than my study. I found it so hard to motivate myself I had a lot of courses I did not like and failed 5 of my last 6 courses.

The biggest problem is also the tests I don't feel any stress so I feel no need to study at all. But it doesn't matter when I well I still forget to write and see small details in question or in my answer and got a lower grade on my test or fail it. While fully understanding the material. So I'm always stressed during the test but never before because I think I can do it.

It's so annoying knowing that you are extremely smart but you just can't show it through your academic skills. Especially seeing all your friends around you getting straight 9/10 or 8/10 on tests. 

I know what I want in my life and that's starting my own business I don't care in which sector.

But family and friends keep telling me you can also do that with the security of having a degree.

Are there any other gifted Or adhd people that dropped and I would like to know why you did it and why you love/regret making that decision?

And the people that had the same thought why did you not drop out and why do you love/regret that decision?

I just couldn't believe that minutes ago this guy was saying some reasonable things and making good points then suddenly he started with the racist bullshit.

It was scary and I keep getting reminded that a lot of people where I'm from are so damn ignorant and toxic to be around. Almost everyone wants to just fuck around, waste time, focus on shallow things and sulk in their ignorance and get comfortable in it instead of trying to educate themselves and being better people. It's impossible at this point to escape toxicity in this country. I'm planning on immigrating, believe me, but for now I'm trying to not lose my sanity.

563,"I have been learning piano for around a month now, though I took them when I was around 7 years old for a short while and quit. I wanted to pick it up all of a sudden because I love music (not necessarily creating and playing it, but just listening to it is enough) and I had nothing to do during quarantine so I contacted an online teacher recommended by my friend.

She’s amazing, like, really amazing. Excellent teacher, not just for piano, but as a teacher in general. The thing is, however, I moved houses 3 days ago and finally got a room of my own, however because I have a room I am able to do things such as play games and watch Netflix a lot easier and a lot more now. This caused me to spend less and less time practicing and more time doing other things for fun. 

The issue is that my parents pay a tad high amount for my lessons, and at first I was very gung-ho about the whole thing and thought the price was worth it, but now, I feel like every session is becoming more and more useless. My latest session was cancelled due to personal reasons of my teacher, and the sigh of relief I breathed.. I’m not sure how to react to it. I haven’t touched my piano since we moved, and I don’t feel like doing it soon. 

What I’m troubled with is, the reason I play piano is, at its root, for fun. This makes me think it should be okay to just quit if it’s not fun anymore, but I am scared of the disappointment and anger of my parents.. I’m scared of getting their hopes up that I’ll actually learn something they care about, and then destroying it. The thing is I really don’t feel anything anymore. I can not force myself to continue learning my piece. I don’t wanna touch my (100 dollar) piano anymore, and just wanna go play or something. Please help me decide.",12Aug2020,1

I have a Puerto Rican friend who is a very fun dude to be around. He's nice and tells good stories and, outside of a once-in-a-while episode of ""not knowing when to turn off the funnyman routine"", he's a joy to be around. 

My issue here stems from the fact that he will often casually, almost self-deprecatingly, use lots of slurs to describe himself or why he does the things he does. 

He'll say things like ""That's my w*tback, showing."" and stuff like that. 

I don't know why it upsets me. I'm not sure if it's because a friend is, to me, insulting himself. Is it because my little sister is half Mexican? I don't know. 

I grew up in a community where the n-word was prominent, but I was always taught never to say it, let alone to refer to myself as such.

566,"My dad has literally zero etiquette when it comes to eating. He is 55 years old, and still does not know how to be polite when eating. Every time we eat, he slouches at the dinner table. He never sits straight, and he talks with his mouth full of food. He drinks water really loud, and he often just lifts up his plate and shoves food into his mouth with a fork. To makes things worse, my dad never wears a shirt at the dining table during the summer, and it's gross to have to be around him, especially considering the fact that he is overweight and has long, unshaved armpit hair.

And he eats really impolitely too. When my mom cooks something like tacos, my dad just scoops a lot of ground beef and chicken fajitas and cheese into his plate, and leaves like two small spoonfuls for everyone else. Yet when we have something like brussel sprouts or beets, my dad gets some of it, says he doesn't like the way it tastes, and then  he just shoves it into someone else's plate.

He constantly burps and farts at the dining table. I try so hard not to freak out when he does that. He thinks it's funny, but it's disgusting and uncivilized to do that. For example, we'd just be eating and talking about the news or something and then my dad suddenly lets out a loud burp, and everyone gives him a dirty look. He always eat too fast, and he burps after wolving down food. Sometimes, he even sticks one of his hands down his pants, and it's super annoying when he does that.

570,"Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to include enough details. We are in our mid-late 20s. I’m black (F), he’s white. Not important but, we met at a music festival as complete strangers. We love telling this story cause music is a HUGE part of our lives so the fact that we met at a music event is very special to us. AND we later learned that we actually were standing next to each-other and just did not know it 3 months prior to meeting at a different concert before the festival, lol.  Especially wild considering we come from two very different worlds and upbringings, odds of our paths crossing was so low, which you’ll learn more about later. 

Where to begin. My husbands mom is very close to your average “monster in law.” She started off really great, but as my now husband and I started getting closer as time went on, pre-marriage, she grew more nasty. For some backround, I got an athletic scholarship to a great school, have my masters, make good money, financially independent. My husband, never completed college, hard-worker, makes decent money, but has definitely had a bit harder path not having a degree, but he is making it work and is working hard on a more lucrative career path. But that does not bother me at all, I love him and we have a wonderful life together, he is my bestfriend, the most amazing person I know, and we’re expecting our first child!

Well, this is where her nasty side really came out. We had a miscarriage in the spring, that my husband did not tell her about until close to the end of June because it was just a really hard time for us and we’re grown adults, mommy doesn’t need to know everything right away. Well she actually found out cause his grandmother “accidentally” told her. Whether that’s true or not, idc. So she calls my husband pissed off and angry he did not tell her, not once, to this day, has she showed any level of empathy towards me, it was and still is a daily battle, even tho im pregnant again, and she is pissed about that too. Mad that I’m having a rainbow baby. 

Again, has never once asked me how I’m grieving or checked in on the new baby. Also, can’t leave out she tried to dictate to my husband when we should get married and actually told me my last serious relationship would have ended in divorce anyway, so i should basically learn from that and wait till “she thinks its a good time to get married.” 

She actually tried to turn my husband against me at one point. Obviously did not work, but WTF. So I find myself wondering, wtf is her problem? The reason I’m starting to think she’s possibly prejudice/racist is because my husband has grown ALOT, since we’ve been together. Finally moved out his fucking hometown, started eating foods his mother swears he never liked, doing new things generally, etc etc (this makes my husband sound like a baby, but im from the NE high-populated/cultured area, been traveling since i was like 1, he’s from a small town in the south where most people never leave and have not experienced much outside their comfort zones. we were brought up VERY different. Which is honestly cool
because we learn ALOT from eachother). 

side note: His mother is VERY manipulative, her way, or she’s grouchy and cranky. 

I’ve never talked to her about politics and she automatically assumed i’m “anti-trump” which i am, but did you just assume that cause I’m black? i have NEVER shared my political views with her or anyone in his family, EVER. Yet she constantly wants to point out our “differing views” and HATES when i prove her wrong. Which I’m not even trying to do, like we’re grown adults, you’re my MIL, this should not feel like a battle. I guess I should add she is a anything fox news says is the truth type person. 

I do come from money, full transparency my family always has my back if I need with money. She hates that too. His extended family has money, but his parents were late bloomers with their own money and so now that they are doing amazing financially its like she gets upset when she learns i’ve already experienced a lot of what they are just now being able to. IT’S NOT A COMPETITION LADY. 

Anyways, I know this is all over the place it just makes no sense. I’m not egocentric at all, but I mean I have my shit together for the most part (well, as much as adults can in this insane world). Yet all she feels is anger and hate towards me especially, even after we experienced a horrific loss and then a miracle. It makes me feel like their has to be a bigger issue and prejudice/racist is the first thing I think of. His sister has THREE kids, which she helps with and helps support, and I can’t even get some empathy for atleast the tragic loss? I mean I had to drive myself alone to the ER when I realized I was losing the baby, it was completely traumatic. My husband was trying to leave work, but I could not wait. As I said, overtime her mean side started to show more and more, but now it just feels like hate and at this time there is no chance i’ll let her be in our childs life, which is extremely sad to me. This whole thing is sad. Idk what I’ve done so wrong for her to harbor so much hate towards me, to the point that she does
not give a shit about my health or the health of the current baby. Makes me sad, so i’m here, just wondering what some of your thoughts are?",12Aug2020,1

He has continued to unfollow and follow my social media accounts, actually respond to my instagram stories and then delete the responses and last night, coincidentally after I reactivated my twitter to give my followers an update on what’s happening in my life (nothing to do with him, they were worried about me), someone tried to hack my personal twitter for the third time. He also follows one of my friends on instagram. 

Last night I did some digging and have found his sister and his mum’s facebook accounts. I want him to stop, but, as I said in my previous post, I don’t have enough evidence that the police would deem “legit” I don’t think. He uses a VPN so that when he attempts to hack my twitter, twitter can’t detect where the hacker is. I do have a lot of strong (and i mean STRONG) evidence that it’s this man, just not for police involvement. 

My friends have recommended blocking him first, seeing how he reacts (whether he makes a fake account to harass me with / messages my friends the private info he has on me) and then contacting his family. I did block him last night, but then I unblocked because I’m terrified of my friends finding out this information he has on me. Plus I have solid evidence this finsta of his is his account. If he uses another account then I have nothing on him. 

I’m wondering if contacting his family will prevent him from doing it at all and just leaving me alone. It could do the complete opposite and cause him to lash out.

I don't look after myself when it comes to overall health and hygiene, I'm a mess of a person.

 I'll spend countless hours looking through ways to escape this to find good solid advice but for what? I never act upon it. it's like I'm only doing it to please myself subconsciously, to convince myself that I'm working towards changing, but in reality, I know that I won't take the advice and make changes because deep down I don't want to change. It's weird, I want to change but I don't want to at the same time, to change would be having to put in the effort which I'm not willing to do.

 Nowadays I've been getting frustrated with myself, and have been having suicidal thoughts, it would be much easier to end my life than live. but id never be able to go through with that, it'd ruin too many lives in the process. So yeah, I'm stuck in somewhat of a limbo, battling these thoughts. I want to get out of this, but I need to become someone who's willing to make an effort, and I have no idea how to do so. I feel lost. 

I used to be someone who was motivated by threats, such as getting kicked out of school if I didn't do my work stuff like that, getting my ass beat if I didn't listen to my parents. but nowadays there's nothing I find to be a threat. in my mind if I was kicked out of home, I wouldn't mind being homeless. I know how horrible it is to be homeless, but the way I see it is that if I was ever in a situation where I'd go homeless id probably just off myself, due to the discomfort id feel being homeless. so its soo hard to kick myself into gear, I honestly need some sense beaten into me.

Where do I go from here? what should I do?",12Aug2020,1
581,"Been working as management for a company for the last year, during lockdown my directors decided to start working in london(I’m in a different city a few hundred miles away) and my partner was high risk and my father was sick so they agreed to let me work from home.

My coworker went to London with them(this was in May) and we recently went and got drunk together and he told me that while they were working down south, the topic of “let’s fire XXX” because they were annoyed that they had to pay me furlough payment and not be on call to travel the country. Now lockdown is over, work is back to normal but I’m so angry that they even talked about this because I had worked so hard for so long to get their company back on track and making money. If I were to show the emails and texts I was shown to HMRC the company could be done for fraud and would have to pay back all their furlough payments, but it would put them out of business. 

The director in question to suggested sacking me has left the company but the fact that the topic even came up and nobody told me until now has made me mad as hell.

583,"Hello!

So there is this man, whose friend request I mistakenly accepted. Let's call him Mr A, probably in his mid 40s to 50s. I do not personally know him but I've heard of Mr A because he was affiliated with my old high school, an all-boys' high school. We have a hundred mutual friends on Facebook—most being former students (possibly of his) and higher-ups from said school.

So he randomly added me, and I mistakenly accepted his friend request. Normally, I do not accept friend requests of people I never encountered personally, but I accepted otherwise because we have mutual friends. He was a higher-up himself; I remember canvassing my old grade school yearbook (elementary and high school yearbooks are merged into one) and I saw him there, IIRC he was a subject head or something. 

So I accepted him. After accepting him, Mr A would like my posts, but not like all of my posts. Just occasional. Nothing too strange.

But a few weeks ago,  I started getting a creepy vibe when he commented on one photo of a male Korean celebrity I adored, ""I actually thought it was you!"" 

It was random, I would never expect receiving a comment from a man I never met, remarking that I resemble this very handsome Korean celebrity. I mean, I should be flattered, right?

So I gave it the benefit of the doubt; I did not give a reaction to the comment. Probably I'm overthinking, probably he's genuinely nice.

Today, I shared on Facebook stories an accident that happened just recently; I was just showing my wound that was recently treated. He messaged me, ""What happened?""

To say, Mr A was genuinely concerned. But the RANDOMNESS of it raises red flags. I repeat; I was never his student, I never met Mr A, nor chanced upon one another. When I first entered high school. he was not even teaching already. I do not know the circumstances why. To add, I'm male, and in my early 20's.

Right now, I'm discerning whether to remove him off my friends list. I would go ahead and remove him, but the possibility of just making assumptions is what's stopping me. I don't want to be the asshole.

What if he is genuinely concerned, or probably just wants to make friends online? Even though he has never solicited nor implied sexual favors from me, I am aware and terrified of stories of lurkers and predators online, and also of old men trying to hit up young men. I am also fearing he probably might have saved my photos and/or he would retaliate in case he finds out I removed him. 

What should I do? Regardless of overthinking, would it be OK to remove Mr A?

Sorry for the long post, but thank you for reading nonetheless.

TL;DR: Should I remove this person—while not exhibiting explicitly peculiar behavior, exudes creepy vibes—off my friends' list?",12Aug2020,1

My father died seven years ago. He was depressed and an alcoholic and slowly lost his touch with the world.
Me and my mother moved out three years before his death to the apartment we're still living in. It was a rush. We lived in a big house and to this day, or tiny apartment is still messy because we own too much stuff....

This time, during summer vacation, I planned to finally get rid off this mess and started with cleaning the storage room where I found... Well. The title says it. My mothers nudes. Thousands of pictures my father took of her, laying all loose in a box.
I kinda already knew that those photos existed, I just didn't know where they were because my mother (obviously) didn't tell me.

Now, I'm holding them in my hands, unsure about what the hell I'm supposed to do with them.

Usually it’s a fox jumping over the fence or something when that happens.

But this morning I noticed just one thing out of place - my boots.
They were wet and I left them outside to dry - might not’ve been a wise idea in hindsight lol.
Anyway, they were lined up by the fence under the ladder, now one is still there but the other is randomly in the middle of my garden just lying there on the floor.

What could’ve done this? Would a fox just pick a boot up and drag it half way down the garden and then leave it there?
Or could someone have been fucking around in my garden?

I feel awful when she comes home from work in tears because she cannot walk across the damn parking lot. 

We tried to work through it with yoga and exercise bikes but they had minimal effect on the swelling. She's got an appointment today with a new (3rd) doctor about possible solutions and I feel like this is near the end of options she has I guess. Shes taken humera, had surgery, and late 60s chemo drugs which have had no effect.

603,"I’ve lived in a four-person student apartment for the last year and am getting two new roommates this week. This apartment comes furnished with a couch (fits 3-4), a chair, and 4 dining chairs and tables, etc..

When I moved in last year the whole place was already decorated so me and my roommates didn’t have much choice in what it looked like. Some of these decorations included one of those huge bean bag chairs that took up all of the window space in the living room. This made the apartment look super small and dark (we have a view of an alleyway and it partially blocked the little bit of sun we do get.)

I didn’t want to be like that roommate so I’ve been in contact with the new roommates to see what kinds of stuff they have/want to buy. One of them has this loveseat type couch that she wants to put under the window (there’s really no where else for it to go.) My other roommate that renewed with me and I don’t really want it there because we know it’ll make the living room look really small and I currently have a cat tree and one of those fancy covered litter boxes that look like end tables over there.

We may also be fined up to $400 for having something blocking the door to the air conditioning unit (student living apartments have shitty rules.)

So, I (21F) am currently a bachelors degree student, and enrolled in a Business and Organizational Leadership program. I receive enough financial aid to pay for almost all of my classes, and I’ll be done with my degree in about 4-5 semesters. 

However, I am not planning to go into business. I am wanting to teach English at the middle school level, but a bachelors program for secondary education in English would take me about 6 semesters, and cost more. 

I absolutely do not want to be majoring in business. I have no desire to take business classes and my current program outline sounds like the most boring nightmare I could ever go through. I know I would love every second of my program if I did the English education degree. I would be starting in the spring after taking the math portion of the teaching certification exam, and then be able to do about 3-4 semesters of coursework and then 2 semesters of internships. 

I think I’m so conflicted on it because I want to be able to start teaching as soon as possible, but I also want to be the best educator I can be and have a thorough background in what it is I want to teach.

609,"This might be longish, I’m sorry.

Background:
I’m 22F. I’ve dealt with depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and adhd since high school. All of this gave me a very strange relationship with schooling. I got by doing the minimums until a depressive episode really hit me senior year. I graduated and went off to college but unfortunately that’s really just more school. I shut down being all alone and half way through just stopped going to classes, ate very little each day, and was just really not doing so good.

After my first semester I told my parents I couldn’t go back for my own health and they supported me. I went to live with them and got a job bartending and it really helped me recover. I’ve learned I can be very successful in a work atmosphere. I can go to my shift, be present, work hard, and then go home and decompress. I benefit strongly from being able to leave work at work and have free time be free time.

Now:
Since March, we have been self quarantining. I have asthma and autoimmune diseases (arthritis) that make me pretty high risk right now. I had money saved up and my boyfriend is getting unemployment (bartender as well) so we’ve been able to be comfortable staying home.

Recently I have been quite restless. I want to work but am terrified of my previous profession. Looking at other options, one I’ve always been interested in is becoming a pastry chef. It’s still in food service, it would be the back of house (no guest interaction), and I would enjoy learning this skill. This being said I have no professional experience working in this area. The best I have is working as a service bartender (making drinks for movie theater guests, stationed in the kitchen, high volume). I would love to find a job that would train me at a low level but I feel as though even low level bakery chefs need to know the basics. 

All of this being said, an option that has come up is a one year certificate program in the pastry arts at a local community college. It would be something to work on while the service industry struggles and after a year I could start a little higher than entry level jobs. I would also feel much more confident with knowledge of the craft before working for someone. Plus the college’s safety protocols seem legit so hopefully I wouldn’t get sick. 

Looking back to my previous school experience, I’m scared. This program seems exciting to me but I’m afraid I would just fail again or get overwhelmed. My boyfriend says he bet there wouldn’t be as many papers or traditional homework, but I know myself and I’m worried the moment I have to work on something at home I won’t be able to focus or start. Apparently with adhd, starting tasks can be difficult and I definitely relate to that symptom. 

I have to make this decision by the end of August because that’s when it starts and it all seems so fast. Each day that passes I get more and more anxious. I made an appointment with my therapist but it’s not until September so I have to decide by then.

Essentially what I’m asking is, should I apply? Should I go through with this program? How do I get over this paralyzing fear that I’m just going to shut down all over again? Would I be better off applying to jobs a little out of my league in hopes of on the job training?

I was browsing a subreddit from an alternate account for a niche kink that is localized for that country. I don’t want to mention which one it is. But this kink is one her and I explored in our relationship. 

On my feed, was a picture that I IMMEDIATELY knew was hers. The eyes and top of the face is blacked out, but the way she is standing, her hand pose, her height, body, complexion, even the diamond earrings she always used to wear are sort of visible. 

It’s her but I cannot be sure. She would never use Reddit. 

I messaged the user who posted it saying that she looks familiar. And the user immediately deleted their account. 

I checked out the user’s posts and they all seem to be titled with Frank Ocean and Post Malone lyrics. Both artists we were really into. And they’re pictures of the same dick. With some comments being on other kinky subreddits. 

So, here are my possibilities: 

1. I could be dead wrong and missing her and finding ways to be close to her, but I don’t get any feelings when I think of her. I’m in a relationship for a year now and a lot has happened including me changing countries, starting a new job, etc. This is all just an elaborate trick my mind is playing on me.

2. It is her. And she’s started using Reddit. Unlikely but hey it’s 2020. Stranger things have happened. But then, why delete the account? Perhaps she felt that someone recognized her and could out her for doing kinky stuff on Reddit.

3. It’s a boyfriend or a jealous ex, with bad intentions. Probably why the rest of the photos are of a dick and only one is of hers. And this is revenge porn or something equally disgusting. 

4. It’s a boyfriend. And she’s okay with him using her pictures on Reddit. Extremely unlikely. But I felt like putting it out there.

Long story short, I (26M) had a stroke 4 months ago and I have been stuck in a different country, as I wanted to go back to Spain (where all my family lives atm) due to covid. 

Both my parents have pre-existing health conditions that put them at high risk of dying from covid. Doctors have strongly emphasised that they are at a huge risk if they were to get it.

They are in their early 60s and I have been feeling like they are getting more and more stubborn when it comes to certain tasks and mindsets. Showering, taking care of themselves, forcing themselves beyond their physical limits, etc. 

Recently everything has turn into a constant argument with them, meaning my brother and I are trying to make them understand what the doctors say and the severity of the situation and how they’re living their lives at the moment is detrimental to their health. 

They are still going out and going to work (exposed to the public), they are getting depressed and they are neither seeking help nor accepting the fact they need it.

We did not win, and I eventually gave up on getting VC money. William still stayed on though. He was looking for a job but had very little work experience, so working for my business was helpful for him in that. I still do nearly everything but it takes stuff off my plate having him around. He completely manages the company twitter account and chat widget, helps reply to emails, and other various activities (test new features I make, cover me on non technical tasks when I'm unavailable, occasionlly I've borrowed money from him that I pay back etc). 

Fast forward to the past 2 months. We've grown to be best friends. The plan worked. William got a good break, I gave him a glowing recommendation, and he has started the job. While it isn't perfect, he really likes it. Despite having no reason to, he still has been volunteering to help me with my business. I do very much appreciate it but had been wondering what he expected to get from it. He mentions the 20 percent sometimes and I wasnt sure if he was serious. I told him we didn't get in and I have not been mentioning that in any paperwork and we'd have to negotiate if he wanted to have that part. He was uninterested in that or as if he was joking

Fast forward this week. Turns out he has been interested in me for at least a year if not the whole time. I've been described as clinically aloof, so I guess I missed the hints. He just said he'd like to be in a relationship. Honestly, I just have no energy to even consider being in a relationship with anyone. I think he gets that message but I am now wanting to rethink his role in the business. Not mixing business and relationships is pretty much the golden rule. I didn't ever want to be in that position but now I am and I think it's gonna be a fight between us.

I think he will be upset and maybe feel like I'm punishing him. I am not sure he understands that he wasn't an official part of the business. I work full time on it so it's really special to me, yet I also want to keep our friendship. Any advice?

Tldr: What I thought was just a business partnership turned into best friends, to romantic interests. I think trying to separate may mean the death of my friendship",12Aug2020,1
623,"Over the last few years, I've been letting go and moving on from previous life goals or ""hopes and dreams"", because it felt like it just didn't make sense to keep holding on to things that just aren't in the cards for me. Sometimes, we just have to accept that not everyone is cut out for everything, you know?

And I'm at a place now where I feel like I really don't ""want"" anything now. Which is kind of peaceful on one hand. But on the other, it kind of makes life feel a bit... empty? I've always been driven by ""want"".

Now, I just don't know what I ""want"" out of life. I've been pondering it over for quite a while, now, and I just can't figure it out. And I really don't like this aimless, directionless feeling I'm left with. I don't know what to do.",12Aug2020,1
624,"Hello. I am going to try to make this as short as I can. I have gone to post so many times regarding this issue but always decide against it, but now it's really starting to get to me.

About 3 years ago my (I am 28)neighbor (I have no idea her age, maybe 40s? She is married and has 2 kids) and my mom (early 60s) started having arguments about my neighbors putting up a fence. Basically it meant that some trees of ours would be cut down and my mom claims that where they wanted the fence would have been on our property, so she said no. This caused a lot of hostility between my neighbor and my mom but I just kept out of it at the time.

A few months later we were having our family over for a birthday party. All was going well until we decided to go outside. My mom had told my family about the fight with the neighbors and how they continue to be rude anytime we saw them. As I was playing with my nieces, we noticed the woman was sitting on her back steps staring at us. I felt sort of uncomfortable but I tried to ignore her. My niece thought it would be funny to start twerking..so she did. I could almost sense that my neighbor was going to say something, and sure enough she yelled out that that was disgusting. This ended up causing a yelling match between me and the woman, and my niece was crying because she was freaked out. I do admit that I said some pretty rude things to the lady, but she just wouldn't stop. She was telling me to go fight her and that I am pathetic etc. 

After that day, she started to harass me anytime I wen't outside. Sometimes I would yell something back but for the most part I just wanted to be left alone. I think she can sense how stressed out she makes me and that eggs her on to keep going. As of now we have had to call the cops on her 3 times (she also called on us once because I started recording her) and the cops were really nice and understanding, but didn't have much to offer in terms of advice except for using headphones outside or planting tall bushes to kind of hide her view of us (because she will sit and stare and give the finger. She also has a dog that barks like crazy at us and she eggs that on too.) 

We did plant some bushes (a bunch of them went bad after a few weeks so we had to redo it) and I no longer look in her direction or even do anything that could get her going, and yet she keeps at it. She says I look like a man, that she wants to call children's aid on us (my boyfriend has his son here for the week and she was watching us outside with him playing) has mentioned a lawyer? And just constantly talking about me loudly to her husband. I try my best to ignore it but even with headphones on I know she's there and it's driving me insane.

We had a lot of loss in our family the past few years. My mom and I have been working on a garden outside to kind of lift the mood and make a nice place for us to hangout and this woman is ruining it. None of us want to go outside because the minute she hears our door she heads out too with her dog.

What can I do to fix this? I am losing sleep over the anxiety and I just want peace here.

Thank you guys I apologize for the length!",12Aug2020,1

 it so intense though. i feel that even they get a bit creeped out on some of the things i do? i send them a bunch of messages and then delete them in hopes they didnt actually see them. sometimes they do and send a sentence and i have to wait again until they reply, which by then im guessing theyre not busy since they reply alot more and not just one sentence. 

my mind is so cloudy at the moment too and my stomach feels like it's killing me. i want to think that maybe its just a phase but ive genuinely havent really felt ok for about 5 years now. i care too much about my connections with people and feel extremely lonley when someone dosent talk to me. ive even heavily really considered suicide it's that bad.

630,"I have very subtle upper lip hair on my face. I wouldn’t call it a moustache because it most definently isn’t that. It is barely noticeable but it still makes me so uncomfortable and I’m starting to believe myself in thinking that my “friends” just think of me as the moustache girl. 

I don’t think it is to noticeable but I have just gotten really self conscious about it since one of my friends’ stupid brother told me I looked like I had a moustache in front of the whole group. After that incident I just got up and left and ignored them when they asked where I was going.

633,"this is a bit of a ramble but i feel at the end of my rope. i don’t know what’s actually wrong versus what my parents tell me is wrong. 

i’m twenty-one and living at home this semester due to covid-19. i’ve actually been home for a while though due to a cancelled abroad semester. 

i’m the oldest of three and share a room with an eighteen year old going off to college. i’m super close with my sisters but the way my parents let them off the hook for everything makes me resent my family a little. the room i share was my room before i went off to college. my parents were really strict about it being cleaned every week. i had to dust the fan, clean my desk off, sweep the floor. really simple stuff. if i didn’t do this, i was yelled at for like thirty minutes minimum. however, my sister hasn’t cleaned the room once in three years. no exaggeration. she doesn’t dust anything and she throws her papers/clothes on the floor or wherever. i ask her to clean and she just doesn’t. i ask my parents to ask her to clean and they yell at me for telling them what to do. she’s leaving in three days and hasn’t boxed up anything like i had to when i left for college. i complained about it and they told me to do it myself. that’s me going through her closet, packing up her books, and sorting her papers. i don’t think i should have to do that just because my sister doesn’t want to. i would gladly help her but i don’t want to do that myself.

another problem i have is with money. when we turned eighteen, we all got some money from my grandparents. it wasn’t a lot but it’s been very helpful. as soon as i turned eighteen, my parents stopped paying for stuff. it was kind of fine but annoying when it comes to doctors appointments and groceries. however, my sister is almost nineteen and they don’t make her pay for anything. she orders takeout for herself on their card. she hasn’t had to pay for doctors visits, my parents do it for her. any clothes, snacks, video games, they pay for. part of me is happy she can save her money the way i wish i had. the other is jealous that my parents helped her out financially but not me. 

kind of related to that is my situation with groceries. my parents have never been great about stocking the fridge. when they do, it’s the same unhealthy and cheap food from our childhood. this isn’t because of money, because my parents eat out half the week. if i want fruit, healthy snacks, or a drink that isn’t coke, i buy it myself because my parents will not. this is kind of annoying. even worse is when they eat my food that they make me buy. i feel dramatic getting upset that  that i wake up and my mom ate all the fruit i bought or my dad finishes my orange juice and throws it away but this has happened for years and i don’t do that to them. 

my family has always taught me that family is the most important thing and you always forgive each other no matter what. when i complain about these things my parents tell me to stop. they’ll tell me i’m not the parent. or that they buy groceries that i eat too.

i want space in this family. which includes having my own room once my sister leaves. as of now, we have opposite sleeping schedules which means i wake up at 8 am and she sleeps till 2 pm. so i don’t have a room for 6 hours, leaving me sit in the living room or just leave the house. 

i don’t want to sound whiny or ungrateful, which is how i feel when i complain about this stuff but i want my parents to start respecting me and giving me space. please give me some advice.",12Aug2020,1
634,"so i don’t know whether to text my landlord and apologize or to just let this go. it’s kind of a long story but i’ll try to summarize:

basically, my apartment (that i just moved into) is in a really weird location—it’s on the BACK of another apartment with the same address and so all my packages kept getting delivered to the wrong stairwell, which i didn’t have access to. so my packages kept getting lost or stolen. i told my landlord and he agreed to install a custom code for my roommate and i so we can access our packages in the future. 
i had to explain the situation to my mom, who is extremely overbearing and controlling (she used to be so abusive both physically and emotionally that my brother called the cops on her). so in short she’s a REALLY difficult person and a huge narcissist. she texted my landlord a “disturbing text” (his words) about how he needs to refund us for whatever packages got stolen, and he was very upset with me yesterday. as he should’ve been because it’s just plain inappropriate, but she doesn’t get that. we’ve had this problem before, one of my old teachers literally wanted to sue her for threatening messages etc. 

anyway, i apologized to him over the phone but i didn’t say much because i didn’t even know how to explain that my mom is just crazy. should i text him or just let it pass? i know that seems like a simple thing but i have severe social anxiety and it’s been weighing on me, i can’t feel comfortable knowing someone is upset with me. but i don’t want to press the issue any more than i have to.",12Aug2020,1

I’ve been friends with this girl. Let’s call or Jiya. We’ve been friends for about 8 years (on and off) and I’ve accepted her flaws and I  compromise things to maintain a friendship with her. If things don’t really go her way she gets upset.. and it’s little things like hang out sessions and activities.
There were times we would go months not talking but eventually would be friends again 
So Jiya has this boyfriend and I’m going to call him Shawn 
I find Shawn to be very condescending and annoying, and I wouldn’t be friends with him.. like ever.. but since he’s her boyfriend I didn’t want to say  much because she doesn’t handle criticism well.
So I’ve hung out with both of them along with my boyfriend on group dates, and it’s been really off putting.
I’m from California and Shawn always says really negative things about it..even though he’s not from there and has no clue what he’s talking about. He’s one of those people who don’t really think much before talking which is fine to me but it gets a little weird from time to time
I’m going to give a list of incidences and I just need someone to tell me if I’m over reacting or not
1. The first time we (my boyfriend and I) invited Jiya and Shawn over he said “I wasn’t expecting your house to be like this nice considering the area you guys live is really old” 
2. He also said I looked really tired the second he stepped in our door for the first time after I just showered and prepared our lunch 
3. We went on a hike and he lost his phone and then we called it and someone answered saying that would wait for us to come down and pick it up and his reaction was “thank god I live in Canada ..had it been California some Pedro would have stolen it” 
4. My boyfriends mother was cooking food for us and he’s like “wow I can tell that her cooking by herself is really bothering Jiya and she really wants to help” but like..my boyfriends mother didn’t want any help..or she would have asked me.. 
5. Then we said I shop at places like Walmart and Shawn laughed and said Jiya would never step foot in any of those places..
This is just a few things I remember.. I don’t really know how to feel because I just find him so off putting. 
And she isn’t perfect either, no one is but can can someone please tell me if I’m over reacting on not wanting to spend anymore time with them?",12Aug2020,1

640,"This is gonna be kind of lengthy (TL; DR at the bottom) but it's something that has been hurting me a majority of my life.
My mom (52 yo) suffers from a colorful variety of mental illnesses (bipolar, psychosis, BPD, pretty much anything you can think of) and had endured a lot of trauma/abuse during her lifetime. She's also physically disabled w degenerative disc disorder and fibromyalgia.

Raising my sisters (29 &amp; 22) and I (24F), she was pretty neglectful and when she wasn't, she was abusive. She kept a lot of stuff hidden from us about our dad who we thought was almost perfect, turns out he had sexually/emotionally abused her throughout their 15 years relationship. 

That being said, my older sis and I were assigned the parent role in taking care of our youngest. 29 yo held the motherly nurturing position and I was meant to be/turned out as the level-headed, ""get your shit together"" one. 
I enlisted 5 years ago and got stationed across the country and my younger sister went to college in a different state.
The oldest ended up being my mom's full time care taker, then ended up having her first schizophrenic episode 3 years ago and has struggled w her mental illness since then. 

Recently, the news came from our mom about dad sexually abusing her and having certain addictions etc, so the one stable parent I had got thrown out the window. I've felt so helpless being across the country, but trying to be there for my mom is so emotionally draining when I have my own trauma to heal from.

My psychiatrist said that Im not her therapist or parent to vent about her trauma to, arguments w my dad, things she needs that I can't help with if it hurts me. She has her own therapist, but she can only afford going so much.

She needs someone to talk to, but she doesn't know who or how to connect with others who aren't as ""mentally fragile"" as me, especially during a pandemic.

643,"Just wanted to know your honest opinions (no sugarcoating) on how for me to improve (a little backstory follows):

So I (20y dude) just finished my first year psychology (65% girls) of Uni (college) in the Netherlands (very heavy student city) and I managed to enter and leave without even having 1 friend or good acquaintance. I lived on my own in a small studio. Now I live in shared housing with 2 others but I don't want to disturb em too much and occasionally talk (we all go our separate lives)

I attended all my lectures/small group practicals physically until corona. Yet I didn't talk with my fellow ""classmates"" too much mainly because I just keep to myself and if someone engages I respond friendly and ask them something in return.

Free time I went to the gym (serious lifter) I do my thing/help out if somebody directly asks. Also, I went to a local dutch MMA club I focused on training and talked like where I could improve 2-3 sentences (mainly cause I don't speak dutch) and went home. Also, I worked graveyard shifts delivering food.

Main interests are:

* I like fishing in the canals (not a lot of students like that)
* Army/war (special forces/paratrooper mainly I desire to join asap) I don't go on rants or anything about it cause I know it's not as interesting for others (not a lot of young college students want to serve after in combat mos)
* extreme sports/hard training (there a lot of creative arts/drama clubs but none tailored specifically to this).
* I love very dark jokes etc. but not around ""classmates"" cause I know it might be sensitive to them.
* Music taste is rock (black sabbath and military-themed songs - think Vietnam war songs/USMC warrior song) dislike pop/rap although with enough alcohol it's tolerable.

I just can't seem to find my kind of people.

I didn't attend any house parties or had any nights out which makes me very sad as those are always fun. What could I change? Except for being more proactive in engaging to convos which is one area I know I have to improve vastly.

646,"So about 4 months ago I met a girl as a language partner as we wanted to learn each other's language and practice speaking, correct our writing etc. We've had, almost weekly, skype sessions of an average of 2 hours to practice speaking and listening. It's very casual, we basically just talk about anything and everything and we've come to known each other quite well. I think I can safely say we think of each other as friends now. Next to that, I don't have many friends so she's been a real life saver for me to keep me from being lonely. And here's where the problems start. 

To preface this, even though I quite like her and could see myself in a potential relationship with her, I don't think this will ever develop into a relationship, simply because we live in other parts of the word and her ambitions and future plans are completely opposite to mine. 

The last 2 weeks or so, I've been having this annoying feeling of wanting to know what she's up to more and more. We had our last skype session 2 days ago but she was very tired and said she would let me know again when she was less tired and able to talk. Even in such a short timespan I'm wondering throughout the day when she will contact me again. And should I contact her or would that pressure her? Is Friday maybe a good time to contact her again if she hasn't contacted me yet? She said she had plenty of time these 2 weeks as she needs to self-quarantine so why can't she talk? These thoughts just drift through my mind throughout the day and I don't really like it. 

I don't want to distance myself from her as I think we both still enjoy talking with each other and learning from each other, but I want to get rid of this obsessiveness as I think it might hurt the friendship that we have, and it just makes me feel miserable, knowing that's it starting to become a problem and I'm relying too much on her company.

Honestly searched for this subreddit out of desperation. Sorry if this sounds petty and unwarranted. Its kind of a long one. 

So I (M, 22) have been having a lot of curveballs thrown at me as of late and it is bringing me down. I had the first nervous breakdown I have had in quite a while due to the stresses of my career, my home projects, relationship and... well honestly just with me. 

Im not happy about who I am, and I am not even sure what about me I am not happy with. My family considers me successful. I make enough money to support my hobbies (Cars, if anyone is curious) and I will be moving out of my parent’s house soon with no debt. My girlfriend is amazing, and my parents/family largely are good to me. 

I honestly do not enjoy my job. I am a heavy equipment mechanic/technician and although I do like working on things, I hate the atmosphere. The people here are just as stereotypical as you think they are (refusing to wear masks, talk about their sex lives, football, etc). Not that there is anything wrong with that environment for some, but it really isn’t for me and because of this I have never really been able to make friends or have any substance walking through that door. Im okay at my job, I have been there 4 years, and the money is okay. I can stand doing it, but I wish I didn’t have to. Most people probably feel this way about their jobs, too. It’s life.

My girlfriend and I are very close, but she is an introvert and I am an extrovert. Because of this it is easier for me to make her feel better when she is down. She doesn’t really like being around me when I am upset and I honestly completely understand. I wouldn’t want to burden her with this... 

which sounds kind of cruel when I am forcing all of you to read it... 

anyway, 

My hobbies I really don’t enjoy anymore. I have been building a vintage jeep in my garage for 2 and a half years. For anyone that knows projects like this, they are tedious and take knowledge and time. I feel as though I judge this project as a reflection of my mechanical skills, and such a reflection of my skills in my career. So when something goes wrong on this project, no matter how minuscule, it really hurts my confidence and completely tanks my mood. Its hard to see why I even started this project, and the worst part is its supposed to be what I am good at!

So that brings me to here: I am moving out in October. I need a car that will get me through a midwestern winter and my jeep was supposed to be that car. Its about finished, but I can’t enjoy it after building it because I know everything that could fail because it was assembled by me. Its nerve wracking. I also need to find a way to settle these issues alone so I don’t burden my girlfriend/bring her down, as she is dealing with a lot too. And I really need to figure out what I am going to do with my life career wise, as I chose this industry with the only thoughts being free college, a job and good pay. Never once did I consider how unfit for it I am mentally.

I am truly, and utterly lost. I am currently enrolled in mental health therapy, but I have been in and out of therapy for 7 years. Ive been on prescribed drugs for my anxiety, too, and I really don’t have anyone in my life I feel like I can ask for advice. I know there is stuff I am leaving out.

650,"I fucked up and snooped her phone one day, and noticed messages between a friend and her. All the messages from the time we were dating were innocent and nothing to worry about. One conversation however was questionable.. My girlfriend usually sends me a sexy text, but that same exact text was sent to him. She continued talking to him and went on with it. When I confronted her, she told she accidentally sent it to him by mistake.
She has told me that they usually joke around sexual banter, but it was only banter. I’m confused because everything was normal texting up to that point, and then the following conversations nothing else was sent illicit. She gave me her passwords, asked me if I wanted to look at her phone, just to make me trust her. At that point we were very good, she told me she loved me, I changed her mind on having more kids, and that she wanted to live with me and have a future with me. Am I just overthinking everything? It’s been 5 months ago and she hasn’t made any contact. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1
651,"I remember in 2016 I helped get a friend clean. She got herself messed up quick with meth, down a real tough path. I'd go to help her out and such with rides, moving things, just the start. Until the third time going to her place, she was under the influence, paranoid due to the drugs, while multiple men were there, attempting to get with her. So I legit had to convince her to get our of her own home as she lay on her floor bound mattress with another random dude lying near her and caressing her, while she is visibly uncomfortable while also mumbling other incoherent babblings. I can go into more details however, it's inappropriate. I remember then she was evicted from there, with nowhere to go, so I took her in. She moved in with her dog and everything. Her dog trashes my apartment, peeing and pooping everywhere, tearing up my belongings. She would borrow my car as I worked long shifts. I'd buy her food, some other essentials to keep her going. She's stay at my place, in my den where she's make a home for herself. Fast forwarding, I invested a lot of myself into helping her, as her ""brother"" she would say, (which is all I ever wanted, not a nice guy). Finally I had to get her out because I couldn't afford to keep losing my things while helping her get healthy. After a month and a half of living with me, picking her up at the dancing club at 3am while working at 6am and other miscellaneous things the roomateship was done. So we agreed she would pay me for everything. And she would within a year or so.

We'll fast forward. Now she is a popular local fb personality, where she pretends to be all about good vibes, energy, chakra, astral projection. When I reached out to her April of last year, she told me that chapter in life is gone. She is also a published children's author and recently deactivated her fb after herself was just used. Like I know there is no legal ramifications for her actions. And I don't want any thanks or anything, just the money. She now says I wanted her, was trying to just get her, I give bad vibes, I am not a good person. More like you want to still get to where you're going but leaving behind a nasty carbon footprint and once you're called out for it, you create a situation in your favor from manipulation. 

I once viewed her as the definition of strength and a fantastic person, who came from so much pain. 

I mean it's been four years, this shouldn't bother me so much, I think it's the hypocrisy that kills me so much.

652,"Hello! Just for some information about me, I am a 20 year old female living off-campus in my second year of college. I'm currently working a retail job (mostly... it's complicated) and need some advice. Also, sorry for the length. I suck at paraphrasing.

&amp;#x200B;

Before Corona happened, I had only been working my job for about two and a half months and I enjoyed it for the most part. There was a team of four of us, all working part-time hours, running the store. It's a small, family-owned business. There are three locations of the store and the one I work at almost never (maybe once or twice a month) has a manager on site. We're also the smallest and least busy location by far. Two employees run the store each day from open-close. I get paid just above minimum wage for my state.

&amp;#x200B;

When Corona hit, my coworkers decided they were uncomfortable keeping our store open and it moved to be curbside only for a while and my hours were cut completely because they no longer needed two people working the store. I attempted to just apply for unemployment, but I wasn't eligible. So, I talked to my manager and told her I really need hours. She offered me a temporary job working at their headquarter location in the online sales, picking/packing orders, and tasks like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, our store moved back to regular in-person shopping hours, but I stayed in the warehouse unless I was needed in the retail store. About a month ago, I requested to be permanently transferred to the warehouse because I enjoy that much more than retail. They said they had already been considering it before I asked and would work to make it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one of my coworkers requested a transfer as well to the HQ location (to the retail store in the same building though, not warehouse). They immediately accepted her request. Now, the week that school starts (that's when her transfer begins) I was scheduled for 36 hours, spread out between 5 days a week, back at the retail store I originally worked at (I only worked 16 hours, two days a week, last semester). One of those days I had previously told her I had class and would not be able to work (oh yeah, just a reminder that I am a full-time college student taking 17 credit hours... my manager seems to think that because classes are online, I have much more free time...). My manager pretty much took my other coworker's hours (the one who transferred) and gave them to me. I talked to my manager about this and all she did was take me off of Thursdays and told me if I needed more time off I needed to talk to my other coworkers (now only two of them) and work it out with them. Well, obviously they aren't going to pick up extra hours so that didn't work in the slightest so now I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I could probably (I'm not joking) write a four-page essay on everything else wrong with this company (like how someone tested positive for COVID and then sent employees to be tested and bring them directly back to work from the testing site... 

&amp;#x200B;

or how then while I was still waiting for my test results to come back, I was scheduled to work the retail store and that started the worst drama I've ever seen where I was bullied into not coming into work and then my manager got mad and put me in the HQ location working retail instead... 

&amp;#x200B;

or how on Monday she texted me at 8 am and asked if I could work the HQ location (the retail part not warehouse) for a couple of hours and then left me alone in their busiest store that has a much larger selection and products we don't carry for five hours and I got so overwhelmed I nearly had a panic attack and then made my ""lunch break"" just driving back to the other location where I was originally meant to work so I had to eat in the car and didn't get any sort of actual break... (also keep in mind they wouldn't let me work alone while it was curbside business but when it comes to my manager needing to go somewhere they'll leave me alone )...

&amp;#x200B;

or how when I was there on Monday one of my coworkers asked me if I could ask management to send over some more cleaning supplies with me and they got mad that we were using too much cleaner...)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and let me just say COVID precautions are nonexistent. Our store has put into place some of our own restrictions, but it's still crazy little. The only precaution that is being taken in the HQ retail store is mandatory mask-wearing... but that's a law in our state now anyways. Trying on clothes is still allowed, dressing rooms get cleaned maybe once or twice a week, etc. We can't close down our dressing rooms but we take everything that's been tried on and hold it in the back for three days before putting it back out on the floor, and we clean each dressing room very thoroughly after every single person goes in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, sorry about that little tangent. I just want to make it clear that while my hours right now are the primary issue, there's been so many in the past. I'm mainly worried about having to work 28 hours right when school starts when all but one of my classes is online, and the one that's not is hybrid. I am a master procrastinator and I need time to work out how to do my classes efficiently and having to work all day is just going to make me demotivated to do the work. If I quit now, I still have to work those two weeks and I'm so afraid of getting behind in the first few weeks and not being able to catch back up. I'm also worried about quitting and not being able to find another job, or that job being even worse than this one.

What should I do?",12Aug2020,1
653,"It’s a lot to describe but I’m gonna try to sum it up as good as possible:


And like I wish I could talk to you in person cause it’s so much easier to say but I guess I’ll sum it up

This is what happened.
-I introduce her to the people I met in group chats before arriving to college. I know she doesn’t know many people and introduce her to all of us. We form a small little group of “friends” (that’s a strong word to use right now since we met literally less than a week ago) and now, basically she’s trying to suck it up to them and take them away from me. Like my old friend from high school is also at the same university as me and now she’s basically trying to take him too cause she claims she wants to “hang out with him”. I’m scared she’s going to take him away too. Anyways, When she goes out with the group I introduced her too, she never really invites me out with them. Like she’ll say “I’m going out with so and so, I’ll see you later”. And that’s usually it. I suspect she made a group chat with them and excluded me but I’m not too sure on that yet. She’s almost essentially breaking the group up. Now, I understand it’s early, and I also wasn’t expecting to be best friends with her (you’re not always best friends with your roommate) and I know she was gonna make other friends, however, the way she’s going about it rubs me the wrong way. 


-she then proceeds to basically ignore me and mingle with everyone else, but won’t introduce me to anyone else like I did for her. Last night, she went out with a group of people (that I also introduced her to) and didn’t even invite me or think about letting me go or the other people we were with. They were in the middle of an Uno game with the group I introduced her too, and as soon as I join the game, she says she’s getting ready to leave anyways and go out with a guy (who I actually think it’s cute, but that’s a story for another time). She leaves after I join and doesn’t even tell us where she’s going or who she’s going with. I don’t wanna sound clingy or obligated, but I just feel like it’s common sense to invite your newly found friends or your roommate to hang out with other people so we can all be social, especially when I or others have expressed wanting to go out and meet new people. It just rubs me the wrong way, once again. 


-goes out into big groups with people, doesn’t invite me like I did for her, keeps everything a secret. We’re all in the honors program, and there’s an honors group chat. Then some of the kids from the honors group chat went to another group chat called “Manhunt”, a game we planned on playing as a way to meet other honors students. Sort of like an honors meet up. I added her to that and told her to come with me (a huge mistake). She hit it off with them even tho she claims she isn’t easy and now (the big group I mentioned before) invited her and like 3 other girls and a whole bunch of other guys from the group chat to hang out with them, leaving me and the others from the OG group in the dust. 
(Basically what I summed up above, if you need clarification, let me know in the comments) 

-acts different around me now
When we talked over the summer through texting, she wanted to do laundry together, share each other’s locations for safety, walk together for each other’s safeties, etc. But now she does that with a girl i introduced her too and I feel like yesterday’s garbage when I’m with her.

-1 on 1 messages people in our group and makes plans with them without me or without anyone else.
Again, this sounds like I’m “obligated” to her and this is really more my fault, however, once I added her to the group chat with the other girls I talked too over the summer before college, she just instant messaged all of them and began developing close relationships with them and now it feels like they like me less and they like her more. Like I’m getting left in the dust. I wanna 1 on 1 message them, but I don’t even know what to talk about with them, and plus she’s already basically one upped me so it’s kinda hard to now. 



Like I don’t wanna be clingy but when we first met she was like “we do things together” “we know each others locations so we know each other is safe” and now that energy is gone. I don’t get it.  I feel like nothing but a stepping stone to her. I don’t wanna sound over dramatic or like I’m overthinking all of this, but I went through the whole “loser, unpopular, ugly” (that actually caused my depression, which lead to suicidal thoughts) phase in high school and I made it a goal to not go through that in college either and it feels like it’s gonna happen again already from this sequence of events. If you’ve seen my previous posts, I’ve really tried to go out and socialize, but everything is awkward and I’m failing, meanwhile, she’s flourishing and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m guessing it’s my looks and my awkwardness, but I can’t change that. I’m getting back to my depression/suicidal phase again and I really don’t wanna go back there.",12Aug2020,1
654,"I don’t know but a lot of the time I’m just kinda bummed out and sad even before the Pandemic, I know I’m not depressed, to use that term would be an exaggeration for me but just why am I always bummed out?",12Aug2020,1
655,"So there’s this girl (22F) that I’ve (25M) been talking to for the last month. We’ve gone out 5 or 6 times since the beginning of July before she goes back to school. We always have a really good time, we hang out a long time when we do go out. We talk every single day. We’ve talked about relationship with each other. I have problems trusting and she has trouble developing feelings. Her last boyfriend she broke up with cause they rushed things and she really didn’t have feelings for him. So I was thinking she was taking her time with me. 

I told her I liked her and she told me the thing of having trouble developing feelings but she always has such a good time with me and wants to continue to go out. It seemed like she wanted to see where things go and I always made clear to her that whenever we go out that it was a date. I would call it a date and the stuff we would do was very romantic and date like. So we don’t have a label but we’ve been going out and I haven’t talked to anyone else even though one of my old crushes is wanting to go out.

So last night I was talking to her last night and she said how she had been at coffee with a friend. Idk why but I knew that it was a date. So I casually asked her how the coffee date went and said how it went pretty good. That she didn’t want to go but had fun. This just hurt me. I wasn’t mad but I was just really hurt cause we had been going out and it sucks to think that she was out with another guy. I know it’s probably wrong for me to feel bad but I guess I’m old fashioned and just think if you were talking with someone that you wouldn’t go out with someone else.

So once the night ended and we kept talking. I didn’t react to it but it was eating me really badly. I asked her on a date again for Thursday. I made sure to say date to see how she would react. She said “yes of course!” My question is, should I clarify things with her on whether or not things would progress with us. Or should I just leave it alone? If I should say something, what do you think I should say?

TLDR: been going out with a girl a lot, she went out with another guy. Should I clarify where things stand with us or leave it alone?",12Aug2020,1

I don't know what to do anymore. Also, drinking coffee doesn't help me at all lmao. In the end, my eyes always gets so dry, itchy and tired (I wear glasses).

657,"Tl:dr- my husband is basically an alcoholic, who starts fights with me when drunk. I've offered to help him find other ways to cope with his issues, but it usually feels like I'm talking to a brick wall.

Some backstory first, I guess. My husband and I have been married for a little over a year. I already had a child and then we had another shortly before getting married. I'm currently putting my education and future career on hold to take care of our kids. (I don't like daycare nor do I want them to go to daycare with covid). My husband works at a retail place right now, but might be getting a new job soon, and I'm helping out at my mom's work as an assistant to bring in extra money to save. We live at my brother's house, so our expenses aren't as much as they would be if we lived on our own.

Back in February is when we moved to my brother's house because he needed help taking care of the place. (He had other people living here, but they didn't help, which he needed.....that whole deal is a different story....my brother was supposed to have his girlfriend help with everything, but she bailed after signing the papers for the house). I didn't mind moving because it was helping my brother and leaving his parent's house which wasn't a good environment for us. 

Now, the reason for this post: due to everything that has happened.....moving to his parents house, then moving to my brother's house (and the drama that came with that, as well as our kids being young and prone to being toddlers.....we've been u der a lot of stress. My husband has said that the only way he can deal with his stress and everything else going on in his head is to drink. (He has tried video games, outdoor activities and a bunch of other things, apparently nothing works).

If someone chooses to have a drink now and again to unwind, that's one thing. But, my husband is a borderline alcoholic. He drinks a whole bottle of alcohol (usually rum) in a few hours. We've talked about it and have agreed....more than once because we have to continually have the same conversations.....that he shouldn't drink during the day so that he's available to help with the kids. 

He has frequently spent all day drinking. Then he either passes out or we get in to a fight. (That would be the main reason I asked him not to drink so much during the day......it only results in one of those two things). We have disagreements if he's not drinking, but when he is drinking, that's the only time we have all out fights. During these fights he calls me names, says my job is useless, brings up things we've argued about before, criticizes my support of BLM/LGBT+/etc., I make him unhappy and he takes my keys so I can't leave. 

We talk after he has sobered up and usually he says the only thing that he really has to complain about (in regards to us) is how much I criticize the way he treats the kids. (He is not very patient and was raised by abusive parents, so he has those tentencies). He also says that he doesn't think drinking is the problem....despite these fights only happening when he's drunk. I've brought up the possibility of therapy and AA, sometimes he's open to it and sometimes he's not. But it feels like if we pursue that option, I'll have to do all the work setting it up. I've also offered to help him find some other way to deal with his issues, but can't think of anything that would work.

He is usually loving and supportive when not drunk, but gets like that if he's been drinking a lot. I don't know if it's possible that the alcohol has that much of an affect on him that it changes how he feels about me.....or if this is how he really feels and just isn't as nasty about it when not drinking. He has asked female friends of his for nudes at least once...maybe more.

I'm not really sure what to do from here. Would counseling help or is it just a lost cause at this point?",12Aug2020,1
658,"I’ve never posted on here before but after searching for so long to find advice or for someone who has been in a similar position without any results I’m taking a chance and hopefully someone can help or give their advice/opinion. 

My mother passed away very tragically and suddenly a few years ago when I was in my early 20s, it was heartbreaking and extremely traumatic as she suffered very much and soon after I had to deal with selling her home which had always been our family home and the place I grew up from a baby so it felt like another loss in itself. 
Once the sale of the house had all gone through I felt I could finally have some peace to process and grieve for everything that had happened but just a few days after I received my inheritance my boyfriends parents asked me to lend them £40,000 which was half of my total inheritance. They pressured me greatly saying they would only need it for 4 months at the most and that there was nothing to be afraid of and that if I do not do this for them then I do not believe in loyalty and that they would never do anything to hurt me. I made clear how stressful the situation was for me and told them if this was to go wrong I will be disrespecting everything my mother went through and her wish to leave me something to have a start in life and they kept pressuring saying they need the money right now and that nothing at all can go wrong. They told me they were buying a shop and that all the documents were signed and everything ready to go so there was no risk at all. 
My boyfriend also pressured me by saying if I don’t do this for his parents then I am a selfish person who only cares about money, and that I always said if I won the lottery I would help people and now I have money and don’t want to help. He also said that even if gave them the money I would still have money left over so what is the big deal. It was an awful awful time in my life I got in my car and drove somewhere quiet to just cry by myself and to try and get away from it but there was no getting away they traveled to my town and told me they are now being pressured to send the money for this shop right now and need to do it now. They didn’t give me any time to speak to a solicitor I told them I would like to speak to my solicitor and they said no there is no need. They took me to a solicitor of their choosing, not for advice but to have a loan document witnessed which they also said wasn’t needed but I insisted I wouldn’t do it without. When in the solicitors office his mother told the solicitor that I was her daughter in law and was married to her son because the solicitor found the whole situation very strange but we are not married and have never even spoken of anything like that. She told me in private that she always saw me and her son having kids together in the future knowing how much I loved him and insinuating that without proving this loyalty to them that it probably wouldn’t happen. 
The whole thing was so terrible but they kept reassuring me they would pay back everything and with interest 4 months later or earlier. 
So 4 months came around and I heard nothing about my inheritance and his mother even asked me for another £2000 which I sent to her. It then came to the July which was 4 months after my inheritance was promised back and I asked her when she could send it back as I had found a flat I would really like to buy and she just said ‘wow, I’ll contact you soon”. Didn’t hear anything for another few months until the October when I met with her and she told me the deal to buy the shop was taking longer than expected but would all be done by the December. Anyway that came around and still not a penny paid back and all I got was more and more excuses for why she couldn’t talk or more excuses of things going wrong. After 2 years of being fobbed off I decided to investigate and found out that there was never a deal to buy the shop in the first place it was all made up, what really happened is that her company was going out of business into liquidation so I guess she needed the money for debts or something but obviously never told me. She then accused me of slandering her simply because I had found out the truth but she swears on her life she has never lied and my boyfriend believes everything she says even though I have documents and evidence to show she’s lied about everything from the beginning. 

My boyfriend says he wants nothing to do with it now and that it’s between his parents and me and said that he never pressured me into doing it so is nothing to do with him. He happily accepts expensive gifts from his Mum she set him up with a nice flat kitted it out with new furniture and a new massive TV and buys him holidays and designer clothes etc, pays his bills and lots more and when I say anything he goes mad at me and says his mum is just setting him up in life which any mother would do and gives me the silent treatment if I say anything and it makes me feel so crazy because it feels so wrong that she still spends loads of money on herself and her children and none of them think it is wrong. 
 He argued with her about it a few times last year but just like me was given loads of different stories and excuses about what really happened and in the end he said it was all my fault that he was arguing with his mum and that I am a huge stress in his life because of this situation but still worships his mum and doesn’t think she’s done anything wrong and says he doesn’t know if he wants to be with someone who doesn’t get on with his mum. 
She started paying some money back but when I asked her to just be honest with me about things so that we can move on and build a new relationship she carried on lying about everything and then told me she just can’t remember anything or what she really spent my £40,000 inheritance on because she conveniently says she now has memory problems even though she still runs her own businesses and cares for her young granddaughter and many other things which someone with memory problems would not be able to do I believe she just said this to get out of all the lies without having to own up or apologise even though I told her I would forgive everything. I asked her why not look at bank accounts to see what the money was spent on and she again conveniently said she can’t look at her accounts.   
It’s now been 3 years that they’ve had my inheritance and still owe over £20,000 and payments have stopped completely for the last 6 months again without any notice or conversation to tell me why yet she still gives money to her son and buys him things etc. She tells me she sees me as her own daughter and that she’s not this bad person that I am making her out to be but it all feels so wrong I have been put through unbelievable stress at the worst time of my life and taken advantage of at my most vulnerable and have not had a chance to even start to grieve for my Mum. 
They have turned themselves into the victims by saying all I care about is money and saying how much stress I am causing them as a family and I don’t feel any support or that any of them really care about me at all. I know for a fact my boyfriend would not allow this to happen to anyone he loved like his mum or his sister he would be going mental and would do anything to sort it out for them yet when I have said I may have to take his mum to court as a last option he’s told me if I do that then there is no going back and he would end it with me for good for disrespecting his mother. 
When my dad found out about it all he told me not to have anything to do with him or his family anymore and my boyfriend came into my house and screamed and shouted at my dad bashing the door saying his parents are good people that haven’t done anything wrong and he thinks my dad is the one who is in the wrong for telling me to stay away. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore I have felt on the verge of having a nervous breakdown from all of this for years and I can’t see what’s wrong or right anymore because they are adamant they have done nothing wrong and they are so convincing I feel I have lost myself completely and cannot get my head around how I have been made to look like the bad person and the cause of their stress if I don’t shut my mouth and keep quiet about everything. None of them care at all about the pain I have been put through or the opportunities I have missed if I had been let to use my inheritance all those years ago and only seem to care about themselves. 
My boyfriend is adamant that all he’s ever done is support me yet when I was in the hospitals with my mum when she was dying he started seeing a girl who he had been texting a few months before but he assured me she was just a friend and he didn’t tell me about seeing her until months after my mum passed away and straight away started being intimate with me when I came home from the hospital without telling me which he now denies it saying he wouldn’t have done that because he would have still been thinking about the other girl and I’ve never really been able to get over how someone could do this if they really loved you or cared. 
I really do feel like I am going crazy and don’t know whether to just leave the situation and let them keep the money which I would feel I have completely let my poor mum down but I just can’t cope with anymore of this stress my life is a complete misery because of it and the worst thing is the lies and feelings of mistreatment yet they tell me they’ve done nothing wrong and that it’s all my fault and paranoia and when I speak up they are disgusted with me.

Sorry for the long rant but I’m really hoping someone can give their opinion or if anyone has been in a similar situation please tell me how you got through or what you did, thanks so much x",12Aug2020,1

662,"Hi everyone,

(tl:dr at the end)

I (20M) have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 7-8. I had good grades until 8-9th grade, where I basically started dropping out/going to school on and off till I was 16 I could legally drop out (I live in France.).

I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 6 (started because I was a “high potential” kid and I needed one to skip 2nd grade) until now. I’ve been diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder 1-2 years ago by my current psychiatrist. The diagnostic helped a lot, now I know why I am like that and that there is others like me out there. Now I’m in a stable state, I don’t take any medicine (I’ve tried), I don’t smoke, don’t do drug, don’t drink, I can manage my breakdowns, I know how to say no when I don’t feel like doing something and know that my heavy suicidal thoughts go away eventually. So, everything is better than ever (mentally that is).

Problem is, one of the things my condition causes is that I have no drive to do anything for more than a few days, or after I hit a point where I need to work hard to get over it, I rather give up. BUT I’m basically interested in everything, I invest some time in everything, but when I know what I wanted to know, I don’t look deeper, I just change the subject. So, I can’t find anything that attracts me enough, for a long enough period of time to make it a job (I’ve worked 1 months at my brothers shop 2 months ago, it was so draining and I was so relieved when my contract ended, even though the work environment was great and I was only doing 20h/week).

Last example: I’m learning how to drive, I am 7 hours in, starting to struggle with the clutch and feeling drained, depressed and close to just saying f it I don’t need to drive anyway.

So, I’ve just been playing games, been on social media, since I was ~12, and I don’t even like it that much, it’s just the thing that makes the time go faster and don’t cost me any energy. I’ve also started working out 4-5 times a week since the beginning of the year.

So, I’ve been trying to find something to make money and hopefully be able to live alone (I live with my parents, they are really understanding of everything and are well off so I’m not rushed, nor kicked out, but I prefer being alone and doing my own things.) and also visit every country in the world (which is basically my only long-term goal before dying)

Do you guys have any idea what I could do or anyone I could to talk to, in France, even better if I can do it from my bedroom, that could help me keep my heads up for a few months? (Not counting in years yet, I find it incredible I was able to maintain a job for a month). I speak French and English.

There is a side of me that really wants to want to live but I really don’t know what to do.

I apologize for any typo, and If you need further information, feel free to ask.

Tl:dr : I have no drive to maintain an activity for more than a few days, I’m looking for something that could make me less dependent on my parents.",12Aug2020,1
663,"Here goes. My 18th birthday is coming up, 5 days to be exact, and my original plan was that my best friend (let’s say her name is Kate) and I would hang out all day and have toooons of fun. Well that plan was all set and stone until yesterday. 

Kate has other friends like most people do, as do I. Well she has a best friend (let’s call her Ann) Ann is Kate’s longest lasting friend (since 7th grade) and the only real person Kate had for a long time (before me 😋) but I didn’t become friends with Kate until the start of our senior year. 

I’m not exactly “friends” with Ann. I’ve never really been able to get to know her and she always seems to only give attention to Kate when we’re all together, making me feel kinda weird and like a third wheel. Ann kinda makes me feel like I’m just a phase of Kate’s that she outgrow. When I say something about maybe getting a place with Kate, Ann sort of makes sure that Ik that SHE, and not I, WILL be getting a place with Kate. 

Well Ann moved away not too far but Kate doesn’t get to see Ann that often anymore soooo Kate invited Ann to stay the night a week ago but Ann ended up not being able to. Kate rescheduled for Ann to stay the night..the night before my birthday..Ann will also end up staying the whole next day. My birthday. So am I a bad friend for not wanting Ann to be there?

She has a great job at an elementary school that treats her great. She loves her job, the people, and everyone she deals with, which makes me so happy for her. However, I have struggled for years to find the same.

I now am a teacher at the high school level and am entering my 2nd year. It is OK, and I do enjoy teaching to a point, however prior I was a cop. I enjoyed that in certain points but had to see too much stuff, so I left after 3 years. That was my first real “career” job. I’m about to be 27. I have put in applications for other jobs, doesn’t matter what they are for this context, but they would require us to move either out of state or out of the county we live depending on which I get.

I was a military kid and have no issue with moving around and think it can be an adventure with lots of learning and experiences to be had in places you’ve never seen. My wife is comfortable with what we have now and loves where she is at and we are at an “impossible impasse”.  I can’t ask her to give up her happiness in hopes that these potential jobs will give me what she has, “career satisfaction and happiness.” The chances of her finding her perfect job that she has now are very slim. But i know she will survive if we all move and the kids will survive. 

Sometimes she is excited to leave but sometimes she is adamant against it. She feels like she is giving up everything “again” for me but when asked what else she has given up she can’t come up with another scenario in which she has. Idk, I’m stuck. I don’t want her to lose what she has achieved and found with her school, but there is nothing for me where we live and never wanted to end up here. All paired with the HOPE that what I want is elsewhere...

677," I fucking resent my\[19f\] mother \[49f\], I need advice on how do I move forward most healthily. 

I may sound entitled or arrogant but it still hurts me and eats me to my core because we have a great relationship in recent years but I explode at every argument/ off-hand comment. So please be nice to me.

Throwaway account, English is my second language and TL; DR at the end because this will be a looong boy.

It all started when my mom got pregnant with my little brother when I was 7-8 years old. My father is the poster child (well man:)) of the narcissistic person, so when my mom didn't have enough time for me, I couldn't bond with him. Now I understand that, of course, you need to pay attention to a newborn but to my alone eight-year self, it was devastating. I still have my diary from there until like 14-15... I was such an angry kid...

I need to add that now in recent years, I have a much better relationship with my mom, we can talk about anything (that's why I would like your advice on how to move on alone without bringing her in) and still a cold and fake relationship with my dad. Let's just say he hates my brother because after the birth my mom started to stod up against him. ( they are still together, financial reasons).

So we arrive at the resentments:

* They, my parents, used us to send my grandmother for 1-2 months in the summer. Unfortunately, my grandmom never had any maternal instincts so guess who had to take care of him, like bathe him, put him to nap/sleep, play with him... And I was like 10-12. Back home, because of my absent father, I needed to step up to help with the baby, be the bad guy to my mom good guy. Now when I am 19 they still joke that I am the ""second mom""...( But hey that's the life of an older daughter).
* When I was 16-17 old, every time we went to the doctor she was like ""I can't wait for you to be 18 so you can go alone"". She was always so dismissive, I told her I can't see on the blackboard at school or that are 3 moons on the sky and she still didn't believe. But the most dismissive of them all: starting from 7-8 years old I got this mind-numbing pain in my legs. She just told me it's growing pain don't worry( thank god I discovered Nurofen and other ibuprofen types of pills). In later years it got worst, I got them every few days, it was hell. At 17, I was done and went to the doctor to discover that I was missing big amounts of vitamin D from my body. And with just a little pill of vit D every day I was pain-free. She always excused herself with ""oh but you didn't tell me"" yeah no shit you told me I was making it up, I want attention or I am hypochondriac. 
* Back to the present time, we are not doing that fine financially. My father brings like 2/3 of the money. Me and my mom joke that you need to beg at least 3 times for him to give you some money. (Stupid I know, that's why I got a job as soon as possible, at 16). In my country, there is this very important series of exams at the end of high school. You need to have tutors to obtain the best grades, that will eventually help you (together with the university entrance exam) get in the best university. Because I already had a math tutor and another tutor to help me with the entrance exam we didn't have money for a physics tutor. That was okay, my mom still knew enough physics to help me and I did a lot of alone studying. But God the comments she said when she helped me... One of the most memorable ones is "" Hurry the fuck up, why you so slow at this? I feel like I am wasting my life here"". Maybe in English, it doesn't sound so bad but in my native language is very cutting.

Finally, I did get good grades and I got in the university of my dreams but fucking hell how hard it was.

Another example of when she said she was wasting her life helping me was when I asked her to help me with a midterm for the university. This exam was based on memorization of facts and history so I had 30 pages of notes from where I crammed. All she needed to do was read from those pages and ask ""when was .... constructed and why?"" Yeah, wasting her life helping me... 5 minutes and I had enough and back in my room to study alone.

The kicker? She does homework every night with my brother to make sure he understood everything and every answer is correct.... yeah not wasting anything there. In my opinion, it is overkill but maybe I think like this because I always did mine alone. There are more examples of this double standard bw us, like me doing the dinner or cleaning and him going back to gaming but it's already long enough.

If you ask why I am talking only about my mom is because I want some advice on how to move forward, how to have a healthier relationship with her. My dad is another story, after I move out I will keep in touch only with my mom. I may tell you that I resent her but I still love her to the moon and back and she will never know what I said here.

I can't move out and I wish to go to the therapist but is too expensive.

TL; DR: In recent years my and my mom relationship became better, it still doesn't erase the years of raising my brother alongside her, the dismissal of my health problems and the double standard bw me and my brother.  How can I move on?",12Aug2020,1

682,"When I was a freshman in high school there was a guy who got expelled for smoking marijuana in school. And during that time five other guys also got suspended from school and everybody told them all that I snitched on them and got them all in trouble. But in reality I had no idea this was even going on. 


So now I am a junior in high school and today I met the guy who got expelled and I was going to the gas station with my bike when I met him And he came out of the little restaurant he works and he started swearing at me and yelling and saying rude hateful things and how he is going to get his friends and how they’re all going to beat me up. I was in absolute shock and Super confused, I kept on telling him that I didn’t snitch on him. I told him that over 20 times but he didn’t want to believe it. He’s believing his own illusion when I know reality. So I went back home after I went to the gas station then I came back to the same restaurant where he worked then I asked him if we could talk. He was being extremely rude and threatening to beat me up.

” Glock me in the face! ” 

And to call the police on me if I didn’t leave the restaurant I went there and I peaceful told him 

“Brother I am peaceful and I don’t want to fight.”

but he just wasn’t listening to reason and logic.

683,"I've always wanted to change my last name. It's hard to pronounce, it's ugly, and it has a bunch of weird letters that aren't in the English alphabet.

I'll be moving to the UK in about a month, where I intend to stay indefinitely.

First of, I can't keep the original spelling because of the letters which the English alphabet does not have. At the very least I have to substitute the characters, so I'm changing it either way. And with or without the original spelling, I know that there's no way I'd get the proper pronunciation from anyone. Hell, even people from my own country often don't get it right.

Secondly, it doesn't really mean a lot to me. Etymologically it just means ""son of [some person about a dozen generations back that nobody knows anymore]"". I'd rather avoid xenophobia when applying for jobs than keep a part of my name that was only introduced for administrative purposes somewhere between the 16th and the 19th century.

With the 2 years of being best friends we have other close friend who are all in their early twenties as well and I love being friends with them, I feel very much apart of the group despite my age.

Me and my best friend also have some internet friends to, we both play the same game together and joined a server with a bunch people who live stream their weird and funny role plays, that happen in this game, These internet friends have also made me feel like i'm very much apart of something and have no problem with my age, considering they are all above the age of 21.

During the summer I hung out sometimes with my high school friends and up until they asked how old my best friend was they had no problem, they started yelling at me that my best friend needs to be dropped because she could persuade me to do something that I don't want to do.

I don't smoke, drink, do drugs and never do anything illegal and no matter how much I try to explain this to my high school friends they still assume it will happen. I do fell most of the time more older and mature them I am I don't want to drop my high school friends but at the same time if this continues I feel like I should.

I lived in Pakistan my whole life, my family, friends and everyone i know is here and i love this place. My elder sister is in unveristy here im in 8th grade and my little sister in 6th so at this point we have made life long friends. I dont know why but my father wanted to my mother, my little sister and myself to move to Canada while my father and elder sister stay here in Pakistan until she gets her degree or something.

Now for the main problem, Im sacred of this event as its gonna completely turn my life around .I like Canada but not enough to completely move there. First of all my whole family is here, iv made so many amazing friends who i would even trust with my life and I dont want to leave any of these things.

693,"I would like to start this off with I do NOT care about the broom, it was cheap, but I do have other concerns arising from the situation overall. 

Sorry if formatting is odd, I'm on mobile. 

Yesterday, I came home to find 2 doors I had left shut in my apartment open. I brushed it off as no big deal- I knew maintenance was supposed to stop by to paint. I thought they were done, but maybe they had 2 rooms left, I don't know. They're currently empty rooms expecting new occupants, so not rooms I go into. But aside from the doors, something just felt off. I couldn't pinpoint it, until today when I went to sweep. The broom I left in the living room is gone. I looked in every room, including the empty ones, and mine where its never been stored because my puppy likes to chew it. Its nowhere to be found. I 100% know I left it in the living room. I piled it up with the dustpan and vacuum and mop (which are still here) in the corner for easy access since puppies are messy. Now, I dont care that the broom is missing. It was left by an old roommate, so i got it for free, but even then, she only paid like $5 for it, its a cheap not very good broom. Its easy to replace. My concern rests with this- whoever took it has keys to my apartment. They may have taken it because they needed a broom. Cool. They may have taken it to see if I'd notice/how I'd react so they could potentially come back for more. Do I report this to the landlord? It seems silly, its a broom, but it could be more. It could already be more and I just haven't noticed too. I'm paranoid now. Over a broom I don't really care that much about. Will I come home to find my very friendly poodle puppy gone next? Thats where my mind is right now. I don't think thats a realistic worry, but he's all I really have and I'm so attached, and he's the only thing I'd truly be upset over coming home to find missing. I don't care about my fancy laptop (which was also in the living room with the now missing broom, and my only access to university), or my $200 pet hair clippers. I care about my best friend. I definitely think I'm over reacting, but at the same time, if I rearranged what I cared about, I dont think I am. So basically I'm torn on what to do because I think im over reacting over a broom, and I just need some insight. What would you do?",12Aug2020,1

695,"Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge that there are some details which I now think are important, but at the time didn't really pay much heed to. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my memory.

Now, I have just recently moved into my apartment on the 10th. Before moving in, I had browsed around for various providers to see what was available in the area. In addition, I emailed the lady responsible for my lease about how they handled internet over there, and if there was anything I should know about (not the landlord, but a representatuve of the property management company who was there to answer questions). She said that they didn't have any preferred provider, and that if I wanted internet I should just go with whoever offers the best rate. With that in mind, I decided to call up centurylink to get some basic internet.

I went to their website and called the number. After a lengthy time spent on hold, I got put through to a sales rep. They asked for the address and what I would be using the internet for. I told them that I was looking for an 80 megabits/s package, and they said sure and started putting me in the system. It was also about this time that I realized that they were using the name Earthlink(!), but I kind of just glossed over this detail and considered the two companies to be in business with each other. Anyhow, I get told that I would need to pay the installation fee upfront, and then I would be getting a monthly bill for $59.60 (I believe this was the exact amount). I paid up then was told I was being transfered over to speak with someone else to finalize everything. I got put on hold for about another hour, then the music stopped, and a bit later the line just dropped. I was a bit confused, but figured that since I had paid I was good to go and just dropped the matter.

Now that I have arrived here and checked my account, I see that they were set to send out the technician today to install my modem and turn on my service. Sure enough, a technician showed up, but he was from Frontier. I asked him about this, and mentioned that I bought internet from Earthlink, but he just seemed clueless about that. He informed me that I would only be getting 3 megabits/s here, and if I would be okay with that. I said no obviously, and asked him why I was only getting 3. His response: ""Well the city is hooked up with fiber that gets about 500 meg. But this apartment building is running on old infrastructure and only 2 providers give service to it. With what you've got you can only get 3 meg. If you were to go through Charter you could get about 200 meg. With that being my options, I told him to just cancel the install. He told me to give my provider a call and that they should give me a refund because I never got my service delivered (as if I am going to convince the lady sitting at the desk in India to actually get anything done about this).

Shortly thereafter, I did try to call earthlink again, and I got through to someone so I could ask about cancelling my service, and about getting a refund. She got my info and said she would transfer me to someone above her, but it just wound up being like earlier where the line went dead for a while and the call just dropped. I call again and ask for the lady who I was speaking to previously, to which I get told she would call me back as soon as she can - she hasn't, and I'm not counting on that happening.

So this leads me to now. My blood pressure isn't so high anymore, but now I'm just feeling depressed about the situation. I really don't have the money to play games like this, and I need better internet to atttend my classes and do my video conferencing online. Has anyone else found themselves in a situation like mine?

696,"I’m on this one girls priv Snapchat story and on it she posted this online flyer that said “all [my school’s name] seniors, you’re invited to a social distanced picnic in the park! RSVP!”. 

My friend and I then signed up, initially thinking that this was an event that was ran by our school. Turns out it was put on by some girl at our school. I don’t like to use the word “popular” because it sounds stupid, but yes, we do have “that” group at our school who has that high social status just for being attractive and playing sports. The school is also all girls and catholic btw. One of the girls from “that” group was the one who is holding the event. 

When my friend and I found this out we went to site where we RSVP and saw that her whole friend group (it’s like 1/3 of our school) signed up and is going. We both felt embarrassed because our names looked really out of place. We aren’t furries or anything, but we def don’t hangout with “that” group and are looked down upon from some of the girls from our school because we are one of the few “alt” ppl there, watch anime, and had a bad kpop phase freshman year. Idk, but the group of girls at my school have some pretty big egos and love to put down anyone who isn’t in their little group that still think vines are funny.

697,"Okay, I previously posted that I called out twice in a row. I ended up going to urgent care prior to calling out on day 2, and got a note that excused me until the 13th.
I called into work today, just to be sure the message was passed along, and to not be regarded as a no call/no show. The woman I spoke with yesterday mentioned nothing about bringing the note on my time off. The man I spoke with today, however, said I have to bring the note today or I would be regarded as doing a no call/no show. We were on the phone, so a no call/no show makes no sense. I felt weird about that, so I called back and specifically asked for a manager I knew a little better. I spoke to him about what happened, and he said that it is okay, and actually better, if I bring the note tomorrow upon my return. Basically, what the heck should I do?

698,"Im a 21 ur old female and usually about 4-5 out of the 7 nights a week I will have these horrible dreams where I am somewhere doing something dangerous, I save myself just in time, then the dream turns into some random old guy (it’s always a different person, only 2-3 times it’s been a female, but she’s old too) trying to kidnap me (and the feeling that he’s going to kill me) but I always wake up before he gets to me. Usually I make it to safety, or right before he gets me I wake up, but never am there in the dream long enough for him to get me.

This is affecting my sleep greatly because I wake up feeling like I was only asleep for 5 minutes. When I lived with my ex for almost 2 years apparently I would kick and punch in my sleep, bad. I would also cry in my sleep. I’ve been having these types of dreams for about 3 years. these dreams started happening while I was spending 2 months in state prison. I don’t know if it’s a PTSD thing. I never saw anything bad in there. Im just getting really sick of this because it’s starting to scare me so much that one week I didn’t sleep for 6 days straight.

700,"I’m very fortunate to have this decision in front of me at this time, but I need advice. I want to make sure I am not making a worse decision out of desperation. 

I’ve been at my company for three years. I’ve been promoted a couple times and have a lot of responsibility. My workload is unmanageable and despite speaking up, it only gets heavier. My pay is well below market value and my boss is hyper critical and rude to many workers. He likes me so I am ok most of the time, but I’ve seen him berate workers so badly, log into workers emails to see what they’re doing, trash them to me, and perpetuate a “work 24/7 or you don’t matter” mindset. Turnover is very high. It has really skyrocketed my anxiety. 

That being said: some positives are we are allowed to wfh right now, I’m very trusted in my role and not really micromanaged, and I do have some mentors I can ask industry questions/problem solve with. I’m comfortable with what I do so lately I can work at my own pace and actually take breaks. 

I’ve been looking for a new position for a while and it finally seems like I have a viable option. But I am scared I’m missing red flags because I want to get out of my current job. 

Some notes about the potential new job (may be red flags):


•They are urgently hiring for this role.


•It is a brand new role so I would “make it my own” (Pro: cool! Con: Would I have guidance?)


•The job is posted to pay at market value/a little above.


•One of the execs I interviewed with told me that the team, including himself, is very blunt and straightforward and that some people don’t work well with that. The company is based in another country and he says this is their culture. He also joked that he had hired and fired someone via Zoom within a few weeks of quarantine. Both of those just felt like red flags. 


•The company seems more focused and has a clear vision of who they are, what they want (not a red flag.) Current company is all over the place.

Ultimately it’s up to me, but I would appreciate any advice. I’m also nervous I’m too far in to ask too many questions and ruin my chances. I don’t even have an offer but this is on my mind. My fear is I leave and things are worse.

Due to quarantine making me BEYOND bored out of my mind.. I have decided to start my own blog! This is something I’ve wanted to do for some time now but I can’t come up with a unique topic! So, what better idea than to turn to random strangers on the internet! 
These are all the things I have experience with, so let me know if there is a topic you would personally find interesting! Maybe a combination of some of these things, I don’t know! I’ve been thinking about topics for too long, so thank you in advanced! ❤️❤️❤️

702,"I'm looking into setting up a private appointment to get a diagnosis as it's causing too many problems at work at this point.

But the problem is that they ask to go back to your childhood. I don't really remember anything from my childhood. I was badly bullied so I tended to hide away in the shadows. I was a bit naughty and certainly impulsive and hyperactive, but I wasn't a huge problem child.

I don't have access to any of my school reports. In my teenage years I remember doing a million and one things that were characterised as 'stupid'. At the time I thought I was. I now realise I was impulsive and made decisions before thinking them through or spoke before thinking it through.

I have a copy of my grades which are below average but only just - something like 7 GCSEs that are C and one B.

I can focus only if I'm under extreme pressure and so I did okay in my A Levels and my degree but only because I mass crammed the night before an exam and am a strong writer so I got by on my coursework.

Am I even likely to get a diagnosis? It's stressing me out and I'm putting off hitting the 'book your appointment' button because if they don't diagnose me, I'll feel like it's the end of the line.

She told me not to tell anyone else and I think out of our friend group I was the only one she called/told. I was in shock because she was over at our house Sunday and I know her dad was perfectly fine and was working so this really was a shock. I am sure it was much more of a shock for her. Later me and my mom decided to drop by her house to give her a hug and some tissues but she was not home and I left her a voicemail telling her I am here for her and if she needs anything just to ask. Later that night she told the group chat of all our friends and gladly they all where there for her. One friend even made a schedule to bring food to her and her mom. At 3 this morning she also texted the group chat thanks. Today she texted me and asked if we could hang out and I of course said yes.

We broke up and got back together countless times, tried to make each other jealous, fought a lot, and were each other’s first loves. We were so young that we both got lost in the relationship (especially me). We would fight and i used to not be able to focus on school and the relationship was very toxic. We ended after one last fight and I blocked her on everything because she was sending me hurtful messages. . . . That breakup was two years ago. We both have seen other people and have graduated college. However, recently in April we started texting again. She and her friend have been messaging me saying that my ex still has feelings for me etc. etc. we discussed our relationship too. However, she has tried to start many fights via text throughout this quarantine and has acted immature again, the same stuff that led to me blocking her, being rude, sending mean texts and picking fights. Im sure im not 100% innocent either. I felt as if i had moved on. However this quarantine has made me feel lonely and I started to miss her. Recently she blocked me because i told our mutual friend that she was being mean and she flipped out saying i had no right to call her mean, so she blocked me.

She unblocked me and apologized. I got drunk and said i miss her and that i care about her/want to see her potentially. She wants to meet up. However i don’t trust her at all given our previous relationship. She says she has feelings for me and is excited that she wants to meet up. I feel bad for saying i want to meetup even if i kno its not good idea. I am just too stressed to think. Can anyone offer some sound non judgemental advice.

708,"My friend (18F) recently asked if her brother (14M) could join our dungeons and dragons campaign for a few sessions as he wanted to try out the game. Knowing how hard it is to find a group I said yes, he could try it out for a while. As you may expect he then stuck around and plays the game with us regularly. The  group doesn't have a problem with this.


The problem arises that he now seems to think he is a part of the friendship group outside of the game as well. I have nothing against him but the age gap makes it difficult. His sense of humour is completely different as he is still in his random = funny phase, he has no sense of when someone else is talking and regularly talks I've people, will repeat a joke over and over again expecting people to laugh if they didn't the first time and will sometimes just repeat jokes other people just said to try and share in the attention they got for it. It's impossible to have conversations on meaningful things about things like when we go off to uni, sharing tips on ways to save money, news stories and the like as he just immediately makes an effort to switch the topic to meaningless stuff like video games because he can be included in the conversation.


I talked to him about it over discord and he seemed to take it ok and I thought I got through to him.


Then today I had planned a barbeque with my friendship group and he shows up, uninvited. Through the day he kept refering to us as the gang and asked what the group was planning on doing next. We tried to subtly suggest that he didn't quite fit in with the rest of the group but it didn't seem to get through and I'm beginning to think we need a more head on approach.


I don't want him to feel like he has done anything wrong. I'm sure that if the group was 5 years younger I'm sure he would be a part of the group but for the rest of us it just doesn't gel well.


I don't want him to feel left out in the cold, I've been on that side and know what it is like.

710,"So my friend, let’s call him Alex, I’ve known him and his friends for 7 years as have my closest friends as we all played on a team together. 

This spring when quarantine started, we began chatting pretty regularly, had virtual movie nights and binged shows, and when quarantine was over, we hung out and ended going on a few dates.

He showed a LOT of care, interest, investment, and communication that I did not expect which really made me start to allow myself catch some feelings. It was really lovely. However after a few dates he came to me asking to go back to being just friends as he was moving in a few weeks and didn’t want to move towards a long distance relationship with someone. Fair. After that we made plans to do things with mutual friends a few times but he was always busy or something came up. Since he was always very proactive about communicating I didn’t think much of it.

So he leaves a few weeks later and we continue to chat. I felt he still liked me because again he had shown me all that investment and attention to little details while here and once gone would do things like tell me dreamt about me or we would chat until the early hours of the morning.

Now a couple weeks later I see another girl (with the same name, career/position, and city as me) has posted a series of photos of them together as a couple. The photos are obviously taken at different points in time as there are multiple haircuts in the photos. All of their friends and family including his mother are commenting “my favourite couple” “so cute” and so forth so it looks like they may have been together a while.

I was shocked to say the least as were my friends who also know him, none of us think he’s the type to cheat on someone and we realize there could be more to the story... but the timeline for him leaving and seeing me and his reason for cutting things off don’t add up. Should I confront him about this and what do I even say? He never mentioned her to me at all and I don’t know how to feel about this. If it were some random guy I wouldn’t care but because I knew him before and we still are friends supposedly I feel compelled to have the record set straight here.",12Aug2020,1

Last week, I saw nudes from a girl who looked developed physically, but I soon found out that she was 13 and I was still attracted to her. So even with this knowledge of her being 13 i continued to do what I was orginally planning to do. I cannot blame anyone but myself. After I masturbated I felt exteremely guilty and felt disgusted on what i did and saw, and to be honest, i became depressed and wanted to kill myself from my actions. So far, I havent been eating, and Ive been basically starving myself. I feel so guilty and terrible, and I even thought about reporting myself to the police to come and arrest someone like me. Ive always, and still am attracted to girls my age and older, but for some reason, I acted on lust and commited a grave sin that cannot be forgiven. Please help me, is this normal at my age or am I just a disgusting pedo? Im at a point where I lost interest in my hobbies, future, and friends. Im never going to do this again because of how tramatic it is for me. At this point, the only thing thats keeping me alive are my parents because I love them so much. Please help me.",12Aug2020,1
715,"I (15M), unfortunately got into Tik-Tok a few months ago. To clarify, I understand the risks and to be quite honest, they don't bother me too much as I am Canadian. 

There's this really stupid ""trend"" going on because Will Smith got cheated on or something, so certain guys are getting ""revenge"" for him by ruining the lives of as many girls as possible. They post videos like ""I've made 11 girls cry, 5 throw out their phone, 2 kill themselves and 8 block me. This is only the beginning of August, there will be many more,"" while standing there looking like an audition for r/iamverybadass cover art.

In response to this, girls in related comment sections are saying ""KAM,"" which literally translates to ""kill all men."" I have no idea why I decided to debate with these people, or why I thought they could have a shred of sense as to why we shouldn't genocide the entire male race. 

Some people say ""it's just a joke to get back at men."" But I have many issues with that, that I will share with anyone interested.

Some people say ""you're an incel, and you're part of the problem."" Which just seems unfair to label someone an incel because they would rather see tomorrow. 

Either way, I've been getting a lot of hate for debating with these people. My mentions are always full of obnoxious people who plug their ears when they hear another opinion. 

Is there something I'm truly missing here, or is there just a legion of one-track minded sexists that I've stupidly chosen to argue with?",12Aug2020,1

So I ordered a pool from a sketchy seller but it had the Amazon A-Z guarantee so I figured what the hell, ill get my money back if it doesnt come.

It was supposed to arrive a month ago and I've called 3x and opened a claim. I was told they refunded it on an e-gift card, but they didn't and I said that and that it still says ""running late"" so the lady (1st phone call) looked in the account and saw the seller ""processed the refund wrong"" and that they'd be refunding the money to my method of payment (debit card). Awesome, I thought.

Well here I am a month later, the claim was sent to the ""A-Z escalation team"" and I was told we'd hear back within 48 hrs. This was 2 weeks ago, and we have heard nothing.

Both other times I've called I have had to reexplain the situation even though I was told it was noted, apparently not. I'm thinking of threatening to cancel my membership, I've never had a problem before though, and we've been members for like a year and have never returned anything.

721,"Hi everyone,

I had a slight brownish spotting today and I can’t determine if it’s ovulation or the start of my period (I’m already 9 days late) or a sign of pregnancy.

Here’s a few details that could help.

I used morning after pill (BC 4 pills and BC 4 pills after 12 hrs) twice this month in July 18 and July 25 because I had unprotected sex.

I started drinking my birth control pills reguarly in July 29.

My last sex was August 1. He didn’t ejaculate inside me. We used pull out.

I think my ovulation should be in July 19 based on my Flo tracker. My period was supposed to come around August 2, but it didn’t. My last period started in July 5.

I took a prenancy test in August 3, 5, 6, 8 and 11. They all came as negative. So I think that means I didn’t get pregnant from my July 18 and 25 sex? I’ve been advised that taking a PT after 2-3 weeks of the sex is accurate enough. I’m still not sure about my August 1 though, I have to wait until 15.

I had intense cramping the past few days and my breast hurt too lately. It feels bubbly in my lower abdomen, so this kinda stresses me out.

Please can I hear your opinions? I’ve been 8 days late. I know that taking morning pill twice delays the period and messes up the cycle, but I just need some opinions. I’m just really panicking and stressed out because of this spotting.",12Aug2020,1
722,"TLDR is at the bottom :)

Here’s a quick rundown of the varsity team this year - 6 juniors, 2 sophomores, 2 freshman.

I’m currently a junior in high school and I’m on varsity. I get along with everyone great and I’m the best communicator on the team. I’m an outside hitter and I have an amazing arm swing and manage to kill it most of the time, and I hustle non-stop. 

All of the juniors are really good and have amazing skills. The sophomores are alright and they will definitely improve as the season goes on. To be blunt, the freshman have no idea what’s going on half of the time. Everyone tries to help and support them but they just need more practice.

We did a few scrimmages last week and she was putting in the under class men a lot. She explained she needed to see how they work playing against other good teams which is understandable. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we had our first game. I’m not in the rotation. She didn’t put me in at all. I explained to her that I’m a very reliable player and I have a very high skill set and I didn’t understand why I didn’t get to play. She said that I needed to beat out one of the other girls in order to play. 

I didn’t spend countless hours of training and practice for my spot to just be handed over to a couple of girls who just got put on the team. I have nothing against anyone on the team. Everyone is super sweet but I just don’t understand. 

I’m planning on quitting. I love it so much but I’m a very experienced player and I deserve a spot. And she doesn’t pay any attention to me in practice anymore. What should I do?

If I sounded like a brat during this I’m sorry, I’m really frustrated and idk what to do.

TLDR: Very advanced player doesn’t get put in rotation, and new players take her spot.",12Aug2020,1
724,"So the story goes as

My phone went bad at nearly feb. But due to lockdown I was delaying buying new one so I used to one which belongs to my mother but she rarely use .

I watch a lot of manga and rarely hentai manga.  So at night while I was trying to find a certain one ( I almost never look for a certain one , but then I was just doing if for killing time ) , my battery went down to 3percent  . So i opened several chrome tabs on it , instead of closing the hentai tab as i wanted to not waste my effort and then went to sleep by putting it on charge. 

Next day when my mother goes to terrace for morning walk she did something very very very rare  - she took my phone for music , and when she  was listening to music she opened chrome (which she never does , but my luck) and then she went across the 20 buffer tabs to find my hentai.

Now she gave me a very long lecture,  threatened me to stop doing it or she will tell my father , and she roams around me every day and gives a daily lecture to me saying that I am still watching it all day  , she also threatened me to confiscate my phone ( which i need very very much due to 6 hour long coaching for my competitive exams next quarter).

726,"Sorry for the length! This is my first post on reddit. 

Background info: 
-Back in Feb. 2018 my fiancée and I brought home a male pitbull puppy. 
-At the we lived with his parents.
-March of this year we bought our first home. The neighbors have a dog who’s fenced in. This dog keeps lunging at the fence and barks constantly if we’re walking him. 

The reason I’m asking for advice: 
The end of June my dog started growling and trying to attack my fiancé. We have never abused this dog and treated him like our child. The morning of July 4th he tried to attach him again and bit both of us. 
My cousin owns a dog training business and we asked him to help us. We didn’t want to rehome him. 
My cousin said he’s displaying dominate behavior and we have to establish ourselves as alpha.
He came home approximately two weeks ago and I’ve warmed back up to him and am very comfortable taking care of him. He used to sleep on the bed with us and sit on the couch now he sleeps in a crate and has a bed set up on the floor in the living room. We are trying to follow the advice given by the trainer. My fiancée wanted to take it slow reintroducing himself to the dog. That has left me doing all the work (walking, feeding, and giving him enough time and attention). Monday I took him out to go to the bathroom before I left for work. The neighbors let their dog out and it of course lunges at the fence barking. My dog was trying to get to the fence, I am a small woman so my fiancée came out to help me bring him inside. We make him sit and stay before we give him the ok to come inside. This time my fiancée did this and as soon as he got the ok he tried to attack him again. Now my fiancée refuses to come inside if I’m not home and when he does he stays in the kitchen with a gate blocking access to the livingroom. My fiancée feels like a prisoner in his own home now. I do not want to rehome my dog. I love this dog a lot and fear if we did he might get put down. I want my fiancée to be comfortable but I don’t want to give up my dog. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1
727,"Hi guys,
Throwaway account here because don't want police involved before I do it myself.

SO A LITTLE BACKGROUND:
My boyfriend was a pretty serial cheater in his last relationships and has been into some pretty kinky stuff sexual wise. We made a deal at the beginning of the relationship that we wouldn't cheat on each other or we would break up. He didn't uphold his end of the bargain however we had a child by the time I found out so I stayed to try and work it out. My last relationship was incredibly toxic so I'm very paranoid about cheating so I have checked his phone on a few occasions, but always found something he shouldn't be doing. 
1st January I checked his phone after a paranoia episode and found a kik and MEGA account on his phone pretending to be a 14 year old girl with my first name and messages to underage/barely legal boys/girls asking for nudes and directing them to the MEGA account. When confronted, he swore it wasn't him and that his phone must have been hacked. He deleted all the messages and apps off his phone as soon as I confronted him, so I have no evidence.
Tonight I was scrolling through my old tumblr (ew, I know) and decided to see whether he had an account too. After finding this account,  with barely anything on it,  I got suspicious and tried to log in with one of his common passwords. Voila, it worked, and I found more messages to girls, some underage, some not, discussing beastiality and incest. One of the longest conversations on there was from 2017-2019 with a 14 year old and having very sexual conversations, with him being called daddy the whole time. The state and country we live in were discussed, the first initial of his name was used, and his snapchat profile was sent to this girl. When he worked and when he was home was also discussed with her, and they phoned each other and skyped a few times according to the conversations. When I confronted him about this, he again swore to me that it wasn't him and someone must have hacked the account because he was sure he deleted that profile and didn't remember having any of these conversations. He of course then went on to immediately delete the main conversation with the young girl while denying any part in it. If he has been hacked it has to be someone he knows, as they know his passwords, his social media accounts, and his daily life.
How do I know if his accounts have actually been hacked? How can he prove that it wasn't him? 

TL;DR boyfriend has paedophilic conversations on his phone but swears they aren't his and has been hacked. How do I find out the truth?",12Aug2020,1

""I have to tell you something &amp; I've been having nightmares about it, I have no idea how to even start but now that you found that YouTube video it's probably a good time🤦💕 but I just want you to know that you're an amazing person &amp; didn't deserve any of this to happen, I'm just fucked up &amp; was looking for attention in all the wrong places. The girl in the pics &amp; videos isn't me, her name is ___ &amp; she's a ___ that lives in ___, I know I've had opportunities to tell you before but the thought of upsetting you when I know you're going through a lot in life too just breaks my heart tbh, but I know this isn't fair. My friend &amp; I made this account a few years ago to keep tabs on her ex boyfriend that was cheating on her, &amp; we ended up keeping it active for a long time. So eventually I just started using it on my own &amp; talking to people because my mental health was so bad I couldn't figure out how to talk to make friends &amp; be myself on my own account. Everything I've told you was true, like I'm 25 &amp; live on my own, all except for the pictures. If you wanna see who you've been talking to I'm willing to show you myself cause that's the closure you deserve, I'm just terrified of having people in my life find out what I've done cause I'm so embarrassed. When I deactivated my messenger &amp; FB that was gunna be it because I figured you were done with me for cancelling plans, I didn't expect you to text right away wondering what was happening so again I got confused &amp; scared cause I do care. You can tell me how shitty I am for dragging this on but I already know, I don't even expect you to reply to this cause it's a lot to take in but I can't tell you enough how amazing you are &amp; that anyone would be lucky to have you in their life.

730,"So, apart from the obvious anxiety and the terrible reason for it, I’ve enjoyed lockdown. I’ve ‘thrived’, as some people are saying. I’ve been able to spend valuable time with my family, I’ve lost 10lbs, I’ve never exercised more, I’ve read lots, learnt new things and I’ve been content.

I’m a teacher and am going back to work on September 1st, for the first time since March 20th. I enjoy my job and am looking forward to teaching again; I have rational worries about it being a new school to me and obviously about COVID-19 but I’m also worried that I’ll become ‘unhealthy’ again. I’m mainly worried about my mental health because as someone who beats themselves up, I was actually feeling good about myself for maybe the first time in my 30 years!

Do you have any advice on how to motivate myself to still do these things (I know I won’t be able to do it all, every day like in lockdown) or advice to let lockdown go and accept that I was just lucky to have that time in the first place?

I know I have enough time to do all these things after work (I finish work around 4pm) but worry that I won’t have to motivation to practice yoga, run, read, cook healthily etc., after a day at work and lesson planning!

731,"I live with my BF and we have 4 dogs. 1 German shepherd (standing on his hind legs he stands at 5'1. The last time we weighed him he was 95 at six months so not sure how much he actually weighs) and 3 mini dachshunds. The first time my half sister met my dachshund (about 3 months old at the time) she held her for a bit then proceeded to throw her on the cement harshly! I was pissed but ignored it since she was just a kid. On several occasions when I baby sat her i noticed my dachshunds would yelp often so I started to pay more attention as to why they kept yelping. Turns out this little AH has been pinching and pulling my dachshunds tails/ears/fur out and she purposely do it when my boyfriend and I arnt looking. When I caught her red handed and ask her why and what she did to my dog she denies it and says ""nothing..."" I've tried to explain boundaries and treating dogs with respect several times but she continues to do this.  


She doesn't like my german shepherd at all. He's very big (very friendly too) and doesn't realize how big he is. He often nudge people roughly not realizing how big he is for people to pet him. When he does this my half sister would smack his face area. Due to this I keep him locked behind a gate in the kitchen when my half sister comes over. Yesterday I was refilling our toilet paper bin in the bathroom and heard her get up from the couch like motha fucking chucky the doll tip tapping her foot and the next thing I know my german shepherd is growling. Mind you this is only the 2nd time i've ever heard him growl and i've had him since he was a puppy. He's 2 now. After growling he starts barking intensely as if there was an intruder in the house followed by my other 3 dachshunds barking. I ran out and saw her slowly get on the couch like she didn't just get up and do something to my dogs. I questioned what she did and she refused to speak. I kept questioning her and she ended up saying ""nothing..."" I dont know what she did but I KNOW SHE DID SOMETHING! My dogs has never barked in that tone nor has my German ever growl at a person. I am convinced she has malicious intentions towards my dogs and I think she may someday poison them or feed them cleaning products. I told my BF but he says ""she's just a kid she doesn't know any better.""  


She always tells my step mom and I that she ""wants to see the dogs"" but every time she comes over she shows no interest. When My dachshunds lay next to her she would exclaim ""NO!"" and either push them off the couch or move away so clearly she's lying.

732,"As the title says, I am mean in my sleep and 99% of the time I don’t remember at all. Some days I will wake up the next morning and notice my husband is acting a ways and now I assume it has to do with something I did in the middle of the night. 

Particularly last night, I went to bed before my husband and woke up today and my husband was distant and silent. In my head I’m saying “fuck, not again” and to him I say, “did I do something last night?” And he said in sad voice, yes, and I asked what I did and he said I refused his cuddles several times and I guess I wiggle my body when he comes to touch me. 

This has happened many times. It doesn’t happen very night especially if we go to bed together already cuddling, I noticed I don’t think it happens. Sometimes I talk in my sleep, kick, or just reject any touching (so I’ve been told). I have definitely woke up in my sleep crying before from a dream, I have woken myself up from kicking before and sometimes talking. But I never feel my husband come to cuddle me if I’m already sleeping. I’m thinking it has to do with me being in a deep sleep already, and he comes and maybe “disturbs” my sleep by touching me. I don’t know. 

One method I’ve tried that works, is I will say a prayer like “God willing I will be loving and kind in my sleep” and it has actually worked. 

The problem is, I never know when it will happen. Should I just say those words EVERY night? What if my mind gets used to it and overrides it and goes back to being mean. It sucks because it affects my husbands mood all day which I don’t blame him and then it affects me because I spend time trying to apologize and cheer him up and wonder how to fix it. 

How can I prevent this altogether? Any other remedies you’ve used?",12Aug2020,1
733,"So, I guess I'm primarily looking for advice from women, but men can certainly answer (although I foresee getting shit on lol). 

Anyway, I've been thinking heavily about my dream man - with no actual intention of trying to find him, or dating... just thinking - when lo and behold I randomly meet a guy who is everything I've ever wanted. **Except that** I'm not attracted to him. He's not an unattractive guy, I just have specific wants and needs in the physical appearance of my partner.

This man has a gorgeous luxury car, a stellar job, and a doting/chivalrous attitude. The Chads of the world would call him a simp (which is a word I don't believe in, just trying to paint a picture here). He is an extremely interesting and captivating person to speak with, so we've gotten together on a couple of occasions just to hang out and chat. I made it clear that I'm approaching this from a platonic angle, and that I enjoy our conversations. He understood and never tries to make any moves or say anything inappropriate. I actually don't think it's in him to say anything inappropriate, ever. 

He has cooked for me, bought me small things (which I vehemently tried to decline but ended up accepting to avoid a scene), and compliments me left right and center. It's like having a one-person fan club. It's amazing, but I feel so guilty. 

I guess my question is... because I don't think I'll ever meet a guy like this again... do I run with it? Or do I continue searching, knowing that these qualities are what I want in someone that also matches what I'm seeking physically? Fuck! Help!

734,"So I want to start by saying I moved from Puerto Rico from Minnesota a little more than a month ago. While I was in PR I had friends but then I fell in a deep depression while in college. I got my degree, then I got hooked on drugs right after that. First Xanax, then Heroin. That went on for like 3 years. 


Then I moved to Minnesota with my aunt. My life has changed for the better so far. I got a job, I'm making some money. Not a lot, but enough to get by. I don't miss Heroin at all. My psychiatrist in PR did prescribe me benzodiazepines and right now I'm tapering off them. I want to be off all that stuff, but so far I'd say I'm doing ok. 



But there's something about me I don't like. I met a pretty girl next door. We speak some times, which took me some time to introduce myself because I've never been with a girl before. Well, yesterday I invited her to go bike riding with me, my sister and my cousins. She said she'll go if she can make it home after babysitting. Then I changed plans with my siblings because we couldn't find bike rentals in town. I thought she didn't want to go, but when her mom got home she told my little cousin that the girl told her she would go bike riding with us and that they had a couple bikes we could use. 


I was excited to spend time with her. But she never arrived in time, so me and my cousins made a firewood which I told the girl she was free to come. But she and her mom arrived late and we were almost done with the bonfire. 


I don't know. I was such in a good mood that I would at least spend time with a girl. I bought snacks, firewood and all stuff. I still don't know if she's interested in me. But I know it's bad to infatuate yourself with girls. Nevertheless I feel depressed and awkward about the whole thing. Where I live there's not many people my age to meet so besides work I spend time with my family. I'm just looking for advice. I want to change. I don't want to feel sad when stuff like that happens, and I also know I'm not the best with girls.

739,"This is a long one, sorry folks. I apologise for any formatting issues, I am on mobile.

For context, he's my best friend, we've known each other for about 4-5 years. We've been living together for about a year. He's 21, I'm 22.

There's a few layers to this story, bare with me. 

Around 3 days ago, my roommate and I made some edibles. They were extremely potent, and he had waaaay too much. He tells me he hasn't been able to come down. He feels weird and paranoid, he says he can't think, and he forgets things very quickly after he says them. He says he doesn't feel real, like the world around him isn't real, that he isn't real.

He just keeps saying he doesn't feel normal, he will never feel normal again. He's tried all of the normal things to try and come down, like drinking water, eating sugar, meditation, etc etc. 

I can't tell if he still actually high, or it's spun him into a mental health episode. He's generally unstable, he had to go to the psyche ward of the hospital for a few days for suicidal tendencies a few weeks ago. They gave him Lexapro, which he has not been taking consistently. About a week ago, he had 3 pills left, now I see he has 1. I keep telling him to refill it, but he won't/can't. He can't seem to focus on anything. 

He has some mental health conditions as well as a traumatic upbringing. He's diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression. Though, I think he may have some other underlying mental issues such as bipolar, schizophrenia, or borderline, (I'm not knowledgeable in this, all I can do is Google symptoms and look at the results) 

Prior to this episode, He's told me he's heard voices before, he tells me all the time he doesn't feel real, generally he's very sensitive (he is a slob and I can't ask him to clean up normally without him telling me he's overwhelmed, let alone now). He's a huge hypocrite, and he lies constantly. He's a compulsive liar. But he believes the words he says until he's called out. Then he's just stressed out. He lies constantly about tasks he says he'll do, but never actually does them. I believe this isn't malicious, he simply believes he *will* do them and then never does. His views of various things/people change on a dime. I know it's normal to some extent to love and then hate certain people sometimes, but to the severe degree he does it, I don't think it's normal. 

After he went to the hospital, he was better for a bit. He seemed like himself again, he's generally very outgoing and funny. He made some new friends, and seemed to be on top of the world until these edibles completely spiralled him. He knows he has a lot of issues, he was trying to work on them. The hospital set him up with a therapist and medication, and it seemed to be helping. 

A habit of his is to reject suggestions, and be generally very contrarian while he's in a downswing. He not only will say it won't work, he can't do it, but he'll actively bring the suggestion down. It can be really defeating to try and help him. He's not good at describing his feelings or thoughts, it's hard to find all the puzzle pieces. You'll think you've made a leap with him, until he brings up some very vital piece of info that it never occurred to him that he should mention. And it debunks all of the information you've already set forward.

I have no idea how to handle this situation. I don't know how to get him the resources he needs, because I've been so patient with him for so long, I feel like there's nothing more I can do. I'm at my wit's end. He clearly needs help. It's taking a toll on me mentally to be around him, he talks himself in circles and I can't do anything for him. 

With the prior conditions, I don't know if he's actually still high, or if this has transformed into something different. I know the real him in there, he's a good person. He just loses touch with himself every so often, and needs help. 

I helped him move out his small dead end town, I got him his job, I drive him to work. I try to be kind and understanding through it all. I've helped him through so many of his problems. I'm tired of giving so much, so often. If I'm gonna keep helping, I need to help him help himself here, but he doesn't seem to be capable. Though he makes me want to move out, I can't just abandon him. 

I'm open to any insight, I'm losing my mind

TLDR: My roommate has basically lost touch with reality after having waaay too many edibles, I believe it's aggravated his prior severe mental health issues, and I don't know how to help him.",12Aug2020,1
740,"Context: my bf knows he has a hard time not drinking, we’ve touched lightly on possible alcoholism but never too many red flags until a while ago he blacked out and a girl kissed him, which he can’t remember. Ever since he said he’d stop but then didn’t. It’s been on and off for months and he won’t stop. 

He said he would stop as soon as he found out I was pregnant because “there’s no reason to drink if you’re not” well found out that’s a lie. He has been drinking since he found out. He buys on his way home and drinks in his car and runs errands for me willingly without me knowing I’m tired to go and drink. I asked him if he’d been drinking yesterday and said “you think im hiding a bottle” i said “yeah you’ve talked about having the urge to do that in the past” and he said “no” and changed the subject. I was still skeptical, something didn’t feel right but i was afraid my hormones were getting the best of me.

I confronted him again saying i know you have tried to work on cutting drinking down but this is more serious now that we are having a baby (we’ve been together 4 years) he got defensive and said he doesn’t need anyones help and he’s taking care of himself. I left it at that and when he fell asleep I went out to his car because i doubted him and found a can of 4 loko, empty. We hadn’t drank in a couple of weeks and it was still fresh.

I waited till this morning to confront and his response was he’s embarrassed but hes been so stressed and anxious and mixed feelings on becoming a dad and didn’t want to stress me out with his issues that it’s his only outlet.

I responded that I don’t want to have a baby, he claims hes going to handle it, but he wont admit he’s an alcoholic. I had 2 alcoholic parents, i know what the signs look like. Im not comfortable throwing my life away the way my parents did and raising a kid with fucked up parents. I am so angry that he lied and tried to make me seem like i was insane, yet only admit once i found out??? I want to help him but cant trust him? His mom is a recovering alcoholic and has had similar tendencies, but he doesn’t want to admit he may very well be one. I think he is (he’s 22 I’m 25) i am horrified that someone can do something like this while going through the biggest change of our lives and pretend everything is okay. That’s so selfish!!!!! What do i do, I scheduled an abortion just in case because I cannot stand the thought of dealing with this and raising a child with someone i may not be able to trust anymore. 

I get that it is a disease but my parents never took the time to get their shit together and it fucked me up entirely, im terrified of history repeating itself and I’m so fucking angry I’m literally letting my life fall apart this way.",12Aug2020,1
741,"My whole life i tried to be polite and nice to others.
But ofc there were some moments where i made mistakes, hurt others, and messed up relationships.
I remember every mistake i made no matter how long ago it happened and i feel bad about it. 

Eg. I gave no attention to this guy who liked me when we were 13, and i told him to stop texting me and to mind his own business. My tone was very harsh and i even changed my fb status to in a relationship cause i didnt want him to talk to me. Looking back, i was very harsh on him and i def hurt him. I feel so bad.

Its good to realize your mistakes and learn from them but i cant move on. Its becoming exhausting and i dont know how to stop this. I know im not a bad person but i guess i cant get over the fact that some people out there may think that im a cold hearted selfish person because of my attitude toward them.

The example i showed you happened in 2015. Yes ik its very odd and concerning.

Ive always wanted to start my own youtube channel but then i kid you not, the first thing that pops up in my mind is: what if someone from 4th grade who i was once rude to finds my channel and 'exposes' me? Ive never bullied anyone before and i swear i never tried to be mean to anyone on purpose. But i cant get over the fact that i too made some bad mistakes when i was younger.

Overall, I have a hard time dealing with these thoughts and the guilt of being mean to someone no matter whar my intentions were. I just want to stop overthinking so much. What can i possibly do?",12Aug2020,1
742,"Like the title says driving terrifies me so much I get anxiety just thinking about it. 

I don't even know why. I have had my license for almost 3 years now and I don't drive much, mostly because I don't own a car nor need one in my everyday life - I live in a big city and use public transportation.

When I do drive I get so tense my neck, back and arms hurt, I'm awful with anyone trying to give me directions - thankfully my fiancée is very understanding but that's no excuse and it makes me feel bad.

It's holding me back, keeping me from doing things, planning a weekend away is often a nightmare because I don't want to drive.

My fiancée is planning a surprise getaway for my upcoming birthday and asked me if I was ok driving there before making reservations. She said it would be 2 hours max and we could take as many breaks as needed on the way. She doesn't have a license. I said yes because I don't feel like I had a choice, and I really want to do something special (I'm turning 30) but now I'm freaking out.

It's in a month and I know I'm gonna be anxious this whole time. It might also keep me from enjoying my weekend. 

I really don't know why driving stresses me so much. I've never been in an accident, never even witnessed one. I'm not very confident in my driving skills but it's because stress gets in the way, without the stress factor I'm a perfectly capable driver. 

Anyway, if you have advice on this, I'll take anything. But I don't have the money or time to take driving lessons and I don't have easy access to a car for practice either.",12Aug2020,1

744,"hi all, hope everyone's doing well. I just needed some quick advice / someone to hear me out until I can secure a slot with my therapist in the coming weeks (my first appointment!) 

universities have reopened in the past few days (covid incidence where I am has been in the single digits for quite some time &amp; there are many precautions taken), and I do have quite a bunch of in-person classes. it hasn't even been a week, but I find myself feeling slightly anxious/antsy, though I don't know at what. I think I might just be anticipating the amount of stress/workload that I'll have to deal with this semester? (but that seems redundant given that I've absolutely zero assignments right now) or maybe bc I am readjusting/dealing with social interactions again? I consider myself an introvert, so I wasn't entirely too bothered by the months of quarantine at home... but now that school has resumed I feel like I've been misstepping in every social interactions I have thus far in classes...

746,"I would be a freshman this year, but with cover kinda messing everything up, I have made changes to what I want. At first I wanted too attend a state school here, but that got transferred to online so I thought $20k for a year of online classes didn't seem right, so I thought of community college, but the idea of spending thousands of dollars to take general classes and essentially google everything doesn't make sense to me. For the last semester of hs, I struggled with everything online. Plus, I just am not excited at all for any of this. I want to do college right as in go to in person classes, meet new people and actually feel like I am spending it right. 

I am about to get promoted at my job which means I will make more money/hour and get more hours. I will have a management position which will look great for college. My parents aren't really excited for that for me, which upsets me. 

Basically, this year I want to spend it working, volunteering, getting in shape and actually take some time to prepare for school. I don't feel mentally ready at all and I haven't felt ready since even before cover. I mentioned taking a semester off back in January to my mom, but she said that I would end up like my brother (he dropped out after his first year). So she shot the idea down really quickly.

 I have always done what my parents want me to do and they are kinda controlling when it comes to me. They have basically planned my future for me. They told me what jobs they want me to consider (nurse, lawyer) but I have told them for years I want to focus on forensics. They told me I need a job that makes a ton of money, but I want a career that I am happy with and interested in (which they told me was ""stupid of me"").  They both have well paying jobs and my other brother is going to be a surgeon so they have high expectations of me. 

Everything just seems like a mess when it comes to this next year. I feel like I am in a bad spot mentally and with college on top of that, I don't see things playing out well. I just want a year or even just a semester to figure things out before I go to school. Any tips/advice on how to explain this to my parents would be great. Sorry for the messy post! Thanks everyone!!!",12Aug2020,1
747,"i just don't know what to do. i am so miserable. i can't go to therapy because my mom would never let me leave the house because she has ocd and a month and a half old baby. it's been 6 months since i've seen my boyfriend or a single human being that doesn't live with me.. 6 months since i've been in public at all. 6 months since i've been outside my neighborhood. 6 months since i've had any kind of takeout food. 6 months since i've been in any store. i have been outside maximum 5 times in the past 6 months. each time was maybe 30 minutes in my backyard. i'm not allowed to go outside without my mom watching.

going outside was the only thing that helped my depression before and now i don't even have that. i am stuck in this damn house with constant yelling and honestly i just can't anymore. my mom was very mean to my last therapist she stopped taking me because she figured i 'had enough treatment and was now cured'. she has never been supportive of my mental health issues and basically said that i would be a drug addict when i started taking meds. and nothing feels real. it's all so foggy and i'm having bad memory issues and i keep spacing out. i'm supposed to start back up with homeschooling again in 2 weeks. how the hell am i gonna do that when it takes all that i have just to get up. why does life just keep kicking me when i'm down. what did i do to deserve it.",12Aug2020,1
748,"Hello all, I wanted to ask for your opinions of what to do. Throughout undergrad, I was told to follow the major I love, and as a result, I did. I decided to pursue psychology because psych really fascinated me. I would love to work with people and therefore that was the major that I am going to graduate with. 

I acknowledge that a psych BA is practically worthless in the market, so I will continue into Grad school . My problem is that I am having trouble choosing a Masters program. I was looking into getting an MA in public administration because from the description and other individuals with that degree seem to have fun with it. I was also looking into I/O psychology; I feel this one is more interesting because what I planned to do was to become a human resources manager. Another one that caught my eye would be an MS in counseling with a focus on college counseling. I don't know if any of these would give me the stability I crave to have: decent work/life balance, and good pay $22 hr would be nice.

I would like to add some details:

I am a CSUDH student and I would love to stay in the school or surrounding area. The reason being is I cannot afford to move at all. I have 2 jobs to pay my way through school and housing. Being that the pandemic is happening I have gotten creative and have gotten into little side hustles and adapting by finding another job. Everything I have is here: The jobs that are keeping me alive. I hate living paycheck to paycheck but so far I have taken out 0 student loans. If I have to take out some for grad school I wouldn't mind but I want my decision to be a fruitful one.  

I am scared of being stuck in lower-paying jobs because I decided to pursue what I love. Quite honestly I am not pursuing lots of money, I believe I would be comfortable within 50-60K a year.  It would be nice to get more but it is not something that I am pursuing. I grew up pretty poor, heck my mom and dad combined made like 24k a year. 

I was also entertaining the idea of becoming a teacher. In this scenario, I would need to get my credentials. I would love to be part of the charter school that paved my way to go to college. Jobs such a HS counselor have also appealed to me. I dont want to pursue a job, I want to pursue a degree in which has different opportunities for me but that doesn't leave me looking for bread crumbs.

Yes, I also thought about getting a Ph.D., but I shut the idea down because honestly, I am not much of a research person. I like interacting with people, talking to them and empathizing with them.

If you have any ideas of other masters programs, besides I/O or public admin, I would love any help.",12Aug2020,1

751,"Ehm I don't know how to start but I (Male, 16) am dating this girl (15) I met at the local dance school for some months now. We met like 9 to 10 times and did stuff like watching netflix together, going to different restaurants or just going for walks.
Until the latest date we have only been talking to each other about normal stuff like hobbies, school, life in general or just things that came to our mind at the time. Though sometimes we walked in silence for a minute or so it was never akward. She's quite different from me.
We don't have the same music taste, have different hobbies etc but I still enjoyed every minute with her though shortly before our dates I had doubts about them.  Then last sunday we were watching Netflix and I finally encouraged myself to take her hand (she already gave me small hints). Idk it felt good and I think she enjoyed it to.
I'm one hundred percent sure that she likes me but I am still insure about my feelings mainly because I imagined my first (maybe in the future) relationship/girlfriend to be different.
She's a very nice person, and from her looks not like ""hot"" but more a bit over average looking and more cute but looks is not as important as character.
I feel like if I wouldn't have these imaginations/expectations I'd be more convinced about my feelings.
My plan for now is to keep meeting her/going out on dates with her and try to get more certain about my feelings.

756,"So my Bff is actually my Cousin (21M), and I’m (25F). We started talking in 2014, we lived in a different cities so when he moved in my city we started hanging out, he lives in the same building as me and my parents just the apartment below us, which belongs to his father. We were so close to each other to the point of telling each other Everything, from our daily activities to darkest secrets and communicating about our deep emotions and fears. I’m absolutely devastated and heartbroken by the fact that he suddenly cut all the contacts with me. I’ve tried contacting him as usual but he ignored my messages and my calls were blocked, i was confused for a couple of weeks I thought that something had happened to him, so i kept on messaging him for about one and half months! But obviously nothing happened to him, he was posting regularly on social media and everything was find with him. He just blocked me. I’m grieving I can’t stop thinking about him, everything was good, perfect even I thought, but i was wrong and everyone around me was hinting that my Cousin might be in love with me but I denied this assumption and tbh I deliberately refused to believe that he had feelings for me except for friendship, first of all he is my Cousin (even though in my country it is allowed for Cousins to marry each other but i saw him as my friend only), and Second he is younger than me, i love him like a brother and a friend I never wanted to see something else in him except these things. Looking at the past i now see that indeed our relationship looked like a “One Sided relationship” basically i friendzoned him without even realizing it. we would talk everyday, if I didn’t text or answer him he would panic and call my sister searching for me, he would bring me snacks and presents for all the occasions. Sometimes he would ask me things like “What do you think if a Woman marries a man younger than her?” I’d answer truthfully that I wouldn’t do it myself (I didn’t even realize at what he was hinting) he would get defensive at my answer. One time i dated a guy and my Cousin tried to break us up by telling me he isn’t good for me and he is a bad influence and all, we did break up but not beca of my Cousin. Anyway The last time we spoke everything was as usual nothing hinted at that he would block me. I feel so horrible and stupid, how could i not see what was going on, why did I ignore the signs?? I hate myself and this situation i feel very sorry for him, I didn’t mean to break anyone’s hopes and heart. This happened 2 months ago and I still can’t accept the fact that he isn’t around and out of my life, i feel like my heart is broken I’m literally grieving, it’s hard for me to open up to people I rarely do it, but when i do I pour my soul into a relationship be it a friendship or a love relationship. Even though it’s hard for me i know it must be as hard for him, I cannot blame him for blocking me, i know he did what was best for him. I really hope he finds peace and be happier.

hi! i’m a highschooler with pretty bad anxiety (undiagnosed, no one knows), it’s been this way since middle school ;-;

recently during quarantine i joined a dnd discord server and found nice, friendly people to play with. all males, and i am female but they are all sweet. we have texted for a couple of months now. 

every week we have a session over voice chat and i joined the server initially because i thought online friends would help my anxiety. i’ve never avoided one purposely but it gives me almost full on panic attacks when it’s time. during the sessions my blood rate is elevated the entire time. i am really quiet and i think they notice but as i said they are quite nice people. i have fun listening to them speak but i feel like i’m in spectator mode all the time. i feel like i don’t contribute to group dynamics.

i am thinking of quitting and leaving the server. i tell myself to be more talkative every week but it just... doesn’t happen. there happens to be a play-by-post text based option and i am thinking of doing that instead, meaning i would leave my current group due to time.

is this a good idea? or should i just “get over it” and tough the voice calls even though my anxiety is really ruining the fun for me. am i a coward? pls help T-T",12Aug2020,1
759,"Honestly, I had no idea how to title this post but that’s about the best I could think of. Basically, I have issues shifting my focus if I’m already doing something else (even if that something else isn’t very important.) Example: I can be sitting on the couch randomly scrolling on reddit/facebook, and my boyfriend will start saying something in the same room. 99% of the time, I will not even NOTICE that he is talking at all. As if my brain has automatically blocked him out without even giving me the choice. After a minute, it will normally hit me that I can hear him talking. But the point in which that happens is pretty random and not really a point in which I choose, given that until that point I have no idea he is even talking to begin with. Plus, by that time I’ve missed what he said and I have to ask him to repeat it.

It’s obvious this has caused some issues and I have no idea how to prevent it. I do know that if he says my name, it’s like a trigger in my brain that prompts me to shift my focus to him. But if he starts talking about something without “triggering” it, I don’t even realize he’s speaking to me. I also frustrate myself with this, because it seems anytime I start talking he can listen no problem, even if he’s doing something else. But I don’t understand why my brain doesn’t do the same?
He tells me that it just means what he is saying isn’t important to me so I don’t pay attention. But I’ve tried to explain that it’s not just him. And I don’t want to automatically dismiss when he’s talking.

I also want to note that this issue is not only with him, I’m just using him as the example because I’m with him the most. But this actually happens with anyone/anything. Family, friends, even if I have the tv on. It won’t register in my brain that someone is talking to me, or if someone on tv is talking, until the person specifically triggers my attention somehow.

Is this really just me being an asshole without realizing that I am one? Or is there some sort of term that this describes??

I have a huge interest in linguistics and also agriculture or really permaculture. I plan on studying linguistics in a few years and then following through until I get a PhD, perhaps at a foreign institute. I am not sure what to do with my life after that ... I have always had a longing for the countryside and desperately want to live in a small cottage on my own holding, subsiding off the land and running the farmstead. This is my dream, I know I will not be happy in life unless I am able to realise myself but I don't see any way of following through on both paths.

My particular interests are dialectology, folklore, Goidelic languages (especially Irish), historical/comparative linguistics and idk philology. My other interests are traditional music and I also like animals (hence why I'd love to farm).

Is there any way I can be a linguist *and* a small farmer? I would love to be involved in Irish revitalisation and Gaeltacht language planning but would I be able to do this where I plan to live in the country side?

Thanks, any advice appreciated.",12Aug2020,1
765,"That title sounds crazy, I know. My boyfriend of 6 years just dumped me and started dating a new girl a week later. He told me he didn’t cheat, and he’s never ever lied to me before and he has no reason to lie now. So I believe him. I am depressed, anxious, stressed, everything you can think of. I have met this girl one time whenever they were hanging out, her car died and I jumped them off. She seems very sweet actually. I want to message her but I don’t even know what to say. I somehow think that doing this will make me feel better. I want to just ask her how she can date a guy who got out of a 6 year relationship a week ago. I want to ask her why she thinks that he won’t break up with her and date someone new as soon as someone better comes along. I just want to have a conversation with her.

771,"So I thought my coworker(32f) and I (23m) got along pretty well. Always cracked jokes and had some deep conversations. It got a bit too deep at times as well. I have been working up the courage ask her out, but recently that's been put into question. These are the red flags.

1. She goes out to the bar with friends on the weekends when the court ordered to stop; from getting into a drunk fight that with an ex that's a control freak. Same ex has tried to open her door with a meet cleaver, stole her dad's ashes, and almost died in front of her by slashing his wrists. Yet, she still hangs out with and didn't truly break up with him until last week (if possible). So it's an on and off rollercoaster.

2. She feels lonely and is very forgiving. 

3. Lied about not bringing same ex to a recent fishing trip some coworkers, her, and I took.

4. She has 4 kids that she splits between her and an asshole ex husband.

I have a certain gut feeling about this, I want to see if it is right. I am not very good at picking up alot of social ques.

772,"Just as the title says. I've been studying away from home since I was 18. The whole reason I wanted to be far away from home was for my own freedom. My parents have controlled every aspect of my life until I was 18 and continued to do it every time I came home. Away from home, I'd be out late, do whatever I wanted and drove my car wherever I needed to go whenever. But once I was under their roof, I couldn't go hang with friends even once a week, they told me when I should get my hair cut, they expected me to dress and speak more maturely and I should lose weight and take better care of my skin BUT the way they would go about demanding this of me was like talking to a dog. They hold so much resentment and disappointment in their voice that I couldn't take it one day and stood up to them. I sat them down and respectfully told them all the things that I felt they were going about doing the wrong way and for the sake of my younger siblings, they should change some of their ways. This was a year ago and since then, they've held that talk against me for being ungrateful for all the sacrifices they've made. 

However, the treatment of my siblings changed. My parents have been letting my younger siblings go out whenever they wanted, go to parties, sleepovers and even found out they started drinking and their response was , ""Well you said we were too strict."" All the while, still being uptight with me. 

Fast forward to 2 days ago, my mom and I had it out over something stupid. She wanted a list on her office desk so I told her oh yea but you said you needed it tomorrow morning. She replied in this condescending tone, ""This is why I never tell you to do anything. You have no interest and no ambition in life. Had I told one of your younger siblings, they'd have brought it already."" To which I replied, then ask them instead of me. 

Yea I know that could have been easily resolved but the frustration has been building up so much in me being stuck at home and I just felt it was time I stood up to her again. I demanded that she learn to speak to people better than that and for the past 10 years, no one has ever spoken to me in that manner and just because she's my mother, it does not give her the right to talk to me or treat me the way that she does. AND SHE JUST BLEW UP. Told my dad how I hate them and don't care about anyone besides myself and don't care about my siblings and hasn't spoken to me since then. 

Tl;dr - My parents never see how badly they treat me and blow up every time I try to correct them. 

P.S - I understand it's their house but I am my own person and deserve respect. I'm only stuck home because of Corona.",12Aug2020,1
773,"
Hello, I actually decided to write my first post on reddit, as an attempt to seek help or advice. Im dealing with an unhealthy obsession and its taking a toll on my relationships and private life.

When my relationship with my boyfriend started he was dealing with a toxic friendship. His lady-friend was struggling with mental-health problems and sadly was dragging him down with her. She would manipulate him and lie to him. He shared his struggles with me, and i tried to support him, while still trying to be objective with my judgement - i imagine his friends behavior was influenced by her mental state and everyone makes some mistakes.

As I found out later, she had a crush on him. She reacted extremally emotional when he told her that he is dating me, and ngl i felt also some guilt for making her mental state worse. Thats when i started stalking her social media. She would post a lot about her feelings and pivate life. She would indirectly talk about her feelings towards my boyfriend, and there was something intriguing in that, that made me check on her sm more often. 
After some time my boyfriend cut her out of his life, and left the friendship behind. Even though he didnt have to deal with her anymore i still stalked her socials, feeling more and more envious and hateful every time she would make a refrence to my boyfriend in her posts. She posted about things they used to talk about, about having her heart broken, about loving the right person at the wrong time etc. She even posted some pictures he sent to her when they used to be friends and added a caption about unconditional love. It made me furious.

That lasted for about a year. I assume she just got over him after that time, and let go the negative feelings. 

But I didnt. 
I became extremally obsessed with her life, gloryfying it in my head and constantly comparing myself to her. I dont even know her in person - I created a picture in my head based on her social media posts. (I realise it might be totally different than her irl persona). I romanticise every single thing about her, while dragging myself down at the same time. 
My behavior makes me sick, but I cant help it - I lie to myself that it'll be the last time I do that but then I'll do it again. The worst thing is that Im aware how irrational my behavior is, it leaves me feeling awful, and emotionally drained.
I tried to get closure by texting her. I confessed my feelings, apologized and explained why i texted her in the first place. Her response was polite and she confessed some of her feelings too. It did help for some time, but im back at it again, feeling mad that i shared something so intimate with her.
My boyfriend hates talking about this topic and I cant blame him - my hate and jealousy towards that girl is totally unexplainable, and it should pass, especially after such a long time. I also dont talk about it with my friends. They know about the situation, but im too ashamed to tell them the whole truth.

I know i need to seek professional help. Im planning to go to a therapist in a few months - right now it is sadly impossible. I just wish i could do something to soothe myself during quarantine - with too much time on my hands my thoughts just keeps circling around her and its making me feel worse each day.

Please dont judge me too harshly - i know my behavior is spiteful and wrong. I just struggle so much to change it. Any words of advice would be appreciated.",12Aug2020,1
774,"Background: My Grandmother escaped Vietnam a few years after the war broke out. Her father was kidnapped by the Vietcong, with only one letter being sent back to the family in 10 years, leaving the family to maintain control of their international shipping business. She was one of the first of her siblings to drop out of school, never getting a proper education in language, but becoming very good at math due to the nature of the work. Our family eventually realized that they needed to flee the country. They hid gold and money in floorboards and different accounts, which were subsequently seized by the government. After she left Vietnam she experienced abuse as a refugee that I won’t get into. Her family was split all over the world, going to different parts of the world as refugees. She ended up in Canada while her other siblings ended up in the U.S, Europe, and other parts of Asia. She’s told our family about all this in bits and pieces. Recently she’s been having sporadic mental episodes, yelling at neighbors, breaking down crying, etc, most likely from stress from quarantine. I’ve mentioned to my mom about going back to Vietnam to help her over her past but I don’t know if it will do more harm then good.

778,"For the past year and a half, I've been working to create an Esports clan and organization that aspires to pave the way for people with disabilities in competitive gaming.

However, almost from day one, there was one guy with a lot of motivation, and by all means he got some really cool things started (yet never finished/stuck with it). It turned out he had mental health and drug problems, which made him extremely toxic, not just to me but to everyone. As much as he helped, he destroyed too.

Most people decided to cut him out of their lives, but as the founder I thought it was my responsibility to try and make it work. After all, people with disabilities (me included) often have personal struggles and I have to be mindful of that.

For the past half year things cooled down a bit. Mostly thanks to the fact that he acknowledged his problems, decided to get professional help and distanced himself from the clan. Now and then there were some hiccups. I can usually handle those, but things add up.

Last night he begged me to video chat with him and the first thing I notice was the white powder on his nose. He was on coke and the only reason he wanted to video chat with me was to shock me and get under my skin...something he loves to do. Things escalated and I honestly had enough.

Today another member of the clan messaged me, saying that he fell again...in what I would describe as an act of self-harming (nothing new to him). 

I want to do the right thing. From a professional perspective and a friendship perspective, at what point have I done enough to make it work? When do I kick him? When do I cut him out of my life?",12Aug2020,1
779,"For the past couple of weeks I've been referred to as either stupid, an idiot or just being plain silly.

It originally started with my Mom who said I'm an idiot for not using my logic. I was having an interview for a new job (which I was successful and start in a couple of weeks!) but I left my Marvel and DC canvas pictures hanging on the wall behind me which prompted her to argue that I didn't look professional and looked like an idiot. After I told her of my success she told how proud she was of me but the fact she called me an idiot still stuck in my mind. 

A few days later I asked my friend about Warhammer transfers. We both collect 40k (he collects Drukhari, I collected Orks and am now moving onto Tyranids) and since the new edition has more terrain rules I wanted to try making my own. I made a burnt barricade out of lollipop sticks and cut out some of my old Ork transfer stickers to stick to the barricade. I had the idea of making it look like Orks had looted the area and left clan tags around and thought maybe I could do the same with another factions. I asked my friend if he had any spare Drukhari  transfers and he asked why, so I told him my idea and he replied with saying my idea was stupid and that Drukhari are pirates and wouldn't leave markings, they'd just string up dead bodies. Again, this made me feel like I'm stupid. 

Last week I had my Grandma over my dinner and when I asked what she wanted to drink she asked for wine and lemonade. When I made the drink it was about 1/5 wine and the rest lemonade. When she drank it she complained she couldn't taste the wine and I replied saying she was driving so I didn't want to give her too much. She then called me silly and that she was only having 1 glass (which she did) and told me to top her up with more wine. My Grandma is a very old fashioned person and uses the word silly in the context of calling someone stupid. Once again this makes me feel inadequate.

Earlier today my Dad was doing some gardening and asked me to get some gloves for him from his office upstairs but I couldn't find them. When I told him he got into a huff and went upstairs and got a pair. He called me an idiot for not looking hard enough and that he despairs about me living on my own next year.

I shall preface this now, I don't come from an abusive background, my family love me very much as do my friends. However, having constantly being told this things I can't help but feel like maybe they're right (i know I'm not, after all I got a new job).

I'm not sure what to do.",12Aug2020,1
780,"I was going to post this in AITA sub but I felt like it was more nuanced than that. I got in an emotional argument with mom because I had been feeling ignored and judged recently. It’s been happening since the beginning of summer, I’ll bring something up that I’m either complaining about or excited about and she’ll either respond really flatly or not at all. I’ve ignored the feeling I got from this up until today, when I mentioned I might make some new hair changes that I was excited about before heading back to school. My mom stood there silently for a minute before saying “i don’t know what that would look like” and changing the subject. I went silent, because i was hurt by the lack of interest which prompted her to ask me what was wrong. Normally I wouldn’t be upset, but because it’s been happening ALL SUMMER it built up a little.

I then talked about how I felt like i was ignored and judged (by the silence) in the previous interaction. She got very defensive, explaining that she was just tying to visualize what it would look like, which I can understand, but then I followed with “well the silence made me feel a little judged and ignored.” This made her very upset and she went off talking about how I wasn’t considering her feelings and that I wasn’t understanding her side of the argument or taking into account everything she’s been through lately (for context, a good friend of hers passed away recently and she has been dealing with the grief).

I guess I’m just frustrated because I wasn’t trying to say that her “trying to visualize” was wrong - it’s just the way she’s responded to me in certain things over the course of the summer has made me FEEL bad, even if that wasn’t her intention, so i’m trying to communicate that feeling and find a solution.

I need advice on how to talk to her going forward, the argument has not yet been resolved. I guess I’m also looking for opinions on if her reaction was justified (aka AITA)? I wasn’t trying to put on extra burden on her during her grief, but she asked why I was quiet so I tried to explain.",12Aug2020,1

784,"Hey everyone,

I   just got out of yet another failed relationship and I've seen some   patterns happening to me that I don't understand, so I thought I might   want to reach out to someone.

I'll   start by saying a bit about myself. I'm a 26 year old male, I have a   steady well paid job, just recently moved into my own apartment, I have a   car, I have some good friends, some hobbies, etc. I'd like to believe,   at least on paper, I'm doing pretty fine in life. In fact, there's   people around me telling me that I'm doing surprisingly good for a 26   year old, yet somehow I don't seem to understand it, and honestly it   still feels like I'm somehow ""behind"" in life or ""not measuring up"" or   not being ""good enough"", etc. Quite frankly, I don't even know what   ""self love"" is all about.

I've had   4 ""serious"" relationships in my life before, and somehow it all went   down the same way for me ; I meet a girl, we date, we hook up, I start   to like her, she starts to like me, and we end up being in a   relationship. The problem is the fact that I seem to ignore all the red   flags about a certain person, and just keep convincing myself that  ""this  is as good as I'll get, so I might as well just settle for it"".  It's  like my self esteem in a relationship is non existent any more. As  long  as she sees eye to eye with me on a few very basic things (mutual   hobbies for example), that's enough for me to ""fall in love with her""   and cling onto her for my dear life, yet I ignore all the other ***very important*** things like whether she respects me or not, whether she's trustworthy, whether she's honest, reliable, etc.

Just   recently I got out of a relationship that lasted around 9 months. Out   of those 9 months, I was unhappy for a solid 8. I knew from the very   beginning that this person was just not okay for me, and yet I convinced   myself to go for it anyway, and be unhappy as a result. To make things   even more ridiculously complicated, they always tend to leave me. I   stick around until the very end, try to fight for what's left of the   relationship, but they always leave me, and it leaves me feeling   absolutely shattered, which is ironic if you ask me ; I'm unhappy in a   relationship, I complain to my friends and family that I want out, and   when the ""out"" actually happens, I'm depressed about it ... ? It doesn't   make sense to me.

The last girl I   dated (we broke up 10 days ago), was far from a compatible partner to   me. Apart from that, she had no respect for me whatsoever, she was   rarely intimate with me, we lacked genuine communication, she used to   play the victim around me all the time, she prioritized lots of things   before me ... Yet I stuck around, until it got to the point where I   started to get very frustrated on daily basis, and she left me because   of it. The ridiculous part is that even though it happened 10 days ago,   I'm still feeling devastated. I've had suicidal thoughts running  through  my head, I've been drinking a lot, I barely get out of the bed  in the  morning, I have 0 motivation, I lost interest in all my  hobbies,... All I  seem to be doing these days is just complain, cry,  sleep, and drink  alcohol. I really don't like that version of myself.  Why is this  happening to me each and every time ? How can I work on my  self esteem  to not let myself ever go through that again ? 4 times has  been enough  already, if you ask me ...

Not congratulations, only bad words and my collague was basically being a rat and telling everything to our boss about how I was not feeling motivated in work since we got cut from extra hours and bonuses, something we shared with each others a couple of weeks ago and we both were upset and not motivated because he cut everything from us from extra hours to bonuses by explaining the financial reason the company is struggling due to Covid situation, even though this is not true because other departments are still getting payed the same way! 

I really want to confront both of them, or at least my collague on what she did to me since I was helpful and supportive to her from the first day but today I heard how she was referring to me!

I know that maybe some people are just this way they are meant to be but need to solve this goddamn situation just to try to prove to her that I'm not an idiot (I was even choosen as Best Performer by CEO for 5 months in a row) and she totally betrayed me!",12Aug2020,1

795,"About 2 weeks ago, my grandfather had a paralysis attack and his entire left side of the body was affected, ever since then he's been dependent on us for everything that includes feeding, bathing, taking a dump, everything. He's been showing some progress but it is very slow. Just yesterday he was able to close his mouth completely and doesn't drool any more. But he is angry (he's a rather patient man), my guess is because he does not have anything to do. He's never been the talking kind and neither am I so our conversation are mostly about if he's feeling all right or feeling cold. But I've been thinking about how to keep him entertained, most of the days he lays awake staring at the ceiling, he listens to some radio but that is not too often. He never had any hobbies, but he used to watch a little bit of TV but he says he doesn't want to do that. Can someone help me on what to do with him?, he talks about his grandchildren IE my cousins but due Covid lockdown they are unable to meet him. Can anyone tell me what to do? Anyhelp would be appreciated.",12Aug2020,1
796,"This feels like a weird thing to say but I constantly feel like I have an empty pit inside my chest.

I have friends but I don't feel like I can't talk to them about how I'm feeling. I feel like I can only talk to one person about how I feel, I've talked to her about how I've felt before. But I don't feel like I can't talk to her, I don't want to annoy her and I dont want to bring her down. Even when I do talk to her about how I feel, it helps me feel better for a while but then I feel riddled with guilt, I feel like im being attention seeking, like im annoying her and like im bringing her down, she says that im not a downer or annoying but she's really nice so she obviously is going to say that to me.

I forget what it's like to feel happy, anytime I laugh or smile I instantly remember how crappy I feel so my happiness goes away.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. 

I exercise a lot, im healthy, I have a lot of friends, I've never had anyhting horrific happen to me, I don't have many significant worries in my life and I have a lot of achievable goals to work towards, but despite all this I constantly feel shit and like everything is meaningless.

Even when I talk to my friends I still feel alone and invisible and like no one likes me.

I also have a lot of hobbies and outlets so I have lots of things to focus on but nothing helps to take my mind off of how I feel.

I also have really bad anxiety so when I talk to my friends about anyhting it feels really intimidating and I'm worried that im going to annoy someone or ruin someone's day. Because of my anxiety I feel like I can't talk to anyone, this makes me feel really alone.

I also don't feel comfortable talking to people that I don't know, so talking to strangers doesn't help and therapy/ online therapy isn't an option.

I feel invisible and depressed, how do I stop feeling like this?",12Aug2020,1

799,"Please just take a minute to read this through. I know what most of your judgements will be right away, but please just answer honestly. 

I’ve been with my guy for about a year and a half. I went through a very toxic relationship 3 years ago so I know the warning signs of one. He’s been 10/10 the perfect guy for me. We’ve fought once and it was in the very beginning of our relationship. We’re very communicative, and we’ve established a LOT of trust. I discovered I was asexual during our relationship, and he’s been very supportive of me and my battle with our sexual relationship. I’ve been raped a few times, but I never really understood that I was raped until my boyfriend and I talked about my experiences, which is why I have such a bad relationship with sex now. 

We’ve talked about some things to help him find a release for his sexual needs. I did bring up that maybe we could look into finding someone who he could share his needs with, but I’m not comfortable with it and he knows that. We also talked about buying him a sex doll/toy that he could use, and he was on board with that! 

Now onto the dilemma.. My boyfriend left to go do some work with his coworkers in another state 6 hours away. This is the first time we will be away from each other for long than 3 days. He will be there for a week. Last night he called me after barely texting me all night (something that’s very unusual for him, he loves giving me attention) and told me that his boss made him go to a strip club.

The story he told me was that his boss had been getting hammered the entire night after working all day. My boyfriend had just a hotdog all day because he forgot his wallet at home. Apparently he convinced his boss to take them out for a meal, but instead his boss brought them all to a strip club. My boyfriend said that he told his boss that he wasn’t comfortable with it and wanted to stay in the car, but his boss gave him $100 to go into the club, so they did. Then his boss bought him a beer. My boyfriend doesn’t drink alcohol, but he drank the beer from his boss. Like he hates alcohol, he even hates it if I drink it. Anyway, his boss buys my boyfriend a fuckin lap dance. He declined, but his boss made him do it anyways. Apparently he kept his phone over his dick cuz he was trying to avoid a boner, but I assume that he actually enjoyed it since I’ve refused having sex with him for about 2 weeks now, and he hasn’t had time to masturbate while away from me. Then he told me that his coworkers are thinking of going to a happy ending sometime this week. This is another option I have told him that I may be okay with in the future, but obviously not this early into our relationship. Idk why but he definitely seemed excited when he told me they were talking about a happy ending before I shut that down and told him how I feel. 

I told him that if he did go through with a happy ending, that I’d feel disgusted if he wanted to have sex with me again. My relationship with our sex is bad anyways, but this would make it 10x worse and he knows this because I told him. He tried reassuring me last night that he wouldn’t do anything, and I do believe him to an extent. But I have the worst feeling in my stomach that won’t go away and this feeling has never been wrong before. I’ve felt it every time my exes have cheated on me or a person has wronged me, and I’m afraid that my boyfriend isn’t telling me something..

Mind you he has been a perfect boyfriend to me this entire relationship. Like I haven’t ever had to worry about him doing something like this. Usually we are very talkative and active with each other over text/snap, but he’s been very quiet and borderline ignoring me for the trip so far??

Last night during our call I told him that he should just focus on saving money for his sex toy. He told me that he feels differently about the sex toy now, and it’s actually the heat from having sex with someone that he craves. Before it was just about getting his sexual needs out, and now he actually “needs” someone to have sex with? All because of this trip. I’m fucking terrified. 

Please tell me what you would do in this situation, I’m not scared to be single but this man is everything to me. There’s nobody in this world that I’ve had a spark with like him, and I see us living our entire lives together. Something like this has NEVER happened in our relationship..",12Aug2020,1

801,"(please read this I'm trying to find out whats going on and it may sound crazy or a creepy story but its not, also sorry in advance for the grammar I speak english so its just a lack of basic knowledge) So for the last couple of months I think about 6-7 months weird things have been happening I live on the edge of the woods and what we thought to be just a one time creepy event has gone on for awhile. So we have cameras around our house/trailer because we were robbed 3 times, anyways at about 2am the camera on our front porch caught someone a man walk onto our front porch and knock when nobody answered he tried jiggling the doorknob the walked off my dad showed me the video of it 2 days later when he saw what happened.  


 For a few weeks all was pretty quiet then about 2 weeks later I was home alone a it was about 4:30am and I was up playing Xbox and heard a knock on the backdoor which faces the woods and is made of glass so a knock on that door struck me as odd so I crept down the hallway and peeked around the corner to the door and saw a figure walking down the stairs so I ran back to my room and locked my door and didn't fall asleep until like noon.  


 The next weird thing happened when me and my sister were home alone playing Xbox we played Black ops 2 for a few hours then at 8-9 pm I shutdown the Xbox and took it to my room and set up the baby gate in the hallway to keep my dogs out and went to my sisters room we talked about her upcoming rafting trip then we heard the front door open and we thought it was my dad so we went out to check but the door was shut so maybe we had imagined it but it couldn't have been that because my dog (12 years old and a pug) had been put on the other side of the baby gate and out puppy (about 5 months old and a pit bull) was going insane barking at the front door so me and my sister ran back to her room and she grabbed a bat which is my dad's friends bat with spray paint saying Mr. bat and we checked every room except my dad's because we aren't allowed inside so we went outside and walked around the house and found nothing about 15 minutes later my dad came home and asked why we had a baseball bat in the living room so we explained it to him and he brushed it off.  


 the next story I can't verify as I was at my mothers but my dad said he was letting our puppy out and saw something bigger than a coyote or a deer standing on 2 legs and it was in the woods by our house so he shot it and it ran off and that's all he told me so again I cant verify it.  


 the last story happened about a week and a half ago it takes place at 4 am my dads asleep I'm in the kitchen making a bowl of cereal and when I shot my fridge door I glance at the glass door and a person was staring in I couldn't make out any facial features other than huge eyes and no hair but when it noticed I had seen it had bolted and jumped the railing of the porch which is a good distance off the ground and disappeared into the treeline, from what I had seen it didn't appear to have a nose or mouth.  


Again I want to make this VERY CLEAR Im being serious this is true I can update this every time something happens but I don't know what this person or thing is or wants if you have a similar experience please help.",12Aug2020,1
802,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place but just wanted to see if I’m out of line on this issue. So I stayed at the residence inn to use the pool. They are broken up into 2 hour sessions due to COVID. I signed up for a session and get there and the pool is swamped with about 20 people and an additional 10-20 in the grilling area. What happened was one guest paid for the room and had a bunch of people come to use the pool and grill. So they basically had a party. We waited for an hour in the hot tub hoping some would leave the pool but that didn’t happen there was so many people in the pool and more coming  to the point where we couldn’t even use it. The guy who works the desk even told the guy all the extra people there were not allowed to be here and the guest just gave him a blank stare like he didn’t care and after the silence the front desk worker said well it’s ok this time but next time you stay don’t do that. I thought well that’s nice we paid to use the pool but can’t use it but everyone else who isn’t supposed to be here is allowed to use it? I asked for the manager but she wasn’t in so I got her email and explained the situation hoping to get a free night or at least close to it since I couldn’t even use what I came there for. I have stayed at this place many many times In the past.

The manager responds saying sorry she understand my concerns etc. Then says you are right but there is a limit of 20-30 guests in the area due to COVID just no unregistered guests should be there.So my complaint of 30-40 people in there is not justified according to her is the way she made it seem. Even though she just said unregistered guests are not allowed. I believe 4 were registered and the rest was their party. They were even on the phone inviting more people. So at the end of the email she said she issued 3000 points for my frustrations. 

I guess it’s a nice gesture but to stay at this hotel points wise it’s 20,000-30,000 for a night, so 3000 points is not really much.Am I out of line thinking I should get a free night? Because she is making me seem like the asshole for my complaint.",12Aug2020,1
803,"I have a very odd tendecy to become overly invested in romantic and platonic relationships.

I'm pretty sure this has led me me losing more friends than retaining them. In my romantic relationships I become very obessive with my partner. In my first relationship I demanded a large chunk of my girlfriends time and attention.
To the point where I would become jealous if she would spend time with her family. I was always calling her at imconvenient times and I always had to know what she was doing.

I've tried to help him out but he didnt accept my help,a week later he dms me saying that he is sorry and it wont happen again.

3 days ago he started attacking me at 3am and calling me a bitch,a liar and a cheater. Why? Because i made 1 pervy joke to a server of 10 people.
My best friend suggested me to block him in all the plantforms,i did it.He asked  IF to talk with me and unblock him,then he dmed my ex telling him to dm me to forgive him and that he'll change.

I was hoping they’d start associating him with good things but nothing yet. I even had him completely ignore them to see what happened and they couldn’t of cared less. 

So today we were in the kitten and mom’s room and the kitten hissed at him while he was in there alone. I came in and they were fine. I was dumbfounded. I’ve never had a two week old kitten hiss for no reason🤦🏻‍♀️

Any ideas would be appreciated. Cats are so weird.",12Aug2020,1
822," Having a mental breakdown about my career choice, turned to Reddit for help :)

I have been a CNA for about a year. I got my CNA license the Summer before my senior year of highschool, aspiring to study nursing in college. I've worked evening shift every weekend of my senior year in a LTC facility, and when the pandemic hit, I switched to full time. 

At first, fighting  against COVID and finding my place as a healthcare 'hero' (my unit had a huge outbreak in March-April) seemed like a noble cause and my interest in nursing was re-ignited. 

Now, my company has become very very hard and frustrating to work for, due to the administration. We are often forced to work doubles due to call-outs and the management's incompetency. Our lifts and vital signs equipment are constantly breaking and management is very lazy to repair it. Administration threatens to under-staff us if they see us sitting at the nurses' station on the surveillance cameras, and many of my coworkers are quitting or transferring. Management is arrogant, rude, and lazy. I realize that not only the CNAs are suffering, but also the nurses. 

The worst part is, from what I hear and read, almost all healthcare facilities are like this. 

It just breaks my heart to see how healthcare facilities and companies can be so corrupt and neglectful of their residents/patients and how little they actually care about the well-being of those who are in their care. They only seem to care about saving money (no matter the cost to the residents and employees) and how we are perceived by the public in regards to COVID-19.

I've always seen being a nurse as the light at the end of the tunnel. I'll tell myself, ""Oh, this job as a CNA is terrible now, I'm being treated like a soulless machine now, but when I'm a nurse, everything will be so much better.""

Now I'm starting to realize that even nurses feel this way.

I am beginning to question whether or not I want to continue in nursing. I love the good parts of being a CNA-- comforting residents, caring for them, laughing with them, holding them when there is nobody else to hold them--but I question if I personally would be able to withstand the negative side of t hiswork for the rest of my career. I want to have a family someday and be able to provide for them without being extremely over-stressed and burned out.

My worries escalated when I was reading on this page after a Google search of: ""Is being a nurse worth it""  [https://www.indeed.com/community/healthcare/the-con-of-being-an-RN/td-p/694844](https://www.indeed.com/community/healthcare/the-con-of-being-an-rn/td-p/694844)

Do I really want to have a terrible job through college while working hard in nursing school and make the next four years of my life really hard, just to have another terrible job and career that'll eventually burn me out?

I just want some advice or opinions from others, including those who are already nurses. What do you think? I'm open to any type of feedback. ",12Aug2020,1
823,"First off, if you can't help I completely understand. If you think there's a better sub for this, go ahead and suggest it.  

Some Backstory:

This happened before my dyslexia diagnosis. 

In year six (Age 10-11) I had this teacher, Mrs B, who hated my guts. I was and still am very shy, so I wasn't confident sticking up for myself. I'm not very good at anything besides academics, this is important. where I am in the UK, we still have grammar schools, in year six we do the 11+ exam to determine whether we get into a grammar school. In preparation for this exam(and SATs) we did A LOT of arithmetic exercises. I suck at these as I am dyslexic and struggle with things like this. This teacher would give the two boys 'clever' boys in my class rewards for getting full marks on them. I felt very threatened by this, especially since I was trying really hard and was not used to not being worse than the two boys. I admit this may have been a mistake. so I began changing my answers as we marked them. These exercises had no function other than practice. So I didn't see the problem with changing my answers so I wouldn't seem stupid when we called them out. Somehow she found out and stood me in front of my desk and basically told the whole class what I had done, reducing me to tears. This did not help with the bullying. 

As another part of our last year, we wrote short stories, I love telling stories but writing accurately without spelling mistakes is a challenge. I wrote my story and took it up to Mrs B so she could check it, she sent me back to my desk with a few spelling corrections I corrected them and went back. She sent me back to my desk with more spelling errors including ones I had corrected. She did not tell me what I  had done wrong. I did this maybe two more times before she let me write it up in neat, we had special books for our finished writing products. I wrote it up in my book and took it up for her so I could do another activity. She tore the page out and got me to re-do it. I did this three times before she just told me to go to lunch and forget about it.

I had school dinners for all of my time at that school, this school ar began with a catering company change that mad eth food horrible. it got to one point where I refused to eat most of my food. This resulted in more tears, my friend trying to comfort me and being sent away and a phone call home. I thought that was the end, boy was I wrong. the next day was fish and chips day. I ate everything but the fish. (I have a deep hatred for it) she treated to call my mum again. More tears and I spent the rest of the year eating upstairs with a friend so she could make sure I ate properly. Little did she know my friend ate a lot of the stuff I didn't want to. 

I got bullied a lot, I was geeky, not sporty and overall different. One day we were running for P.E. and, not for the first time, a group of boys Including the two 'clever boys', called me names including fat, slow, and other things I didn't care to listen to. When we got back I cried, my friends, managed to me persuade me to tell Mrs B. I gave her names and told her exactly what they had done. All she did was stand up in front of the class at the end of the day and say 'I think some people need to be a little bit nicer to each other in this class.'

So, does anyone know how I can deal with this? it's really hard since all my friends liked her. at the moment I just want to not feel so angry anymore.

My question is, with there being so many options, how does one assess if a therapist or office will work for them? I would like to get myself into some program and begin to feel better, and I have been told that it can be difficult to find therapists who you ""gel"" with.

827,"I’m getting my first apartment for school with my two friends and about two weeks ago we did a pick out of hat for who gets what room. All three rooms are different sizes, my friend who got the smallest one (we’ll call her F) said she was fine with it and would get over it. 

My other friend (P) and I discussed it and decided that F could pay $100 less a month. Which I thought was very fitting because we were going to dorm but it was too expensive for F so we all agreed to get an apartment.

F brought it up a couple times that she was a bit annoyed that she got the smallest room and we talk about and said we understood why. F did a lot of work to get us into it. She talked to the landlord and set up the days that I would go see it. So she felt since she did that work she deserved a better room. However, I went and saw the apartment (and several others), and P worked out several things on the lease to make it better for us. I always said that we could redo the random room selection, mostly because I didn’t think we’d actually have to do it. 

Now F is saying that since she doesn’t want to resent anyone we should redo the room selection. And I said okay, but in honesty I do not want to do it. I like the room I got, and I talked to P and she said the same (obviously).

I understand why F is sad she got the smallest room, I do. But whoever got it would feel that way, and she’s essentially saying that she is the only one who really doesn’t deserve it. That me or P should get it. And that’s pretty annoying. I don’t want to create animosity between us and I don’t want to attack F and gang up on her with P. But we did the selection in a fair way. I know I would feel the same as F does if I had gotten that room, but I don’t know if I would feel entitled to say someone but me deserves it more.

I have no idea what to do with her. She doesn't have anything to hold against me. I've never had a BF, I've never hooked up with someone, I didn't even have my first kiss yet.

833,"On Monday I came to work and noticed a bike with a backpack and bags on it propped up against the fence in my parking lot. I thought it was weird but figured it would be gone soon. 

That night it was still there and same thing the next morning. So my husband came to check it out. The backpack is brand new and still has the tag on it. We didn’t really go through it extensively but we saw a brand new burner phone in the package inside. There’s also Walmart bags hanging on the handle bars containing new clothes, a men’s electric shaver still sealed in the package, an umbrella, a face mask, bandages, etc. 

The part that broke my heart is a cardboard sign that says I’m homeless please help. 

I don’t know what to do with all this stuff. We left it alone for the last few days and no one has returned. I thought about moving it inside our store to keep it safe and leaving a note saying we have it but I’m scared that he will return and try to break into the store if we’re not here to get his stuff. I’m also worried that someone else will take the bike and all his stuff if we don’t and really screw this guy over. It’s a pretty nice bike and literally brand new things so I’m sure someone eventually will. 

I don’t know if he’s in jail, hurt, or what happened to him obviously. I’ve never seen any homeless person riding the bike around here before even though there are quite a few homeless people who frequent our area. The bike even has a bike lock on it that he didn’t use so I’m worried something bad happened. I want to help if I can but I don’t know how.

Backstory synopsis: —
-My mom has been known to get super aggravated out of nowhere and make it very known, which has been something i’ve dealt with my entire life. If company is over (no matter who) and this happens, she will make anger-charged comments that only my immediate family (myself, dad, brother) would be able to hear This doesnt happen all the time, but it is unpredictable. 
-My dad is a judgmental person and has made distasteful comments or jokes in our home about others. He has never said these things to a persons face nor would he ever have the balls to, but I feel uncomfortable knowing he could be judging my friends based on a multitude of factors. 
- in general I have never felt that my parents are welcoming to others that are outside our family in a way I see other families are. 
-New living situation (as of 6 years ago) has brought two more people into our household that live below us. They fight loudly on a daily basis, sometimes I’m sure the neighbors can hear. 
——-

This weekend I’m hosting a get-together outdoors for my birthday that is next week. I have never organized a gathering for my birthday because of the anxiety I have around my family, so I’ve always only ever spent it with one or two people somewhere else. 
For this event, my anxiety is coming from the things that I summarized in my backstory: Mom being aggravated, Dad being judgmental (as one of my friends coming over is gay and is bringing her girlfriend over), but the biggie is the arguments. My therapist helped me work through a plan to try and ease my anxiety: mention there are friends coming over as a curtesy and potentially mentioning the issue to my friends as a warning (which I’m scared to do). My idea was to also borrow a large and loud speaker that one of my family members own to help mask the potential sounds. Also, because of COVID, no one will be allowed inside except to use the bathroom. 
Today however, I’m feeling like I want to back out of my plan completely. Pros would be avoiding the situation I’m afraid of, Cons would be not seeing friends I haven’t seen since quarantine began, and not completing my goal of doing something for me on my birthday for once. 
I feel really sad that this is something that has caused me so much self-turmoil for my entire life just because of family. 

Any advice on what I can try to do to manage my anxiety so I can enjoy the night rather than “just get through it” would be so helpful. Also, if you happen to have any advice about anxiety management in general, I am all ears.",12Aug2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

To put things bluntly, I feel kind of weird about life now. I'm 25 years old and am in the Air Force. I'm doing really well considering my age, and have gotten to a pretty high rank considering the amount of time I've been in. The thing is, I feel unsatisfied.

&amp;#x200B;

Work: At the moment, the thing I want most in life is to feel fulfilled. Currently, my job doesn't leave me feeling much of anything. I am attempting to switch jobs within the Air Force but that could be up to a year before I get to start something new. I am thinking about getting out and moving to Colorado to go to college or work as an electrician. The thing is, I'm about 1/3 of the way to retirement in the Air Force. So if I could find something I enjoyed doing within the AF, I'd be really excited. That being said, something weird and magnetizing is pulling me towards Colorado.

&amp;#x200B;

Girlfriend: Recently things haven't really been working out with my girlfriend. I tried to break up with her but she asked me to take some time to think about it. So now we're attempting to go to counseling (we've been a few times already), but I don't really foresee a future with her. So I think we will be breaking up shortly, which is difficult because I do really care for her. I just don't see a future there.

I have recently applied to a high school near me as a teachers aid so it would help me further my carrier and I get all the benefits of working in a school district.

I have also heard about a position that pays nearly double but it is not school related, it would be hard on my car and I wouldn't get as much time off. With this job I could move out and pay for school and be financially stable in my early 20's which would be nice. 

But I don't know if I should choose the job that pays more, or could possibly further my career. I've already done an interview for the school and they said I should find out by Friday if I have the position. So obviously if the school doesn't work out then i'll go for the other job.

I'm already combining graphic design and webdesign in my current job, and could have asked the company to fund my evening classes.

We laught together, shared secrets... 

Until I stoped texting her. I couldn't for some reason. Days, then weeks pasted. I felt bad but also mad. I got stuck in this thought that my life is falling apart. I didn't have strength to listen to other peoples problems. Didn't want to. So fucking annoyed, tired. I can't deal with my own issues, how can help someone else? Leave me alone!

I'm depressed and suffer from a personality disorder. My past coused more nasty things. Maybe from outside view I am not doing anything. Sitting at home. No work, school isn't every day... Still, stress is constantly there. It makes my chest hurt sometimes. I have sleeping problems. My motivation likes to die a lot. I tend to beat myself over everything, over my fellings. Like I should be always happy. Two years of therapy and taking medicine. Many things became better but I have a long journey ahead of me. Also being in the wrong body adds so much more pain.

""Sorry for being a piece of shit""?

""I didn't want to hear how hard your life is""?

I have been with my GF for about 5 years and we are completely growing apart. We used to do everything together like watch movies, TV shows, and hanging with friends but now she refuses to watch anything that I am interested in but if I want to watch something with her then I have to watch something shes wants or she's not interested.

We are an interracial couple(Me=white) and (shes = Mexican) and she spends all day on social media saying ""fuck white people and white people are the devil, colonizers, etc"" I completely understand that reverse racism doesn't exist but when I communicate that it kinda hurts my feelings because I am white. I am met with the typical "" You never been systemical oppressed, so it shouldn't hurt your feelings"" and completely disregards my concerns. I kinda just feel like a fetish and my feelings are invalid because I am white. (Maybe I'm being weird/sensitive??).  


All my family is scattered around the country and only my brother and I live close together, so seeing my side family is an effort base with planning. She doesn't make any effort in seeing them or wanting to see them if I make plans. She also takes upon herself to talk massive amounts of shit because my family is little on the conservative side and any politics/beliefs they may stand for. She will also start massive arguments or demand that we leave because someone said something that opposed her beliefs. I am also expected to drop everything/anything when it comes to her family and if I don't then basically I have to deal with massive amounts of attitude for days. I always have to do something to make it for it.  


I can't take her to any of my company events because I feel like she is a liability to my career because my employer is also conservative with strong Christian beliefs. A couple of Christmas's ago my CEO invited me over after our Christmas party for drinks and food.  
My boss made a comment like ""Thank god, Trump was elected because he is going to cut some taxes where I can bring on more employees and give better benefits."" That comment triggered a full-on argument that lasted almost 30 minutes before his wife was like ""let's go to bed"". Once we got into the car she was like "" Why didn't you stand up for me?"" and I responded with ""That man cuts my paychecks and I wasn't going to get on his shit list because of YOUR political agenda"". My boss and I talked the following Monday which he apologized for the comment and that he didn't know it was a trigger for her.  


In the last 6 months, I find that she no longer talks about me in a positive light to her friends, family, or even my friends. The only way I found out about this was about three weeks ago, I had some friends over for some drinks as we just moved into a new place together. Long story short, I got a little drunk and passed out early. She spent the remaining of the night talking shit on me to my childhood best friends in which they called me the next day to explain everything that went on/said. I was really blown away like wth?  


One time after work I called her to explain how unhappy I was in which she ended the call early then called her friend to air out the situation but left me in the dark. I tried bringing it back up in person but she just said that I was ""Gaslighting"" her and then started naming off all the things I do wrong.   


We just signed a lease together but honestly, this has been going on for about two years now and I cannot take it anymore. I just want to feel comfortable in my house, in my own skin, and knowing that my name is being drugged threw the mud when my back is turned.

853,"I’ve been struggling with depression since the 6th grade. I am now twenty years old. Two years ago, I met my biological dad and my new siblings. My [17M] brother is always “too busy” to do anything with me and my younger sister [14F] is great but often times is very negative and reserved due to insecurity. Since she is much younger I often try to guide her thinking more positively. When we’re all together however, it feels like I have a piece I’ve been missing. Life long friends and family. For the past two years I’ve hung out with my brother 3 times. Playing soccer and hanging out with girls is more important to him. Our family is constantly making excuses for his behavior, “he’s 17, he’s not doing it maliciously.” “He’s 17 he’d rather be with his friends.” I’ve tried everything, appealing to his interest, offering to take him shopping, everything but he can’t be bothered. I text him with no reply, call with no answer. When I confronted him, he promised one day a month. Which we don’t even do. I don’t get the idea that he doesn’t like me. He does use me to drive my car and buy him things but that’s about it, and I put that to an end because I feel exploited. Anyone been through this?

854,"I’ll try to keep this short, but apologies in advance if I provide too much background info.

I’ve been working at my current job for a little over a year now (first job out of college), and I’ve been quite unhappy for a while. When I signed my employment contract it was for one role (software engineer), but when I actually started working they told me I was going to be working as a quality engineer. I was initially ok with this because I would be learning new skills and the pay and benefits were great.

I did come to realize pretty quickly that this is not the career track I wanted to continue down, and I brought this up to my manager for the first time last fall. She listened and said she would try and help me transition to a different role (something my company claims to fully support). 

A lot has happened since we initially had that conversation, to name a few things:

* I actually had a conversation with my manager's boss pre-covid to switch roles he spoke with my manager about this
* My manager told me splitting my time between two teams to learn even more skills (still as a QE) would be the best option for my career and would allow me to better transition to a software engineering role
* I was then actively added to that second team and now “split my time” between two teams (I don’t really do anything beneficial for the second team)
* I was told there was a new opportunity for software engineering and that I would be considered for that position
* I was told I would no longer be considered for that position because it was going to be contract instead of full time and I didn’t want to lose my job security
* I was told I could split my time between my primary team and a new, different team
* I was told in front of a larger audience that I now owned a project I never heard of before, which I called out and complained about
* I am now being excluded from my primary team’s discussions because they’re under the impression I’m too busy with this other team/project

I have talked to my manager on numerous occasions about how stressed this makes me, and she typically bulldozes the conversations and talks the whole time, affectively turning the dialogue into a monologue. I also have suspicions that she is telling other team members that I’m too busy for certain work, which is why I’m being excluded. I have some proof of her inconsistent promises, but I have a feeling there’s a lot more going on behind my back and that she's doing this for her personal gain.

I feel like I should maybe bring up these concerns with her boss (who I have a good relationship with). I’m also trying to come up with things I’d want to take away from this potential conversation. Do I just want clarity with what’s going on? Do I want my manager to be reprimanded or spoken to? Do I ask for a new job?

Ultimately, is it worth “going over my manger’s head” to talk to her boss about how she’s been treating me, or should I try to talk to her about these concerns, even though I’ve tried to numerous times in the past? 

Any advice regarding this situation is greatly appreciated!",12Aug2020,1

I've been dating a girl for close to a year now and she recently told me that when she first met my friend she thought he was gay which was very confusing considering I had told her for sure that he wasn't. Even more befuddling was when I asked her why and she couldn't even come up with a solid reason except that maybe ""he talks too fast"". 

For a while I thought that maybe it was just things that only she was picking up on but later I found out that some of her friends thought that too, one who had only limited interactions with him through class and another who he had directly pursued. Both didn't even realize he was straight until my gf told them so.

My question is how do I break this to my friend. I've only known him for about a year and a half but it's kind of obvious he has some self esteem issues and I don't want to exacerbate those but it might be in his best interest to find a way to change how he makes first impressions to keep women from immediately ruling him out as gay.",12Aug2020,1

860,"     I've tried posting a similar thing onto a different subreddit, however that post was deleted by the mods, so I decided to come here instead since I genuinely have no idea what to do in this situation and I need advice. (Please forgive the formatting, I'm new to this and on mobile.)

     My friend is a minor and recently she ran away to a youth shelter for safety. I have no issue with this and I actively supported her in seeking help. However, her situation is complicated and housing at the shelter is only temporary. The shelter has been looking for people to live with, and it just so happens that she'll have to live with her other abusive parent. The shelter has no way of knowing this as my friend won't speak up. She is afraid of her abuser and she has told us that if she speaks up, she will get killed. The people at the shelter are trained to handle these situations and had they known how dire it was, they'd allow my friend to stay much longer as they look for other housing alternatives. This is in their policy.

     Unfortunately, my friend has turned to running away from the shelter illegally this time. She very briefly mentioned her plan to me and her friends, but refuses to tell us who and where she will be staying. We suspect it may be someone off of a dating site due to very specific texts she has sent us. Me and my friends are very concerned as this area is known for gang violence... As well as human trafficking. While I wouldn't say this area in particular is the worst, human trafficking is very common amongst young homeless teens all throughout the world. This is why I will NOT let her run away under any circumstances.

     I have my own way of knowing this individual is not a safe person to run away with, however to avoid being identified, I won't reveal too much.

     My initial plan was to call the shelter the moment she ran away so they can catch her in the act. I want this so that they can pry her for information without her denying that she tried running away. Though, it was brought to my attention by the previous post that I can't time this properly and there's no way of knowing if they'll even catch her in the act. That's why I came here.

I'm a biology student and I believe in science, so please don't reply if you're an anti-masker or think covid is a hoax.

Every summer we rent a house at the Jersey Shore for a week with my dad's brother and his family as well as 4-5 family friends. I was obviously apprehensive about going this year, but the beach we go to isn't crowded or a ""party beach"" and we're only either at the beach or the house, plus the family friends aren't coming this year, so I figured as long as we isolate completely for two weeks afterwards it's not terrible. I wasn't feeling great about it, though, even before today - more about that in a bit.

Last week, because of the tropical storm, nearly everyone in my town lost power, internet, and cell service. My dad's brother was affected, but we were luckily not, so starting last Wednesday my cousins (16, 19, 24 + one partner, 23) and occasionally uncle sat in the backyard to use our wifi for their work &amp; online classes. For the last couple days, we let them come inside because of a heat wave. I figured this was okay because we'd have to be in the same ""quarantine pod"" at the beach. Their last day here was Monday; they got power back early Tuesday morning.

Here's the big issue: today we got word that one of my 16-year-old cousin's friends, who had for some reason been in contact with my cousin &amp; uncle as well as in my uncle's car during they time they were using our wifi, tested positive for covid. I'm still trying to find out if they were wearing masks while hanging out with this friend, but if I had to make an educated guess I'd say they weren't.

I'm very angry, as is my mom and the oldest cousin and her partner. My dad is saying there's nothing we can do about it now and is still planning on going to the beach. This week at the beach is something I look forward to for the whole year and it would break my heart to miss it, but I feel like the responsible and considerate thing to do is to skip it and get tested and quarantine until we get our results back.

What kind of person is my mother?

Like she always seems to want to feel sad with other people like she’s addicted to it. She seems to take so much joy in it when people share their pain for instance her friend tells her how her son’s wife has cuckolded her son.

She does this with me too. Like when I share that my flatmate and I don’t talk so much and are rather distanced towards each other she’s all ""oh nooo. That is so sad. You must be sad about it"" in an voice with so much compassion it’s almost over the top.

I told her I don’t mind it so much actually at which she got angry.

But when I really need compassion for once, like recently when I was so sick I had to throw up five times and asked my mother to spend me some company and give me a hug, she was incredibly cold and said ""so can I go now?""

I’ve once opened up to my parents about that I think I might had been really depressed for some time in the past, but am doing my best and she said how I was always making such a drama and a fuss.

How do these two things go together?

Sometimes she comes down to the apartment my boyfriend and I are living in to stay for a few days, crashing on our living room couch. It’s been good every single time, and I never felt weird about her once. Recently though, she’s been acting weird and inappropriate towards me and my partner, making odd sexual comments and remarks, flirting subtly, and overall being kind of shady. It started almost innocently enough with her and my boyfriend joking around, her asking him for a cigarette and him retorting “only if you ask nicely”. It then escalated from there, her response being a surprisingly untoward “please papí”, and I almost wrecked the car out of shocked anger. Later she did confront me about it and asked if I wanted to talk about what had happened, and I explained to her that it was uncomfortable and rude of both of them to do that, especially in front of me. I know she was kidding around, but it just disturbed me. And now, even more recently than that she made physical moves on me, starting with simply holding hands and cuddling while watching movies, to kissing my face and asking if she could make out with me “just one time”. I laughed it off because she was drunk, but I wanted the girl I’d met before back. I don’t want this girl coming into our apartment talking about how big and “nice” her ass is to my partner and me, and making strange advancements and comments that stress me out.

So the question is do I start to like the guy or brush it off as some desperate and fleeting attempt to stop feeling lonely? The feeling lonely doesn't even bother me honestly.

It has been 10 years now since my parents are separated, I never liked my father, I don't have any contact with him nor I want any contact with him, he used to abuse my mom and now they are separated for good. 

So the nightmare is basically me, my mom and my brother going to our old house to live with my dad again, it is really horrible, in the nightmare I just want to go out, I call my aunts, I call my grandparents that please take me away from here. 

Once in the nightmare I told my mom that this is not even real because I have had this nightmare so many times now that I know this is a nightmare.

I work at a hair salon as a receptionist and have been trying to enforce the rules as much as I can but all of the stylists at my job seem to not care at all. 
First of all, they will all hang out in the back room between clients and always take their masks off no matter how many of them are back there. They’ll sit and chat with clients and take their masks off when talking to them. We have signs posted saying you need a mask on, clients will come in without one and I tell them they need it and their stylist will speak over me and say something like “oh I don’t mind if you don’t wear one” or that they can just wear it around their chin or take it off if they get sick of it. We also have signs saying people need to wait in their cars if their stylist isn’t ready for them, which I enforce. I will check people in and ask them to go wait in their cars and if their stylist hears me they’ll literally drop what they’re doing and come over and tell their client they can wait inside the salon. I had a stylist yell at me today for sending their client back outside because it’s raining out. 
It’s getting really sickening being contradicted every day and made to seem like the bad guy when I’m literally just trying to make sure we follow the LAWS and don’t get shut down. I just don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.  I’ve tried talking to the owner about it thinking she would care but even when she’s at the salon and stuff happens she doesn’t even enforce her own rules. It seems like I’m the only one who cares about it, but also probably because if we were to get shut down the stylists wouldn’t be inconvenienced at all since they can all work out of their homes.

I can’t seem to adjust to nights while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Currently my schedule is less than ideal: working 4, 11 hour shifts (which includes every weekend) with 3 nights off. I have uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypogonadism, and am overweight. I am planning on seeing a cardiologist as I’ve been on multiple medications for my blood pressure but none seem to help. Anywho, I’m nearing 30 and I need to get my health on point which in my opinion includes getting off working nights. That being said, in this field, day positions are near impossible to find. The rest of my experience is mainly hospital registration, which pays significantly less than my current pay. I have an associates degree in psychology so not much I can do with that. I have about a year left to finish my bachelors, but I’ve been so terrible with school that the last university I went to I was academically disqualified, again, I have struggled since working nights mentally as well. So the past year I have just ignored the idea of returning to college all together, which has me feeling at a loss. I am not a creative person, I’m not athletic, I have literally zero interest or skills. Not being dramatic either, but I can honestly say i have no talent in much of anything, which has made my academic career a disaster as I’ve found it hard to commit to one pathway. 

I’ve considered trades but I’m not the the trade-type (if that’s makes sense), and with my increasing health concerns, I’m not sure most trades would be suitable at this time. I’ve always enjoyed the thought of a small business but again I struggle to figure out what kind, and even if I knew, I have a ton of things in collections from my early college days that at one point I just let go because the interest kept hitting and my minimum payments were almost as much as my car payment just for one credit card. 

I’ve done a lot of dumb things and between the stuff I have in collections and student loans, I’ve got a lot to pay off, or at least towards. I haven’t touched the collection accounts as i was just going to wait the 7 years but they have made a lot of things difficult financially. Recently I’ve been considering just trying to settle a deal with the collection companies, but not sure if it’s worth it, but most still have 4 years to go. 

I’m simply at a loss. My current position feels meaningless. I know I help people but healthcare just isn’t for me, but then again I think of working the 9-5 and it makes me anxious, probably the millennial in me. I’d like to just finish my bachelors to open more doors but then what and how, my transcript is being held because I owe the school, so can’t transfer elsewhere but can’t afford to pay them. I see those around me doing so well, doing things they enjoy doing, and I can’t seem to find my niche. I want to do something that gives me the feeling of having a purpose, that’s financially stable, and that I can actually wake up and not dread it as I pop my medication. Trust me, I don’t think life is a fantasy and that’s not what I’m looking for, just looking for a direction because right now my compass is broken, and has been for a long time.

883,"I feel like I have no choice in working at my job. 
I work the usual 7:30 to 4:30, very predictable hours, usually a lot of mandated overtime. Pays relatively well for where I live, also benefits.
I dont mind the overtime, the job is stupid easy, but feeling this way makes me exhausted all the time and hate everything I do.

 I space out and daydream constantly as a way of making the time pass and this bleeds into my free time and I just do the most mind numbing activities like browsing reddit or watching YouTube videos.

I'm not sure of what to do about this. I've made a list of workplaces in the nearby area that pay the same-ish. That hasn't seemed to change this feeling though.

886,"Guys. As if it didn't suck enough that our wedding got canceled I have to deal with this epically unethical company. 

I rented a pair of chairs for my 4/17 wedding which was postponed until September due to Covid. Over the seven month course of the pandemic  I was forced to relocate to the Mid West but still looking to travel back to Los Angeles in September for the wedding. 

Due to continued gathering restrictions, we were unable to host our wedding again. The event was canceled and I reached out to Imani to coordinate a refund or work out a way to still receive the products I paid for.

The company requires a signed contract and full payment at the time you place the order (red flag number one) and touts a strict no refund policy but offers ""one year of store credit"". She also makes it very clear that this company only accepts rentals in Southern California and within 150 miles of their location- which legally renders the contract void under the doctrine of impossibility of performance.

I sent an email asking to have the chairs shipped to my current location at a later date or have the $300 I paid refunded. My request to change the service was flatly ignored and I was told that her company was out of business for 3 months with no incoming sales and they still hadn't fully recovered from being out of business for 3 months. She said she have overhead and expenses that were still owed during the months they had no income and they were a small business trying to survive this pandemic and have no funds to refund over 100 canceled events. 

And prayed for my understanding

I am so shocked that a business owner thinks that they are entitled to pocket the money of their customers to help themselves through a difficult time when there are plenty of government-sponsored small business loans and pandemic assistance available.

I did not realize that by into business with this woman I would become personally fiscally responsible for her existence.

887,"
my best friend and I have been friends since age 14ish, I'm 21 now and she's 20. we were always INCREDIBLY close, she moved in with me and lived with me for some years. she has always been the best friend I have ever had, we did everything together and told each other everything, etc etc, everyone thought we were dating, we were so close.  
  she ended up having to move away and I was sure the friendship would survive because for the first couple years of our friendship we were online only, and based on how close I thought we were. 
  basically, for the past months she has been ignoring me. she goes out and hangs out with her friends she swears she doesn't even like, but ignores me for days on end to drink with them. lately for around a week at a time. I can see her online status on discord come and go so I know she's talking to other people and ignoring me. 
   a little while ago I opened up and asked her if she even still likes me and how much it hurts that she's ignoring me, she admitted she was neglecting the friendship and she would stop ignoring me so much. well, that was a crock of shit. she stopped ignoring me for a week or two and is now doing it again. 
   I'm so heartbroken and exhausted. I care SO deeply about this friendship, I love my best friend so much, but I'm so angry that she clearly doesn't give a shit and wouldn't even admit that she doesn't give a shit when I asked her. I told her id understand if she'd moved on but she insisted I'm still her best friend. I feel so discarded and lied to. I want to just block her on everything and move on because it's stressing me out so badly and I've already told her how I felt and she acknowledged and then disregarded it. I really don't think she's ever going to like me in the same way she used to, and it's absolutely devastating. I don't know if I can handle looking at her online status as she ignores me for 4 days straight, after talking to me once after ignoring me for 5 days before that. she ignored me for 5 days and her reason was ""she had people over"". 
 
I'm sorry this is so long, I feel so lost and sad and I'd really like some advice.",12Aug2020,1
888,"I joined an organization in my university during my freshman year. They claim to be progressive and anti-hazing. When I attended the orientation, I found that their principles greatly aligned with mine since they were against tyranny and advocated for equal rights. They also have a few reputable alumni in the academe and in the field of arts. 

Once I joined, I started to notice that they didn’t live up to these high standards they had projected. The organization has been struggling financially for a few years now but continue to organize a big concert during the university fair, which only ends in more debt. The process for applying is also quite problematic because the final rites simulate hazing. There is no physical harm done to the applicant but there is some form of psychological harm being done. Their reasoning behind this is to ingrain in the applicant that hazing is wrong. Another issue I noted is that they want to implement a rule that requires the applicant to pay a certain amount of money for every misconduct. The forms of misconduct include being absent or tardy to a meeting, improper attire, getting a failing grade in a subject, and delayed payments to the financial committee. I can’t help but feel that these rules simply aim to milk members of their money and come off as anti-student. Also, my university doesn’t have a dress code (except for laboratory classes) so it seems quite inconvenient to impose a dress code, plus the meetings are usually hosted in an informal setting. Another problem that I observed is how much the organization values seniority. Whenever the alumni visit, we are expected to treat them like royalty and aren’t really allowed to say no to their requests, even if it seems quite unfair. They also experienced physical hazing during their process so they ridicule applicants/members who couldn’t handle the modified process. 

The organization believes that whenever there is a problem with how things are being run, the member should do something to fix it instead of disaffiliating. This is the main argument they use when someone expresses signs of leaving. This instance was observed when my closest friend in the organization tried to send a letter of disaffiliation but the president got angry and said hurtful remarks towards her. I understand that disaffiliating can be likened to “cancel culture” since most people would rather cancel someone instead of educating them. I want to believe that this can be disregarded since I have already expressed my concern many times, only to be dismissed.

Majority of the members don’t seem to have any problem with how the organization is run. Is my organization really problematic or am I just being overly sensitive? Should I push through with my plan to disaffiliate or should I try bringing up my concerns again? I’m scared that maybe I’m being gaslighted by the organization.

TLDR; my organization imposes rules that I find concerning. I’m unsure if I should leave the organization or try to address the problem again despite my concerns being previously ignored.",12Aug2020,1

892,"I know the title sounds like I’m about to be a smartass but hear me out.

Since I was 7 I’ve known my parents don’t love each other because that was the first time I remember seeing my father get really violent with my mom and throw a table at her(luckily he missed).
Being 7 i didn’t get why and since my dad was always “cool” and took me to trips I thought it was just a stupid argument.

Now I’m 14 and I’ve realized a lot of things.
Firstly,my dad is cheating on my mom with around 10 other women which I found out by going through his phone.

I told this to my mom expecting her to finally divorce him but she just said “I know” and told me about how she CAUGHT HIM SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!

Why does this all matter to me?Well,I am personally scared that one day my father might hurt me and there’s a second much more important thing to discuss which is the main point of this post.

My parents are both highly educated and both of them have PhD’s.To a normal person that would mean a lot of money right?Well...
We live in a 70 year old building in a one bedroom apartment.
My room is around 4 square meters.Four.Not fourteen.Four.
It would be fine if my parents couldn’t afford a bigger place to live and a place where the basement isn’t constantly flooded with sewage but yet again MY MOM EARNS ENOUGH FOR MUCH MORE THAN AN APARTMENT FILLED WITH RATS.
Why do they do this?Do they save money?No.

The reason for them living like this is because my dad can’t let go of this building and my mom refuses to divorce him.
I have discussed it with her and I’ve begged her to divorce him and all I got was her telling me that “We don’t have anywhere to go”.

We live in a city.
There are brand new apartments for rent for 300$ a month.
She earns 5000$ a month.
I have tried talking to both of them about moving out but they don’t even listen to me.
My mom constantly complains about the apartment yet refuses to divorce and move out.
My dad has been out of work for 6 months now and refuses to even look for a job.

TL;DR mom who earns more than enough to cover the expense of renting a small apartment instead of living in a rat infested 40 square meter box refuses to do so due to husband who constantly abuses her and cheats on her and refuses to divorce him.

I have a plan of ruining their marriage by confronting both of them at once and telling my mom in front of my dad that she knows he cheats on her and telling my dad that mom doesn’t love him and if that doesn’t work I plan on calling child protective services effectively ruining their lives.

Should I do it?",12Aug2020,1
894,"- for backstory, both my boyfriend and I have seen J (the brother) choke his father, kidnap his former girlfriend, and attempt to choke my boyfriend (his brother.) 

A woman called my boyfriend last night &amp; disclosed she was being abused, raped, cheated on by his brother. She disclosed that he raped her the first night they met and never left her house. He’s distanced her from her family: she said “I had to pick between J  and my dad, so I picked J.” She also told him she has no friends, except for him and another guy. 

They’re supposed to get married in less than two months. This scares me a lot because abuse only gets worse after marriage and it’s harder to escape at that point. My boyfriend said it seemed like a cry for help, especially because they’ve only hung out once and barely talk. My boyfriend wants to help and is very upset by the situation she’s in, but I’ve reminded him that we can help her until she asks for it.

I have been focusing mainly on foundation work, the basics: basic phrases, numbers, colors animals, food, all the important, most used verbs but specifically to have, and to be, etc, etc... I'm working up from there as I want Peter to have a strong grasp on the building blocks so he can truly understand and command the language.

The father said that his cousin, who lives in another country (not US), and who supposedly ""speaks Spanish"", attempted to ask his son questions and his son ""couldn't answer any"". I can't even imagine what kind of questions he asked him! That certainly raised some red flags for me. The child is 7 yrs old and has been working with me for literally 26 hours. 

So, the main questions are: Is the father being unrealistic? What should a child know about a language after just over 3 weeks of learning?  I was UPFRONT from the very beginning of our communication:

 I stated that if you start out as a beginner and spend an average of 1 hour per day working on learning **Spanish**, you **should** able to reach **conversational** fluency within 12-18 months!

I am a part of leadership at a call center focused around healthcare, so it’s high stress already. We have even had gun threats targeted at the facility I work at. 

I was hired into the base position and worked myself up the ladder, even skipped a position to land in leadership where I am now, which I am proud to be in.

Recently leadership above has made us devote four hours of our day to handling calls. This means I have 3 1/2 hours to tend to my daily duties as leadership and help out in our group chat (since we are working from home), as well as any other high profile cases we may be working on during that week. 

This has put a lot of pressure on all of us, but I feel very demotivated currently. I have started having panic attacks about simple phone calls because all of my other tasks that I was hired for are now tasks I don’t have the time for. I have also been turning down these tasks as they come and redirecting to another team that has the time available to help. 

This change does not have an end date. 

I feel overwhelmed, have been calling out or making excuses, and cannot seem to get a grip. I have been dealing with some minor health issues and my stress is just over the top for me. 

I’ve even been thinking about quitting and trying to do art (which is such a saturated dream that I know I would struggle for years, and I can’t do that because I am the only employed person in my little family). 

I’m torn between muscling through it, panic attacks and all, or trying to find some relief. I just want the job I was hired for back. I enjoyed it immensely and had the resources to really help people get the medical attention they needed. Now I feel useless and underutilized to the point I have lost joy in my job. 

I have already brought this up to management twice, to take me off calls for my mental health, but I was declined both times with the usual empathy statement “we understand your frustration, but we cannot fulfill your request”.

I am ripping apart at the seams and losing motivation fast. Anyone who has experienced this before, what did you do? What CAN I do to keep myself sane and keep my job?

903,"This is my very first time posting on Reddit, but I really need some advice.

Back in January my fiancé (29M) and I (26F) decided we were going to start adding other couples and singles into our sex life. We went to a sex club, hooked up with some different people and honestly I had fun. I was alright with it, but I honestly was just doing it because he really wanted to, and I didn’t see why we couldn’t explore our sexuality together. Now to preface, he’s a very horny person and I’m the opposite. He’d like to have sex all day every day and I’m like a 2-3 times a week kind of person. I just don’t think about it very often and it doesn’t hold as much value for me as it does for him. I’m bisexual and girl on girl is a big turn on for him. 

So he started messaging other couples on an app and he found another couple that seemed pretty chill. The wife was just like him, super horny all the time. The husband was like me: doesn’t really think about sex all that often. She was allowed to have sex with other men, and he didn’t mind it if she did. That was not the situation for us. Our rules were clear from the beginning: we only play together and only if both of us are interested. My fiancé started messaging the wife with flirty messages and I didn’t find out until he showed me a few days later. I was NOT okay with it, specifically because that doesn’t count as us doing it together. 
My fiancé didn’t take it too well and said: “well I don’t get flirty messages from you and I like that.”
That hurt so I shut it down immediately and told him how uncomfortable I was with it. He respected it but wasn’t happy about it.

Flash forward a few months, I found out some really terrible news about my father and couldnt even think about our sex life. My fiancé understood and was there with me through it all. I truly appreciated it. 
I honestly decided I wasn’t interested in continuing down this path, so I had a conversation with him about how I didn’t want to keep going because I wasn’t at all excited by it. I told him I didn’t want to hold him back, but this was what I wanted. I said I wouldn’t get mad if he left, but he needed to decide what he wanted. He said he’d stay with me because I’m more important to him than exploring more. 

A little while later I find out he’s talking to single girls trying to get them to come over for a 3 some. I told him that we already talked about it and he said he was confused because he thought we were just stopping random hookups, but if we became friends and felt a connection with someone, we could do it. It was a total miscommunication on both our ends. 

I told him my boundaries were crossed and I wasn’t okay with this to which he replied with: “well if we’re not going to do this then you need to take a sex class or something.” Basically saying I wasn’t enough sexually for him.
That was incredibly hurtful because never once has he said having sex with me wasn’t good. Yes, he puts in the work most of the time, but it’s because it takes a lot for me to actually be in the mood. We also have a really good connection when we’re actually having sex, so this to me was just a slap in the face.

We talked about it later when we got home from work and I agreed that I would try to be more open to the idea, but it’s all for him. I really DON’T want to invite anyone else in the bedroom, but I’m willing to do that to fulfill his fantasies.

I’m not sure if this is even a question that can be answered, but what should I do? I want to be with him because we love each other so much, but I do not want to continue inviting others into our sex life. I don’t know if he’s the problem, or I am, or we both are. 

Any advice or other people going through this would be appreciated.",12Aug2020,1
904,"Hi, I’m a teenager, and my sister and I are friends with this girl (we’ll call her Pheobe). We live near each other, and she is in the same class as my younger sister. Also, we live a few streets away, so we are quite close. We have been friends for about 2 years.
The problem is that Pheobe is a very problematic friend to have. Here are some of the things my sister and I have had to deal with:

Our grandma gave us some Christmas money, and obviously we told her. She asked us what we were going to do with it, and we had been wanting an Xbox for a few months, so we told her we were getting an Xbox next weekend. The thing is, she wanted one too, but her parents wouldn’t buy her one, so she was using her brothers old one. She started ranting at us about how ungrateful and spoilt we were. The next day, her mum texts our mum screaming about how we were bullying Pheobe, even though we had done literally nothing. In the end, we had to apologise, and even she admitted a few months later that she was just jealous and wanted to ruin our holiday (we were in Spain when all this happened.
This happens on a monthly basis now. Not always about the Xbox, but the same sort of story.

Today, we were going to go i got own to have ice cream. We agreed we would meet at our house ready to go, and she comes with a friend that she knows we don’t get on with, and says that they still need to eat lunch. We wait, and proceed to go get ice cream. We end up paying. Me and my mum have chronic conditions, so the family is shielding against Covid-19. Then, they dragged us to this milkshake shop, where we paid (again!) and they ignored us all the way back, only talking to each other. We later realised that the only reason they even went with us is because their parents wouldn’t let them go without me (because I’m a couple of years older). 

The problem is that although we want to cut her out, she is one of our only friends, and the only one we can see at the moment. And, my sister has to have her in her class for 2 more years, so I don’t want to make it awkward for her.

906,"Hi everyone, I’m just wanting to hear your thoughts on my predicament. 

I moved out of my parents place in Sept 2018 and moved ~2.5 hours away to a bigger city for my job. 

In mid March of this year I moved back in with my parents since my company told us we would be WFH. I left my condo the way it was and kept paying rent because I didn’t know how long WFH would last. Little did I know, it looks like I will be WFH for the rest of the year...

Before quarantine I was sort of seeing this guy and we continued to talk during quarantine. We made it official around 2 months ago. 

I just got told by my company that we can expect to WFH for the rest of 2020. I’m kind of torn on what to do:
1) Move back to my condo in the city (where Ive been since before covid) so I can be with my bf
2) Move back to the city but find a cheaper condo (I’ve tried to find cheaper places and tbh it’s kind of hard but if I really put my mind to it I think I could do it)
3) Move out of my condo entirely and stay with my parents for the foreseeable future/end of covid and continue long distance relationship

The 2 things that are making this hard for me are that 1) Rent for my condo is 1,400, which is around 40% of my income and feels like a huge waste when I’m not even staying there, and I feel like a lot of people are using this time to save $$ whereas I haven’t really made many changes to my savings because of rent and 2) I want to spend time with my bf but if I stay with my parents I have no idea how long covid will continue. Where I live isn’t very accessible to the city I worked (only form of transit currently running is the train which can be over $100 for a round trip) so I don’t know how long we can continue this weird virtual long distance relationship lol

For reference, I live in Canada.

907,"I'm a student in class 12th, from India. The competitive exams which would determine the university I get are just a few months ago. Some context: I've been a straight A student throughout my life, and being perceived as really smart has made me terrified of being perceived as average. It literally drives me crazy, even though I know no one cares that much about anyone.

Now, with the lockdown in place, work was done really easily, and I had a lot of time in my hands. Instead of investing it in the right direction, I used it to get really addicted to chat rooms.  I fully know that my grades are being heavily affected because of this, but I choose to ignore this, while dying of guilt inside.

Earlier, I did not use to study a lot, but I did study. Nowadays, almost the whole day is spent in front of my laptop, doing useless stuff, which is no way related to my exams. I often feel motivated that I'll do better the next day, the next morning, but I sit in front of the laptop, and the hours go by. When I'm writing this, I'll be going to bed a little while later with effectively no work done, and the day wasted. 

I know that I will regret what I'm doing, but I can't seem to stop doing it. Even if I somehow get a lot of work done, the next few days are wasted in shadow of the one productive day. My grades are steadily deteriorating, and I need help. I do literally anything to avoid studying my  coursework, even though I find it really interesting. 

In my recent tests, I have sometimes cheated (They are online) to maintain the illusion that I'm doing good to my friends, which is killing me inside now. I can't just do bad in a test either, because I can get kicked out of the top batch for that. 

I've read a lot of productivity tips, but I either choose to ignore them, or they don't work for me.

This seems like a pathetic rant to me as well, but its literally the first time I'm opening myself up to anyone. All responses are welcome. thanks",12Aug2020,1
908,"This is my first post on here so sorry if I make any mistakes.

My niece is nine years old and for a couple of months now, I've noticed that she hasn't been wanting to take any pictures and frankly freaks out when she thinks anyone takes a picture of her.  Now, I understand wanting to look good but she'll go into full blown panic mode if she even thinks that I took any pictures of her and will try to take my phone etc to try and delete anything. Just yesterday she started online school through Zoom and wouldn't turn on her video feed for anything, she only did when she had to introduce herself and even then she sat far away from the camera. Today, she finally reached her breaking point and talked to me about it.

It started with her teacher assigning some homework and in there it asked for a picture of her for her portfolio or whatever. When I tell you she had a full blown breakdown... She asked if she could just not put a picture but I said no because she wouldn't give me a reason except that she just didn't want her picture in there. Now, I know that I maybe should've respected that but this has been going on for months and I needed to know what's been going on. I put a picture of her on her homework and when she saw it she immediately burst into tears and just kept on telling me to take it off with no reason except that she wanted it off. Finally, through many tears she told me that she was ugly. I asked what was ugly about her and she just said everything. I offered that she can choose her own picture and she said no because all of them were ugly and she could never look good in any of them because her face was just ugly. That was when the waterworks started with me.

It was around this age too that my self-confidence issues started and to be honest, they still haven't quite went away. It breaks my heart that she's so young yet experiences these issues already and I don't know how to make it better. I always tell her she's beautiful and I tried to tell her that too when she told me how she felt but nothing seems to get through to her and she wanted to be alone after all this. I don't know what to do and I don't know if I should tell my family about it because they're not the most emotionally adept people. I feel like affirmations aren't enough for issues that are already so deep set. No one was ever there for me so I don't really know how to approach this the right way.

911,"I had my first relationship last year. It was a no label relationship so it was very confusing and it didn't end well for me since the guy I'm seeing is apparently entertaining other girls (which is my fault because I shouldn't have started this no label thing to begin with) while I had my eyes for him only. When we ""broke up"", I told him that I saw him as a boyfriend but he told me that he defines what we have as friendship since we don't have labels. Yes, we confessed to each other that we had mutual feelings for each other so I thought that what we were doing was just testing the waters until I sense that this relationship is going to go well. Apparently, he didn't see things in that way. I stopped talking to him about us after that.
Months after that, I was still hung up on him but I got news that the girl I was jealous of actually dated him shortly after our breakup. But there was one time that we were at a friend's birthday celebration and he got flirty with me. All of our friends saw this and said that he was indeed flirting with me so I am not just assuming this. I took this as a chance to get some closure because I was still so confused and hurt at this point. The whole time I talked to him, he refused to answer my questions. In the end, I got nothing.
Fast forward to now, he's been hitting me up. Not frequently though. Just once a month. To congratulate me on my achievements, to talk about our common interests, etc. Just small talk. But there was one instance that I think he was thinking about apologizing to me but he got scared and didn't do it. But every time he wants to chat with me, I get cold hands and my heart starts to pound fast but not in a good way. In a way that makes me feel like nothing good will come out of this conversation because I know the guy: he's an asshole. I know he's a guy who's jumping from one relationship to another. Who knows, maybe he's in a no label relationship again and I'm the girl who's on the side. I don't want to get involved in his shit anymore and I don't want any girl to hurt like I did. Tbh, it just boils my blood to see him talk to me like he's done nothing to hurt me. I really do just want to cut him off but I've done that so many times before — breaking off contact without stating my reasons. I don't know if that is the solution in this case.

Any advice on how I should approach the situation?

TL;DR: a guy i had ""no label relationship"" with has been hitting me up recently. i always feel uncomfortable whenever he does because i get anxious and get a feeling that nothing good eill come from the interaction since I know he's an asshole who broke my heart and still hasn't owned up to it.",12Aug2020,1

913,"Hi, so here is some background information that might be helpful. I am Male, age 22, my Father is 68, and my mother is 66. I've never had the best relationship with my father. We have always had differing opinions about many things. Religion, politics, you name it and my father and I have polar opposite opinions. The thing I need advice on however is how to handle these opinion differences. I try to talk things out with him calmly but he always resorts to ""playground tactics"" (yelling, name calling, belittling, etc.) to try to throw off my argument. I have also tried to avoid topics that would cause his outbursts but the problem with that is then I just don't talk to him because talking to him is like walking through a minefield. You don't know where the mines are set. Then he gets mad at me for not talking to him. He is very controlling as well, and I guess that is one of the roots of the problems because he has realized he can't control me or my opinions. I have tried to explain to him how he treats me and he turns it back on me like it is my fault. That I am ""disrespecting him"" or ""talking back"" like I am a child. My mother and I don't have these issues, we are able to talk and sort things out like adults but my dad I can't handle at all.

914,"As a person who’s never once faked being sick in grade school, I‘ve been extremely exhausted the past month and a half, and I just really want a day off. 

The last few weeks of my summer has been filled with sports camps and band camps every day from 6:30-12:00, and then most days more practices in the evenings. My father doesn’t want me sleeping in on the weekends, because “life happens early,” even though that’s the only time I could potentially catch up on sleep. I have constant headaches, and I’ve just had such little energy lately. 

Tomorrow is just like every other day, but we have a longer marching band practice. Just thinking about being out there in the heat for that much longer, just relearning everything we do every year, I’m just not looking forward to it at all. 

Would it be wrong of me to fake a migraine tomorrow morning? I get migraines frequently, but they’re usually at night so I don’t get to miss anything. It would be very believable if I just told my mom that I woke up with a migraine and wasn’t feeling well at all. I would just text my coach and the band director, and they would have to understand. 

I really really want to, but the only thing that’s holding me back, is will I feel guilty? I think I will. But at the same time, I want nothing more than to just skip and sleep in. 

Should I feel guilty even if I’ve never done this before and won’t do it often? I would really like some outside input. 

Tl;dr- I’m exhausted and want to fake being sick for a day off, but my conscience is stopping me. Should I do it?

I am not sure if this sub is right for me, but I want to hear what others think. Recently, I met this girl online via Tik Tok and we both live far away and haven't met in person. She added my Snapchat back. I started snaping her and it seemed like it was going nowhere because I was doing all the talking by asking her questions about herself and commenting (I found her story interesting). Anyways, the last few days have been great and she started to ask me for advice on things in her life. By accident, I didn't reply to her for 12 hours (I was very busy) and she didn't reply to me for one day. We just finished a five-day texting conversation and she ended by saying ""thank youuu"" so I wished her good luck.

Ok so this might be a bit long and sry if it’s hard to read I suck a t writing, but I’ll try my best. 

Ok so last year I started highschool it went pretty good I put my self out of my comfort zone and talked to anyone and pretty much anyone which was big for me since I’m normally rly shy and anxious.

I now have 5 close freinds, and talk to quite a lot more but ofc not as much or only at school.

Since I’m going back to school soon I need to sort a problem I was having on the first year if highschool 

Ok so at first I did talk to ppl but didn’t have much friends just the two and weren’t that close. 

Fast forward until the “friend group” is all well freinds we all got along and we all went to the same classes mostly. 

But there is this one girl let’s call her Carla, 
I don’t like her and either does anyone of my friends, I know it’s mean but we can’t be forced to like her.
I (and my friends) just find her annoying and I’ll explain 

She always follows let’s say Lucy, 
Like idk why I feel bad for Lucy, she’s qui the and nice so never rly says anything and just jokes about it but I can tell Lucy doesn’t like her, we eventually realised that she probs likes her which ngl I found funny just because well Lucy is awkward and doesn’t know her sexuality yet so she ofc said no , and cause she doesn’t like her that way 
And say when we are going to class or lunch or whatever she just follows us everywhere and it’s so annoying, and when u try to talk to someone else she walks between u and go’s “WhAT?!” and it’s so annoying lol

I don’t want to hurt carlas feeling though, yes she doe annoy me and I mean a lot but I don’t wanna make her upset.

She doesn’t have any other friends than “us”
But recently well before lockdown with this other girl (she also doesn’t have that much friends I don’t like her either but ofc not rude or anything)

I just need a way of saying like leave us alone we aren’t your freinds, but how am I supposed to say it politely?

I try to be nice but sometimes she annoys me that much I say thing I shouldn’t have (not anything extreme, just say when she buys into Our convo I jokingly say “we aren’t talking to you” which tbh we are in highschool ik Scotland so you would hear way worse

But yeah idk what to do, don’t wanna gurt her feelings but do not want to be freinds at all and no one in our friend group does

918,"hi! sorry if the formatting is weird, i’m on mobile. 
hopefully this isn’t an annoying post - but this has been eating me away lately.
i’m 17f - last year i moved to a new school and i met a couple people and we had a lot of fun last summer as i got close to them, i got really attached because being the new kid i didn’t really have anyone else.
we hung out a ton last summer and i regarded them as some of my best friends.
we didn’t talk much this school year - they were all a year+ older than me so they were busy with college and other stuff and when the virus hit i didn’t have the chance to ask them to hangout or anything.
it’s almost the end of summer now - i’ve asked if they wanted to hangout a couple times and they always say later and they’ll tell me when but they never do. i try being nice and maybe start conversations but they die out pretty fast i guess. i garden so i ask if they want anything from mine and when they say yes i go drop it off at their homes but they never say hi or anything when i do it.
i feel like they hate me now and i don’t know what i did wrong. i want to ask if they want to hangout again but i’m afraid i’ll just be annoying and they’ll hate me more or something.
i’m sorry if this seems really juvenile and stupid, but i just really care about them and i don’t understand what happened. one of them doesn’t even respond anymore when i text. they all leave for college soon and i just wanted to see them before i lose the chance to.
is this behavior really annoying? should i ask if they want to see me again or if they’re mad at me?
i’m kind of really hurt but i don’t want to tell them that in case they don’t realize they’re doing that and they feel bad is it wrong that i’m upset?
sorry if this post is really rambling but i just don’t understand where i went wrong or what i did to make them not like me anymore especially considering we haven’t even seen each other. 
any advice would be appreciated a ton!! thanks in advance !! &lt;3",12Aug2020,1

921,"English is not my first language, so excuse me if I'm not able to formulate my thoughts accurately enough.

Also, I apologize for the length of this post.

\_\_\_

A while back there was this girl that I saw around a place I hung out (sort of a cultural hub). I thought she was cute so I figured I'd talk to her at some point. But I quickly found out she was too young for me.

Then maybe a year and a half later, by circumstance, we talked a few of the times we met. She would always initiate conversation with me, and not really with any of the others that were with me. It seemed like she was interested in me.

However, that made me uncomfortable for two reasons. One being my anxiety, etc. and two being the age difference. So I didn't really reciprocate the interest. I was sort of avoidant. I was considering waiting a year for it to be within the age-divided-by-two-plus-seven rule.

But at some point, especially as some time went by, I realized that the age difference isn't too bad. She is 17 and I'm 21. I asked a few of my women friends and they said it wasn't too much. Even her mother seems like she wants us to date.

But then, all of a sudden, a tragedy hit their family and the whole community. Her father hung himself. She was the one who found him. That was a month ago now. I was devestated, as I knew him dearly, but I can only imagine what pain she must be going through right now.

Pretty quickly afterwards, I felt the need to send her a message on facebook. Something along the lines of ""Hey, I know we don't know each other that well, but if you ever need to talk to someone or if you want to get your mind off things for once, let me know.""

But now a month has gone by. I feel like it is too late. And I also feel like it was never my place to begin with, seeing as we haven't talked a lot. But my heart feels for her. If there is anything I can do, I owe it to their family.

Now, the crush thing has definetly taken a backseat role. I want to help her through this difficult time if I'm able to, first and foremost.

What do I do?

Do I wait till I see her again to tell her? I don't know when that is, because the place where we usually met has closed down for good. Should I do nothing? Do I send the message, even though I've never sent her a message before, or is that weird?

\_\_\_

tl;dr: I thought a girl I was interested in was too young. A year later she showed interest in me. Now I realize the age gap isn't too bad. Then, amonth ago, her father killed himself. She found him.

922,"Hello! So I'm a 19 year old girl who has never been in a relationship or even had sex before. I started talking to this guy that I met on Discord and he lives in my city.

Backstory (short): So I had a good friend but we were slowly drifting apart. As this happened, the person told me that I am their cause for their depression, and therefore the reason behind her being suicidal. This happened some time ago but I believe the person tried to manipulate me.  Fast forward; the person is safe and sound, and I believe the person is alright now but I feel anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem: So as this happened I've had some violent intrusive thoughts about hurting my beloved sister and brother. I heavily dislike these thoughts. The more I think about the thoughts, the more anxious i feel and sometimes I question if I am sane. I know these are just thoughts and have no meaning, as I in no way wish to act upon them. It should be said, that I am not in a position to seek professionel help from a therapist, and I hope some of you might descend a helping hand from up above (if that makes sense)

925,"I dont know how else to put it. My dad is toxic. I knew this whole time, but I never really realized it till now. Hes a toxic person. Hes overbearing, manipulaive, unbelievably stupid, and the biggest pain in my ass since the first time i ever shit. 

I wanna preface this by saying some stuff. My dad is a nice person. He has a lot of friends who all mutually see him as a good person. Hes funny, hes confident, is attractive, hes a great husband, a father of 4 kids and probably over all one of the coolest people you'll ever met. But hes a shit dad. Hes not physically abusive or anything but... hes not good.

My dad very plain and simple, cant parent properly to save his life. He knows all the right words to say, or what to do in certain situations hes presented in, but the application isnt the only part of it. My dad doesnt properly do anything else. 

From what i can remember, ive played ball with my dad twice in all 16 years of my life, and those are the only things ive ever ""played"" physically with him. He never eats dinner with us unless my mom forces us out to a restaurant or on holidays, which are both rare. He takes in all of my interests at face value, and is only interested at bonding over his. He almost never came out to see any of the sports i played, and if he did he never paid attention. He almost never apologizes for anything. The bonding time we have, my dad usually takes me driving places and talks aimlessly about important things in life but never... with me. He says he loves me alot, and cares about me, to me, but almost never talks with me.

I remember once when i was 5 or 6, i was mad at my dad and told him i didnt love him. He got really upset and he threatened to kick me out of the house since i obviously didnt care whether i was with him or not. This was, undoubtedly, my fault and he was understandably upset, and of course i did love him i was just mad, but my dad really took this to heart.

When i was 13 years old my youngest brother (5) and my sister (2) were beginning to make mischief. All of my extended family members advised me to always look out for them and reprimand them so they grew up to be good people. I always made sure they didnt do anything dangerous, or stuff they werent supposed to and sometimes i would take it upon myself to spank them. My dad, however, didnt like this. He pulled me aside and told me that my only job was to protect them, and it wasnt my place to spank or reprimend them, since that was his and my moms jobs. I agreed with this, but the problem with that was, my dad was never there to see them do anything wrong, and if i told on them my dad wouldnt care enough to do anything to stop them. Over the next three years their misbehavior evolved into things me and my other brother (3 years younger) would never have done, since my parents would have spanked us before we got there. It was bad. They were making unbelievable messes everywhere and leaving my mom to clean them up literally every other day, they would throw violent tantrums, throwing things like chairs and vases, often breaking things, screaming at the top of their lungs the most disrespectful things an 8 year old could say, but my parents almost never raised a hand to them, and never corrected it. I saw this as an issue and i went to talk to my dad about it. He accused me of ordering him around, and he hit me. Eventually i left it alone, but my younger brothers attitude just went worse and worse. I ignored it completely till i was about 15. My parents started getting mad at me for letting my siblings do as they pleased and they eventually started forcing me and my other brother to clean after them. I complained a little but found it pointless.

Now, heres where the real issue gets in. Any sibling in the world knows that you will fight. Whether it be real fighting or play fighting or whatever, you will _scrap_ eventually. My dad, obviously didnt like this, since my brothers would often get hurt, in someway or another, but try as you might, accidents happen. Even though he may have hit me first, bruised me or made me bleed, if i layed a hand on my brother my dad would fly off the hinge, even if it was an accident, and it got bad. When i was 15, and my brother was 7, my dad was leaving us home alone so he could go do something. I went into my room and found all of my alcohol markers were missing. My brother had happened to take them without asking, and had wasted several. For those of you who know, they are exspensive, and i got mad, but i didnt want to hit him since i felt he was still a kid and i used to do stuff like that. I flicked him on the forehead, and asked him not to do it again. My brother ran outside right before my dad could pull out the drive way, told him that i hit him across the face, and before i could explain myself, he smashed my phone. He accused me of being a heteful and unloving bully, and he left. Cant say that i didnt cry. 

Things like this happened often, all that would need to happen is for my brother to get touched, he would fake cry, and my dad would fly off the hinge. God forbid he got cut, cause there was a chance he would break something. And everytime, even if it wasnt my fault, he would accuse me, or find some way to blame me, yell at me, call me slurs and hateful things, and said that it was impossible for me to love anyone and that my feelings were fake. He accused me of having anger issues everytime he would purposefully provoke me, and told my youngest siblings to stay away from me and not interact with me because i was dangerous. Several times. And it hurt. Everytime. 

Eventually i told my dad how the things he said hurt my feelings, and how his assumptions were unfair, and his words and actions were leaving lasting damage to our family. He eventually turned the conversation around so that i was the purpetrator and was manipulating everyone else, even my mom, onto my side. After that i ignored everything completely. I stopped trying to defend myself from his accusations. I stopped explaining myself, and no matter how questionable listened to everything he said, and found myself not saying anything whenever he talked to me, afraid that he would turn what i said around back against me, and now, even when he says hurtful things to me, they hurt the same as they did the first time, but im not able to cry anymore. But even then, in almost every conversation we had, it was always brought up about how everytime i disagreed with him over something, it was because i hated him, or if i made a wrong decision, it was because i thought he was the enemy and wouldnt listen, or something or other. 

It became very clear to me that my dad had no concern with things i said to him in response to his words. I remember we talked about the BLM protests, and that while i stood with the movement, i didnt like the destruction of unrelated businesses and the killing of innocent people that were happening, and that didnt mean i was standing against them, but it was a small part that i didnt agree with. My dad, unconcerned with the fact that we both thought the movement was needed to fix a bigger problem, called me a white supremacist for worrying about anything else but the movement. I told him it was insulting that he would call me that for caring about people dying, and that we still both had the same viewpoint, but he didnt care. He got mad at me, and told me i wasnt really black and didnt care about anyone... as always. Eventually i just pretended to agree with everything he said, and just left it alone.

Today was the last straw for me. My mom had woke us up and told us we needed to clean up. Everyone but my youngest brother, now 8, proceeded to do so. He wanted to play on our nintendo switch, and my mom said that no matter what our dad (who was out of the house) said, we couldn't do anything with it until everything was clean. My brother went behind my moms back and used her phone to call him. He said we could play on it, and my mom got mad. She threatened to break it if she caught us playing with it, so that was that. We continued to clean, and my dad came home and my mom and sister left. My Dad then gave the switch to my brother, who asked me to the unlock it (a precaution my mom advised me to take since he couldnt be trusted with it) He had yet to clean his room, or anything else, and i said no, keeping what my mom said in mind. My dad came over, and my brother proceeded to tell him i had locked it and kept him from playing on it, and i repeated to my dad what my mom had said - to this he got mad at me for ordering him around, claimed i was a bully and manipulative, same old same old, and then proceeded to smash the switch, taking all 400$ worth of games _I_ had bought with it, promised my brother his own new switch, and basically said fuck me. 

 I cant tell you how... mad this makes me. My youngest brother currently has nobody he can call a friend at school, and cant keep up with schoolwork because he has no self control, or semblance of discipline, and i cant blame him. Our house is always a mess, my stuff is constantly getting wasted and broken, and my dad is bearing over me like im one big predator who cant be trusted. And all the while he says all these things, makes these unfair and rash decisions, he expects me to treat him like hes my dad and he would never do anything to hurt me, when thats all hes been doing. But thats what i do. I greet him everytime i see him, sit down and watch his boxing matches and movies with him, laugh at his jokes and ask him for advice, even when i break out into a cold sweat everytime i see him. 

While I would be sad to move away from my siblings and my mom when i head out for college, theres nothing more id like then to have him 50 miles away from me, or at least apologize for the things he did.

928,"Hi everyone ima keep this short and thanks in advance for reading. 

I work for LAUSD and school is coming back into session soon. My employer and I have a great relationship, and I get along with admin super well. Like they take me out for drinks, that well. Before school got out they told me they’d call me a week early to come into work to get everything ready for the next school year. That’s supposed to be this week. However sometime during the summer in July I tested positive for Covid-19 as well as half my family. We quarantined, followed protocols and everything. By now I have already tested negative two times and have received two separate letters from the Health Department telling me I’m good to go back to work. 

Last week I let admin know about it, told them I have letters to prove and everything is good and that I’m feeling good. The only reason I let them know so late was because I was debating if I should tell them because of the stigma surrounding Covid-19 and felt that they would outcast me. But I took my chances and wanted to be honest so I told my boss anyway. 

Fast forward to this week, it’s the week I’m supposed to be working already and I come to find out through a coworker that they’ve called everyone back BUT me. I can’t help but feel fucking embarrassed because turns out everyone at my job knows I had it during the summer. Meaning they didn’t keep it confidential!!! And I don’t know who said anything but I had only told two of my closest coworkers, and my Administrator boss.  So now I’m doubting everyone!! Mind you I have been stupid worried because LAUSD is doing cuts and I am terribly worried they’re going to cut me bcuz I’ve had Covid-19. 

I have excellent work ethic and I go above and beyond for my job! I love it there honestly. And I’ve shown dedication to teachers, parents, coworkers and admin.  I’m not mad that they haven’t called me in, I’m mad that they haven’t even bothered to tell me that my job is still promised. I’m so scared they’re gonna fire me because of this! Which I don’t even know is legal or not????!!!! 

My coworker told me everyone is acting shady and pretending they don’t know anything about me, when usually, at the beginning of each year I’m the first one to get called in to work so I know me not being there is strange to everyone. So I don’t know what to think or do. They’re singling me out because I had Covid-19 and above that they’re spreading my business around the work place like wild fire. Everyone else is already getting paid while I’m home still not getting paid. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1
930,"I'm at the beach right now with my family for a few days. Today, I noticed a man walking past my window to the back of the house, then back front again. I was pretty confused as to why some random guy would be walking back there, so I went to the door to look again. To my surprise, he was right out front.  


He stood \~3 feet from the door and held out a McDonalds bag to me. I said, ""Is this for us?"" and took it from him. After looking at him a little longer I noticed he looked very nervous. He was wearing what I thought looked like a mailman's uniform but it may have been something more like an exterminator's uniform (I can explain more later). After I asked him about the bag, he just said ""tell ----- this is for her"" and quickly left. I couldn't tell what the name was as he said it very quietly but thinking back it kind of sounded like ""angel."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the back upstairs and told my family that we just got some random McDonalds and we all assumed that it was just a doordash guy that got the wrong address. I had a gut feeling, though, that something was off. The guy was just acting so strange.  


A few hours later, we decided that we should look in the bag, joking that we would find a hand in it or something. We opened it up and found what looked to be a syringe of [Advion ant gel](https://www.domyown.com/advion-ant-bait-gel-p-932.html). Our minds immediately went to drugs. Why the hell would some nervous looking guy hand us ant gel in a McDonalds bag?   


My family and I are confused as to what we should do here, or even if this is the right sub. We don't know if it is drugs, but should we still report it to the police? Do we just leave it in the trash? Do we leave it out front? I don't know man, I'm spooked.",12Aug2020,1

Like I've barely spoken more than 1000 words to her my entire life but I just wanted to get it going with her. She doesn't even look as good and has quite the negative reputation (you know) but this whole physical aspect of it was driving me insane. I acted on it and it dissipated but now it's like her name pops up randomly in my head out of nowhere, or her birthdate drives me nuts every month. It's gotten worse to the point where every hour whenever it's her birth date on the minutes hand I get all neurotic. It's not even physical anymore but it is as if I'm psychologically punishing myself for no good reason. I've absolutely no feelings for her, but these patterns of being obsessive about her birth date or her name just popping up every now and then is now driving me literally insane. I'm actually suffering at how bad this is. It's just loud noise in my head I can't get rid of. I realize these are patterns I need to get rid of or unlearn but I don't know how.

942,"So, my sister and I have both suffered from depression and have a special bond because of this. We talk about our issues, coping mechanisms, resources and progress. We're overall very supportive of each other.

But a couple of times recently she has been saying things that will either A) bring me back to a time I don't want to remember, or B) make me insanely worried. Typically she would say these things in an argument or when she's feeling agitated.

Some examples are: when she would stomp away from an argument, she would mutter about ""slitting her wrists"". Another time during an argument where I was annoying her, she said ""I'm going to commit suicide"" as she rolled her eyes at me. I interpreted this as a twisted joke, saying ""well don't pin it on me"" and she responded with ""that's not the point. I'm just letting you know.""

This all seems like it's heat-of-the-moment and not serious, but that doesn't stop me from flashing back to the horrible times when I felt this way. And I'm still very concerned because these words out of context are reason to call the police on someone. I know she doesn't want me to interpret them as serious, but should I?

my sister keeps threatening suicide ""jokingly"" during arguments that will make me uncomfortable and worried. Some of what she says is pretty graphic. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1

945,"About seven years ago, my husband and I decided to adopt a kid. We ended up adopting Tom ( not his real name ) when he was 8yo ( he is now 15 ). And although it was hard at first, he is now a fundamental part of our family and we love him. 

His biological parents weren’t the best. They weren’t directly abusive to him ( at least for what we know ), but they were unstable people who decided to radically change their life every few months. And had problems with drug addiction and violent behavior. Because of this, when we adopted Tom, his father was in jail ( and still is ) and his mother was in rehab. 

We never knew anything more of them until last year. Apparently his mother had finally managed to rehabilitate and wanted to meet his son. We weren’t really sure about this, but Tom wanted to try and reconnect with his mother. The first few meeting we went with him to see his mother. She still seemed a bit weird, and couldn’t stop asking how “having two men as parents had affected his baby”, but overall she seemed to be fine. So we decided to send him alone the rest of the meetings.

At first it all seemed to be going well, until we noticed he was stressed and kinda sad after the meetings. So we decided to ask him about it. Apparently his mother tells him about all of her problems whenever they meet and he never gets to talk about his life. However he still wanted to reconnect with her, so the meetings continued.

Until quarantine started of course. Since then they have only talked a few times though the phone. But recently, family reunions have been allowed and his mother called us to arrange a meeting with him. But when we told Tom about it, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to go. Apparently he has made little progress trying to connect with her, and the meeting are still about her issues. So he asked us if he should still go or not.

Honestly, I wouldn’t care if he didn’t want to go. She seems to only bring him problems and doesn’t seem to care about her own son. However, I know that I’m biased in this situation. And that he really wants to reconnect with his family. So we decided to tell him that we didn’t know what he should do, so maybe he could take some time to think about it. 

This happened yesterday and he doesn’t seem to decide. So maybe we should advice him to go or not to go? I think that an external view of this problem might help us.",12Aug2020,1
946,"Hi,
For a couple years now I've been struggling with my selfesteem. Mainly it's related to the way I look... It has become more apparent in recent days when spening time with my friends who are all reasonably attractive and happy with themselves. I hate the way I look when smiling, which keeps me from expressing joy. Especially my lips since I had an accident that left my upper lip slightly deformed.

I realize that not smiling and not accepting my looks is destructive and counterproductive. But I can't help but to fear that noone will ever think of me as a partner because of the way I look. The past few days this feeling has been haunting me. Everytime someone looks at me I can't help but feeling selfconscious. 

How can I overcome this and develop a healthy relasionship with my looks? I just want to feel comfortable with the way I look.

Thanks",12Aug2020,1

Recently my ex boyfriend broke up with me and sent me home 2 days before we were supposed to move into our new apartment with his friends.

Durring the relationship I had gotten pregnant and agreed to get an abortion for the sake of the relatively new relationship (lasted 5 months)

But after he dumped me I had second thoughts as I didn't really want the abortion in the first place and the reason I ultimately agreed was so that we would stay together because I knew a baby would be a stress on him. However I also knew that he was not ready to be a father and we were not going to get back together anyway (I accepted this) so I decided I would like to give the child to a good home..

When his mother found out about me changing my mind she told my ex boyfriend she felt s*icidal over losing a grandchild to adoption despite pressuring me to get an abortion in the first place..

My ex Ultimately consented to the adoption, and I've found a wonderful family willing to take the child in a closed adoption.. but the situation has me racked with guilt over changing my mind..

Now with the guilt im feeling im so unsure of what to do.. im 8 weeks pregnant and fighting my instinct to just run away from it all..

We never talked in any ~personal level, only messing around with class, funny stuff we'd seen or done, etc, etc. but I genuinely liked him and wanted to even be friends with him because we had some common interests. I never asked him for his number or any social medias because I thought he'd figure out I had a crush on him or whatever negative other thought I had, and even on the last day of class I saw him I never had the chance to talk to him and haven't seen him since.
However, one day I was deleting some pictures off my phone and stumbled upon a picture I had taken in class and he was in it, I remembered the small crush I had on him and I looked him up on Instagram and I eventually found him.

960,"I suffered from violent intrusive thoughts all past month. These caused a lot of anxiety and also a strange feeling in my pants. It wasn't arousal but I feared it would become. I was afraid that I was going to harm someone. After much deliberation (to the point where I couldn't sleep, and could barely work), I contacted my psychiatrist. She prescribed me olanzapine; now she's prescribed me seroquel, after I told her my symptoms diminished (they had to an extent). 

Now I can't shake off this feeling. The feeling in my pants is still there to a moderate extent, but now I feel *shame*. I don't know why, but I feel shame, embarrassed, and vulnerable all of a sudden, and my mind is somehow connecting this to my body. It's like I want to curl up and wither away. I can also remember having this feeling when I was a child. Ever since childhood, it's like that feeling down there always manifested when I was embarrassed and self-conscious; it went away for years but it's now back with a vengeance. Now I don't feel embarrassed nor self-conscious (I haven't really interacted with anyone since lockdown began), but it's still there. It's like my mind is screaming out to touch myself there, but it isn't arousal, I'm not horny. 

So it's a situation where a) I have a feeling down there, b) I feel embarrassed/vulnerable/ashamed, and c) It feels like I'm reduced to a ""childlike"" state. In other words, I feel like a child. I want this feeling of touching myself, and the shame and sadness associated with it, to go away. I'm sorry if none of this made sense. This was more of a venting post. I haven't told this to my therapist yet (I have a ton of other issues we're working on, including the intrusive thoughts which are still there but have mostly gone away). I just... what's happening?

963,"So I worked with my ex-boss for two whole months last year. It seems short but we were a very small team (around 5-6 people) and I had joined as an Intern. So we have spent a lot of time together and he thinks we get along very well. I clearly don't. He makes me feel uncomfortable most of the time with little annoying comments that he makes, though harmless. There's a huge gap between us, this I have to mention because most of the comments he makes is quite inappropriate as a Boss. Borderline Narcissistic. Always expects us to keep complimenting him on anything he says. Has no boundaries. Offended my own mother once. I could go on but any way it's clear that I'd like to have no contact with him. Thinking of him gives me anxiety much less talking to him.

I quit my job with him because of the above reasons for the sake of my mental health. But I kinda kept in touch because I think I wanted maintain ""contacts"" in the industry. Though lately I have been thinking if it's worth it. He keeps sending me forward messages and when I respond, I won't get any reply back. This happens every time. He called me once to catch up and told me I can always call him and keep in touch. But one day when I called him back, he wouldn't talk back properly. 

He sent me a forwarded message again yesterday and I haven't replied back because I kept thinking what's the point. But knowing his behaviour, I know he expects me to respond and if I haven't he will certainly note it and bring it up in a conversation if we do have one later on.

I need some advice because I don't know if I am over reacting and I don't know what to do.",12Aug2020,1
964,"Hello, this has been going on for years and honestly I (22f) don’t know what to do about it. My Mom (50f)is overly paranoid that my Dad (58m) is cheating on her with his Ex wife. She has gone so far as checking his phone, calling his work, checking receipts, checking mileage on the car he uses, and circling his ex wife’s work. Waiting to catch them in the act, if my dad says he’s at one place she will check a whole list of other places she know his ex wife frequents. It’s all she talks about and none of his behaviors indicated any form of cheating. 
She’s made up stories about random people on the street telling her he’s cheating. I know they are lies because she was home all day on the day she claims it happened.  She freaks out every time my dad visits the grave of his first born (7days old his daughter with his ex wife). What should I do? I already told my Dad but he’s not concerned but she’s been making comments about how she will party when the “witch” is dead. I’ve tried to get her mental help but she says “therapists are quacks” or “therapist are liars and I don’t have a problem I just need proof”. She’s never been violent but I worry this creepy behavior will get worse.",12Aug2020,1
965,"Hi, I am writing this post because for some time I have been ruminating a bit, I will describe my last months, because I really lack any idea what is going on with me, and hopefully someone not related to the case may help me. So here it goes:  


At the beggining of lockdown my girlfriend announced that she is going to study away from me: it's about 300 km between our cities and that was a shock due to her always telling me we will live together in a flat and so on. It hit me pretty hard, I broke down mentally for 2-3 days, I cried the whole time and had no energy to do anything, because I was sure I will lose her in the future.

As the time went on, she told me that she might go to my city on uni, because she also feared that we would break up. And then I thought ""Well, I dont want her to be unhappy in my city or ruin her life, so I must be sure I love her because if we would break up she would be pretty screwed and I probably wouldn't be able to live with that. 

I started surfing through the Internet with questions ""Do I love her?"" ""Is it love?"" ""Are we compatible?"" to be sure we will be together no matter what. And then when on some sites there were paragraphs like ""If you don't do X, then you are not in love"" and I got anxious, started overanalysing, trying checking my feelings, how I react to her etc. I also completed quiz and if it showed that I love my partner I would feel sudden relief, but for short, then the thoughts came back and got stuck in my head just asking different, more complex questions than before, more mean too, for instance: ""Is she attractive?"" ""Why does she have so strange eyebrows?"" ""Isnt she fat?"" and really thousands of similar doubts.

It lasted for about 2 months to the point when I could spend half of a day searching for the answer to the core question ""do I love her"".  As I was overanalysing our whole relationship I lost that feeling of connection between us, she felt like a stranger to me, we started arguing, I wouldn't care about her etc, but I desperately wanted to stay with her and still do, no matter what.  


Fast forward to now, 4 months into my little madness and I feel like I dont feel anything to her anymore, and tho I strongly believe love is a choice my thoughts keep ruining my relationship, they can come every time of the day actually, I could study/cook/do my stuff and then \*smash\*: ""Why I don't feel anything towards her anymore?"" ""Will I have to break up"" and then I get anxious and sad as I said before.  


It is terrible, as every girl seems more attractive and more fun and I feel this dread that some disaster is looming sometimes, I am desperately afraid I will cheat on her, I get anxious if some girl is attractive in my opinion and that even makes things worse, as it deepens my anxiety.  


I think of it as the commitment issues because it all started when I had to commit to the relationship, like make everything that this relationship would last to the end of our lives. And oh, we are with each other for 2.5 years.  


Any advice? Thanks for your time if you are still there and forgive me my chaotic style of describing things, I am open to answering questions and precising things!",12Aug2020,1

969,"So I like this girl and recently I got her snapchat to talk about games and stuff since we both play games. I like to snap food and stuff to my friends so I sent it to her too. The first two days she responded back and even snapped me back stuff, but after that she just stopped for some reason. She just opens my snaps now and doesn't say anything nor to the messages I send her. I've noticed she saves all the messages though which I thought was kinda weird. 

I was really hoping to get to know her more but it just looks like she's completely uninterested. I'm confused as to if I did anything wrong and I don't want to ask her cause I met her through my friends and we sometimes play together and I don't want things to be awkward.

971,"I'm a 6'3 male. I dress and carry myself well, and without bragging, I'm made up of qualities, physically and mentally, that people are attracted to. I understand this logically, and I guess it's a good problem to have. When I was younger, I was overweight and annoying, dealing with a lot of things stemming from my childhood. I got very little attention from women throughout most of my life, and eventually learned to live with very little of it. I'm now in my late twenties, got in shape and worked hard to improve my personality. I'm an introvert with extravert bursts, so I can come off as outgoing. But I get exhausted quickly when I talk to anyone for too long or have too many interactions in a day. I like to be alone and read.

Within the last year or so, some switch was flipped, and many women, of all ages and background, that I pass or speak to express some form of romantic or sexual interest, sometimes very aggressively. It's become hard to keep female friends. I'm not a shy person, but I'm not currently interested in a relationship and I have very little sex drive. I've never felt the desire to have sex with every woman I see. I like conversation and joking around, but that's mostly all I want from women right now.

Again, this is a great problem to have, but it's not helping my anxiety. I find myself always feeling obligated to give them attention they ask for, or politely rejecting them. It's gotten to the point where I go mostly everywhere with headphones on just to enjoy peace and avoid talking. I've been followed by women through stores and through malls; I've had women in cars follow me home, unprompted and without permission, so they could talk to me; I've had women working in stores go through my rewards information in their system to get my number and text me; I've had women with boyfriends offer sexual favors behind their backs. It's flattering and should do wonders for my self-esteem, but it's exhausting, and every time I leave my house for anything, I have to prepare for this to be the case. I keep my eyes forward and speak only when it's necessary. It's a sigh of relief when a woman treats me like a human being and not an object of desire. Honestly, I miss being unnoticed.

I'm trying to find some balance between being social and being worn out. I don't think there's anything I can do to avoid attention, but what can I do, without compromising my personality, to better handle this? What mindset can I adapt so that this doesn't completely drain me of energy?",12Aug2020,1

My parents was really submitting, to the point where I was praised/taught to not defend myself (verbally). It was usually coming from my second youngest brother, he was (I haven't been around for a while) an equivalent to grenade with it's pin nearly pulled out anything could set him off. They would praise me and tell me that they wish that they had same patience, until they get mad at me for dumb shit I did (they even get done with my second youngest, they will go find me) and then they would get angrier because I won't fight back. It usually turns into my parents (Dad, my mom has my dad fight nearly all her battles for her) verbally abusing me. Due to my ptsd I would get super high anxiety during those times I don't say anything mostly because my mind just goes blank (like I become emotionless) and I am more focused on movement. That would really piss off my parents because they thought I was trying to be better than them, which made it a lot worse. I moved/got kicked out (a long story) and it's been a few months, I am starting to get my confidence with other people.

I don't think I am, but I would, because for me life would be pointless if it wasn't the case. Which leads me to this - If I could give you any advice at all, I would say that keeping your energy balanced by not letting go of it is safe, true, but unnecessary.

982,"So I’m gonna keep it short and to the point. 

Parents want me to become a software developer which I used to have a strong interest for but only because they have been drilling it into my head since the 7th grade. 

I voluntarily signed up for IT classes in high school and I have learned the basics and I am fluent in Java and C++.

I also want to get a job and make some money so I can buy my dream car ($12k) and make it a project car because my strongest interest is cars and IMO I am pretty good at solving issues with broken vehicles and if I can’t solve them I can diagnose and reference correct parts. 

After lots of thinking and reconsidering I decided that I wanted to become a mechanic and my goal was to start my own shop. 

I created a plan where I would get a part time job after school (because school is online) and work at my dad’s friend’s auto repair shop while simultaneously study software development so I could have a backup plan and not fall too much behind in case the mechanic career doesn’t work out. 

I told my parents about this and they didn’t even let me finish before they shut down my idea. 

They said that the mechanic industry was hard and it didn’t pay well and that I would be happier working with computers. Also they’re whole argument revolves around the fact that I said I liked software development and they think that my career path has been chosen and cannot be changed.

The more I think about it I despise working as a software developer and if I had to become one I would develop my own applications and work for myself. 

I don’t care about money. Money is not what makes me happy. The things I dream of are not luxurious cars and big houses. I like playing games online with my friends and working on cars and hanging outside. The definition of success is different between me and my folks and I’m scared I will become this lifeless husk working in front of a monitor from 9-5 until I’m 60 and I’ll never be able to work on cars and do the thing I love to do.

984,"My uncle died of AIDS in 1996. He was cremated and placed in a niche in the mausoleum of a large cemetery in my city. For 24 years my mom and I would come to visit him every so often, and later to visit my grandmother who died in 2003. My grandmother and uncle were 1 niche apart. There were times when we went a year or two without visiting, but recently with corona virus and social distancing, I've been visiting with my daughter just to have a relatively unpopulated place to go. Its a large mausoleum of old crypts with ornate gates and beautiful stained glass. My daughter and nephew are particularly fond of reading the old names from 1860s and speculating about what each person was like. 

Over the years it felt like our loved ones niches had been moved up higher. We've always needed a ladder to get up to place flowers on their niche but both my mother and I feel like they were moved higher. We were never sure though, and didn't really bother to check. 

We visit every month or so. This year we were there on mothers day and June 27th. I know because I have a video and pictures from that date. My mom was with me and we say a prayer before leaving every single time. My mom would have noticed her brother missing. Maybe I would have missed it but my mom definitely would not have. She swears he was there. 

Yesterday on my uncles birthday, August 11th, we bought flowers to place on his niche and came for a visit to find him missing. Niche empty. We check all surrounding niches thinking they may have moved him, he's nowhere to be seen. Obviously this is strange. I have my daughter with me, who  didn't want to leave so we stay while my mom drives to the office to get to the bottom of things. 

Apparently there was a break in and the culprits threw a chair (10 feet in the air) and broke the glass on my uncles niche along with the surrounding niches. He and the others have been placed in a locked, unmarked crypt for safekeeping. They tried to contact my other uncle, who arranged things after the death and has changed numbers since then, and got no answer. My mom demands to see a police report and they have one. The report says that the date of occurrence was between the 25th and the 26th of June during the hours of 16:00 and 8:45.  

As I said, we were there on the 27th, the day after the break in happened and there was no broken glass or damaged niches. Definitely. And my mom swears up and down that he was there. 

Now the question is why he wasn't placed back in his repaired niche? Its been repaired since at least the 27th of June so why wasn't he put back? And say there was a policy about contacting the family before he is placed back. Why didn't they put a sign? Why wouldn't they put something up to let the family members know something happened and to contact the office? What would have been done with my uncle if we hadn't visited that day? 

My fear is that they tried to use this break in excuse to take my uncle out, who died a very long time ago, and resell his niche that he worked his ass off through AIDs to pay for. There are no cameras so there really is no way for them to know we still visit. Then again I'm not sure. I'm not at all familiar with laws about cremated remains in niches. 

My husband thinks I'm overreacting but I can't help but smell something very fishy going on. My mom was obviously very upset and didn't think to ask about seeing exactly where they had her brother, knowing I was there with my daughter and didn't want to make her upset. We're not really sure how to proceed. The guy at the office offered a free interment ceremony when they put him back and claimed not to know anything about it because he was a new employee. We took pictures of the police report also. 

I guess the advice I'm asking for is if we should pursue legal action or if anything illegal actually took place? This is so strange and Google isn't much help.",12Aug2020,1
985,"And I'm pretty close to resigning to the idea that I never will.

I'm a 24 year old male who is not a very socially proficient person (thanks a ton, extremely Christian homeschooled upbringing), so when I get a group of people I seem to click with I tend to stick with them. People have invited me to their houses, parks, sports events, etc. before and, while I always enjoyed being there, something always felt off and I couldn't put my finger on it until recently.

I feel I'm a good friend. I'm an enneagram type 2/Meyers Briggs INFP (for anyone who follows those) and I get legitimate joy out of helping other people. I do things for others without expecting something in return because I want to see other people happy. Problem is, I feel like it's only one sided. I don't expect anything in return when I help someone in whatever way, but it would still be nice to feel appreciated once in a while. And that plays into what I finally realized was off about my relationship with my friends.


I've never felt wanted. I've never once been around people and felt in the slightest sense that they want me around. Maybe it's selfishness, depression, or whatever else is plaguing me right now, but the more I look around during these gatherings, the more I realize how differently I'm treated from everyone else by everyone else. I was at a park with my friends and the fresh air helped clear my head from the stress built up at work lately. As I was sitting down after a game of volleyball, I noticed that all the people were sitting and talking together in some smaller groups. Groups that were started because one person deliberately went up to another and initiated conversation, and it got me thinking. That never happens with me. I try to initiate conversations with them, but I feel like I'm always brushed off or just completely ignored altogether, and no one initiates conversation with me aside from my roommate asking about grocery shopping. I have my own interests and love hearing others talk about theirs, so I don't think I'm boring to talk to. I don't understand why no one cares to carry a conversation with me. I feel like I'm ignored in conversation and I can't understand why. 

This next one is going to sound dumb, but hear me out. My friend group is very close and all of them are touchy-feely, not in a weird way, moreso like arms around shoulders, hugs, and stuff like that. None of them have ever been like that with me, which is another huge reason I just feel alienated whenever I'm around them. This is a big deal for me because one of the signs of love I resonate with is physical touch, so being touch starved consistently for years now hurts like hell. Normally I wouldn't question anything (again, due to my Christian upbringing I was used to not much physical touch, even from friends), but I see how they interact with each other and it fucking hurts. They'll hug when they see one another, (platonically) cuddle during movies, and every time I'm just stuck off to the side alone.

I say ""I feel like..."" because I worry it's all in my head even when I can see it happening. I'm confused and hurt because I don't know what's real and what my mind is making up. Like I said, I usually just chalk these feelings up to depression, selfishness, jealousy, or whetever else I felt has been affecting me because I feel like getting angry at them over my feelings of being left out is unfair to them. Fun, right?

How do I stop feeling like this? 
How to I talk to them about this?
Should I even try to them about it?
I just want to stop hurting and feel like someone in this life actually wants me and cares about me.

The pain becomes unbearable to the degree that I can't walk properly anymore, walk at all, or even sit because just touching a surface with my feet becomes a session of not crying out of anger and frustration.

It has become more intense lately because my job is demanding some extreme performance, and in the last three hours I effectively spend work time trying to dodge work to give my feet rest (i.e. by going to the toilet and then just sit there for 10 mins in hope to slightly get rid of the pain - but that also doesn't help and I can't do it too often).

I also checked if there was work that I could do sitting down, but nothing is available, not even for a few seconds or minutes.

I got new shoes as well, with some custom made insoles, but they don't help either.

At this point it feels like I'd have a better work experience if someone tried chopping off my feet with a spoon. Can anyone provide any advice on what I could do to effectively get rid of the pain? I can't keep doing this job with this pain.",12Aug2020,1
994,"Ahaha I’m scared as heck :(

I’m getting surgery tomorrow that will last five hours. It starts at 6:30 am. So it will be done at 11:30 ish. I’m going to be in pain for a couple days and won’t be able to eat solid food. Im going to have to drink protein shakes. I’m getting put to sleep and I’m afraid I will wake up and say something vulgar or stupid. I’m also afraid that I’ll feel the whole thing. Right now my mom is picking me up and we are driving an hour to Newark. We’re getting a hotel there so we don’t have to drive in the morning when traffic might be bad and we would risk being late.

995,"Hey guys, I’m a 16 year old male. I am currently struggling with my family relationships and it just makes me feel miserable. I don’t get along with my family at all, I only talk to them in a way similar to the small talk someone would make with a stranger. My mum is probably the source of the issues as she has many double standards with the way she behaves and then expects us to, I have so much pressure on me to ‘enjoy my school work’ and get threatened with being put in a rubbish school if I don’t, and the general way she speaks makes me just feel sad. I barely see my friends as I am frequently left out of things and I don’t want to keep begging to go, and I’m just too nervous to ask people to do stuff as I always have the idea in the back of my mind that people don’t actually like me and they aren’t my friends, they are just nice to me to avoid being mean (I probably feel this way because of previous friendships I have had but it is still a really unhelpful barrier which affects me greatly). Just generally having a really rubbish time at the moment and would like some help on how I can improve my situation.

1000,"I already posted on r/relationshipadvice but I just wanted more input. Thank you 

My (22F) and bf(22M) have been together for about 2 years and everything has been going great. We have disputes here and there but we always manage to solve everything. Recently, we have been going through a rough patch because we started discussing our religious differences. He is muslim but he's not really into his faith and he just believes in a higher power, but I was raised catholic except I'm not religious at all anymore. So we brought up marriage and children (I know we are young, but at this point its been 2 years and I really see us together in the future) and we started to dispute over what religion our kids should be. The thing is that I compromised with him that due to both of our faiths, I don't want our kids to be raised a certain religion so I told him that how about we don't instill religion into their lives but just teach them about God and our two beliefs and later on when they are older, they can make that decision themselves. However, he isn't okay with that because he wants the kids to be brought up with religion since it will help them develop good morals (which I think isn't needed, because the parents can teach good morals). I'm personally very against this because as horrible as this sounds, I don't want my kids to be raised solely Muslim because it is going to make me feel left out and I'm not interested in converting whatsoever. He is not into the idea of raising them half and half because it is just going to cause problems. Both of our families are immigrants (Arab and Polish) who are both very religious, plus my parents would be VERY VERY against the idea of my kids being Muslim and I know that his parents would be against the idea of the children NOT being Muslim. This is turning into a dealbreaker for both us and if we can't come to a compromise, we want to part ways because there's no point in continuing the relationship if later on, this argument comes up again... I know that things change over time but there is no point in continuing this if its just going to be a huge dilemma. Here is the thing, I truly truly love him and I don't see myself with anyone else but him. Please please advise

We decided to take a break and figure this out on our own, but we both think that taking a break is stupid and it won't work. Please advise!!!!",12Aug2020,1
1001,"Every day I wake up, and I have this feeling of dread. I don't think I am good enough for everything. I lie on my bed wishing that I was dead so the pain could stop. Finally, after hours of lying on my bed, I have this burst of hope that lasts for a minute that helps me get out of bed. I wash up and try to go about my day. When I am outside, I feel better because I have not reminded of how much I suck hell, sometimes on a good day, I feel there is some hope I can change, that if I work hard enough if I put in enough time and effort, I can actually be someone I and others would love.

1003,"My dad absolutely smells horrible. He brushes his teeth only once a day, and he drinks a lot of dark coffee which stains his teeth and gives him bad breath. He is constantly eating snacks, and he doesn't rinse his mouth or brush his teeth after eating, which makes his mouth smell disgusting. He also sweats way too much, and the sweat drips everywhere. He wears the same clothes for 4 or 5 days in a row, and it gets super stinky after the 3rd day. Whenever he showers, he just stands under the shower head for 10 minutes while listening to some stupid podcast. He doesn't scrub his body or use any shampoo.

Well when you sum up those factors, my dad smells horrible. The worst part is that he releases silent but deadly farts. For example, the whole family would be playing a board game or we're out shopping or something, and suddenly I smell something horrible. It smells like rotten eggs, and it always comes from my dad. The farts lingers in his underwear and pants, and it smells like garbage when he tosses it in the laundry bin.

Everyone else is aware of his terrible odor. We've bought him deodorant and mouthwash before, but he always forgets to put them on. He always eats stuff like hard boiled eggs, chocolate, ice cream, and stuff that makes you fart silent but deadly farts.",12Aug2020,1

1006,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for over a year and a half, dating for almost 8 months. The first 3 weeks before we became official I found out he was still talking to this girl from across the country who he had never met before. He was going to fly her out here and then when we started dating he canceled her flight, but was still FaceTiming her and calling her sweetheart. Anyway once we made it official he didn’t talk to her like that any more. I asked him about this girl and he said when he was on vacation last year with his family they matched on Tinder but never ended up meeting up. THEY’VE NEVER MET IN PERSON!! 

So anyway, there have been a few times since we started dating that this girls name has come up and I asked him why he would willingly reach out to talk to her, send her heart face emojis, etc. He gets defensive and says she’s just a friend. I know he has other female friends and I don’t care about that, but this one girl bothers me and he knows this. His other female friends he didn’t have a two month or longer textationship with where they FaceTimed, sent heart emojis, match on Tinder, etc. It was a relationship pretty much. 

I tried following the girl on insta because I was going to message her and ask her intentions, etc. I know it’s not the most mature thing to do but I did it. Anyway, when I sent the follow request she messaged my boyfriend saying why is your girlfriend trying to follow me that’s creepy. He didn’t stick up for me at all, he apologized to her, and I forgot what else was said but he said something to her about our relationship and she asked if he wanted to talk about it. He didn’t respond. They later had a small chat about MGK. That was a few weeks ago. 

I don’t care if he’s still friends with this girl but the fact that they matched on Tinder and he was going to fly her out here and he allowed her to say disrespectful things about me and he didn’t stick up for me but instead apologized to her about me.. I feel so disrespected. When I confronted him he got upset and said it wasn’t a big deal and this girl doesn’t mean anything and she actually blocked him on Snapchat and Facebook not too long ago. He said he thinks she blocked him because she has a bf now or something. And I said exactly, she blocked you when she had a new bf so why can’t you do that for me? It turned into a full blown argument, him saying I’m not going to be successful in life if I worry about the past, etc. I’m pissed that he didn’t say something like, “I’m sorry you feel disrespected those weren’t my intentions, how can we fix this moving forward?” Instead he got defensive and critical and fought with me for hours. 

What should I do? We live together and I do love him but I can’t be with someone who allows Tinder strangers from across the country to disrespect me. My boyfriend is not good at conflict resolution at all.",12Aug2020,1

When my stop came, I thought the driver was going to stop as it was going kinda slow and towards the side of the bus stop and then within seconds I get down of a running bus and fall head first on the road. For a second it felt like I was going to die because I legit fell on a busy road. After a minute or so, someone came and helped me up and it was fine like I was bleeding a bit from my elbow and front teeth kinda broke little. I called my dad and the whole shabang happened but the thing is since then whenever I am in a moving vehicle and I am near the door or the window, there's something in me like a voice or sth that keeps telling me and kinda like reminding me of that incident and the rush I got when I fell on the road like it's urging me to get down. I also started visualising what would happen.

It seemed ok, aside from the shady adds that said “win 1000 dollars now!” And other things along the lines of that. I zoomed in on something I was reading b/c the text was small and my iPad froze. I tried taping the screen but it did nothing, I went to press my home button and it wasn’t working. Even the power button didn’t work. after a few minutes of that my screen went black and the apple logo came up. I went to my settings and hit the “clear website data and cookies” and everything seemed normal. About a week afterwards I was on a tab and it suddenly closed itself while I was looking at it.

1016,"I've heard the gurus tell us that it is best to relieve ourselves from desire in life. I've heard the philosophers tell us that if we remain a ""third party"" from life, we will ultimately be able to control our life through reason and logic. I've heard the Tao tell me to flow with life and to be as adaptable as the air. But for some reason, none of this is working for me.. But at the same time, it kind of is.

I'll give you a little bit of a backstory to my life. My sophomore year of high school I moved for the first time. Just about every 6 months since, I've been moving from place to place. I'm 22 now, I went to 3 different high schools, and I'll be attending my 5th college in the Spring. At this point it's safe to say that I don't really feel close to anybody, not even my family. It's like we have mutual respect for each other, but they also seem like distant strangers to me. 

At this point I'm pretty good at making friends. If I move somewhere I'll have made friends within a couple weeks, though I've always been the type of person to have a lot of friends than a few good friends. It sounds pretty messed up, but most people are boring to me. I read every chance I get and my mind constantly wanders with questions about the Universe, Human Nature, etc. 

It's because I find life so interesting that I am struggling to feel happy in life. There is so much to do and I am not afraid of pursuing any of it. In my mind, I am capable of anything.. But I am not good at picking one thing and sticking to it. How can I? I live one life on this Earth, and I want to experience the best of it. On the other hand however, I don't desire any kind of material wealth, I've gotten to the point where I don't even try to find relationships anymore, and I feel like the worst things in life could happen to me and I would barely be affected by it. 

I want to experience emotion. I want to experience fear. I want to experience what it's like to be vulnerable. I want to know what it's like to be angry, sad, and most of all... happy. I remember a time in my life where I was sitting outside, I took a deep breath, and I was just overcome with GRATITUDE for everything around me. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. 

Now I feel like I approach my whole life through logic and reason, but I am not in tune with my emotions in any way. I don't need drugs as an escape, but I've noticed that when I drink I tend to drink a lot (haven't had a drink in months though). There is literally nothing that anybody can do or say to really trigger me. If there's one thing I wish I could do however, it's to learn how to be silent. I try to force interesting conversations on people, and though some do enjoy it.. I come on too strong with others. I'm really just not good at small talk with strangers, though I have no problem with it when it comes to friends. 

I feel like I'm constantly trying to make the best out of my life by experiencing the most that I possibly can. I'll tell you that I am afraid of a few things. I'm afraid of growing ignorant to the things happening in the world, I'm afraid of routine and getting comfortable, I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant. 

I can meditate for hours on end, I won't move and my mind will be completely still... Though I still feel like I am never living in the moment. How can I become more in tune with my emotions and experience what it's like to feel gratitude again?

P.S. I was religious at one point, I've been trying to get back into it but I just can't get myself to do it. Mostly because logically it doesn't make sense to me.. I'm currently reading the Baghavad Gita, but I think since I was raised Christian it will be hard for me to make that transition.. But that won't stop me from trying.",12Aug2020,1

I am a victim of a horrible sexual crime back in 2014. Big enough that you can still google my name and find the trial. 3 men were involved and caught by police in the act. 2 of the men plead guilty, served time and have been released. They have never contacted me. The other man wouldn’t plead. I had to go to court. It was awful being there, seeing him smirking at me the whole time. Long story short he was found guilty. He was also found guilty of more crimes after my case. He tried to appeal and lost in 2008. I received a letter last month, one I knew was coming. He’s to be released in February. I can write a statement to the board and sign a limited confidentiality form. 

I’m terrified. This man lied from the beginning even while being physically caught by the police. I feel he is a monster. But I’m also a compassionate person and want people to have the chance to change. I don’t know what to do or what to write. I don’t know where to begin or what’s important. I don’t even know that my statement will change anything. And I know he can’t be put away forever. 

My life completely changed on that night and it’s crept into every part of my life, I learn more and more how as time goes on. Just getting to this point on here has me shaking. Fiancée says it’s my choice and he supports me either way but doesn’t know how to help and I understand that. 

Anyone who has written these, no matter the outcome, how did you decide what to say? Did you feel better afterwards? I feel like if it’s too long they won’t read it all or just think I’m overreacting. If it’s too short then maybe I’ve left out important things. I have a couple months to get it out so I thought I would just write and maybe go back to it weekly to fix/add things.

1020,"So some background, this all started around 2-3yrs ago.

My ex wife has this friend that was like a little brother to her, families are close and he is best friends with her little brother.

he would come and hangout at the house often and i was under the impression he was around 15.

there was this girl he was fooling around with, thought she was of a similar age, and he like to talk about these other high school freshman girls he was sleeping with. and everyone talked about how he manipulated and used them and hes sorta a pos.

well a little while later my wife started sleeping with him for a short time, and I found out he was actually 20. idk why but i didn't make the connection that something was terribly wrong with what had been going on at that point.

this year my wife cheated on me with him and his new wife(who looks' like she's freaking 16) and left me for them.(they're 22 and 21 now, wife 27 but looks pretty young)

&amp;#x200B;

me and my ex wife have 4 kids together 8 and younger and at the moment they all live with me but are going to go back and visit their mom for a couple weeks  


ok so here's the issue, I just recently found out that the girl he was with was 13/14 at the time, and i guess so were all the other girls he was messing around with.

having realized this i messaged my ex and told her that i don't want him around my kids especially our daughter. she bounces back and forth from their house and her moms right now so if they go down its likely that she would have them in his home.....

She said she needs time to process this and doesn't know how to feel. That she needs time to think and process this since she's never thought about that stuff before either....

 how long do i give her?  i get if this is a shock if she's just realizing it, but i don't want to plan to take my kids down there and have to say no at the last minute and disappoint them

but if she decides to stay with him and that she's going to keep bringing him around the kids I'm tempted to actually go for full custody and try to limit her to supervised visits to keep him away.

&amp;#x200B;

let me say i do not want to do this, i do love her and she is generally a great mom and I don't want our children missing out on time with her... but with all this i feel like i might have to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

id appreciate any thoughts on it, whether I'm over reacting or not and stuff like that since I'm having a hard time with it and don't know what to actually do or what is too much...

1021,"So originally we had planned on homeschooling our daughter, who is 5. So I had been teaching her at home when she begged to go to school like her cousins. So my partner and I decided to enroll her in kindergarten this year and give it a few years to see if regular schooling is the way we want to go.  This is the issue I am having, because I had been teaching her (I previously taught kindergarten before she was born), she is way ahead what a normal kinder kid starting school would be. So much so that she's adding one digit numbers, she already has 20ish sight words memorized, can count to 100, knows her alphabet, etc.  I am afraid she'll be a 'problem' child because she's bored with going over the things she already knows. My question is should I tell her teacher before the school year starts? I don't want to sound like that mom who thinks their child is a genius when they aren't, but I also want the teacher to be prepare for the possibility that she will be bored frequently. What would you do? Any teachers, what would you like a parent to do, tell you or just find out once the kid is in the classroom?

1. When I was 12 years old, I had the desire to become an artist (a DJ/Electronic music artist). I had tons of ambition and motivation and had set my goal for life.From that point in my life I kept pursuing it and put in the hard work to achieve it. It was literally the thing that kept me awake at night. I imagined and visualized my dream of standing on a stage in front of 10k people and playing my own music. I visualized one of my idols supporting me and my music. That was the person I looked up to, the guy who sparkled my fire and inspired me to achieve something similar.
2. Years went by where I got laughed at on every online forum possible. My music sucked, I was too confident about my thing and people basically told me it was pure shit haha. Yet it did not  stop me from pursuing my dream. I was the little kid amongst older guys being better at this music production thing. It was fun to be honest. After 3 or 4 years, when I was around 16 my music got noticed by someone bigger than myself. My music started to get noticed by local clubs and ""famous"" DJ's. They started playing it every single week in clubs and reached out to me. That's where it all began. Somebody I looked up to emailed me and wanted to make a song together. That's what opened many doors for me. Eventually, it led to releasing (and distributing) a real song under my name and having more support and plays as I wished for.
3. After a few more musical releases, I got approached again. This time by one of the biggest artists within this scene. I had the luck this scene was very local and everything happened in my country. So we met up. I was a shy little kid who took the train to cross the country to meet one of my idols. This was a big day. I felt like the luckiest and happiest kid alive. A dream coming true. My dream of being a star and realizing my goals didn't seem far away.
4. Things went well from this point. It took some time but eventually near the time I graduated I was ready and settled to make this my business and job. I was happy, around 18 years old. And I was playing shows around the globe and earning a nice amount of money per booking. The fans and ""likes"" kept coming in and it seemed like I established some sort of fanbase. This was the life I imagined. My goal seemed reached and I was happy.
5. As I grew older I started to become a bit more pessimistic or perfectionistic.. or both. There are a lot of fake things going on in the music business and I was not the type of artist who likes to play along with that. I felt real. I spoke real (to my fans, on my social media pages, etc), and I acted that way. I want to mention that at this same period of my life, my family was putting some sort of pressure on me that I should find a part-time job for some extra income. Since I didn't play shows every week, I didn't generate a stable income doing music alone. Yet this was the goal, and this was perfectly possible as almost everyone in my crew was making a living from this. I want to mention that ""my crew"" was my record label / booking agency where I was part of. I kept believing that this was possible but due the pressure and stress my family gave me I think I started to doubt myself at some point. Although I was living my dream and touring the world, my family didn't push or believe it enough so they would suggest me to find a parttime job. I hated that. Every time they brought that up it made me annoyed because I just wanted to focus on my career and because I knew I could pull this off.
6. My career was still in a good line at that time. It was also the time I was smoking cannabis. I became an addict. It was something I did on a daily basis and I think it had a negative impact on my behavior and work ethic to produce music. It also had an impact on my social media posts and thoughts about the music industry.
7. Eventually, everything let to the point where I made a social media post which my label and booking agency didn't like, at all. It was so ""off-track"" for them that they decided to cancel some of my bookings for that upcoming summer. My post was about justice, and I shared some of my thoughts on the ""fake"" aspect of this music business because it made me extremely annoyed how people could achieve the same things putting in less work than I did (friends, connections, money..). As my label and booking agency supported those fake activities as well, they were kind of pissed that I shared those honest words in front of my fans online.
8. Since I was a honest person, stubborn, and perfectionistic, I was like ""fuck this"" and basically never made contact again with them. Eventually this led to my last booking and then my career died. To this day (7 years later), I still get spotify plays from those old songs, and I still get messages every now and then of people asking what happened and why I stopped making this music.
9. I would like to mention that my interest for that specific genre was fading away near the time I made that post on my social media. Don't get me wrong, obviously, I would've loved to keep doing it as my job. But personally it just wasn't touching me that much anymore as there were other genres that started to appeal to me more.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an important thing I remember telling my dad at the age of 20, after destroying my career and right before starting some labour work which I absolutely hated. ""Dad, I'm going to do this job maximum 3 months before I'm off on another musical adventure in another style!"".

So far 7 years have passed hopping jobs and not saving a lot of money. It's only been 2 years I finally been able to quit smoking cannabis. I have made tons of songs in all those years, and removed tons of songs completely from my computer because I hate them at some point and I get angry because of everything.

I get a few plays a month on Spotify with my new musical project but it never really took off. I decided to abandon my previous name and start from scratch because I didn't want any connection to my older project. The closest I got to achieving something big was another famous artist reaching out because he liked one of my songs, but eventually it led to nothing (unfortunately).

I have not played a single show as my new project and haven't got close to being successful or making this my job, at all.

As the years are passing by and I'm slowly starting to realize I'm no longer the ""golden boy"" (aka the little 13 year old kid with big dreams) it starts to eat me and devastate me mentally. It's a big part of my life and the dream is still alive but it feels like the fire or belief that I will get there is slowly fading away.

There have barely been days that I did not make music but no matter how much I produce or whatever genre or style I try, it doesn't seem to take off.

At this point, and for the last year, or 2-3 years, it has become worse.. I highly doubt every step I take and I feel like I cannot make any decision at all for my musical path anymore. I changed my artist name multiple times and even while writing this post I still think the name isn't good enough and I should start another project from scratch. I basically like a lot of genres and I can't seem to make a choice on what I really wanna go after. The musical world has exploded so much with social media and everything right after my career died and there just seems to be too much choice and things going on. I cannot seem to find the right path and I can't find my fire and ambition like I had when I was younger.

Every now and then I still look back at my musical colleagues which I abandoned 7 years ago and see what they are up to, what the music sounds like and how successful they are right now. It makes me feel worse but some part of me likes looking at it and imagined what I could've become. The fact of seeing them so successful right now and still doing their dream job just makes me even more sad realizing its been 7 years and I'm still living at home, hopping jobs and thinking how to take off on another musical path.

Last year I have met the most amazing girlfriend in the world, and in the meantime I found some other hobbies that I'm passionate about such as trading in forex and doing visuals. But I feel like it will never replace music since that's like my main-quest in life.

If I think about it, being able to do shows again and make an income being a music artist would make me the happiest person alive but there's no way I'm going back to my older project and certainly no way I'm going to knock on the door of my label and say 'Whatsup' after 7 years.

Without a doubt, my behavior and stubbornness led to the most stupid choice I ever made in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading along. I might delete this post later because I feel like I shared too much personal stuff and it makes me insecure. Although I want to admit it felt good writing all of this.

Peace.",12Aug2020,1
1023,"My family is soooooooo SELFISH

Ok so I’m 19 and I have two older brothers 32 and 33 and a twin sister. My mother is the most selfless person you’d ever meet she’d give you the shirt off her back if you had nothing. She literally puts other people problems above her own. She’s so kind and genuine. Just overall the nicest person in the world I have so much respect for her and how strong she is and aspire to have the same qualities as her. But here’s the problem my sister is so selfish she’s obnoxious and rude. I love her to death and would do anything for her but she’s nothing like my mother in that sense. My oldest brother is the same selfish. My younger older brother is exactly like me we both are exactly like our mother we do any and everything to help her and whatever she needs we don’t question it just do it. It’s harder for him now that he lives an hour away and has his own life and demanding job. So I basically am my mothers only ally. It used to really bother me a lot how selfish my other siblings are but not as much now as that’s no way to live. I just don’t understand how my mother can be such a selfless person and raise four kids and 2/4 are like her and the other two selfish. I just don’t get it it’s not like we all had different experiences or anything of the sort. I mean my sister and I were raised at the exact same time for god sake. How can she be so selfish and me not. She also acts like a child and can’t handle any responsibility or pressure. I however have an addiction to responsibility I love it I can’t live without it. It makes me feel important and needed. And when I feel pressure from my responsibility’s I go into overdrive and work even harder. My mother and my brother are the same way. My other siblings make fun of my brother and I that we are exactly like my mother but I’d rather be like her than selfish like them. On top of all that I’d say my brother and I are way more accomplished then my other siblings. They are both smart but their selfishness is definitely a down fall for them. Long rant but I just don’t get it.",12Aug2020,1
1025,"Giving the back story, my family purchased a large estate with a small apartment attached the the far back of the main home, they offered it to myself and my wife to own, after setting lines and boundaries we accepted happily. (Literally said it's our and they don't have any say in what we do)

We moved a lot of our stuff in and got a dog (since we are wanting to train it before we have kids). We have a travel trailer and decided to travel before moving in, along the way we got a dog, and once my family found out they had a meltdown. They started bringing up respect for them, and how we didn't consult them, but they said it's our place clean and clear. I assume they didn't expect certain things, but still kinda caught me off guard.

They expect us to use our own money to expand, or fix the place up so we can rent it out down the line, which seemed normal, and yet they have started to make us pass next to everything through them, and start saying ""you don't know how to show respect"" when we say we'd rather live somewhere else if us doing anything there would cause them stress. Basically, if we don't live there they feel there is nothing to live for anymore since they thought they'd be helping us, and they play victim when we push back and try to stand up. We remind them and say ""you literally gave us the place, and are putting money in, yet we can't make our own decisions in the place?""

I'm very tempted to just rent elsewhere and leave it behind, but I know there will be a ton of emotions on their end, and a lot of hurt. each thing we try and do to the place (btw the place needs a full kitchen installed, which I'm expected to pay for) they get really offended if we don't take their direction, which leaches into my wife's and my life with stress and guilt.

I guess what I'm asking is, should we just rent elsewhere, because it feels like my family is overly controlling and overstepping into our life. My mom just today got diagnosed with cancer (unknown what type or stage) and now she's using that to try and make us comply too. I love my family and want to be there for my mom especially now, but I really don't know what to do. Any advice?",12Aug2020,1
1026,"For personal reasons I (20F) want to move to another state where I can transfer from my current jobs and have a place of my own.

They're online friends, my only friends, and I said I was going to take a break, but then I unfollowed their social medias and unfriended them on discord. I figured it wouldn't be surprising when I never reconnect with them but I feel a little guilty. should I reach out and explain?

1031,"My toxic FP doesn’t want to be friends anymore and I feel awful

I’ll say this, logically I know he’s not the best person. When we first started talking back in April he was caring, nice, actually liked talking to me and spending time with me. I don’t know what changed over the months we’ve known each other, I guess he just got bored.

He’s ghosted me three times, the first time he blocked all of his friends with no explanation for  a week, then he just said bye and blocked me for 2 days, and then gave a long explanation and said he wasn’t coming back but then came back with an apology after only 2 hours. I’ve been there for him every single time with nothing but love and support despite my other friends telling me to move on and that he’s toxic.

Recently it’s seemed like every time I try to talk to him about issues I have he’ll just brush me off and not want to talk about them. I love listening to him tell me about his likes and passions but every time I tell him mine I get criticized. If I say the slightest negative about anything he does or likes he’ll get upset and act all pissy. And recently he’s started talking to someone who has manipulated him and I in the past despite me advising him not to out of concern for him getting manipulated again.

I know part of it was illogical because I’d bring him up a lot but I was just worried and scared that he’d end up manipulated again. Last night he messaged me that it was best we didn’t talk anymore because I kept bringing up the creep unwarranted and I guess acted “weird” if he was talking or playing video games with other people which I didn’t realize. I’ve been told my anxiety and mental illness is just me acting “weird” by my parents all my life so it stung ro he called that definitely.

What hurt the most is that he said he realized something was wrong when he left the first time and felt nothing. The first time he left was months ago and he felt apparently no remorse or sadness and didn’t miss me and just came back because he didn’t want me to miss him. I just can’t believe he hasn’t cared about me for months while I would do anything for him and was always there to care for him and talk. I know logically he’s toxic and I need to move on to find better people, but I just know and remember how amazing he was when I thought he cared and how happy he made me feel. I know I’ll never find someone again who made me feel this way. And if he does come back with an apology for the 4th time I know I’ll forgive him and stay friends, I always do.",12Aug2020,1

So, I'm hoping to get some advice from savvy customer service reps or anyone who work at call centers. It seems I come across this problem all too often where I take a call and the customer wants to talk my ear off. I work for an FBO as a front desk CSR and between my paper work, ringing out customers at the counter, transferring calls between departments, communicating with inbound/outbound flights and the fuelers I can't afford to take a 5 minute phone call about their life story when all they want is to speak with sales.  


I like people, but I'm honestly too darn nice to say no sometimes. I fear though that cutting off people when I have three incoming calls waiting for me to pick up, when the customer is mid-sentence will come off terribly rude. 

My information is concise, to the point, and do my best to stay polite. Some people just don't breath between their sentences though!  


How can I be more tactful about my calls? I do make a point to ASK if I can place on hold before I do, but how can I ultimately make my calls short without being offending even though I JUST answered all their questions about flight school and the damn cost between all plane rentals. I'm also really trying to limit putting people on hold, I really don't need to have a line of people whom I need to speak with.

My (22F) and bf(22M) have been together for about 2 years and everything has been going great. We have disputes here and there but we always manage to solve everything. Recently, we have been going through a rough patch because we started discussing our religious differences. He is muslim but he's not really into his faith and he just believes in a higher power, but I was raised catholic except I'm not religious at all anymore. So we brought up marriage and children (I know we are young, but at this point its been 2 years and I really see us together in the future) and we started to dispute over what religion our kids should be.

The thing is that I compromised with him that due to both of our faiths, I don't want our kids to be raised a certain religion so I told him that how about we don't instill religion into their lives but just teach them about God and our two beliefs and later on when they are older, they can make that decision themselves. However, he isn't okay with that because he wants the kids to be brought up with religion since it will help them develop good morals (which I think isn't needed, because the parents can teach good morals). I'm personally very against this because as horrible as this sounds, I don't want my kids to be raised solely Muslim because it is going to make me feel left out and I'm not interested in converting whatsoever. He is not into the idea of raising them half and half because it is just going to cause problems. Both of our families are immigrants (Arab and Polish) who are both very religious, plus my parents would be VERY VERY against the idea of my kids being Muslim and I know that his parents would be against the idea of the children NOT being Muslim.

This is turning into a dealbreaker for both us and if we can't come to a compromise, we want to part ways because there's no point in continuing the relationship if later on, this argument comes up again... I know that things change over time but there is no point in continuing this if its just going to be a huge dilemma. Here is the thing, I truly truly love him and I don't see myself with anyone else but him. Please please advise

So first off, T is really bad at saying no to people, even if that person (V) is using her and she knows it.

So T has recently moved into a new uni flat and studies nursing, where she has been assigned placement approx 30 mins away from her flat. V is on placement in the same place but doesn't have any accommodation and has essentially invited herself to stay with T, despite having not spoken to her for most of the year. T lives with 2 other girls who will also be in the flat and realistically doesn't want anything to do with V.

But she cant say no, so we have tried to make excuses. I am unable to stay with her in the city due to my own placement elsewhere but we tried to let on I would be up staying full time (V doesn't know anything about me) so her reply to that is that she would sleep on a mattress on the floor (like seriously).

1042,"Hello Everyone! 

I have a pretty tough decision to make and don't worry I got a lot of input from family and friends, but I think it would help to have some more unbiased/ neutral people that aren't too close to the issue at hand. 

So I am a second year grad student at T university majoring in speech pathology. The school I attend is pretty terrible and they really dropped the ball. It's a pretty long story, but now I will definitely have to do an extra summer semester and maybe an extra fall semester. That pushes my graduate from spring 2021 to possibly fall 2021. My professors are not the best either. I have been communicating with them, but I get no response, it kind of feels like they gave up on me because this problem I have with the school just keeps going and going and maybe they are just tired of it. My professors have always been a problem. They disappear frequently with no communication (one of the professors disappeared for about 8 weeks of a 13 week semester, and she never communicated with us throughout her break. Even the other professors were confused on what we were supposed to be learning and doing), they lie, they are not supportive at all, they aren't organized ( for example my classmates and I had 3 days to prepare for fall clinic and two days to prepare for summer clinic. By prepare I mean create semester therapy plans, and lesson plans for the first two weeks of clinic), During spring clinic we just didn't have a resource room (that's another long. To clarify though we do have a resource room, they just rarely unlocked it), so most of the materials I used were bought by me. 

Basically I just have a lot of problems with the program and the university. I got to a point where I don't know if I just don't like speech pathology or if the university has just completely turned me off my career. For comparison I really enjoyed the courses I had in undergrad and during clinic I sometimes do enjoy working with my clients. I say sometimes only because I am quite shy and introverted, but I am working on it. I used to really look forward to classes and even if I didn't like the clinic all the time. Now I dread going to class and I'm zoned out the whole time. 

I have applied for a special education program at the school where I completed my undergrad and I have been accepted. The reason I am maybe switching to special education is because I had a scholarship that paid for me tuition and fees for four years on the condition that I teach at a public school (any public school, not necessarily title I) for 2 years.

I have gone back and forth a lot about if I wanna switch careers or not. I could see myself being a slp working with older clients ( I worked with some clients in the age range of 50-70 during the spring semester and I really enjoyed working with them) or with pediatric swallowing and feeding ( I don't have a lot of experience with this, but the topic interests me). I don't know if I would love being, but I could stand it and maybe enjoy it for at least 2 or 3 years. 

I have always really been interested in event planning. I was kind of pushed out of it because I was told I wouldn't be able to get a job in that field and if I wanted to do event planning it would have to be freelance and a bunch of other stuff that made me choose and go with a plan B option. I was also kind of pushed into speech pathology because i was told I would be guaranteed a job and I would make a good living and that I was good at languages so I would be good as a speech therapist ( I really really really really love learning languages). 

Anyway, I could really see myself working in curriculum development for a museum or zoo or youth program or as director of student activities in a school, or as a special projects manager or event planner for a company. 

So, with all of that information what I am struggling with is I don't know if I should suck it up and stay with speech pathology ( like I said I don't know if its career that I don't like and the university is adding to that or if it's just the university that I do not like and thats making not like the career or it could just be that clinic in grad school isn't really enjoyable, either way I afraid to take that gamble) or if I should just switch to special ed, which I could end up not liking at all. 

I mean with either one I cant start on that scholarship condition until Fall 2022 anyway, so the starting over doesn't really bother me. 

If I look at it from a money perspective, my undergrad is way cheaper than my current grad school university, so if I start over I would actually have less student loans than if I stayed at my current university. 

I tend to ramble a lot so to state my dilemma again: Should I stay with speech pathology or go with special education? I really don't know and I hope I can get some other input from some other people.  If you want more context (maybe about those long stories? or anything else)  I can put that in the comments.",12Aug2020,1
1044,"I know there are other subs for these kinda topics but I really and desperately need advice and this subreddit gets the most attention.

Well the title sums it up, I need to break up with her. Every time I think about her I feel bad or detached, and sometimes she's so funny and great. But once a day she goes into a really bad place and only texts me about it, she doesn't go to therapy anymore no matter how much I tell her. She has a terrible home situation and ik I shouldn't break up but I didn't ask for this. I really care about her, but I just can't handle it anymore. I'm worried about what she will do if it happens. Idk if I should just ghost her or directly tell her, because idk what will happen if I straight up tell her. I live in constant anxiety and fear because of her and I just dont want it anymore, but I'm too ""nice"" of a person to do that too her. She doesn't really have friends or people to talk to but I dont care I just need relief. And ik that sounds terrible but I can't do anything irl without her clinging to me.

Before people say I should call a hotline, I can't really I can't. She has been to a mental hospital and I can't believe I let myself get so close to her, I'm just a person.

1045,"My bf and I see each other only few times a year(long distance realtionship). All days before were: talk, talk, and bonding. During the day, we would play games and during the night and morning we would text. Now every night and morning are morbid, without cute good morning messages and caring, 0 attention and 0 conversation about problems or feelings, during gaming my parents listen to me so I cant straight up talk about my depression or fears so I kind of hold it in me and it really hurts not to have someone to talk about your feelings. Now we never text, he just plays games all day and doesnt bother to notice me and give me attention like before. He told me he just doesnt use his phone as much as before, but he often just spends his time on yt or spotify, and tells me that, and he has ""pop out"" notifications so he can actually reply to me no matter what he does, but he isnt doing it. He even told me he turned it off, but Ive seen it on just a few weeks ago when he was at my place. Also, he can text me on his pc, but never does, his excuse is ""somtimes I dont turn on my discord or whatsapp"". Also noticed once that he ignored me in the morning and went playing games instead of replying to me. Also, when I told him this for the first time, few days he came online to talk but in a week he got bored of it and turned back into his old self. He also tried texting me in the same time as playing twice(cuz he plays for fun,  nothing competitive and he can multitask so easily) and even told me how enjoyable it was to text and play, but also turned to his old self in like 2 days. He acts like he doesnt have time to play during the day so he has to play every single night and not talk to me for months. And what is the worst, he spends time on phone and ignores me. He plays entire day and cant separate 30 mins to talk about feelings or our problems. It really hurts  my guts cuz he used to prioritize me and us as a couple but now I feel like the only thing he prioritizes now is his computer. 
I just feel like its all excuses: bcuz he used to play games before and always replied, he has plenty of time to do so. Every night and day, for last 6 months, I feel rejected and no matter how much time I tell him its bothering me(I say it weekly, but actually every day I am lonely) he doesnt even try to prove me wrong or fix anything. 

What do you guys think?

1046,"Hey guys, I’ve tried googling advice and all sorts but couldn’t find anything to relate to or advice. I hope this sub is okay for what I’m asking.

I, now 21m, was in a relationship with my first boyfriend (first any thing) at 18-19. I fell in love and throughout the relationship my skin was horrendous, I had the worst anxiety, sleep paralysis and panic attacks. I tried Zoloft and citalopram but I hated both, they made me so tired and I couldn’t drink alcohol, no sex drive and citalopram made me worse. 

My ex wasn’t.. amazing but he wasn’t “terrible”. But I feel like he’s part of why I feel the way I do when I get feelings for people. He’d tell me he was suicidal at times( break up with me constantly, leaked my private Reddit account to all his friends which had my eating disorder and mental health issues written down all because I posted in relationship advice a few times because he wouldn’t let me talk to my friends about my problems (he saw my username when he went through my phone one time and looked at my posts since then). I split up with him 2 year ago and my skin cleared up (I only realised the two was related until my skin broke out again (for the 4938th time) when I got feelings for another guy. 

Now I’m stuck. I met a guy a few week ago, he’s SO amazingly handsome and so unproblematic. I don’t want to mess up. I said to him can we pause and carry on in a few week when we are closer together (for uni) and he agreed and was fine with it.

Go to community college and get a pharmacy tech degree (2yrs but pay isnt great) or go to university tht is near here and spend five years more in this house and get my bachelors of social work and maybe masters (pay is decent in ontario).

1055,"Hi I’m a 17 year old guy and recently I’ve been having a bit of a tough time mentally. I don’t believe I have any mental health conditions as such I just frequently fluctuate between happy periods and sad periods like most people do. Sometimes it can be a month or two of one thing then a week of the next, mostly down to what’s going on around me but sometimes it’s random as well. Recently as I’ve mentioned I’ve been having a bit of a tough time mentally, I feel lonely and unwanted by a lot of my friends in my core social group. I believe they are all aware that I have these periods but I don’t think I’ve felt this down for quite a while. I feel ignored a lot of the time when talking with my friends. We were trying to organise getting together to do something and everything I was suggesting was getting ignored and shut down instantly but then someone else would suggest the same thing and everyone would go along with it. There’s one of my friends that I feel is constantly annoyed at me atm and i don’t know why, I’ve tried asking and he just rattles off saying I keep saying stupid shit. Outside of that friend group I don’t really have anyone to fall back on, besides my best friend but she’s always busy doing stuff with her boyfriend, and thus whenever my main friend group start to show signs I’m unwanted it really hits me hard. Just there one of them started arguing with me over nothing of importance but it made me feel like shit cause if anyone else said what I said, there wouldn’t of been backlash or an argument formed, just because it’s me he went after me. After this I obviously felt like shit and none of my other friends in the group chat stood up for me or anything. After this I decided I had enough so I just opened up abt how I was feeling and shit and how the way they were acting towards me was making me feel. 

I didn’t even get a sorry. 

Not one person reached out and asked if I was okay or if they could help in anyway. 

It really fucking hurt me because not to long ago one of them was having a hard time and because I was worried abt him I walked around for a good half hour, with one of the other guys in the group, searching through the town we live in trying to find him so We could make sure he was okay. We sat him down and he opened up and we all had a chat to try and help him. 

Now, when I have expressed how I have been feeling. I have been ignored by every single one of them. I don’t know what to do now. I feel betrayed. Any advice on what I should do would be great, thank you for taking the time to listen to me.",12Aug2020,1

1059,"Sorry, this is going to be a bit long.

**TL:DR - I want to ask my employer to reduce my workload after they let go all other staff-level employees, but volatile interactions in the past lead me to believe this won't go over well. I need advice on how to handle this in an amicable and professional way and/or prepare to be let go ""at will"".**

Background:
I work for a SMALL organization that is going through a very transitional period. Less than a year ago, our board brought on a new ""CEO"" right before the COVID pandemic struck. Since then, the organization has gone into survival mode as our industry was severely affected.

When this CEO first started, she had a ""one on one"" with all the employees to discuss the company and our jobs. I was honest with the CEO about problems I thought the company had, and this ended up creating a volatile situation. Since then I haven't really trusted them completely and I just went to work and kept my head down. 

Still, in the aftermath I excelled at my job, I took on new responsibilities to help out, and the CEO was very pleased with my work, telling me ""how they really saw a future for me"" with the organization.

Since COVID started, the CEO used this opportunity to lay every staff level employee (3 people) except me and an admin manager (pseudo my boss, different department). Publicly, it was because we didn't have the money to pay them, privately in meetings, it was because the other employees were ""holding us back, and now with them gone we can finally get things done"". Note, the CEO did not hire any replacements and the organization doesn't have any written operating procedures, so all the responsibility has fallen on us (mostly me as the only staff-level employee) to figure out, and honestly, I'm miserable.

After the CEO made the decision for the layoffs I was told that ""we need to be all hands on deck (e.i take on all the responsibilities)"" and as compensation, I was given a raise from $20k &gt; 23K (no new job title, no written employee contract, no clear delegation of what my new scope of work is), with the promises of ""real opportunities"" later on. 

I want to have a professional discussion with my CEO about this, but given how volatile our first meeting went, I don't have high hopes that they are going to react well. I drafted two emails to potentially send, one stating that *""I didn't think there was enough work to justify the increase ""hours"", and that I don't want to jeopardize my position by taking advantage of it.""* This is mostly so I can use this to limit my scope of work. 

And a second email being honest and saying *""that I have hit an impasse with my position and I don't feel particularly engaged and I feel overworked. That I am not looking to leave the organization, but I think a reduction back to where I was might be in place.""* Normally, I believe honesty is the best policy, but I'm not looking to get fired, and I don't think the CEO is going to react well. Obviously, you don't know until you try, but after seeing how the recent layoffs were handled, and other previous experiences, I don't think the CEO cares a lot about employees.

**Has anyone ever experienced something similar? What advice do you have to approach my CEO about this as professionally as possible? What steps should I *absolutely* take in the event I am let go? I just want to create as amicable of a situation as possible for both me and the organization.**

Additional details:
I do not mind having my salary reduced back to what it was. The extra money really isn't worth the workload or the lack of delegation of tasks. I don't really want to get fired right this second, but I also can't avoid that.

We are 100% remote

I would like to convince the CEO to hire new staff, but that doesn't seem like that is going to happen right this second. Anyone have advice on how to approach this?

I work in an ""at-will"" state so I can quit or be fired without any reason. I have already started revising my resume already and have references from the recently laid-off employees.

For imagery purposes, let's say my job was ""department lead"" and now my job is ""office secretary, IT, social marketer, and community relations manager""

I apologize if this is making me seem selfish. I don't really want to screw the organization over, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of or screwed over myself.

The instructors in that department really liked me and helped me out a lot.I have been working in the main Warehouse environment for 4 weeks and today I got called in the HR office. The woman told me they were going to switch me departments.she said my productivity wasn't high enough even though I have been working my ass off every day and they haven't given me a position yet. they have given all of the other new welders positions so they don't have a way to monitor my productivity and I am still training. She told me that they wanted to switch me to the stainless steel department which is harder and means that I have to retest. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Part of me thinks they want me to fail the stainless steel test so I can get fired. I have heard that the coach stainless steel department is better than the department that I was in.

Is there something wrong with me? I don't intentionally look for WOC to be attracted to, it's just most of the time I catch feelings for a girl she happens to be black or another WOC.

1066,"TLDR at the end. I (20F) have worked at a daycare for almost 4 years. It was my first job and I was able to work through college, so I've never had to give my two weeks anywhere before. With everything going on with COVID, we don't have that many kids and some parents are hesitant to come back. One set of parents asked me to nanny for them this fall and obviously I took the job. My boss is an older lady whose really kind, but also kind of stubborn and I know she will try to convince me to stay. Some of my coworkers were talking yesterday about how shitty it would be for one us to quit and nanny for someone who used to come to the daycare - which is my exact situation. The whole conversation left me feeling shitty about quitting and I don't want to tell my boss I will be working for a family that used to go, but I know she's going to ask and I'm not the best liar, and I get tongue tied very easily. The family is also considering sending one child back part time and I would hate to put them in the awkward position of lying to my boss if I chose not to tell my boss about where I'd be working. I feel like this work be so much less stressful if I could just email her about it. I work on Thursday and then not again until Tuesday, so if I emailed her Friday I wouldn't have to face her until Tuesday.

Overall I feel like I'm being a chicken shit about it but I'm just overwhelmed with anxiety over the whole thing and I need someone to tell me what to do. My mom says email isn't the way to go about it and that I just need to do it. I feel like she's probably right but I don't know.

TLDR; Is it okay to quit my first job, that I've been at for four years, by email? Or is in person the right thing to do? I know what to say in the email, but if I should do it in person, what do I say?",12Aug2020,1

1068,"My husband live in a medium sized city. Apartment living is expensive. I recently took an online job and my salary is dropping from $50,000 to $36,000 (I might work part time to get to $40,000)  


My husband and I are considering buying a condo that is not part of a condo association (like buying half a duplex) so that if there are major repairs, we may not be responsible for the entire costs. We are not handy (I would be willing to learn a bit) and we don't like to mow/shovel.   


Condos are $150,000-$200,000. My husband also makes about $30,000-$35,000. I am hoping buying would reduce our bills. It looks like a $175,000 condo is about $1000/month with property taxes+mortgage+insurance and if we found a condo for $140,000 that would be $775/month.

I respect when people don’t like or want physical intimacy, but I had a good group around me where I could bank on at least one person being down.

1072,"I went to a local store today  (like a mini Walmart if you’re from abroad). I noticed a gentleman on a mobility scooter (with a leg missing), looking through the cables and electronics isle. I also happened to be there looking for a plug adapter I needed. The man looked to be in about his 80s. He seemed frustrated and was looking for something he couldn’t quite find. I of course, offered to help. It turned out he was after a cable to connect his WiFi “router to the tv”. I asked him how long the cable needs to be. To which he replied, “about 5m”. It turned out the store didn’t have a cable long enough. I suggested to the gentleman he ought to “look it up on amazon” and see if they have the length he is looking for as they tend to have pretty much everything you can think of. To which he replied, “do you know where I can find this amazon store”. Now, I’m aware “Amazon go” has be trialed in some countries but my mall is far underdeveloped to have Amazon’s interest. The conclusion I am trying to get to it, I often find the elderly and more specifically those over 60, tend not to be to grips with technology and things such as amazon. In this situation, it would have saved him a ton of time and travelling( to a potentially dangerous store with lots of people), where COVID could be a threat to the man. I’m in my early early twenties and I often question whether when people get to those ages of around 70-80, why a lot of people don’t tend to adapt and learn the ways of life such as using the internet to help them be more efficient in shopping, mailing, cinema etc related activities. Is this because of a mental barrier or are they just not exposed to technology. 

Just as a bonus, during our conversation of me trying to explain to him he could look up the item online. He revealed how he doesn’t use his computer much as “they track you” and “take your privacy”. I also found that fascinating to an extent.",12Aug2020,1
1073,"Hey guys, 

I need some advice here, first I'll give you a little idea of the situation. So, I (F, 25) passed my A-levels with a GPA of 2,7 (which isn't suuuper amazing but not bad either in my country Germany, please note our education differs a LOT from American). I am super happy with my GPA and never imagined I'd make it that good, I've got extreme dyscalculia and Math is a main examination subject here in Germany. So, yay for me. 

Now, here's the problem. A very good friend of mine also did her A-levels but with a GPA of 3,0 and she always dreamt of studying law, which can either happen with her GPA or not. Originally I wanted to study something comepletely different than her, but found out it won't be taught at my local university due to lack of interest in my city. After long talks with my family and thinking, I decided on law too, because I want to work for the city or ministry and law gives an amazing spectre of opportunities. I made that choice totally focusing on me and my goals in life, not even thinking about my friend. 

She called me crying because she wasn't sure she'd make it into university and especially law with her GPA where I will (most likely) get a university place. I honestly don't know if and how she will react to me telling her I want to study law too, she's an absolute sweetheart, but I feel terrible because I never realized how MUCH she wanted to study law. I'm afraid this will cause a drift in our friendship and I'm already very much alone in life, I have two best friends and her and that's practically it. 

Any advice how I should tell her that I've enlisted for law too?",12Aug2020,1
1074,"My father gets drunk every night before bed, he is 77. Just today he got drunk, fell and busted his head open. He seems to be okay but the ambulance took him to the hospital. I am 20 and live with my 25 year old sister who is always locked away in her room working with head phones in, unable to hear anything. On top of that she is also bipolar and doesn’t respond well in situations like this. 

I just transferred colleges and I am leaving in 12 days. I’m extremely worried about him and his safety being here while I’m gone. When he’s not drunk he operates like he’s 15 years younger than he actually is. When he drinks he barely can control his legs falling quite often. I’m crying and hurting because I don’t know who to turn to. I tried multiple times to stop his drinking. Whenever I bring up his drinking to him he always down plays it. Reminder he’s 77 and convincing him to stop being an alcoholic after most of his life being one seems impossible to me. Any advice would be appreciated",12Aug2020,1
1075,"I know it sounds weird and I might just delete this later  but for the last 6 years I’ve been watching anime in secret I’m not sure why but I just hid it at first, and now it’s been so long that I don’t know how to tell my friends and family. I play piano and can play songs by just hearing them, and recently I started playing anime songs while trying to hide it from my parents . My parents heard me playing part of song called Unravel which if you don’t know is a very loud song. They haven’t said anything and they probably don’t know what song it is but I really want to tell them and I feel after so long of hiding it that I can’t give up now. I’m not worried about my mom but I am worried about my dad because a few years ago my dad was talking about how my favorite color was blue and I told him that my favorite color is actually purple and he freaked out and made a scene and I can’t imagine what it would be like if I told him that I’ve been hiding something from him for 6 years.

1076,"Ok, so I left my old job back in January because I wanted a manager position and I didn't think one would open up where I was. So I left for another job where I was promised to be fast tracked to management within the year and for higher pay. Well it turns out that guy told all new 20 hires the same exact thing. 

So I left there and switched up industries completely to a sales role. Hours are great and no benefits though, small office so he doesn't have to offer any. I was ok with the lower pay because it's a new industry to me and I'll be making commissions. I do feel like I'm actually helping people in this new role, I'm not an all-star at it but I'm not doing terribly I think.

Turns out I was wrong on the first job and a manager position did end up opening up. Old boss contacted me and asked if I was interested. Pay would be about triple my current base pay, full benefits, gas card, and yearly bonuses. Hours are going to be worse, 10-12 hour days possible 6 days a week. The increase in pay would be extremely crucial right now because I would like to buy a house in the next 2 years and a wedding.

 I would be walking into a shit show from my understanding. Extremely high turnover rate this year, quit matching 401ks, pay increase freeze this year but no word on next. They lost both managers so I would be solo until a 2nd one was hired. Just everyone I talk to that I used to work with that is still there sounds miserable. I was just a supervisor (non-management) before I left, I did enjoy that more than the entry roles.

I know this is a more ""me"" thing, but would love just outside perspective on the situation to see how others would react in my shoes.",12Aug2020,1
1077,"It all started once some handsome looking doctor guy started texting her. After time he started texting her how he likes her, how he'd come to her, yadi yada. She believed him everything and was talking about excitingly to our family. When I saw his profile, it immediately looked suspicious to me. After using Google image search, I found out he is fake. She didn't seem convinced, but later on seemed to agree a bit. When I texted him by himself to stop pretending him to be someone else, he started mumbling something and later on blocked her. But...it didn't stop there. A newly created profiles started texting to her, all of them looked like some successful doctors in their 40s-60s, probably to be more attractive to older women likes my grandma. It  seems like it's all created by one guy, or maybe small group of people. I believe their goal is to somehow get money from these women. And the worst thing is that my grandma still texts with them. I keep telling her that all of them are fake profiles and she keeps replying ""yeah, yeah I know"". She probably really thinks that these men are real and like her.

A good thing is that she would never send them money, mainly because she doesn't have a bank account and doesn't have lots of money anyway. They also often demand Hangouts from her, so that they text with her there. I don't understand why they need these platforms? But anyway, she doesn't know how to install hangouts or nor how to use it, so she came to me couple of times to install it for her and show her how to use it. At first I declined, but she got quite mad so I ended up doing it. Today she wanted it again, apparently she accidentally deleted hangouts from her tablet. But this time I declined, telling her that it's just wrong, to which she got quite mad and even almost started crying.

I really don't know what to do. I mean sure, they probably won't be able to scam her, but still, I'm not sure if I should allow these men to lie to her. She really likes to texts with them, daily, multiple hours per day. Should I just....let her? Or keep declining to help her with it?",12Aug2020,1

If she were to break up with me, I don't think I'd be that sad; more, bored, shes my best friend. I love her, but I also like the thought of being alone.  

I have never believed in love, like at all.  Parents divorced at a young age and I never found the use for leaning on somebody else.  It's complicated to explain.  I have been around the wrong people all my life and I just don't believe in it.  

I saw my girlfriend a lot, we did the same sport so we had to see each other at comps and we went to the same school.  It's harder now because of the words situation, but ya.  She is older than me so push comes to shove when she goes off to college I will brake up with her because she plans to go to college far away.

1080,"
Hello Reddit, i want to give some background to myself so some can understand if I don’t understand things or get things immediately. I am a 19 year old female, who had a traumatic brain injury when she was sixteen. It took me two years to recover, and I graduated from high school within six months at eighteen. During that time we moved from Nevada to California, and I have been going to community college since then, and full time taking care of my little sister since she nine months, including sleeping with her at night, and a few hours break on the weekend. Even college took a backseat, because I had no time to study due to how fussy she was and I was crib training her. I recently just got a part time job at Vons for 13.20 an hour, but I haven’t started training yet. The problem? My parents and I constantly butt heads over different issues, and it has gotten pretty bad as of late. They want me to now either move out, and pay them 800$ in rent for the time I am there, or full time watch my sister without any fighting on my end. I am hesitant about moving out because I don’t know how to drive, I was never taught, because my “doctors” would have to clear me. (Haven’t seen a doctor in a year and a half) I also don’t have a lot of real world experience, and no family in the area to help me, and no friends because we move around a lot. I don’t even know if I make enough to pay for everything on my own. I also don’t want to stay, because of the fighting, my parents going through rough patches constantly, and my college life being affected. For example, I could only do online courses, because no one could watch the kids during the day. So what should I do? Should I suck it up and stay? Or should I rough it and leave? (I’m sorry if I sound spoiled, or entitled, I’m just confused, and scared)",12Aug2020,1
1081,"So I’m surrogating for my sister. I’ve had to stop my transition (I’m non-binary but taking testosterone), I’m weening off my anti-depressants, and I’m putting off top surgery until I’m recovered from having her baby. We’re still planning and trying to figure things out, and I want to have a cut off point, because I can’t put my transition off forever, because stopping my transition in combination with going off my anti-depressants, my body image and mental health are going to suffer as a result, though that’s something that I’m planning for and prepared for, but at what point do I set that boundary to call it quits? Because once I go back on testosterone, my fertility is going to go  continue down and I probably won’t be opening to carrying again. I was only on testosterone for a year and had no trouble getting pregnant the first time, but my partner and I weren’t really trying and we didn’t have to do artificial insemination with frozen sperm, which lowers your chances of getting pregnant. I don’t want to be a dick and give my sister a “time limit” for when she can be a parent, but at some point I will need my body back. How much time should I give this while being fair to her and myself?",12Aug2020,1

1083,"My parents believe that they have the right to say whatever they want about my life and how I live it. They are controlling and manipulative and every time I sit them down to have a rational talk about having my own freedom and privacy, they believe I am ungrateful for all they have done for me.

They even try to talk me out of moving out and guilt trip me of not caring about them enough to stay with them and help out At home.",12Aug2020,1
1084,"As my title says, I live with an abusive family, mainly my dad and brother. My mom is also abused so she supports me leaving but she doesn’t intend to move out with me (if you can give me any advice on how to convince her, that would also be appreciated) and basically my dad and brother collect money from my mom and I so we don’t get a say or know how the money is managed. 

This is only a problem because I have a car that my dad bought (partly with my money and partly with his money) and he and my brother control the car insurance. I am more than willing to leave the car behind when I leave but just in case they allow me to keep it, I need to know how to separate my car insurance from them so I can pay it myself. So that’s the first thing I need advice on.

Next is that I’m planning to rent an apartment. I currently make $2000 a month and I don’t have much saved, maybe $1000. I want to get a 2 bedroom place because I at least want a place big enough for my mom to have somewhere to escape to. I keep watching YouTube videos about what to look out for when renting an apartment so can you all help me make a checklist of things I need to do or keep track of so I don’t get ripped off. I’m aiming for the cheapest place I can get that is still livable to me, but I’m not sure what things to look for. I also don’t want to get ripped off so I know that I’m supposed to take pictures on the first day but any other tips like this are welcome.

Lastly finances are something I’m a bit worried about. If I make $2000 a month, how high of a rent should I accept? I need money for food, car insurance, my phone bill and another thing I’m worried about is medical expenses. I did actually try moving out without permission when I first started college and lived in dorms but I became depressed soon after that and my psychiatrist thinks it has to do with moving out. I had to get ECT treatments (6-12 is how many it usually takes) but it costs like $200 for EACH treatment. I don’t know for sure that I’ll become depressed again but that’s something I need to look out for.",12Aug2020,1
1085,"I'm 30 years old. Growing up my family always made me feel shit about myself - there are so many reasons for this, but generally they just constantly (in small ways) undermine, belittle, don't support and disrespect me (I think partly because I'm the youngest so all the family pain has trickled down onto me because I (was) the easiest target growing up)

I still love them. I just feel like I've outgrown them. When I go back to them I just feel 'no one in my life treats me like this'. The people I'm friends with and my SO all treat me well, and I treat them well. So it's a shock to come back to my family where it's not like that.

I try to express my boundaries toy family, and they try to be better for a bit, but they always slip back into old ways of acting towards me. 

At this point I feel sort of dead inside to them. I am just cut off from them and emotionally distant whenever I see them. It makes me sad because I still have lots of love for them. 

They just can't seem to treat me how I expect to be treated. It's nothing major that I'm asking, it's literally just respect me as a human being and stop treating me like shit. There's some good they do, but there's also lots of bad. I have friendships and relationships where there is little to no bad, and lots of good. Sometimes I feel like why am I fighting to make things better with my family when they can't seem to learn or grow.

What should I do? Anyone else been or in this situation?

TL;DR my family make me feel shit but I still have love for them. I've expressed my boundaries with them, they try to respect my boundaries, but end up crossing them. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1

1088,"Just some backstory: So, I've had feelings for my close friend for a while now. I say close because, well, we're pretty close. We tell eachother shit. We've known each other for a year. We briefly dated about 10 months ago but his ex gf was giving us problems at school so we broke up but decided to stay friends. I asked him if he wanted to date again in early January/late December and he said no because ""relationships are stressful"". We remained close friends and i only brought up my feelings for him a small handful of times when it was necessary, not to ask him out again. That's the backstory. Turns out the reason he didn't want to date again was because he had a girlfriend, not because relationships are stressful. Am i allowed to be mad about this? Im not mad he has a girlfriend but i feel like 8 months of my life have been wasted having feelings for him. If he had just told me in the first place that he'd gotten a girlfriend, i would have been kinda sad but gotten over it eventually and at least I'd know there was no chance we were ever gonna be a thing again, instead of being unable to get over him for all this time.

1092,"I have had multiple flings with men in the past, but it has always been sexually performative and always felt taboo.

(i'm 23 now) 

I met my (now) boyfriend a few months ago and he was easy to talk to. At first i didn't think our friendship was going in the relationship direction, but i listened to his problems &amp; gave him advice,,,and one day he just asked me to be his girlfriend and i said ""sure"". Flash forward a few months and he tells me he's obsessed with me. Calling me multiple times a day, wants to see me, have sex, and continue to use me as a problem solver. He's really kind but i just feel so drained and burdened. 

He's shy and can be very insecure, so i've taught him more about body confidence. I was the only one there for him when he was in a really dark place. He relies on me for things like hygiene (he has depression and its hard for him). He tells me all the time how much i mean to him. 

The problem is lately i've started to become aware of my sex repulsion towards men. I began to look further into comphet ( compulsory heterosexuality), which made me feel so alive and understood. I am fairly certain i am a lesbian who has been groomed and manipulated into being with men. 

I know this will break his heart. I don't want to crush him or bring him back to a dark space. I'm just ready to be free from the twisted hetero dynamics in my life. I want to heal and just free myself. I've never broken up with anyone before so i don't even know where to start. I really appreciate him and hope he does well! I just don't know how to go about this without absolutely crushing him.

Please help me. I wish i didn't let it go on this long. I really don't even know how to start this conversation with him. It's beginning to feel like every time i see him, i'm wearing a mask.",12Aug2020,1
1093,"I’m a sophomore in college so I’m not really relevant in this whole thing besides being in the family but essentially my sister and I lived with my mom after my parents were divorce child support was a regular thing but then we moved to a different city leaving my father behind about 2 hours away. My sister didn’t like it there and moved back with my dad. I haven’t been accounted for in child support for 2 years now but my sister is still legally in my mother’s custody despite living with my dad for the last 3 years. My dad stopped paying child support because my mom said she’d change the custody thing or something of that sort but then couple of months later the government froze my dads accounts and took about 7000$ from not paying child support. He’s been trying to get my mom to cancel it all but she says he’s legally supposed to pay her still. 7000$ is not money we can toss around and though my mom is definitely less well off than my dad it’s still not chump change to him.

Fuck no.

1096,"I apologize in advance, english is not my first language and i'm still shaking for the emotional burden. My hands are still trembling as I write this but I'll try to recap everything the best I can so any poor soul who has the misfortune to stumble upon this raving of mine can at least understand my opinions and the background of them more or less. Basically I felt like shit for the majority of my not so long life, I'm 21 btw. Never had good or close friends, never had success with girls. Spent my school years mostly alone or without ever really belonging to one group or another. Home always felt like shit with a family that despite being composed by the most hardworking folks one could ever meet was never the most comprehensive one. The last ""real"" crush I had lasted years and only ended in a path of depression. I stopped caring about me, stopped caring about others to the point I didn't even felt bad anymore if a girl rejected me, stopped trusting people in general and begin to not even bother to give anyone a chance. Especially things like WhatsApp became my most hated thing above everything to the point that I'm not able to stand interactions that are kept too long under a screen. The majority of my time talking online is spent either for business (like asking homeworks and things) or spent looking for red flags, counting the lengths of vocal and written messages, the last time online and the reply delay and things like that. And I may have been starting to slowly descend into the spiral of alcoholism (for a couple of years now). The last year fell on me like a boulder. The friends who I considered like a family practically ghosted me, I was suppose to complete the second year of university but instead I wasted it working small jobs here and there for a few bucks.  Now we're coming to the clue. During this hard time only a group of 3 friends that I've made from university still stayed with me, now we've known each other for almost 2 years. Here the troubles begin. The group was always us 4, but then I discovered that a mutual friend of ours wasn't in it. I know her since the start of the university like all the others but never had occasions to really bond with her until this year. After six months away I finally returned to university and in february we met again. It was her birthday.  I found her very nice and a wonderful person so I made her part of our group after a few weeks since she was friend even with the other friends of mine. Then covid hit and I was left with the message apps as only mean of interactions. Now this year and the previous ones have been rough for her too, she came out of an abusive relationship and some psychological issues. We started to speak more often and we had the occasion to meet up with all for my birthday and in other occasions during this summer. It took me sometime but eventually it became impossible for me to hide any longer to myself that I felt something for her and god knows since how long. During the last month I've tried to limit how much I spoke to her since I saw she was not into me and I was afraid to let the feeling grow. We never hang out together alone, everytime we met was only with all the group and all of my hints and even straight out attempts to date her went invain. And I have to specify that I only live 10km from her and the other friends of ours live like 70/80km away. Last month she started dating another guy even more toxic than her ex, I was ready to give up. I stopped texting her too often and basically spent the entirety of july drinking while my parents were away. We only spoke to deal with things and when she asked me for advices. But then I don't know what happened, the past 3 weeks feel all dizzy to me like a kind of dream. She and the fuckboy ditched each other, and she found the strength to abandon all the toxic people that treated her like shit for all this years. She begin to open up with me, and I run in her aid when she called me. I would not call these days dates because we hang out together because she had no one left but still. She still didn't feel anything to me but we started to bond real well. She always had trust issues and feared that the people around her might try to take advantage of her. Now with me she said she was happier, and even that she trusts me (our mutual friend even confirmed it to me, she send me a message or her that I have still saved because it keeps me from jumping off a cliff already). I always felt cursed because it was like I was invisible for every girl I've ever met, like I was not even worth to be considered an option. But now this curse of mine felt like a gift, even if she didn't love me she was able to find some peace alongside me exactly because for once in her life the guy she had in front wasn't someone that seemed like a predator to her. I decided to suck it up, to hide my feelings and to accept a bit of a suffering if this was worth her happiness. For once I really care for someone and I really mean it and we became closer. The messages started to be more sweet, we started hanging out and she even hug/cuddled up with me. And here the fuck up. Yesterday we were in a conference call on whatsapp with this other friend of mine that has a huge crush on another friend. Then my crush put her call on mute because she had to do something. She left for a couple of minutes, or at least I thougth, and I was left alone speaking with our other friend (For indeed she knows about my crush). My friend started complaining about her crush and so I commented that she should feel lucky she doesn't have to hide her feelings like I have to. Well I didn't knew my crush was still there and she could still hear us. Today she wrote to our friend about this, obviously she tried to cover up everything and deny but still. We had in program to go out eating together, I proposed it because she confessed me she stopped eating and lost weigth since last time we've met and I felt shit for not notiving it before. She cancelled all the plans, responded to me kind of cold on whatsapp and now I'm here. For once I was able to make something good, I was building something and I was making her happy. Now I feel utterly shit, I feel like I broke her trust. She felt better talking with me because she didn't have to worry that I may try to talk her into loving me and I hid my feelings because I didn't care to do so and that was the only way I had  to give her no worries at all. And now I'm terrorized, I'm scared, I miss her and don't know when will be the next time I'll see her and even more afraid of what to say to her next time.  I miss her, she's alone because all of her former friends were a toxic bunch of assholes (she still have the other 4 friends of our group obviously). I can't message her, I can't ask if she's ok, if she's been drinking or if she started eating again. Nor I know if I'll receive an hearth emoji, or an audio of her speaking with the cute voice, or an hug ever again. I had the thing that was most close to love I've ever had in my life, I was happier too and I wasted it like the shithead I am. How can I fix everything? How can I rewind back to before yesterday and start again from there? There's gotta be a way out, anybody, anyone, pls help me. What have I done? I don't know what to do now, I'm lost.",12Aug2020,1

After much back and forth and delegation over the years it seems that my parents have decided that they would like to pass ownership of the business to me. Ive been working in this place since i was 14 and have remained until i was 20 when i went away for college. came back about 2 years ago and tried to do some of my own business on my own but ultimately came back to the store.

The store in question has over 10,000 products and has been around since mid 2000s. There have only ever been 3 main employees; My dad, my mom (works her real job m-w then the store th-sat), and me as my parents never really trust people and figured they could do everything on their own.  
The storefront is rather clean and well kept but dear god everything not accessible by customers is an absolute mess, NOTHING is organized, papers everywhere, everything is jerryrigged together, from the floor made out pallets and ply wood to the desk we have our computer from 2006 running windows xp and a macbook that we finally openly admit don't even know how to use.

We don't have a system to check the cost of items or how much we paid for things in the past or even really what the price is for an item now. If we don't put a sticker on it we don't know how much it cost, a lot of the times my father would make up a price on the spot when something doesn't have a price then we would have to check online to see what the real price was.

My job recently has been to reorganize the online part of our business which was equally in shambles. Multiple google pages that showed old address and phone numbers and facebook/instagram accounts that haven't been touched in almost a decade.Out of these 10000+ items they also had maybe 400 of them on eBay, Not much sales, maybe 1 or 2 items per day. I have ample of experience selling on eBay and amazon and figured that i could try to post more items but the problem is that they also want me to make a website for the store. 70 hours later i manage to scrap out a very barebones website and I repeatedly state the website is really in a very early state but all they ask is ""when will we make money on it. when will we sell something."" They are now talking about paying a company called ""[AD.IQ](https://ad.iq/)"" to become a google partner to help push their business / website on google???

Sorry for ranting i just don't even know where to start with what needs to be done. I guess first question is what would be a good system or register / pos system for a massive inventory with thousands of items?

Also has anyone use [Ad.IQ](https://ad.iq/) or any other google partnered marketing service to help push your business?",12Aug2020,1

1099,"I'm sure there is a better way to phrase this, but this is something I've consistently struggled with across multiple relationships. Hell, this doesn't even apply only to romantic relationships.

Basically I want to know how to get people to do simple things: listen to a song, watching a video, reading a short story, trying something new, etc.

Obviously I'm not trying to manipulate anyone, but just gently coax them into doing something so that we might have some mutual interest or experience to talk about / share together. I think this is especially important in relationships, and obviously I realize that its a two way street (and I of course reciprocate by checking out things others recommend).

Most of my fruitless searches about how to better go about this have led to advice centered around sex or psychological manipulation, but that's not what I'm going for at all.

My S/O is as stubborn as I am and will often outright decline to check out things I send them, and its hard not to be frustrated by this (which I often am). However, I recognize that this only furthers the problem. 

If I'm too pushy, I become a nuisance. Too casual, and I will be brushed off most of the time. Dammed if I do, damned if I don't.

Should I just give up trying to share things? Anyone else experienced this or have a solution? Any advice appreciated!

Thanks!",12Aug2020,1
1100,"So I (f) have been long distance friends with a guy for about 2 years now. We met on an app and he originally messaged me because he thought I was single, though he lives a few states away. Regardless he accepted I was taken and continued to talk to me anyway. He was a little flirty sometimes and I back but it was always light hearted and jokey. I was always very transparent about where I stood as far as our friendship stood. About 2 weeks ago it was my SO birthday and I made a snap about how I was a bad gf because I didnt him a gift. The friend ( we'll call him Jack) messaged me joking about me using my boobs as a gift. A joke actually several other people made one way or another. I responded and it was never opened. I didnt think much of this because that happens sometimes. Well a week later and I see it still had not been opened so I clicked on our messages to see if the header would come up saying ""messages are pending until so and so adds you as a friend"" thinking maybe he randomly unfriended me. That messaged was not there so I let it go another week. Still unopened I finally tried to just message him at random and it woupdnt go through. Clicked on his name to see it had the option to add him which confused me. Only to find when I clicked it nothing happened. I've never been blocked on Snapchat before so at first I thought it was the app being stupid until I googled the problem. So now a day has passed and I know I have been blocked. What I do not know it why. We didnt fight or argue. And it's not like he was just talking to me a few days and then got bored like some dudes do when they realized your not going to send them nudes. A 2 year + friendship just ended for now apparent reason. If he had just unfriended me I might be a little less upset but he blocked me. And to me that's for people you just dont want to exist anymore and I'm pretty hurt by it. We weren't BFFs who talked every day nor was everything we talked about all that important, mostly idle chit chat and jokes and we had never met in person but I get attached to people after a while and genuinely gave a shit about him as my friend. I have another snap account. I made it a few months back when I got logged put of my regular one and had issues resetting my password. I could message him on there and then add him to see if he would respond. Just to ask what I did if anything but I dont know if I should bother. It's really bumming me out right now. I know I'll get over it eventually but I hate thinking I did something awful enough to get blocked and not realizing it. If it was for no reason other than him just not wanting to talk to me anymore, maybe I can just be mad and move on lol. Idk if it's worth the trouble, but for now it's just stewing in me.",12Aug2020,1

I finally got a retail job thanks to my younger brother but then covid hit and I'm sort of without a job again (picked up a bar job once again,, thanks to my mum, though I'm not sure how long I'll be able to stay bc I feel like it's too much for my anxiety/I'm gonna start messing up soon)

This is an abnormal situation. For some background, I am, what most people consider a successful 21M who owns multiple businesses, makes a high income, and is about to graduate from an IVY league despite coming from a low-class family. I have a great girlfriend whom I genuinely love and can understand me very well. I have thousands of acquaintances and social media followers. 

But on top of my desire for my girlfriend, I always feel like I want a bromance with another guy. I know that sounds weird, I am not gay and don’t want any sexual or anything even close to sexual relation with another guy. I just want a friend whom I can trust very well. For me a bromance is just were 2 guys can talk deeply about things, and can just do things together, go to the gym, play sports, talk business, drive fast cars, etc. 

As a businessperson, I tend to meet a lot of people and every few months I meet someone whom my mind sees as perfect. I become extremely attracted to that person (in a complete nonsexual way). Like I just die to become their friend. Its very weird, since I am attracted to people with certain lifestyles (people into manly stuff, cars, trucks, mudding, business, sports, self-development). 

What sucks most, is when that person leaves from my life, I fall into severe depression for a couple of days and it just keeps cycling.

After spending a few weeks at my dads (who lives a more rural lifestyle), I just want to give up on these ambitions. I tried studying again, but it doesn’t fucking do anything anymore. I just ask what’s the point.

This is because of a recent fascination of nature I have started with. I’ve looked at stories of people who just moved into the wilderness, away from civilisation. I’m not a social person whatsoever, I get on with people, but when I’m with someone I’m always thinking I’d rather be alone right now, no matter what.

Here at home I’m constantly worrying, what if I see someone I don’t like when walking down the street, why do I have to follow these exact rules, why should I pretend to like people I look down on all the time. Why should I work a job where I may never be fulfilled, I will always know what I’d rather be doing.

It lasted for a whole minute maybe and I couldn’t cum because I was so nervous.

When I was 18 just going into college I was 5""8 and maybe 140-145. I stopped doing sport and just noticed I would eat takeout and drink beer more than I used to and now two years on I've noticed I've gained a bit of weight.

I am fortunate that my parents who are pretty well off money wise. That being said I’ve became to comfortable living at my moms house for the past FIVE years. She basically has paid for me to live for the last five and while she’s not happy about it she doesn’t kick me up. To give an example about how I literally won’t do anything that doesn’t interest me: I have had bills come from eye dr/car payments/ appointment no shows that I shoved in a drawer just because I was to lazy to pay them at the time (my mom paying them) which in turn is RUINING MY CREDIT.  I am constantly thinking about these things in my head and stressed and anxious about them but yet do no action toward them. 

So currently I am enrolled in college (at 26). I take my classes online and while I’m not failing out yet I’m nervous and afraid of my self that I will. This is literally my third time attempting college.  And even IF I graduate I’ll have a whole new set of problems.

1122,"Hey. I've got myself in a bit of a predicament. I, a very lonely 22yo, became friends with someone at the beginning of this year, when corona wasn't a big deal yet and people could travel freely. This was the first time I became close with someone and that I had someone to just talk to.

Our friendship has been very rocky though and it's caused me a lot of worry. We developed a serious crush on each other from the very beginning, that we knew could never lead anywhere, and that it was wrong even, from the very beginning and we tried to stay friends all the same. We had to take several ""forced breaks"" and I felt an immense fear of abandonment during that time. Still do, but it's less. It's also something I always expected to feel with any close friend or partner I'd get, so to me it didn't come as a real surprise. Anyway, it didn't work for months but the latest time we did it, it finally caught on.

What I mean by that is that we stopped talking about pretty much the majority of subjects that actually matter. The main reason for it is that our schedules drastically changed in the last couple of weeks. She started school again, I have been on a vacation and our schedules matched up less. She's been more busy too.

But. There's more to it, I feel... I know she has time she just doesn't spend on taking to me anymore. I don't hear from her when she just needs someone to talk to, I barely know what's going on in her daily life anymore while I used to get updates every two days or something... One thing is definitely that I don't always actively ask, but tbh we're pretty well in tune and it's almost like she's trying to avoid things that could prompt a good question from my side. Another thing is that I also don't do that much anymore, but as I mentioned earlier she's basically my only real friend so sometimes I just have a thing I need to talk or vent about with someone and at those times she's just there for me no matter what. But it feels very wrong to do that with someone who won't do that with you anymore.

So one thing is that this is all long-distance, internet-only and that makes it very different. You can't just go hang out together, or make memories in physical form. We met in real life though and it was one of the most fun times we had. Another thing is that she's been in a relationship and her getting close to me felt very wrong to actually both of us and I'm sure she feels guilty as fuck for it. I've had many thoughts about it but the ones that I can't shake are that she's either actively trying to give her partner more attention than me at all costs, leaving me with not just less attention but basically none that is actually meaningful and mutual to me. The other more intrusive one is that she never actually liked me as a person, but only as a distraction and a relief from things that were wrong in her relationship. I'm pretty sure the last one is not true, there's one too many signs of the opposite, but it's a thought that's practically impossible to shake. 

So these things have my reclusive mind look for reasons why I'd even stay friends with someone who has little time for her friends, and who won't devote much of the time she does have to me. There's loads of reasons to stay friends and I don't want to lose this at all but I feel like I need to do something right now to ""save"" it. I'm here looking for advice on how to approach this topic with someone.

My issue is that I don't want to ask her to devote more attention to me. Even though that's what I want. But yeah it's not really a fair thing to ask for. I don't really want to make her feel guilty for not telling me all about her life. Plus, I'm scared of hearing that she's actually stopped caring about me as much as she used to (because even though I've mostly gotten over her, I still care about her very much and want her in my life and it would hurt a lot if she didn't). I feel like it would come across as needy and jealous maybe even if I told her that I feel like she doesn't make a lot of time for me anymore, or never asks me how I'm doing anymore (I'm trying to tell myself it's because of lack of time but I'm doubtful that's the actual reason). 

So yeah, do I just ask ""hey why aren't you really talking to me anymore?"" or what? Does that sound too harsh? What could I say or ask that wouldn't directly put the blame on her? Is it okay to directly ask for more attention, to come to me more to talk about any stuff? Am I looking into this waaay too much and did her life suddenly turn into paradise with not much to complain about anymore? Should I just leave it be and let our friendship fade naturally? I mean that's not how friendships work but idk anymore... Please give me some advice if you made it this far...",12Aug2020,1
1123,"Hi,
I'm 18 years old and im supposed to be in my dorm now but cause of rona I'm stuck at home. My parents work three times a week and give it their all but at the end of the day when they're stressed they yell at me. Why? Cause I didjt cook dinner. I have two other siblings who are able to cook, but don't. The majority of the day I spent cleaning and doing chores that the other two should be doing on top of my current online summer classes.  My parents expect me to cook every day for the entire family, meaning that when they come hoke they expect a full meal ready because its my duty as a child. But lately I've felt really drained cooking for them. It feels like I cant do anything right. And when I tell them that i didn't cook they get mad and have a bad attitude for the rest of the day for me to feel bad. Its gotten to the point where I'm too scared to cook myself lunch cause I don't want them to findnout and get mad that I didnt cook them somthing. I use the argument that my siblings cook for themselves so why cant I but they don't listen. I knownim being dramatic and that other people have it worse but I dont know what to do.",12Aug2020,1
1124,"Hi this is my first time ever posting on a sub like this, but basically I'm a Highschool student and last year I signed up to take a college class this school year.

 The problem is that in order to go I have to take a covid test which I don't have a problem with, but my dad really does, he's really into lots of conspiracy theories including ones about covid. I recently tried to talk to him about getting tested but he thinks that even if you send them a unused test back it will still show positive. (As I was writing this post my dad walked in my room asking if I wanted to talk, I got a bit mad with him when he told me no so that's probably why, idk if this is relevant tho.)

 So the reason I'm posting on here is because I really want to take this class, and I also kind of have to, I have a poor memory but I remember talking with a teacher about singing up for this and she told me this will count towards my graduation credits, this is important because before last year I did very poorly in all my classes and this class could really help me out.

 The only idea I have come up with is ordering a mail in test and asking one of my friends to receive so I could go over to their house and take it there, but other than that I don't have any ideas on what I could do. Also sorry if the grammar or formatting sucks I'm on mobile.",12Aug2020,1

I find him quite uninteresting and boring, as we've grown apart the last few years (I don't want to be mean that's just genuinly how I feel) . I've become a different person that I was 2 years ago when we first became friends. He very clearly still wants to be my friend, but I don't feel the same. I feel like he is going to want to meet as soon as we go to uni (providing we both get in) and the person he still is (he hasn't changed in 2 years) aren't the type of people I want to he friends with; as in he may be a drag when trying to meet new people. I sound like a total asshole saying that and maybe I am, but it's just how I feel about the situation.

I was hoping university would be an excuse to drift away further from him but clearly that can't happen

I sound like a total dickhead for saying this about someone who used to be my good friend, but I have changed and he hasn't.

After the appointment, they wrote a letter and a diagnosis/treatment plan and now my parents want to be able to look over it and see what the doctor said. The problem is that the doctor left a small throwaway comment on it that mentioned me being gay, and I also asked a few followup questions that related to gay health and everything.

1134,"Hi all,
I've been doing a lot of introspection and realized I could and should change a lot of things in my life in order to be happy. Unfortunately this happens a few times a year- I fall into this rut and I'm constantly on edge, sad, short tempered and then I decide I'm gonna change everything and be happy. But I can never seem to make any meaningful change.

I'm a college graduate still working an unfulfilling entry level job, but the thought of applying and interviewing for a job terrifies me. I'm really introverted and afraid of failure so I end up staying where I'm comfortable and getting stagnant.

I'm vegetarian but that's about all my diet has going for it. I'm unhealthy and it makes me look bad and feel lethargic and frustrated with myself. I've had eating disorders in the past and I'm afraid to fall back into that life if I make too drastic of a change. I recently had a health scare that should have scared me into taking better care of myself but it's like I'm desensitized to all the horrifying problems that come along with a bad diet and lack of exercise. I cant seem to break my bad habits. 

I feel like I should be working harder on my relationships with my friends and family but I never make time to actually do that, and I always feel bad about it. I'm in a loving relationship and my partner can always tell when I get into this funk and our relationship becomes strained.

I know this probably just sounds like first world problems, complaining about things that are ultimately within my control, but I'm really struggling with how to make progress in these parts of my life.

Including an underage girl who has since deleted the picture. They are not lewd pics just regular selfies but his comments over the text were inappropriate. 

This officer has been in the guild for a while and was only recently promoted. About 2 months ago I'd say. In this time he has taken over a lot of responsibilities and has been working hard. He reaches out to new members and according to him a lot of people feel safe talking to him about problems they have either in or out of the guild. 

We are planning on having a meeting with him on Friday and I have composed a small list of complaints against him. Other than the pictures he has recently been misusing his power / going power hungry, been passive aggressive towards the other officers, and low key insulting then backpedaling people. Hes been getting really jealous when people run mythic keys without him. Stuff like that. 

He is also the kind of person who really likes to talk, especially to people who dont want to talk. I myself have had several conversations with him where I would try to end the convo but he keeps it going in some way or another. He will type super long paragraphs about what he thinks should happen in the guild, including a system where he gets more recognition.
