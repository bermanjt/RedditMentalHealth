0,"OK so before I rant for a while, lemme just start out by saying, I know for a fact this is the most cliché teenage girl bullshit, but I'm honestly at a loss for what to do in this situation. In advance I'd like to say, I'm sorry, but I don't have anyone to go to about this as of right now and I could really use the advice, and also this is kinda long so buckle up.

So there's two people you need to know about, let's call one Tracey and one Ally. Ally is one of my closest friends if not the closest, I absolutely love her to death. Ally's childhood wasn't exactly great (Mom Overdosed, raised by single parent that later remarried to a women that doesn't like her, she started self harm at 9 years old, really shitty situation) and she as a result has some pretty gnarly mental health issues that she refuses to talk to anyone about, which is where I think this issue stems from. This isn't exactly the problem, but this paints the picture; She tends to change her personality to accommodate any one person she meets. While the fundamentals are still there, she just completely changes her demeanor. Which as a result can maker her really inconsistent to be around, and sometimes its physically exhausting to deal with her. I hate that I used ""deal with"" but I'm not sure if there's any other way to phrase that, but I don't know how to phrase it without sounding like a bitch, but I'm sort of trying to explain that I don't know how to help her handle the situation if that makes any sense. 

ANYWAY, this is where Tracey comes in. Tracey and I haven't always had the greatest relationship, but we do see eye to eye on this issue, and began to realize that the problem was a bit more severe than we thought. A few weeks ago, I was placed in a group chat. (Now, this is quite possibly the most I-gen shit I've ever experienced) Long story short, it was me, Ally, and our other friend (not Tracey). The entire chat was essentially them ranting at me about ""my ignorance when it comes to mental health and how I was making them feel constantly invalidated and how it wasn't fair to them."" It was 45 minutes of them calling me stupid, ignorant, unengaged, etc. Real self confidence booster. Now, in all honesty, there is some truth to this. I'll own up to that. I can be unengaged and detached sometimes, but usually for good reason. Sometimes Ally will text me and be like ""i'm lonely"" or some shit like that, and 9/10 she's joking. (or telling me that she is. If she tells me that she is, then she won't talk any further about it. Even if there was some truth to that, she'll just change the topic anyway. If I do go through the motions of getting her to talk, then eventually she'll loose her shit on me. Which leads to no where.) So most of the time I respond with something like ""mkay"" and then change the subject. Because honestly how the fuck do I respond to that? She won't talk, she'll change the subject anyway, and most likely eventually flip shit. So What exactly is the point of being like ""OK, let's talk about it."" I understand that maybe all she's looking for is validation, and maybe that's okay. But telling me I am ignorant and stupid for not validating you, then waiting for you to do what will inevitably happen is a bit harsh.

Ok, What I just told you I ranted to Tracey about. She pulled up a previous argument they'd had, which was equally as concerning. It was essentially Ally passive aggressively telling Tracey that ""she was an honest to god terrible person, and that her problems were invalid. (She usually makes these in offhand comments) and that if she was being passive aggressive that it was my fault because I constantly act like that and she's just learning the behaviors from me.""

Well okay then.

Ok, so to get to the point. Honestly, I can be passive aggressive around Ally, because there's no other outright way to express my emotions around her. If I am ever up front with her about my feelings she usually just shuts down. But to blame me (and only me) for being so passive aggresive is ridiculous. 

So what I am asking is, Is it a complete and utter bitch move to stop being her friend because I can't handle her problems? She's honestly a great friend (even though it doesn't seem that way), but I don't know how to handle her. She cuts, she gets in trouble all the time, and refuses to go to therapy or talk to any adult who actually knows what to do. I don't know how to help her, and at this point associating with her at school is causing adults and teachers to legitimately question my judgement. The guidance counselor pulled me into her office to ask why I was friends with her. Is it fair to her? I feel like I'm basically going to stop being her friend over mental health issues, but I just can't anymore. I mentally and physically just can't handle the stress of seeing new self harm scars or seeing her get into trouble constantly.",31Jan2020,2
1,"My boyfriend and I are on the same course but different classes. My boyfriend is in a class with our friend who thinks everyone hates him, complains to my boyfriend and says stuff like 'Such and such hates me I know they do. But with my boyfriend spending a great deal with our friend in his class it has made my boyfriend less patient and he is less tolerant when it comes to me, I am a very sensitive person never used to be but something snapped when I lost my mum and now I cry more than I used to. However, with my boyfriend being fed up with our friend's problems and dealing with my problems he has become easily annoyed and at first I didn't know why because he started acting differently and withdrawing from me which upset me because I didn't know why he was pulling away.

He is snappy, when he comes up he always wants to watch stuff on his phone instead of watching our shows, he hangs up on me when he gets annoyed or I annoy him, he is less likely to listen to me now etc.",31Jan2020,1
2,"(I am not used to Reddit and it's etiquette so forgive me for my mistakes.)

Hi, I am a male high schooler going through a rough time, and I would like. At school, I used to be much more extroverted but because of this classmate, let's just call him ""E,"" I have become much more introverted. E kinda pushed me away from my friends because he insulted me for being myself and has called me hurtful names in the past (I understand that other people have been through much worse, but I would appreciate it if you would just give advice instead of a comparison). I asked E to stop it because it hurt my feelings and he has stopped, but he did it so much that I adapted to not do things that I feel like I need to watch everything I do so he wouldn't insult me again (he called me ""retard"" once for being clumsy) when I am at school and now I feel the need to do it when I am at home even though he is not here.

How do I move on and stop obsessing over what E thinks of me and forget that he was mean to me?

(I apologize if this was a weird read - I am not very articulate when I am sad, also, let me know if you would like more facts about the situation)

I am in university bachelor program, third year. Here is the story I am adult male in a female dominated program (child &amp; youth care). In first and second year we have a seminar group where we all meet and talk about our practicum placements and debrief. In these seminars we get to know each other, stats, background all that basic info.

From the very beginning I established that I was in a committed relationship, ten years and still going. I am adamantly a one woman man. I had also disclosed that a female coworker was hitting on me, telling me intimate detailed of her and her bf relationship, always comparing him to me putting up on this pedistool. I brought up how disturbed I was. That alone should’ve been enough to convince most people of my fidelity.

Fast forward a year. We have a law class and was instructed at the end of class to find partners to work with. After we had a smoke break and sat down for next class, I asked a classmate who was in that group with me if she “had a partner yet?”. She responded very quickly “I already have a boyfriend”. This was information that I had already knew. I met the guy. 

She knew I was in a relationship already.

I feel like she thinks I’m the type of guy that would try to weasel his way into an affair. I admit I feel insulted  that she would think that of me. I’m I making this about me? Or am I half right I’m thinking that she has the wrong idea about me. 
This concerns me. Be gentle.",31Jan2020,1
4,"So I'm planning to go abroad next week and I'm sorting out travel insurance and my parents keep telling me I'm uninsurable so I don't know what to do.

I have access to my medical records online so I can check all this. Almost two years ago I went to the doctors with anxiety and depression, I was put on anti depressants but I only took them for about two months. I decided I didn't want to take them anymore and didn't book a follow up appointment.

On my travel insurance I declare my anxiety and depression (I have no other medical issues now or before) but state I'm currently not taking medication. My parents say because I just decided to stop taking it myself, and the doctor didn't officially say then no one will insure me.

When I look at my medical records it says in July 2019 my medication template with that anti depressant ended. Which I'm guessing is because I didn't come back to get more prescriptions?

I don't have long, I have a week until I leave. Do I ask my doctors? Speak to the travel insurance?",31Jan2020,1

8,"So, when my family first moved to our new house we had a dog named Joe and two cats Maggie, and Beans. I’ve always grown up around animals. However the animals couldn’t adapt to town life due to the fact that we lived on a farm before. We didn’t have the money to go to the vet so my dad first took our two cats out to the farm. Then the dog. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. This was about three years ago. I’ve been severely depressed since then. I’ve been advocating for getting a new pet for a while. This is my side. I do understand my dad’s side due to him having to put them down himself and all the hurt and pain he has gone through. I just want him to make room for love in his heart.

13,"So my Mom is pretty lonely and stuff she has had a hard life. Around a year ago she made friends with a guy (just friends nothing more), and sometimes they would go for coffee and chat, and he would also come to the apartment sometimes as he is good with fixing things and he would help with fixing stuff around the house. However my Mom found out he is an alcoholic, but he was always really nice and kind to me and her, and also my siblings when they came home to visit. He was pretty fine but he started to come to the apartment more and more, and when I went to see my Dad (in Seattle) last summer for a month, I found out that this guy was coming to the apartment everyday and he didn’t wanna leave and he made my mom feel scared and worried. 

Fast forward to recently. He got insanely drunk a few months ago and came to the apartment and starting insulting my mom and stuff. He was also telling people in our city (small city) and people we know that he was my moms boyfriend and stuff which isn’t true. So after this my Mom told him to leave and she didn’t let him in, and he went away. That was in November, and since then he has been stalking us, like waiting outside our apartment, waiting near my moms workplace and standing near the Walmart we go to. He has seen me come from the gym and he has insulted me and threatened me [18M]. He’s also insulted my Mom and stands outside our apartment recording us with his phone. 

What do I do? We’ve already gone to the police they don’t seem to wanna do anything about it. He waits by the downtown he knows we are busy people and always have a lot to do and he is waiting in the places we frequently go to. 

I’m moving away soon and it means my mom will be living alone, as my other siblings are older and moved out already. I’m worried about my Mom and I don’t think I can move while he’s being like this.

My Mom hates him and never wants anything to do with him. I hate him too and I wish he would just die and leave us alone.

14,"We are debating selling our home and moving. We got a decent tax return and think we should fix something in our home first but dont know which is more important. My home was built in 2008 and it still has the original carpet and appliances. I can't afford to fix both right now unless I opened a credit card but idk if I could even get a credit card that big. My appliances work but I seriously don't know how. They are the cheapest models you can buy and all white so they are not pretty. My carpet is 11 years old and has survived 3 kids, a dog, 3 cats and other wear and tear. Its not torn anywhere just badly stained in almost every room. Its also not worn down, somehow the pad underneath is still pretty thick and fluffy but my carpet was almost white originally and now its pretty greyish brown. I'm only guessing but I'd think the carpet would be the better investment since its more expensive but would it be worth replacing before I sold the house? Also if I'm going to replace the flooring anyways is there anyway I could let the buyer pick the carpet? Would it be more insentive if it was in a contract somehow that I'd replace them with their choosing before they moved in or should I just pick new carpet even tho I won't be the one living in the house.

16,"Okay, keep in mind, this is my best guess at a possible reason I am having this problem. So, I had a lot of really bad attention seeking problems (nothing illegal, just acted out a lot) when I was younger which was probably because my mom was never home really and my dad lived in another state. My brother also went through a rough patch which I think sparked mine. My whole family wrote off his issues as attention seeking and it took him years to get help. They have since gotten much better at recognizing mental health issues and he is doing great. But, I have a lot of anxiety and I worry a ton about whether what I am asking for help on is me genuinely needing help, or wanting attention. It’s two voices (metaphorical) that are telling me I am legitimately having a problem and the other telling me I am faking it. I have a really hard time believing I actually have a problem and I question virtually every feeling I have. Did that actually offend me, am I actually sad, am I really upset about what happened? I think it’s something called cognitive dissonance but I haven’t talked to my therapist yet about it. If people have experience with this, either personally or someone they know, how do you fix it? I don’t like doubting my feelings and feeling like I’m either a liar to another person or a liar to myself.

TL;DR: I have a hard time believing the feelings I feel and have conflicting feelings. How do I fix it?",31Jan2020,1
17,"context: i am a highschool girl, and my best friend (ill call her S) is a girl as well. we’re both bisexual (and if you’re homophobic, could you just keep scrolling? i’m not up for one of those arguments).

so S is one of my closest friends. i’ve had a massive crush on her for over a year now, although i just started realizing it a month ago. S is pretty popular, and has dated a bunch of guys in the last few years (she’s not out about being bi to everyone yet), and i’ve been okay with that. just recently, one of my guy best friends revealed that he had a crush on S. i got insanely jealous. they didn’t work out, but S started talking to a guy (E) from her church. i’m still super jealous and feel like i’m going crazy whenever S is texting E and somehow i have to keep it together and not cry whenever she’s talking about him to me, i know i sound weak and sensitive. S wants me to go ice skating with her and E, but i’m honestly not sure i can take it. the last time i went ice skating with her and a guy who liked her, it was a horrible night and i was crying for a long time when i got home.

to add on to that, my other close female friend (P, also goes by bisexual) has been kind of... stealing S from me? maybe i’m just a paranoid jealous freak, but S has been talking to P for a while and not letting me listen. i found them in a corner at lunch today; they didn’t even tell me where they were and they said to go away and that they were having a “deep conversation.” it’s been making me really pissed, like, what are you saying that you can’t tell me too? i feel like a horrible person.

also, to contribute to the confusion, a guy friend of mine (he’s gay, soo i don’t have to worry about him and S) said earlier that he found out that S liked me, but now she’s dating E. he said he knew S did like me because he saw a text from S and a friend of his talking about how S liked me. this got my hopes up a lot, but S has never really done anything to hint that she liked me, and now that she’s dating E and is super happy... i don’t know. i want to be happy for her, i really do- and it really does make my day when she gets so excited about E, and she rants on and on about how he’s super cute- it makes me smile because she’s such a passionate person and she’s gorgeous and gets so happy sometimes... then i remember E, and all the other guys that she’s dated, i remember them and know she won’t ever like me.

also, at my school (it’s a quaker school) we have meeting for worship, where if you didn’t know, is where you sit in silence for 45 minutes once a week. S leaned on me for 10 minutes and then sometimes hugs me a lot, and looks for me after each class, saying my name super happily and i get my hopes up, thinking for some crazy reason that she might like me a little more than friends, but then she ignores me for a full day and i’m back to the start, crying in the bathroom and hoping for something good to go my way.

am i just overreacting about this whole thing? would S ever actually date me, or does she hate me? advice, anyone?? i’m feeling really stuck right now.",31Jan2020,1

I am arguing that reparations for the lineal descendants of African Americans brought to the USA on slaves ships is **not** warranted.

22,"For a while now I’ve been making a huge effort to get my dad to eat better and start taking care of himself but he utterly refuses to listen and instead acts like a toddler whenever confronted. I’m an only child and have no real family other than my dad (no mom) and he’s 59 years old and already starting to have health issues. He recently had to start taking medication because he has high blood pressure and he also just got out of surgery last week (nothing too serious). His doctors have told him to eat healthier and cut back on sodium because he essentially eats like shit and it’s affecting his health. I’ve been introducing him to more healthy foods like whole grains instead of refined grains, more vegetables, less red meat, etc. He basically only wants to eat sugary food/drinks, processed food, burgers, and steak or fatty chicken thighs and potatoes and I have to force him to even eat one vegetable a day. He puts three tablespoons of sugar in his tea every morning, which I told him is too much on top of all the sugar he already eats, and I even bought a set of spoon measures to show him what a teaspoon vs a tablespoon looks like so he can see how much sugar he’s actually putting in his drinks, but he got angry and said the spoons are wrong and he knows better. I just got in a big fight with him because I offered to make him lunch to take to work so he doesn’t have to buy crappy food (he usually eats Jamaican patties, sausages from a hot dog stand, pizza, jerk chicken, stuff like that) and he said he “doesn’t want to eat nasty health food”. I offered to make him a wrap which he said in the past that he really enjoyed, so it wasn’t like I was forcing him to eat ”nasty health food”. I tried to explain to him that I’ve been going out of my way to get him to eat better and I’m getting worried about him because he’s my only family and he’s getting old and already having health issues, to which he started laughing. I explained that every time I try to talk to him about anything that worries me he just laughs and treats me like a little kid (I’m an adult) and HE STARTED LAUGHING AT ME AGAIN. I was so angry that I almost started to cry so I gave up. He then proceeded to make fried chicken for dinner. I don’t know what to do anymore because no matter how hard I try to get him to understand that he can’t eat like a teenager anymore and that he doesn’t know better than his doctors, he just doesn’t listen and thinks everything is a joke.

I practically can’t hold conversations or have small talk with people anymore, and I feel literally incapable of starting conversations in the first place as I have nothing to talk about. Generally I’ve lost interest in many things, social interaction being one of them, yet somehow I still feel down and lonely about not being able to talk to people.

Despite all this, I have a friendgroup but tbh they’re pretty different to me, mainly cause they’re so charismatic and creative. They’re nice but I feel like lately all of them either dislike me or just don’t care about me. When we interact, the second I start talking about something I can just tell they’re completely uninterested as they either ignore me, not respond or interrupt and start conversation with someone else.

29,"I live in small college town, and live in an apartment complex. There’s a parking lot that is conveniently right outside my door. However, for the past few weeks, I’ve begun to notice two men sitting in an old SUV. They sit looking at their  phones, smoke, or talk. The car doesn’t appear to ever move, and I leave and come back throughout the day often. They are almost always there between the hours of 10am-6:00pm. Sometimes it’s just one guy, who I believe lives in my building. 

I think it’s weird AF that they do this (when do they work????) but it makes me uncomfortable because from where the car is parked, they can see my balcony. You can tell if the lights are on even if the blinds are closed, so if I walk out of my car and into my apartment they’d be able to tell which one is mine, even though they can’t see my door. I’ve never caught them staring or looking at me other than what I thought was a passing glance.

30,"Little background story, I moved in with my S.O. and his parents when I was 19. I’m now 21. His parents were great at first but after about 8 months something happened in their life. I don’t know what but his dad went through a major depressive episode. Ever since then they’ve been drinking between them two about 12 beers a night. In under 4 hours because they go to bed earlyish. 

My S.O. never really drank THAT much but since then he started drinking more too. He told himself and me that he’d never turn into them as in drinking every night and making it a habit. Well you guessed it, it happened. He started getting into the habit of drinking every single night. Some nights he won’t drink but he goes right back to it. 

Every single night his parents are drunk, every single night my boyfriends drunk. The house is now piled with beer cans, his parents have no incentive to clean. They go to work, come home drink, make a very unhealthy dinner, and go to bed. I lost my job that I had for over a year and have been out of work for 6 months trying to find a job still. But the thing is I clean every single day, I clean up everyone’s mess, I clean the kitchen everyday. If I don’t clean the kitchen one day. They leave the mess until it piles up into a huge mess until I do it. They always complain about how I never clean but they don’t remember me cleaning because they’re drunk. 

They always complain about how I need to do more around the house and start picking up the slack because they’re working all day. You know I can understand I don’t work, I should clean. And I do. But they don’t do anything, I get no help from his parents. I feel like a maid rn. My boyfriend helps me a lot but I’m mostly the one to do it. And every week they talk to us about “this weeks the week, we’re not going to drink. We’re going to get our life back on track”. It never happens, I’ve been hearing for months about how they’re going to stop and then the next day they walk in with a 24 pack. The cycle continues. 

The cycle also continues with my boyfriend and he’s not even 21 yet!! My boyfriend drink about 8 or 9 a night. He’s been telling me how he wants to stop and I’m like great I’m so excited. Because I get excited, I feel happy for him. And then he’s like “eh screw it I can have a few beers tonight it’s not going to hurt anything” IT HURTS ME!! 

I’ve gotten so many empty promises from all of them, and it hurts so much to feel like things are going to change when they aren’t. My boyfriend and I can never have a conversation about it because he doesn’t like it that he’s an alcoholic. So whenever he mentions it basically all I can do is say “nice” because if I say anything else he gets a little hurt. I’ve asked how I can help him get his mind off of drinking and he says he doesn’t need help. He just needs me to be here for him. I am here for him but I’m starting to resent everytime he tells me he’s going to stop because I know it’s not true. And right now I just cleaned the house for 3 hours and it’s still massively dirty. I have to deal with probably not eating dinner until 9pm, and get to hang out with my drunk boyfriend. 

I don’t know how much longer I can take this, I’m starting to get upset and I’m about to lash out on my boyfriend but if I do he’ll feel sad. If I even get mad at him he’ll be super upset. So how am I supposed to do “nothing” when I’m hurting from this and getting really resentful? 

Guys what do I do? I can’t talk to anyone about this because they don’t want anyone knowing about their alcoholism (aka my family) I can’t talk to my family about it because they’ll end up disliking my boyfriend and parents more than they already do. Ugh.",31Jan2020,1

32,Hi I'm Josh aged 13 and well I'm on a really bad life path at the moment I smoke (tobacco and weed) I drink and will probably end up doing harder drugs I'm always sad and lonely even though I have lots of friends my parents don't even care about the stuff I do and I feel like no one cares about me.,31Jan2020,1

34,"I think I’ve been emotionally abused by my dad but I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve considered leaving them for good when I’m 18 but I feel like I have a responsibility to take care of them, and I’d also feel awful because they still love me and I’d feel like everything is my fault.

My dad crosses my boundaries and when I tell him he’ll mock me or tell me that I can’t live like that. I don’t like being touched period, that means hugs, kisses, etc. I’ve told him this countless times but he never listens. He’ll take my phone or get mad at me until I let him kiss my forehead. I know it’s probably not a big deal but it really upsets me because I feel like I have to appease him. He can walk all over my boundaries and I can’t say anything without getting punished.

He gets mad at me for little things once when I was 13 I was at a friends house and I made my mom wait a little too long to go home, however my mom never motioned or called me to go home. He yelled at me telling me that he didn’t like my friends and I needed new ones. When I started crying he mocked me. I ran to the bathroom because that’s the only place I can get away from him and he followed me all the way there and glared at me when I left.

We were at a Chinese restaurant and he kept taking pictures of me without me knowing. At the time I was super self conscious about my looks and I was really upset. I told him to stop 2 or 3 times but he continued to do it. I eventually got really mad and took his phone and deleted all the pictures. He got really mad at me and demanded that I gave him my phone I tried to explain that I felt like my privacy was being violated but he told me that I violated his privacy by going into his phone. He wouldn’t even look at me for the rest of the night.

I told my mom once that I didn’t want to go to church because I didn’t know if I believed in god. My dad took away all my electronics yelled at me and left me home alone for 3 hours. When he got back he lectured me about how I was going to go nowhere in life and how I was heading for a brick wall. He threatened me with making me move schools. Essentially separating me from my friends. He eventually gave me my computer back because I was apparently too annoying.

He constantly need me to tell him I love him or hug him or talk to him or else he’ll guilt trip me into doing it. When I get home from school I don’t want to talk to anyone because I’m an introvert and I’m drained. He’ll say things like “you don’t love me” or “at least I love you” or “I wish you loved me”

There’s more of these instances but that’s how things usually go down. I feel like I’m always walking on eggshells with him. Whenever I see him I get super anxious and defensive and he gets mad at me for that. I feel like this is all somehow my fault. I want to get away from him so bad I want to cut all contact with him so bad but I can’t help but feel like I’d be a horrible person if I did that",31Jan2020,0

They've charged off and today I received mail from state attorneys saying my county has filed a lawsuit or wage garnishment against me. The amount in debt is only $1,700 and I have not received a summons.

Few weeks ago i made a party and well she was also there. And i was drunk she was drunk and i told her or someone else did i dont really remember it. But the next thing i know is that she was laying in my arm and we kissed and it was just so good... to good unfortunaly. So the next day in school she tells me she really likes me she likes my character and she thinks i look good. But then she told me in the face that she likes a guy from my class more than me and finds him way more attractive. I asked who and well he is a piece of shit, he may be musculous but his character is extremly bad and he doesnt like her. That hurt alot because i gave my best and tried so fucking hard all this fucking time. So on that party, well i thought she may... like me or something. I just ask me all the time, was it my fault was it because i was together with her girlfriend 2 years ago or why why cant she fucking like me. It just fucking hurts i wanted her so bad and i thought she was the one. I mean if someone saw her they probably wouldnt say wow shes beautiful, she has neither big breasts or a big ass but i dont care, to me shes perfect, perfect character, face, body, humour... And im just curious if she ever liked me, to the time where i didnt really notice her, befor we became friends...

Why is love so fucking hard, why cant she just fucking love me back? 

Its about 4 weeks ago when i told her and i cant even fucking sleep. I have school in 3 hours and havent sleept because i fucking cant.

43,"One of my closest friends of 3-4 years confessed their love for me a few weeks ago. I knew that they had a crush on me for a long time, and it was not news to me. This friend also has schizophrenia, and serious mental health issues. So I do my best to keep that in mind.

They used to be in a four year long relationship with someone they didn’t love. And I had to hear how much they wanted to leave and all the bullshit for three of those years. They finally ended it a few months ago. 

My friend told me they never loved anyone like me before, even when they were in that long relationship, they were really in love with me, not their partner. And when they told me all of this, they started crying, and said that they know I would never pick them over my current partner. Ever since then I have this sick feeling in my stomach.

I can barely think about being around them, or talking to them, or asking for anything. Because I know they would do everything and anything for me without hesitation. They say that being friends with me is enough, but when I tell you I’m their only friend. I mean it. I’m literally their only friend, besides the ex thats always around. 

About four days ago they asked me to hangout, and I denied politely. And then at 5 am the next morning the sent this long paragraph saying they think “our spark” has faded and they want to know if they did anything to ruin our friendship. I didn’t want to hurt them so I just told them I was going through something and needed space. 

But ever since then, they message me once a day trying to spark a conversation or send me something. I know it all means well, but when I said I wanted space I actually fucking meant it. I had to put them on mute, and I’ve basically ghosted them at this point because I don’t know how to reply. I got another message about 20 minutes ago “i hope youre okay”. 

We’ve been friends for so god damn long, and they know more about me then anyone else ever has. So I’m so hesitant to end our friendship over something like this. But I cannot help how I feel, I don’t want to be around them. I can’t see past this, and it makes me really uncomfortable. I really just want to be left alone.  What do I do without hurting them?

I have tried EVERYTHING. I downloaded a white noise app to my phone since I can't afford an actual one and I play it every night. I've even played it on my ipad AND my iphone to block out the sound. I've gotten earplugs. I've tried making noise to wake my roomate up so she switches position. I've tried actually talking to her and she bought nose strips. I've tried going to sleep before her and taking melotonin to help me fall asleep quicker and stay asleep. NONE OF IT WORKS. I am averaging about 3-4 hours of sleep a night.

47,"so my friend, let’s call him avery, used to make fun of me last year. he would make fun of my art, call me annoying, put his hands around my neck without consent (i was too scared to stop him),etc

now at the time, i remember feeling terrible at myself. i couldn’t tell if he was joking or not... i told my friend about all of this, cause she knew him, causing her to dislike him. she told me she told her other best friend, who figured out it was avery. i still feel guilty-i shouldn’t have dragged her into it. i also told some of my close guy friends (bad idea, i don’t think i did, but my goal was never to kill his reputation.) 


**note that i only told my friends cause i wanted advice**


i told my parents and they made me cut him off from my main instagram. anyways, i have a few instagram accounts, so i still occasionally talked to him. he seemed to be way nicer, and i’d see him in the halls at school-and he acted completely different. 

he no longer makes fun of the things he used to-or anything really. he actually said my drawings are good, that i’m not annoying, etc!! 

we played minecraft today, and it was really fun. he called me his friend, which was something he had never done before. 

i cant help but think i’m in the wrong-i mean IM the one who shat on his reputation, i was probably being overdramatic??? anyways, he’s changed. i actually like hanging out with him.

but my parents still hate him. they think he’s just reeling me in, but i truly think that any other time i said that he was being nice i wasn’t 100% sure. now i am.

54,"* I did not want to go to college, I wanted to be a firefighter // *My parents bullied me and said because I am a woman I would never be a real firefighter, that I would be raped by my fellow firemen, that I would never be strong enough and that I would let people down and cause their deaths, that I would burn alive in a fire and die young.*

&amp;#x200B;

* I said fine, I'll go to college. My parents said they were not going to pay for any of it, but my grandmother did. However, my mom said that even though my grandmother was paying the full cost - I should still take out all the student loans offered to me. Me - being really stupid - listened to my mom when she said to take literally any and all loans that my school would give me - without reading or looking into any of it - because ""the government will never give you this amount of money again"" // *I now have 20K+ debt in my name and only a 2-year degree, and even though I wanted to take a break this semester I cannot because I can't afford to pay back my student loan payments yet.*

&amp;#x200B;

* I am quiet and reserved, but I still decided to major in business administration at school // *My mom said I will be a bad manager because I am not charming and extroverted like my dad - which are the only qualities that make a good manager supposedly.*

&amp;#x200B;

* I wanted to be a DoorDash driver, or a dishwasher, because I cannot hold down a regular job due to my  extreme social anxiety (Yes I'm medicated already), and I have major trouble holding down a job and going to school at the same time (I usually fail my courses) // *My parents said no - that dishwashing was for people who can't speak English, and I can't be a DoorDash driver because a Dasher one town over was murdered at 2 AM during a robbery (I would be working during the day, and I even offered to get my concealed carrier permit). And our town is safer than 70% of all cities in the US. I now have a hostessing job because they want me to be more social and I am very depressed and upset - even though nothing bad happens I come home and cry.*

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't want to listen to my mom talk about how she hates my dad and about their suffering marriage and them talking about divorce, and how she wants to commit suicide// *She says that I want her to suffer in silence, that I'm siding with him, that because I'm her daughter she deserves to have someone to vent to.*

&amp;#x200B;

* When I was 19 and tried going out on Tinder dates, etc. // *My dad tracked me on my iphone, threatened to take my car away, threatened me with physical violence, and said I could move out of his house if I was going to be seeing boys (that he or my mom did not pick for me)*

&amp;#x200B;

* I am not allowed out at night, not even for classes or for work. Whenever I try to do something, my dad just says no because he loves to control people. My mom says ""Why would I send my 3 year old out at night"". I am 22F, but she said she still sees me as a 3 year old.

There's so much more. But basically, my parents are very very toxic. I have no autonomy and they have no desire for me to be independent while I am under their roof. They have both expressed feelings of not wanting me to ever leave them, they never want me to leave the house, they never want me to get married (And they mean until they die).

I have so much student debt that I really cant just up and leave, and I have no work experience because my parents say that any job that I want (due to my social anxiety) is off limits.

Any attempt to make myself more independent or autonomous leads to threats of physical violence or homelessness, and I have NOWHERE to go. At all.

I also get confused because my parents deny being toxic and tell me that it is all in my head and that I'm too sensitive, and so whenever they say anything to me I ""twist it"" into them being bad when really they're great people and do everything in my best interest (I obviously know this is a lie but it causes me to doubt myself - should I even fight back against them if they're doing all this just to try and help me?).

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**I do not know what to do. I feel very trapped. I am trapped with my parents, and any attempt for me to become autonomous is squashed. They deny being toxic. I am 22F, and still treated like I am 14.  No amount of arguing will get them to change their minds. They like being in control and having power.

56,"Quick backstory:
Girl and I met senior year in Fall 2018, got together in March 2019. We were together for the rest of senior year and over the summer. I left for college in August, she left in September. Long distance, time zone difference, and new stress of college life ended our relationship. She pulled the trigger. We agreed to still be friends. In the following weeks I was shattered and made a fool of myself by pouring my heart out after things were already over and she doesn’t care anymore.

So now:
We broke up 4 months ago. I haven’t talked to her, but I consistently have vivid daydreams where I have conversations with her. I imagine all the things I wanna do with her over the summer, but then I realize it’s unreasonable and I have school to worry about right now.

The problem is that I need to be focused on school, but I don’t know why I keep getting distracted and think about my ex, especially when our relationship’s been dead and there’s no use worrying about it. I’m so distracted that it takes me about 2.5 times longer to take notes on class readings than it used to.

Now I'm basically stuck with enough cash coming in to support the very very basic needs but it'll never get me close to financially free.

   A little bit of background on me. I’m a foster care child (soon to be adopted), my psych eval says that my IQ is 130, I’m a sophomore in high school. 

    My grades are mediocre, although my test scores are very high (or so I’ve been told.) In math, however, I’m painfully stubborn and not that smart in the subject. I hate it when my family tells me there’s no reason I can’t pass or even get an A in it, but there is. I’m not good at math. 

   I’m diagnosed with Schizotypal Personality Disorder, which distracts me enough from my classes, but my math class in particular. Mainly because the teacher, to put it clearly, is very unlikable and should probably get fired. She tells the class about who had sex with who, will slut shame certain students in front of the whole class, etc. She’d let this boy in our class. He’d call kids “faggot” and rip their stuff. Therefore, she was told he wasn’t allowed in the classroom anymore. What does she do? Have him climb through the window. 

   I don’t get along with her, and I can’t concentrate in that class at all. She’d constantly try to report me over “violent” pictures I’d draw on my tests. But she never keeps other students who aren’t in the class from coming in and just screaming at other kids. I have a 27% F and a D for the first semester. One reason is because I’m very stupid and lazy, the other is that I hate the teacher so much I refuse to give her anything because I don’t respect her. 

     The office called my mom and told her that they’re “afraid” I might fail the class, and that it’ll affect my graduation. My mom’s upset, as she takes education and college very seriously, (she’s a teacher) and constantly compares me to her birth children, as their successful adults. But, here’s the thing: I think it’s too late for me. I didn’t have good grades last year, so I don’t think any colleges are going to want me anyway. She told me that freshman grades mattered, so if they do, then I don’t know why I should really try anymore. 

   I think she’s lost all hope for me, as she’s been telling my younger brother about how much money college with give you and stuff like that. I think she’s hoping my brother will turn out better than me. I’m afraid that without college I’ll never become successful. I’m scared that my life will be miserable and that even if I have a job, I’ll be barely hanging on. I’ve thought about just finding a wife or even husband who’s older than me, with more money. I wouldn’t be using them for it, but I think that will at least give me a purpose. Looking after children? I’ve also thought about just killing myself if I know that college will get impossible to go to. Maybe write a book? I don’t know. Is it too late for me?",31Jan2020,2
63,"I blurred out any crucial information that may give away locations and my school regarding this post.             

Anyway, we were given a [contract](https://imgur.com/a/f4pc5Az) to which we are required to sign, but after reading the contents, I'm a bit wary as it may change my experience within the school. I belong to a special class that includes experimental research unlike the regular classes where it is only required depending on their strands. With the mention of college within the contract, I'm quite confused as to why they would require junior highschool students (I am in 9th grade) to sign a contract that reflects the college years. I don't even plan attending college in the said school as I plan on taking forensics (which is unavailable and rather, an uncommon course in my country).

**Short Rant:** I believe that this contract is suddenly published just because my school is getting established as an international school and university, thus why they have started putting out all these new policies and requirements to make it seem like the school is creating lots of achievements, when the truth is that many of their students are actually suffering from massive workloads, to which they reason that ""students spend too much time on their electronics rather than prioritise their responsibilities."" I beg to differ though, with experimental research, mandatory projects, school competitions, upcoming exams and homework all stacked up together, even the the most productive student is struggling to keep up with these surges of requirements that older student batches never had to handle with. We do have better resources due to the help of open resources such as Internet, but we are never given better time stamps to even comply. 

I don't want to sign it or show it off to my parents just yet. I need to think about it before even signing a short contract that may possibly (horribly) affect me academically.",31Jan2020,1

Always wanted a tattoo but was always dangerously too poor the last 5 years for anything but the bare essentials. Taking care of my sick mother and getting little brother through high school. 

All I have is the internet to learn how to improve my art skills. 

I have always wanted tattoos and piercings since I was a little kid. Grew up in Texas so i was convinced by my environment for awhile it wasn’t worth it to get them. I was mistaken. 

I’m begging any of you for guidance and tips as it’s deadly obvious I have a disadvantage for the art I should have learned. Seriously bad even compared to the tattoo artist looser standards.
I don’t have any experience with good shading in the last time I tried to paint it looked like toon link
I also can’t freehand for the life of me yet or do time trials for fast drawling

Here are some examples

Is it’s even worth it to dedicate three hours a day every single day to getting better at drawing for the sake of becoming a tattoo artist someday? If I took it seriously do you think I have promise?",31Jan2020,1

68,"Here's the situation, I was working at my company,(A), everyone I knew there was leaving, finding better jobs, better paying jobs, it was the cool thing to do. I tried to stick it out, but eventually found another job, similar work, making 25% more. ( yes company A was underpaying me)  
Company B starts off super awesome, making more money, but eventually the job/work/people/customer just SUCKS. Caused severe depression, health issues. I was not well.  
Magically my old boss from Company A asks if Id come back, at higher/matched salary. (this is a life line) Of course I say yes. I am grateful. Things are nice.  
Fast forward 6 months, all the customer and corporate issues that sortof pushed me away are starting to bother me again.   
Out of no where, literally unsolicited, a recruiter from Company C (never encountered before) has this smoking hot 60% increase. Yes this is real money, above the 6 figure range. Job sounds good, benefits great, shorter commute.

The problem. I really like my boss, he welcomed me back to company A when i needed it. I feel like I owe them more than 6 months. I am 99% sure if I leave again, this is good bye, bridge burned. No turning back. Also apart of the equation, I was just not selected for a manager position, doesn't bother me, but the guy that was selected is a D-bag.

70,"I'm 19 years old and off at university. Last summer I met up several times with my secret long-distance boyfriend. He came to my town and we stayed in a hotel together. We fooled around, went to restaurants or museums, walked around the town. My parents had no idea that I was with a boy and in a hotel - they thought I was at my friend's house.

It's been several months since summer now, and it's still bothering me that they don't know. I feel guilty. I broke up with him when summer ended, cried for a month straight, and was really scared about stds cause he didn't want to get tested and I've had sex with him. I couldn't talk about any of this with my parents.

Do they have to know everything that went on? That I was sexual with that guy, that I slept with him in a hotel? That I wanted to get tested for stds? I was 18 back then, so I was of legal age.

82,"A few weeks ago I gathered all of my terrarium tanks and supplies to post on OfferUp because I had no need for them as my animals outgrew them. I was alone at my mom's house gathering up everything and posting it up.y sister happened to stop by and saw a particular tank I had posted. She got excited and said she could use the tank for her her son's (my nephew) pet snake since it would escape regularly from the tank she already had. I told her I had the item posted for $150, but since she really needed it (and it would make me feel good to help my nephew out) I told her I would sell it to her and have her only pay $100 since it's in the family (being nice). She was grateful and said she would pay me the very next day and if I wasn't able to pick it up then she would leave the money in an envelope on the counter at our mom's. 

The next day I went over and didn't find the money so I called her and she said she was sorry that she wasn't able to make it over.  I told her it was ok and I'll see about getting the funds the next day. I texted her the next day asking if she had it and she said she didn't. She needed the money for gas and whatnot. I was a bit irritated at this point because I wasn't just idly selling things for the hell of it; I needed some cash. I thought it would be convenient for me to get the money almost immediately from her than waiting on OfferUp for a response, and also I would be helping out family. I thought it was a win-win. I didn't really respond to her message. I think I just said, ""ok"". 

I waited another week and asked her when she thinks I will be getting the money. She promptly sends me a picture text with what looked like a bank statement with her funds being in the negative pretty much telling me (or showing me) that she doesn't have the money and that's she's actually broke and won't get paid until that Thursday. I don't know what to say at this point, but I told her I needed that money because I was struggling myself and although I understand she may be broke I was expecting the money she promised. I didn't get a message back. Since then I saw on Instagram that she was in LA at a monster truck show with her sons. I asked my mom that she claimed to be broke, but can drive up to LA for such an event. My mom told me that the event was courtesy of her Job (they gave her tickets to go). Even if that's the case, she would still had to pay gas, food and whatnot for herself and kids. So in my eyes she wasn't broke. 

I don't know how to approach this with her. Do I keep asking? Do I just forget about it and never do business with family again? I feel at this point it's just the principle. Pay me the money you owe. I don't dare take the tank back, it's not my nephew's fault.",31Jan2020,1

Since this mark will go to university, my parents are super angry, and they want to go to my school tomorrow to talk to my biology teacher to give me a higher mark. However, 88% is consistent with my term marks. I previously received an 88 on my midterms, and my mark had actually dipped after midterms and my exam mark brought it up. I have severe anxiety and I don't want my parents to coerce my teacher into giving me a higher mark for several reasons. 1) I don't think this coercion will work. My parents are from India, where ""arguing"" for marks is a thing, but where I live now, most teachers get upset when you do that. 2) The teacher will be teaching me next semester, and I don't want to tick him off in case he marks me down for the next course I take with him. 3) I don't really deserve a better mark, but my parents are so entitled that they think I should get on because I had the flu during my exam.

I was used to it at that time so I never really cared or told anyone. So, I know for a fact that she is abusive at least to some extent. My niece and I grew up together so we're really close and she tells me everything. Today I went over to her house for the first time in awhile, and for no clear reason her mom started screaming at her, calling her retarded and worthless while she was crying and saying ""I know"".
That is wrong. I don't care who you are or what your child did, if you're saying that to them then you're absolutely not fit to be a parent.

Anyway, her mom grounded her and took every single source of communication from her, and on top of that saying she's going to take her door off it's hinges. Her mom left for awhile with no explanation while my niece cried for hours. She told me she cuts herself and doesn't want to live. She asked me to stay the night because she was scared but I couldn't. I immediately tried calling CPS but they're closed so I'll try tomorrow. I called my mom, but like mother like daughter. She doesn't want to believe her angel crotch goblin would ever do anything wrong, despite calling my niece a ""shitty child"" and ""a fucking idiot"" right in front of her. 

My sister also *openly cheats on her boyfriend in front of my niece. He is the nicest guy on this planet and as much as I want to tell him, she told me to keep my mouth shut. She's gone as far as having loud sex with her child in close proximity. (I think when she was about 9)

I told her to tell someone about this but she's scared of what her mom will do to her. If I somehow get her taken away I'll be resented by her whole family forever.
I also gave her the option of living with me when she turns 16, but I don't want her psychologically damaged any more than she is now. She genuinely believes she's stupid and worthless.

She is now home alone with that god awful excuse for a human being, and who knows what's happening to her. What can I do about this? I'm not just going to let this happen.

I met the guy I like about 2 or 3 months ago. I'm really not sure if he likes me back. We don't talk as much as I'd like to (but I'm a little shy too..). When we do talk, (ususally once a day at school, some days a good amount of interaction, some very little) he seems really nervous, and he starts getting clumsy (dropping things, making mistakes, walking into doors). He also smiles at almost everything when we're together. I find it so cute, but I'm not sure if he's just doing these things because he's nervous that I'm a girl... (and it has nothing to do with liking me.) 


The reason I say this, is because in my trade school program, I'm the only girl there. So the only comparison I have is when I see him talk to other guys. He seems more confident, and doesn't fidget or get clumsy. Maybe he's just more comfterable around them?


I'm pretty sure he looks at me quite a lot, but I feel like I'm imagining it, because I like him. I just can't tell if he feels the same way, or I just make him nervous because I'm a girl... please help? :)",31Jan2020,1

96,"  

So, what started out as a nice friendship between me (26M) and my coworker (27M) has evolved into a huge crush. He is openly gay and has said in the past that he is not interested in dating coworkers. I agree with him, however the feels I have for him will not go away. Also, he is currently dating other men and I don’t think he is interested in me. I think that he is oblivious to the fact that I have a crush on him. 

The advice I’m asking for is: Would it be a good idea to tell my coworker about my feels for him or should I keep this to myself?

I have wrestled with this problem for a while now. I keep flip-flopping on which action I should take. I value honest and I think that you should be honest to the people around you. Even if I tell him the truth, I’m going to keep our business relationship strictly, professional. However, I’m afraid that if I tell him the truth, then I would be making our relationship awkward. I just don’t want to jeopardize our friendship. Also, I don’t what this to impact our abilities to work in the office. 

I don’t know how to control these feels for him and I desperately what to tell him. But I’m afraid that this could backfire.

100,"Say there is a group of people living in a boarding home (or a similar setup). This communal home has a small, cozy communal area where people work on their laptops, eat, drink etc.

Now, at this boarding home, there are residents who do not wear deodorants and as a result of that, they - naturally - emit body odor.

Let's say one of the residents covertly covered their nose and mouth with their scarf whenever they used the communal area when the ones that had body odor were there.

Let's say the ones that don't wear deodorants noticed this action and got offended, thinking of the ones that covered as arrogant, pompous and full of themselves (based solely on that action). And that should they find the smell offensive, they should stay in their dorm and not use the communal area, instead of being disrespectful in front of them by putting their scarf on their mouth/nose (a gesture done by conspicuously resting your hand with the scarf over your face, covering your mouth and nose).

103,"Hello,

I'll start by saying how stupid I am. I made a huge mistake and now I am an anxious wreck.

I had orientation just this past Wednesday for a mental health support worker job. I just graduated in August and have been trying to get into the mental health field. This is not the career I want, but it is a great stepping stone to where I want to be. I got a casual position for this company and therefore I sign up for days that I can work, and they schedule me accordingly. The woman doing the orientation said ""The days you sign up for, expect to work them. You're not just giving us your availability, you are signing up for specific days to work and you could end up working all of the days you signed up for"". I signed up for 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, and I think one week I put that I'd work 6.

I don't know why I did this. I've been out of work since August. I work 2 days a week at Subway and have been living with my grandmother since my relationship went to the shits. I've been extremely anxious to get working, and I just got ahead of myself and was extremely impulsive. Even when I gave the lady my availability, she said ""Look at this.. You're going to regret that"". I could punch myself in the face.

Now, the job hasn't started yet. I still have to complete a couple courses before I can officially start working. The last course will be complete next Wednesday and they said we will be working right away. I'm thinking, maybe I could e-mail someone there and just say ""hey, I've made a horrid mistake"", but I really don't know how that will come across and I do not want to give the wrong impression of me. I am at a loss. I'm a nervous wreck about the job to begin with, as I have never been a care worker in any way, and I will be thrown into caring for dependent people who have issues that I can hardly comprehend at this time.

106,"Okay so let me give you the run down of my situation:

I am a dude that just started high school and about a 1/3 of my middle school class came with me to this particular high school.

There are two girls that came with me and I have known them for years. We got really close in 7th and we used to talk all the time. Let’s call them Abby and Claire.

In the span of 2 months (Sept. - Oct.) I managed to get a homecoming date, get a girlfriend, and have her break up with me and then me “accidentally” talk shit about said girl. Truth be told, I honestly really had no idea I was talking shit about her.
But this homecoming girl became friends with Abby and Claire. Which meant, after I talked shit, they immediately accused me of doing so and stopped talking to me.
Flash forward to December. I decide to individually apologize to each of them and earn back my trust with Abby and Claire but not with the homecoming girl.

Now flash forward to present day.

Nothing feels the same as it did. Abby and Claire never talk to me, if I’m lucky I’ll get to say hi to one of them. I always see them with a bunch of other guys and it just pains me that I was just... replaced. I was a good friend too. Always remembered their birthdays, I talked to them with every chance I got, listen to them cry over the phone and talk them through things; hell, once I even stayed out at an 8:30 track practice with one of them on my SICK DAY just so they weren’t alone.

118,"Hi,  


I am a white guy in my 20's. I noticed one day that everywhere I went there were rooms full of people looking down at the almighty pocket rectangle instead of interacting with each other. I was already using a flip phone and nine out of ten times it gave me a notification it was spam, so I decided I'd be better off without it. This seemed to come as a shock to a lot of my social connections - some of them were even upset with me (despite the fact that they never used my cellphone number to contact me). I told the few people who did contact me regularly to just e-mail me instead, as I check my e-mail from my PC once or twice a day.  


I knew some people would be unhappy with my decision, but I didn't expect this much of a negative reaction. Am I crazy to have done this? Should I be worried that I won't be able to form bonds with people as easily, since I'll have to tell them ""sorry, I don't have a cell phone""? The cute remarks I got for having a dumbphone were bad enough before, but from what I've seen so far, I've all but alienated myself from everyone around me.  


What should I do, if anything? Is there a better story I can tell people about why I don't have a cellphone, instead of being truthful with them that I'm disgusted with how people tend to use them?  


You know, I don't actually think smartphones etc. are evil. I'm sure there are some people out there who could use them without being consumed by them, but I'm not such a person. And neither are most people I know.",31Jan2020,1

121,"I did a terrible thing at work, that's criminal, and need to change.

The PI at my research lab developed a terrible brain condition. He said yes to everything people asked. I was looking for a job. A family friend asked him if I could work there, as a way to expose me to the research field and help me with my grad school decision.

He said yes, and told everyone to train me and help me figure out what to do for grad school.

This is a lab with its own grants, cures for cancer, projects, and deadlines. With people with these agendas. Asked to use its resources and people to train someone not even qualified for the position, for their grad school decision.

I didn't previously study in the field at all.

I didn't really understand, going in, how messed up all of this was. And I wasn't informed about it. It only seemed like people were pissed at me and didn't want to train me.

One of the students at the lab was doing her phd project, alone, because the PI had this brain condition and couldn't help her. She was afraid she wouldn't be able to graduate on time because she had to do this project alone. And she didn't know what would become of her future.

The other manager had 2 years to get a grant or else she'd have to leave the lab and wouldn't know where her future was.

I should have just left after hearing all of this. But for some reason it just didn't register. I felt I could just train myself and not be a bother to them. I tried to educate myself on all the techniques and learn everything independently.

Despite this, they didn't assign me anything. I did a whole lot of sitting around doing nothing. And they were annoyed.

4 months later the director of the department agreed to put me on his project. A publication, with funding, with a grant and huge deadlines.

I tried to do the project for a month but everyone was really, really pissed. My coworker pulled me to the side one day, and said they both have been correcting my mistakes for this past month. I've been a huge liability, causing them to have to worry about me a ton and dragging down their productivity. If I continue on this project it's going to be a huge drag on them when their futures aren't secure already.

The considerate thing to do would be to leave.

So, I told the supervisor who assigned me this project that I couldn't do it, and I would be resigning from this position.

He got really, really pissed. You can't just ask someone for a project, they take the time to assign it to you, it's part of a grant with huge deadlines, they wait on you for a month, and then you just decide on your own without asking first, that you can't do it, and leave.

You're supposed to give two weeks notice before leaving, but he didn't even want that. He emailed the hiring person and told them I'd be leaving tomorrow.

This can't happen again. It needs to change. And I have no idea how I'm going to be able to hold a job at all or be a contributing member of society, when I've been acting this way for so many years.

If anyone has had experience with this, or knows how to change, please feel free to let me know. All opinions welcome.",31Jan2020,1

she has very protective parents, shit her parents dont even know about me. if she were to be pregnant, shed be dead. her period shouldve came on or around the 25th but today is the 30th. she has been getting cramps and sore boobs on and off. i plan on maybe buying a test over the weekend and giving it to her monday the 3rd. yes ive read all the comments on other posts similar to mine about delayed periods and ""waiting to panic after the test"".

&amp;#x200B;

I am the lady, J my friend is A the guy.

We were FWB for a long time. 3 years. We stopped sleeping together a month and some change ago. I was going through some personal problems so I didn't speak to him for about a week. He did contact me but I kept the convo short. I had not verbally confirmed that I no longer wanted to stop sleeping with him but about a week later he asked if I wanted to come over &amp; I told him ""No. I don't want to have sex anymore"" Unfortunately I made the very very unwise choice of continuing to sleep with him overtime &amp; catching feelings. I care about him alot and I had a hard time emotionally unlatching from him because we had slept together so long. He always made it clear that he did not want a relationship. When I made my intentions of no longer having sex I was fully prepared to never talk to him again. I do know that he has feelings for me. but the relationship willingness is not there. To be clear

&amp;#x200B;

I was never led on. when I did discuss my feelings for him he told me he had feelings but he does not want a relationship. Once I got the courage to stop having sex I respected his wishes and no longer brought my feelings up to him. Surprisingly to me, he didn't even say ""ok"" after I told him I didn't want to have sex. He continued the conversation normal as ever &amp; just asked me how my day was going.

&amp;#x200B;

for the last few weeks we have been talking everyday. If I don't contact him for a day or so..he would text me. Just regular friend stuff, small talk, how are you [feeling. Now](https://feeling.Now) last week, we were texting &amp; he said ""I wish I would have gotten to know you better before we had sex"" ""down the line I thought you would become mean but you really are a sweet person &amp; im so sorry I had made those assumptions about you. Not wanting to entertain anything for the sake of my feelings I said ""thank you"" and kept it moving. He did say more that I'll include. I changed the subject because I now he does not want to be with me so I refuse to get my hopes up. Now, this is where my problem lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

about an hour ago we were texting &amp; he asked what my plans for the weekend were. I told him I was going out to dinner on friday &amp; saturday I am taking my brother out for his bday. He said this

&amp;#x200B;

A-Oh okay. Enjoy your dinner date!

me-Its not a date, just a little outing with a few friends, like a little ladies night.its been forever &amp; work has been so annoying lol its overdue

A-Oh you're having a ladies night that's lit! &amp; yeah I know you work a lot, you need to take a vacation/have a dinner date and enjoy yourself

me-lol yeah I know. The dinner will suffice for now. I'm just glad I get off early

A-Welp yall have a good time! I'm going out myself on saturday.

me-Oh ok. Whats saturday

A-idk my mans just asked me if I wanted to go to this gathering in Jersey, some big party

me-NY on saturday, followed by superbowl sunday. your week is fully booked I see have fun and of course be safe

A-Thanks and you have fun too! don't hold back &amp; I know you don't drink but still try to enjoy yourself

me-lol I don't hold back i'm just a calm person and its just dinner

A-well still enjoy yourself

me-I will &amp; thanks I appreciate the well wishes

A-No problem (insert my nickname)

&amp;#x200B;

Why the fuck would he tell me I need a date night when he knows my feelings for him. Maybe I want you to take me on a date you stupid idiot

I didn't respond because idk im annoyed and I wanna tell him its so pointless to do this friendly hey have a great day text me everyday like you're interested in me but never ask me to hang out you just wanna be text buddies and reddit readers I am very self aware &amp; I too am asking myself these questions.

&amp;#x200B;

""If you know he doesn't want to be in a relationship, why are you mad that he assumes you have a date, &amp; then when you clarify, he still says ""well you need a vacation/date night""

""he has been honest &amp; clear with you, he probably does like you but just because he likes you it doesnt mean he wants to hang out with you especially since you're fresh off of a fwb arrangement""

""It seems like you still have pretty strong feelings and you're expecting something from him that he has made clear that he doesn't want. A relationship""

&amp;#x200B;

im self aware of how stupid this post is. Im aware of how childish I sound. We talk the exact same way as we did when we we were messing around for so many years. I'm thinking maybe he still thinks we will have sex still because we have stopped and started again a few times over the years. but I'll add in some other things that he said both breaks my heart and confuses the shit out of me.

 THIS IS WHAT ELSE HE HAS SAID 

A-I'm not gonna lie you were so nice to me when we first met and I thought all those compliments and just texting me to say have a good day were because you had ill intentions of using me but I was wrong. You are such a sweet girl and I thought you had a boyfriend cause you just seemed so, idk, so sweet. Thats why at first I just treated it like it was fun sex at first, and even if you did I cant be mad at that.

&amp;#x200B;

also, why the fuck does he text me EVERY SINGLE DAY THROUGHOUT THE DAY if he doesn't want me. am I a friendship pillow that hes so comfortable with he can be friendly friendly with that he just fluffs me out and goes about his day. To be clear, we have went on dates before, we have done the whole cuddle stay up till 5 am talking about any and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

idk why im even asking for advice when I know the answer. I obviously should not be speaking to this man if I obviously have strong feelings for him. I am content with being friends, but it just feels so annoying cause I know he doesn't want a relationship as clear as he makes it. but I know the feelings are there, and I guess that's the tough thing to come to terms with...he has feelings for me..but he doesn't want to be with me. he never wanted too and he never will. I am not the woman he will end up with. He is 30. I am 26. I was 23 and he was 27 when we met. If he has not pursued me in any way of romance other than friendship or sex, his mind will not magically change over night. It is it going to happen but why do I still tear up every time I wanna ask him why do we do this whole fake friendly nonsense. Despite telling me his inner most fears, insecurities, his fear of getting hurt, having trouble believing my compliments, thinking of relationships as ""a loss of freedom"", texting me everyday but never asking to hang out....

&amp;#x200B;

HE DOES NOT WANT ME. Why am I putting myself through this emotional distress. I guess thsi post belonged in r/offmychest. Man you don't even need to give me advice. The harsh truth would be better.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish I could tell him "" I really miss you. alot. "" but that would serve me no good.

So I've lived in alot of places across Canada. I was born and raised on Vancouver Island. But went away for a number of years with the military. I was posted to the prairies, and when I left the military due to mental health stuff I moved to northern BC. I ended up falling in love with someone, she was everything, and in a way I feel like she still is. I had to move down to Victoria (my home town) to be closer to mental health resources as there wasn't much available in the northern BC town. Her and I ended up going through a rough patch but we worked it out. She remained up north and I lived in Victoria to work on myself. We would visit eachother and everything seemed to be working perfect. We had plans to marry, have children, buy a house have dogs. Everything. We had the 3 year plan. And then the relationship ended. A bit of both of our faults, but it ended and I think both of us are pretty destroyed. We don't talk anymore. Just like that. No more communication. And as soon as we broke up I had this feeling that nowhere feels like home. Absolutely nowhere. I can't see myself ever feeling comfortable anywhere. She felt like home, where she was would have been home. So in an attempt to find somewhere to just fit in, to feel comfortable, I gave away most of my stuff, packed up some boxes and loaded my truck up and drove across the country to PEI to stay with an old buddy from the military. But I can already tell this place isn't home either. So Reddit, where the fuck do I go from here. Honestly have been just debating moving to France and joining the French Foreign Legion.

What do I do, my grades are way too shitty to go to a decent college. I have no skills, no motivation and I’m considering dropping out to kill myself. If I go and get help and tell them I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, guess what? 5150ed. It’s not fair. I’m literally loosing my shit, none of my friends can help me, they are worried sick about me. And I just want help, and the problem is that the help available doesn’t work. Mental hospitals remove your freedom and if you don’t comply you get tranquilized, from what I’ve heard. I want to get tested for depression but I don’t want to worry my family.

I have a 2000 ford Explorer, I know I know fancy AF. this was a gift to me from my parents for my 18th birthday, I've had it ever since, I'm currently 22, almost 23. I invested a lot of money to get this car running and well, my parents think its time to let the car go and sell it for what I can get for it, what's currently wrong with it is its leaking oil from the motor and it's hitting the transmission on a joint and well it ate the seal, and to fix the leak and the seal, they need to remove the transmission which is a lot of work so I would mostly be paying labor if I decide to get it to fix. Now we also have another car, it was my father's old car, a 2014 ford fiesta that just needs a new motor and it will work. My parents suggested I sell the explorer and fix the fiesta since its a newer car and I would save a lot on gas. 

Now I am a sensitive person and have grown to love my car, I even have a name for it (i call him Gilbert) I have grown to have a strong affection to the car since it's been with me for almost 5 years, I really don't want to get rid of it, but I do need a new car.

Now my parents won't charge me anything for the fiesta I just have to fix it and its mine, so I would be getting a deal even needing to buy a motor for the car, which is around 1400.

146,"ALRIGHT. My boyfriend and I have been together for over 10 years. We have spoken about kids but never really determined when we wanted them (I was always skeptical and he always said not now). 

Well.. I'm pregnant. But wait that's not all!! His mom JUST passed away very unexpectedly and he was very close to her. He is very distraught and stressed and upset. She did not leave a will and there are A LOT of loose ends. She also lived about 5 hours away and we went up to help deal with things but I felt so unwell I came home early and left him up there. (That's when I found out).

I have been waiting to tell him until he gets back because I figure it should be done face to face, I've only known for a few days and he will be back in 2 days.. but I am torn up inside. It is horrible timing. He is so emotionally drained and is being pulled in so many directions. 

I'm a wrong to not tell him over the phone? Is this too much for someone to deal with? I'm making myself sick over this.",31Jan2020,1
147,"My dad happened to look up his name today and follow a thread. Someone posted links to an imgur post with dozens of our childhood photos. There were pictures of us outside our house (several with our street address on it), pictures of us in the bath when we were young, etc. Our whole families full names are listed on it and they narrowed down what street we live on as well as they're idea of what school we go to. They have links to suspected Twitter accounts, Instagram accounts, Facebook accounts. 

We know it has something to do with my younger sister based on the fact that the post seemed to be directly taunting her. The very last sentence is ""being a stupid egirl bitch isn't funny"". I know this was malicious but she has no clue who she's pissed off. It's been up for six days. How do we deal with this? We're scared and angry but mostly confused. I know it's not someone she knows in person since they got the highschool wrong and don't know our exact address. But we're at a loss for how to proceed. What should we do? How do we report this?",31Jan2020,1
148,"My fiancé and I have lived together since about June 2018. For all of 2019, I was the primary income. I made enough to where I could support us while my fiancé finished up his degree. I’m so proud to say he finished in December! 

My fiancé obviously made less than 4,000 and as I stated above, we did live together. I looked up some information and consulted a family friend who does taxes, and was told I could claim him as a dependent. Makes sense to me.

I had to get his social security number from his mom. Long story short, she flipped her lid and told me I can’t claim him because he is on her health insurance (we are both 23 years old.) I told her I didn’t think that was true because I am on my grandmas insurance (I was legally adopted.) after going back and forth, she basically starts begging me not to claim him because even with him, they still have to pay. Without him, they have to pay significantly more.

This isn’t fair to me. I’ve put in a lot of my time working to make ends meet for us. I’ve paid for everything the past year. I also want to establish we are getting married this year and they have not offered to help with any of it. She also stole money from us while we were on vacation over the summer. We have a long history of her being very manipulative and screwing us.

I know if I claim him, I will definitely get the money. The issue is her. This will start world war 3, and I know everyone will attack my fiancé and not necessarily myself. His mom gets everyone in his family to jump down his throat anytime anything happens and it really upsets him.

I feel like my hands are tied and I don’t know what to do. Do I file him and report her and take my chances? Do I let it slide?",31Jan2020,1
149, So I met this person and we became really close until the end of October. I heard from him once on Thanksgiving and didn’t hear a word until I messaged them on New Years. They said a family member had a heart attack at some point and weren’t messaging anyone else either because they were so upset. And no the family member didn’t die or anything though it was close and there wasn’t any approximate time when it happened. Now this person overworks themselves a lot and says so too. They also told me they were sick but working a lot and not taking any time off. They’re job is to transport disabled people. So this bothers me when before they had at least breaks between picking up and waiting to take the person back. I’m just bothered by having a person message me nearly everyday for a year and half and then die on me. Reddit please tell me what the hell I should do.,31Jan2020,1
150,"I have a medium frame, like not thin and not chubby, just the right type of body. But I really never felt great about it. When i was in highschool i was fairly slim, i like to eat and it never really bothered me if i eat too much since i stay slim.

At first i'm fine with it, i don't care if a lot of people started to notice and said things like ""you look/got fat"". But then things started to get really annoying, and it hurt my feelings most of the time. I now overthink a lot of what they said, picking what clothes to wear so my body frame isn't noticeable, and eating little as possible as i can. Food doesn't excite me anymore, i nearly cry if i think the food i ate is going to give me more weight. Every time i eat i'm close to throwing up. I swear i'm trying to stop myself, but i just couldn't, whenever i see my body in the mirror i don't like it and tell myself i'm disgusting.

He’s been nothing but supportive, however he gets extremely grouchy and hard to talk to. My dad barely survives on his income alone and is finding it extremely hard to pay for bills and food which is putting me in a situation where I’m in need of a job to help with food and save for college (were using what we had saved right now because his job is forcing him to take days off because they’re slow)

154,"Roughly seven years ago I started developing low self esteem. I was already low on self confidence from the different things that happened in my childhood and it only got worse through the years.

I was pretty much fine until I started taking interest in the opposite sex, that's when I started going downhill from comparing myself to everyone else.

That's when I started looking deeper at myself and noticing all the other things wrong with me.

 Like how limited my social skills are. I spend a lot of time with other people, and I see and speak with new people all the time especially since I started working and traveling. But yet I'm still the quiet one who doesn't always know what to say. And my ""friends"" are all at my work with their own lives so once work is over it's just me. That's kinda why I like to stay later than I need to at work, just so my alone time won't be as long per day.

The years have gone by, I'm 23 now, and nothing has changed except how I feel about myself. I feel worse. Because it feels like everyone is so much better than me. 

I started getting really depressed lately. Suicidal thoughts pass through my head on occasion, even though I know I don't have the guts to actually go through with any of them. I'm too scared to. Just because of what might come afterwards, and I know that things can't really be as bad as I think they are. There has to be something to look forward to.

People don't know that I think these things about myself. I hide it well. I'm sure they think everything is just fine. But of course I'm hating myself inside.

Some people I know have started trying to get me to setup a dating profile. I want to do it, but I can't for several reasons. I have to like myself before I can expect anyone else to, I'm afraid that people might think I'm better than I actually am and then it just end horribly, and of course I don't think I'm good enough for anyone. Everyone else is more attractive, if not in looks, then personality or both. And the slightest mistake on my bad days will make me feel like a complete failure at everything.

I can't go a day without these thoughts now. I've lost interest in almost everything, even my hobbies. Im always depressed come evening and night time, sometimes mornings but I forget about it all at work, thank God.

I lost my appetite a few months back and haven't been eating much anymore (that, people have started to notice but don't think much of.) I know I've got to be underweight for my age and height now, not severely but still underweight. I haven't even tried to weigh myself since it all. Kinda don't care, kinda afraid of what I'll see. Sometimes I'll feel hungry but just don't feel like eating.

I've just lost my drive, and what worries me is that if I don't beat this, then one day I'm probably not going to be strong enough to resist it anymore and I'm actually going to kill myself. Again, I reiterate, suicidal thoughts go through my head but I have no intention of going through with them.

Some days I'm strong enough to know that I'm blowing these things out of proportion and I shouldn't feel like that. But I'll quickly sink back down again.

I've tried some over the counter anti depressants and mood health pills, and it seemed to work for a few days. I felt really good and even confident about certain qualities about myself. But I must have developed a resistance to it because they stopped having as positive of an impact and now they are currently buried in one of the cabinets.

I'm getting a new doctor soon because my old one retired, and I'm debating whether or not to bring all of this up when I meet him or her. I want to because I just want any help I can get, but then again I probably won't because it might just be seen as some kind of plea for attention or an attempt to get drugs since some people do that.

Again maybe it's just me being self conscious.

I've probably had about three mood swings while typing this out. I was almost okay, halfway through, now I'm down again. 

I just don't know. I can't envision myself as good enough for anyone, no matter how bad I'd like to be. My life is rushing by, and I'm letting it go on without me. I'm going to miss so much, gonna miss everything cause I'm stupid.

I don't want to post this right now. I want to delete everything and slap myself on the forehead and just go to bed. But I'm not going to do that. I'm gonna post it no matter how it sounds because I just need help. I obviously fail to get better on my own no matter how many times I said I'd be better and stop thinking negatively. I'm so weak, even a brief look at myself verses someone else will ruin any high spirits I might have. Seeing other people happy with each other and how I could never make someone that happy or laugh like that, or make their heart flutter like that. 

It's all confidence. It's all in how I see myself. I know it has to be. But at this point I don't know how to change how feel about myself. Everything seems pointless.

And there's my negativity again.",31Jan2020,1
155,"Man, this going to be hard to even write out. It’s a situation I haven’t fully come to grips with or even grasped myself. 

My mom, I think, is schizophrenic. I just found this out a couple ago. I knew she had some kind of anxiety and depression that would creep up once in a while but no clue about the extent of it.

Anyway, a couple days ago she sent a group text to my brothers and I. It was very cryptic and disturbing. Basically it said that she needs us to help her. She can’t take it anymore and is tired of being tormented by them and for us to please make them stop.

I got this weird feeling and I called her. I asked what was going on and she told me she can’t talk about and to please call my grandma.

So I did. My grandma tells me my mom has been dealing with strange thoughts and delusions for the last couple years. Which I knew to a point. Last year she checked herself into a depression clinic for a week. But she didn’t tell them what was really bothering her.

What I didn’t know, is that she thought the government was after her. My dad went to prison when I was young and I think she has it in her head that the FBI is trying to get her for something he did or blame her for being a part of it or something. She never was, she’s never done anything to anyone and I literally can’t think of a sweeter or more humble person than my mom. My dad abused her, then the next person she got with abused her. He would stomp her and make her waltz around on a leash in front of his friends. Put her in the hospital several times and as result of the trauma she developed epilepsy. The attacks were numerous and even worse than I will describe here. It sucks because all she ever wanted was someone to love her and her kids. Now she is dealing with life long injuries and PTSD.

But anyway, my grandmother tells me my mom thinks the government is tracking her. That they have cameras in her house, she sent my aunt a picture taken on her phone where the camera lens is reflected in her eyes and she thought that she actually had cameras in her eyes.

I didn’t know any of this. My grandma told me it was because that she and my aunt had decided that it would be best not to tell me because I have two kids that my mom loves to baby sit and they were afraid if I knew I wouldn’t let her babysit them anymore.

I call my mom back, heartbroken, and I tell her she needs to get help from a doctor, to just let them try. On Monday, too, my brother was having his first child. My mom’s 3rd grandchild. So when I called her she was sitting in the parking lot of the hospital. She was telling me that she has tried to get help, that the doctors can’t help her, they wouldn’t believe her, and that’s why she needs my help. She weeping and scared. She has flashbacks of being tortured, and in addition to that thoughts that the government is trying to capture her.

I told her why doesn’t she stay the night at my house sometime this week with my step dad and she said okay and that she had to go.

Later I get a call from my grandma that we have to something because my mom called her afterwards and told her she just wants god to take away the thoughts or to take her. My grandma said usually it doesn’t last this long, the delusions.

Last week we had a family dinner at a restaurant with everyone because my brother was having a baby and my other brother was going on a cruise and we didn’t know when we’d be able to get together again.

My mom was at the end and I noticed her head was down and her mouth was moving. My mom is very religious so I figured she was praying. She often does stuff like that, or she will pull out crayons and draw pictures for god or whatever. But my grandma was next to her and told me that during that time she was actually having a spell and was just talking to the voices trying to make them stop, she just wanted to look normal. This obviously is an upsetting thing for me to think about.

Anyway, my grandma also told me when she called back that the help my mom was asking for was for someone to call the president and ask him why he is after her.

I looked into what I could do, but there isn’t really anything I could do to get her into a clinic unless she proves she can’t take care of herself or is danger to herself.

My grandma says that my mom would never hurt my kids. And it’s true that her life revolves around them. She told me that the only time my mom isn’t thinking about her painful past or paranoid is when she is taking care and playing with my kids.

But, I’m scared that what if one day that changes, what if she thinks the government is coming for my kids too and takes off with them. What if she thinks the only way to protect them is to kill them. I just don’t know, the things going through her head are so scary and wrong and clearly not real but they are real to her so what else might she make herself believe?

I think I have to tell her that if she doesn’t get help I can’t let her watch my kids alone or without me there. And I know that’s going to kill her. It’s going to break her heart and it’s not her fault. It’s like I’m punishing her for being sick. Making her suffer for suffering. She doesn’t even realize she needs help. I don’t want her to feel like I’m giving up on her. But I can’t risk my kids health or lives at the same time. If she ever did anything to them she’d never forgive herself, I’d never forgive myself. But I don’t want to hurt my mom. I feel like a piece of shit.

Any ideas as to how to tell her or what to do would be greatly appreciated. I love my mom very much, the thought of what I know I have to do is killing me.",31Jan2020,1
156,"My kitten grabbed the roach I killed with roach poison an hour ago when I opened the door to the room it was in. I quickly got it out of her mouth (which is another reason why I'm panicking so badly, considering I grabbed it with my actual hands and I've had a horrible phobia of them since childhood), but I'm worried that she could have somehow ingested some of the poison.

She's my baby, and I love her so much, I don't want her to get sick and end up in an animal hospital because of this. I don't know what to do. Should I call the vet and see what they say?

160,"Firstly, to establish a fact, I am indeed a male. To establish another fact, I am not gay or bisexual.

I happen to realize a lot that I am not a masculine person and that I do not act like a lot of my male peers. I’m more emotional than a lot of them, and I speak about my emotions and struggles more than other guys do. I’m friends with a lot of the druggy kids at my school, and they all act very tough and act cool. I don’t really act tough like them, but I take part in their actions time to time.

I attempt to be very friendly to other people and try not to be judgmental. I don’t act off something without thinking about it, which guys tend to not think before doing something way more often than women. I really have a deep love for fashion and colors, and I very much love the arts. I have a lot of friends that are girls, and I’ve lost a few to other cliques with these “tough cool guys” in there. I’ve had a few girlfriends that enjoyed my company, but I was the type of guy who was too afraid to break their hearts. Out of the 8 of them in my High School years so far, I’ve only broken up with 1 of them. I feel nobody accepts me being who I am and what I try to be. I can tell a lot of these guys dislike my company and think I’m weird because I don’t act like them.

Now, I’m confused with who I am and don’t know what to do or how to present myself. Is there any way I can change to become more manly? Should I even change in general? Is there something I’m doing wrong?

TL;DR
I feel like I’m not manly enough compared to other guys and I am confused with who I am and how I should act. I’m not sure if I should change or continue the way I present myself.",31Jan2020,1
161,"Lately it's been pretty hard for me to get exited over something. Like usually I would get very exited over game releases but for a while its been pretty gray, especially these last few months. A Half Life game was announced after 12 years and I was like ""oh cool"".

I used to get so exited to play with people and have fun but it's just been draining to be around other people like that. I don't have fun and get absolutely drained.

It's also been challenging to become immersed is things like movies and video games. Like I have to put a lot of effort on focusing on a movie and staying grounded. Now a days I don't really get pulled into the stories anymore, at least not not normally.

I have been trying to force myself into things, to try and enjoy life but I end up dreading my choice afterwards.

I haven't been interested in doing things I used to enjoy like hobbies and such.

As time passed, things became more gray. Especially in the last 2-7 months. But somethings stuck more than others.

Its not like there is nothing there but it's like I lost a piece of me somewhere. I don't know what to do.

Is this normal? Is there something I can do about it? Is it just a phase and I should just wait it out?

My mum just bought me some clothes from a store that has all styles of clothes that was a having a sale. I appreciate when she does this so much, I love my mum and everything she does for me. But, these clothes are the complete opposite of my style. These are very frilly, girly pieces and one is lab oversized leopard print, T-shirt dress. which is not what I am into. I tried the clothes on and tried to style them to fit my style, which is more ripped jeans, dark colours etc. The result was I just didn’t feel good in these clothes. But I really want to because she thought of me and bought them for me. She will notice I am never wearing them and ask, and I don’t know how to tell her I just Don’t like these clothes. I want to but they just don’t  look good on me nor are they my style. I’m in no way upset she bought me these clothes and she obviously thought they would look nice on me. I am so grateful for that, but how can I tell her I just really don’t like them and won’t wear them?  I feel so ungrateful, for not liking them even though I am so appreciative of the thought. I still live with my parents, and she sees what my wardrobe consists of, so I hope she will understand. Any advice on how to tell her? And do you think I am being ungrateful?

178,"Just so y'all know I'm going to bring up child molestation. So don't read this if you're sensitive to that.

He was exposed to porn when he was very young. He grew up in a relatively Christian family so there was a lot of therapy and medication involved. He struggled a lot with mental health issues and was pulled out of school. In early high school he molested two young girls that he babysitted. He went to jail and then the state placed him in a group home where he did lots of therapy and eventually his parents were given custody of him. Needless to say this destroyed his family.

It's been about 7 years since all of this, and he told me this when we started dating. He's currently working hard to get himself off the registry. 

I love him a lot. He's a very caring and kind person. He is still attracted to minors (not IRL but things like hentai). I'm not sure if it's something he can change. I don't think he'd ever reoffend now that he's aware of how much that hurts someone. He does not want to hurt anyone ever again. Also all of that really fucked him up. He didn't really have a traditional adolescence.

Now my problem is I like feeling small. I like acting childish and playful. I enjoy DDLG and ageplay. We both like it. It seems okay to me- we are both consenting adults and it allows for our fantasies to be acknowledged and expressed in a safe and healthy environment. Similar to BDSM or other taboo kinks

Please I just want an external opinion on this.",31Jan2020,1
179,"So let me start by saying that family is important to me. I was raised with tight family bonds. That's why I've let this go for so long.

Almost 7 years now I've known my mother in-law. And I've always known her to be an unreasonable woman. From what my wife told me about her childhood, this behavior was nothing new. Back when we were first dating my wife would be so upset by her that she wanted to disown her. This happened more than once. 

Let me pause here to inform you that my mother in-law has   serious  mental  issues. 

As you might of guessed she didn't get disowned. I advocated the importance of family to my wife when that came up. But let me tell you a little more about my mother in-law. She is a woman who is addicted drama so much so that she creates stories that put her in the position of a victim, and then tries her damnedest to breathe life into them and make people believe they are real. But they are not real. They are fictional occurrences that the comes up with to continue her story. 

It was mild before. She would only accuse her husband of cheating on her 24/7 when he wasn't. And she would accuse my wife and I of assisting him with his cheating. There's more but I'll just say this was a mild phase for her. That was before we had kids. 

My wife and I had 2 beautiful daughters between now and then. My oldest is 3. Herein lies the beginning of my biggest issue with my mother in-law. 

When I met my wife she was in a dental program at a technical college. When we had kids she was still in the program. Well I had to work and guess who the babysitter always was. If you guessed the mother in-law, you'd be right. Let's just say over the past 3 years my daughters became very close to their Nonna and Pap Pap. After my wife finished the program she opted to forego pursuing a dental career for the time being to have more time with the girls.

There were always little things along the way that reminded us of how crazy she was. She was often forgetful and usually condescending. She would get into fights with her husband a lot. She even stabbed him in the arm a few times (not at our house). Why we never called on her for that is hard to say. I guess we just felt like we should've stayed out of it. 

So what has been happening now, for a while now, she has been coming over to our house as much as she possibly could to play with the girls. Not always with with her husband. She has acted as  playmate for the girls so much that they get upset when she leaves. 

Alright now that that's been established, I'll tell you about how she recently fell off. Not long ago, she started carrying on about how her husband is having the police investigate her so that he can divorce her for free (This couldn't be farther from the truth). And of course, according to her, my wife and I are in on it too. And then she has the audacity to say that we have police hiding in our attic spying on her. She is saying that she honestly believes that the state is paying police officers to crawl around in our attic 24/7 to keep her under surveillance. But she keeps coming back to our house to play with the girls! 

Well today, when I got home they were leaving. And as they were leaving my daughter said ""no don't leave me I'm scared of Daddy."" This was a surprise to me because she has never said anything like that before. I'll tell you now my daughter has no reason to say that she's too scared to be left with me. She's gotten popped before, yes. Punishment is a tool not a reaction. I have never hurt my wife or my daughters. Hearing my daughter say this convinced me that my mother in-law is training my daughter to say this. I believe that she wants my daughter to hate me or something. 

Well when my daughter said that, my mother in-law goes on about all of her cops in the attic bullshit and accuses me of beating my wife and kids (my wife dropped her phone on here eye once and my mother in-law thought I was beating her up). 

So I basically told her off and called her out on all her bullshit (something I've never done). She couldn't get to me with her lies so she started shouting and saying she was going to call the cops and social services on me (not the first time she's threatened this). I know the threats empty I mean if I'm under 24/7 surveillance by the cops in my attic why would they do anything when she calls? 

But my main issue with all this is my daughter saying what she said. I want to know how to make my daughter understand that what she was being trained to say isn't right. 

I swear it's like my mother in-law just want me out of the picture. But that's only plausible in her delusional mind. 

My wife and I are putting the foot down for good and she's going to have to get mental help before she comes back.",31Jan2020,1
180,"On mobile and first post warning. I think I have the formatting down, but please be kind. I’m also hoping this is the right subreddit. tl;dr at the bottom

A bit of back story: My husband and I are planning on moving back to his home state next year. This has always been our plan. We are currently leasing an apartment and will be on the hook if we break the lease. Before our wedding, I was the acting caretaker for my mother with numerous medical issues, my 90 year old grandmother, and by proxy also my uncle. Since the wedding, I have been slowly easing out of that role. We’ve been married for a little over a year. 

After hearing about the parameters of our lease agreement, my mom offers for us to move back in with her and my dad (their house is plenty big enough). This way we don’t have to worry about breaking our lease and we can save money. Initially, I thought this was a great idea, but asked for time to think it over and see what the Hubs thought. My mom gave me the “are you kidding?” look, but I didn’t think anything of it then. 

Hubs ends up being 110% against the idea, and I agree with him and his reasoning. And I feel the fool for forgetting one major aspect; when he first moved to the state to end the long distance aspect of our relationship, he lived with myself and my parents. We were already engaged at that point. After 4 months of a mostly fruitless job search (he was working PT, looking for FT), my mom states that she was tired of him impeding on her space and threatened to throw him out. Thankfully he was hired someplace full time later that week, and quickly found the apartment we now live in. Moving forward my mom says that she now sees him as the son she never had. Hubs is still a bit closed off around her.

Other reasons include our independence, our privacy (still freshly married), and he doesn’t want me to get dragged into a more entrenched caretaker role again. 

About a week ago, we were talking about our downstairs neighbors who can sometimes be a bit loud. 

My dad jokingly offered: Hey, just move in sooner

Hubs: Or we could just move to another building. 

My mom shot me a look, but I just sheepishly shrugged. 

Two days later, I was over for my weekly help visit when my mom turns to me while I was talking with my dad of and starts with: 
“I don’t want to put you on the spot, but why doesn’t Hubs want to move in? What’s wrong? Doesn’t he like us?”

I explain our reasoning. 

She explodes. And I was thrown back to my teenage years. She berates me for taking his side, about how immature he is, how I’m the adult in my household so I need to make the right decision, and she only threatened to kick him out to make him grow a pair. It wasn’t like she actually would have.

I’m embarrassed to say I just shut down. I didn’t verbally respond, but according to my dad, if looks could kill my mom would be six feet under already. 

She starts to get flustered, “Don’t get mad! I’m just stating facts!” My dad is eventually successful at the diffusing the situation, even though my mom tries to keep bringing it up. I leave to work on some chores, and my dad follows. He says he wants to smooth things over, that my mom knows she may have pushed too far but I know how she is, and she’ll apologize in her own way. 

And that’s it. Hubs and I are both pissed, and this episode has firmly pushed both of us to not want to move back in. This is the first time my mom has acted this way since I’ve moved out, so I’m not completely sure how to articulate our displeasure without making an even bigger mess. So, any advice?

tl;dr: my mom freaks out when I tell her my husband and I do not want to move back in. How do I properly articulate our displeasure at her insults without making the situation worse?",31Jan2020,1

184,So I am currently 16 with just my mom and step dad in my life.Ive met my biological father before but we havent had any type of communication  with eachother for maybe 11 years.I have no idea where he lives nothing about him.At the age of 3 I was molested by him.My mom would go to work and leave me with him and i would cry saying I dont want to stay but I never said why eventually i would say “daddy touches me and it hurts” and “daddy plays with my tootie” I was brought to the doctor but there was no sign of anything.My mother took him to court but he wasn’t charged with anything because “i was so young and my mom could have just told me to say those things”.So the court then forced me to see him I believe it may have been at the age of 8. The court only allowed me to be with him if others were around.It was really weird for me because I knew he was my “dad” but i looked at him as if he was any other stranger.We started to first meet at  public places such as mcdonalds my mom would also stay I guess just so i can be comfortable around him.I could remember sitting on his lap and him being very weird and me trying to get up but him squeezing me to stay.That then changed to my mom dropping me off at his house but “family members” were around.I barely knew my “dad” so those “family members” that were around didnt help because i didn’t know them at all.Like i said if I was with my father there had to be someone else around at all times but sometimes it would end up being  just us.After I let my mom know that I stopped seeing him but i don’t remember anything else.,31Jan2020,1

Taxes, bills, jobs, housing, kids, etc. We had to choose our jobs based on our GPAs. This is all cool and stuff but what isn’t worrying me is a stupid school thing, it’s the fact that this affects my real life. This is an actual decision I will have to make.

 My dream job is working backstage in theatre, because I love everything about musical theatre and want to work on Broadway one day. But it’s hard to get into. And it pays low. Versus a job that I’m mildly interested in, being an engineer. I am currently in a magnet school that specializes in the STEM field, so it’s not like it’s a far fetch that I could be an engineer. And the STEM field could really use an engineer right now.  But what about in 8 years? Will the market be over saturated and by the time I finish getting a degree I don’t want I don’t be able to find a job? Or will I lose my opportunity to live comfortably and make next to nothing, that is if I even manage to make it in that career?

200,"So my sister has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for 6 years now. They have three kids. And from the time she was 9 months pregnant with her first baby her boyfriend was already showing who he was. She could be seen doing the groceries, laundry, and cooking for him while he played video games. Three kids later, he does very little, he does not parent his children, he barely even looks after them. He can be seen on his phone all day while their latest baby cries in another room. As far as I know, my sister has been the main breadwinner and taken on all the responsibility of providing for the kids. 

Over the course of her first pregnancy I have seen her personality change. I used to think the world of my sister she was always one of the strongest women I knew. Before I knew she was pregnant with her first baby and while she continued to carry on a long-distance relationship with that boyfriend I asked why she was with him, why she drove across the country for him, bought him plane tickets etc. She had no real answer for me, she just started crying and said she loved him. 

Her family moved away for a couple of years and you could tell they were struggling financially, with her doing most of the heavy lifting. They have recently come back to my parents house where we at least know she is not being physically abused, but she remains quiet and withdrawn. I thank God I'm not under the same roof as them, I would've flipped out on him already and done something crazy. I haven't been in contact with her out of pure frustration, I messaged her that if there was ever something she needed that I would be there for her. She laughed that off and didn't respond much. The last time I saw them was a year ago during Christmas and it wasn't pretty. 

My sister is a beautiful woman, she deserves someone so much better and she could manage better by herself without this guy, yet that doesn't seem to be an option for her. I have no idea what is going on in her mind. I don't know if she's been emotionally abused or what. It's hard enough seeing her in such a situation, but seeing her kids not being cared for is sad. Two of her young kids don't even speak they're 5 and 3, I can only imagine it's from the lack of interaction they receive. I am so frustrated I want to help her, I don't know what to do to help. She came from a family of two loving parents I don't understand why she has chosen this man to fill her life with nothing but hardship and suffering.

203,"Where do I begin, it is a complicated web of toxicity. Firstly I am in the furniture project sales line, been in this job for 5 months , ok lets cont. (TLDR below)

My Boss is inconsistent, which makes it very hard to work.
She would insist to use Plan A one day then change her mind the next, blaming me for using Plan A.
From there she will derive that I am incompetent for thinking of  Plan A in the first place.

Through that , she continues to think negatively and starts checking every work that is produced by me.
Finally when she finds one mistake, that one mistake proves her point that I am incompetent.

And the cycle continues.

This negativity affects me. How?

One of the days my colleague (Bootlicker, yes man kind) accepted too much workload from her but kept quiet.
When she found out she screamed at me,
""Why are you not helping her? You have absolutely nothing to do and yet you do not want to help her?""

I had just completed juggling 3 projects on hand that morning, this she knew about.
But when her mind snaps, she thinks negatively of a person immediately.

Its not just me. My other colleagues all get the same treatment.
Through her negative mindset , many issues arise.

Paranoia- Is my employee really working? Are they really visiting clients?
Is this lunch claim for the clients really for clients?

Crazy Tantrums - Screaming at her employees every once in awhile for things that they did not want to do.
 (E.g. Plan A example above)

Belittling employees infront of clients - Going to meetings and presentations with her is a nightmare.
She will not say that her employee is not good, but instead.. Cut into conversations to sound smart, nickpick your responses to clients also to sound smart , etc.
These are clients I have to visit, and when I do , its very hard to work with them because they only want to communicate with my boss.
Which leads to most clients only calling my boss and she in turn blames us for not servicing the clients.

All these also makes the office environment very harsh and makes people think bad about each other which leads to more deeprooted issues.

I am a diligent , meticulous, hard worker type. Besides salary , I want to be treated like a human being.
I can't help but feel like a useless trash everyday. TBH , my work quality is slipping and I can't find a reason to be bothered.
Theres happy money to be made and unhappy money to be made. This , to me is unhappy money.

But the thing is this, I believe I can't leave just yet.
1) I have switched industry from Photocopiers to Insurance to Furniture Sales.
2) In my late 20's.
3) I have a house to apply a loan for in 1 year.
4) I have to plan for a wedding before the home comes about.
5) My savings is just right if i continue to work here .
6) My Fiance will lose confidence in me.

Its one of those ""Im afraid to jump ship"" kind of moments. but in this ship I feel like trash.

The thought of not being with him makes me want to die. The thought of spending the rest of my life potentially being cheated on, beaten down over anything and everything, being broken up with two times a week and crying and begging for him not to leave me also makes me want to die.

206,"Back in my junior year, I had an amazing French teacher. She had a lasting effect on all of us, and me especially. Every now and then we email each other. Her passion, knowledge, joy, and teaching skills influenced me to consider majoring in French in college. Unfortunately, I didn't choose to major in French, although I still love what I'm majoring in. Anyway, while it had nothing at all to do with my choice of school, I actually just realized that my old teacher lives near where I am currently at school and also went to the same school I am at. We were very, very close a few years ago. She helped me through some hard times during my junior year, she wrote my college letter of rec, I planned a going away gift for her, etc. While I'd love to be able to see and talk to her again, I'm not sure if that would be awkward, inappropriate, etc. I'm unsure if that fact that I am an 18 year old man and she is a 26 year old women makes it any worse, but I figure it might be helpful to know that for teachers on Reddit who can comment and respond to this post. I want to be clear as possible that there's nothing weird between us and I don't have any weird feelings for her or anything like that... unless its weird for a former teacher and a former student to still stay in touch every now and then via email. I'm simply hoping that we can get together again at some point.

My question is whether or not it is appropriate or awkward if I try to reach out and ask her if she'd be interested in meeting up. Unfortunately, it may not be acceptable by social norms for something like this to happen, and that's why I'm asking. What would you say? Should I do it or not? If so, how would you go about doing it? How can I make it not look awkward and just be normal? or is that not a possibility? I'm just interested in what your ideas and advice and tips about this are. Please don't be afraid to be brutally honest, I can handle the truth. Thank you very much!",31Jan2020,1

Post was removed from r/legaladvice for not having a clesr legal question.


My friend 23/F  was working as a nurse assistant for a home health company. She is pregnant and due in a month or two.  and per her doctor's orders she is shouldn't continue to work due to health issues/high risk. She still tried to push though it and work anyways. In December sometime before Christmas she was in much pain and asked if she could be removed for her next days shift. (Her employer was aware of the health issues).

Instead he removed her from her entire scheduled week and told her to cone back in March/April after the birth. Basically a forced time off. Naturally, she filed for unemployment because she did not quit and wasn't fired either but still needs money for bills.

The case manager at the department of Labor calls her and tells her that apparently her boss is saying they have paperwork that my friend signed saying that she was going on leave. She hasn't even stepped foot in the office since November and hasn't  signed anything. The signature on the paperwork is NOT my friends

Now she finds out from her employer that they are going to withold her W2 form for a year. Surely this can't be legal?


She is looking to possibly sue them but doesn't know if she needs a lawyer or an attorney or what the difference is. Also her and her family are lower income and cannot afford extremely expensive lawyers.

What should she be looking for and what questions should she be asking as someone without a lot of money looking for a lawyer? Do many offer free consultations? 


She is talking about going to the office herself tomorrow and demanding her w2 and to ask them about the fraudulent signature. I will say this company is very unprofessional and there's a lot they could possibly get in trouble for. From letting non certified nursing assistants help with medication and adult diaper changing to bathing them. They tell you during orientation (i know because i almost worked for them and went to their orientation) they stress that you are not a CNA you are a ""home companion"" to give conversation, company, and possibly drive to appointments. 

Instead once they hire you they have you doing what only a certified CNA should be doing and they don't background check or drug test before leaving you alone with the elderly.

Any advice appreciated.",31Jan2020,1

218,"Reddit, 

I’ve made some mistakes &amp; I need advice how to proceed. There’s a lot of backstory so let me know if anything’s confusing. (All of us in this story are late 20s). I have been dating Randy for about 8 months now. I love him more than anything &amp; he’s one of the best people I know. We met in college originally &amp; we were just friends then. He moved out of state after college then moved back to the area before we started dating. 

So my freshman year of college I met my friend Eliza. She was talking to this guy named Jack at the time. Never in a relationship just talking/hanging out (they both had SO’s at the time). That summer they didn’t talk &amp; came back to school with different SO’s, but again they started talking/hanging out some. Since Eliza &amp; Jack hung out some, I got close to Jack. Jack &amp; Randy were in the same friend group but I would never really consider them friends (I don’t think Randy particularly cared for Jack). Jack &amp; I ended up becoming roommates the following year with another guy, while Eliza transferred to a school back home (about 3 hours away). Jack &amp; I were really good friends in college. Eliza &amp; I still talked some but not a lot. 

About a year after college, Eliza &amp; I both were ending separate relationships at the same time. We kind of bonded over that &amp; hung out a few times after that even though she lived a couple hours away. She &amp; Jack started talking/hanging out some, but again not serious. Then she started a new relationship with someone else (the love of her life kind of thing, moved across the country with him). About a year after her &amp; her new boyfriend were together, Jack &amp; I drunkenly had sex. We had kind of flirted/made out a couple times in the months before that. But he didn’t live in the area so it wasn’t ever anything serious. I was really ashamed about this &amp; didn’t talk to anyone about it. I thought about telling Eliza, but since her &amp; Jack weren’t ever serious, I told myself she wouldn’t care. I’m not exactly certain about Eliza &amp; Jack’s physical relationship from the past but I’m sure they slept together a few times. 

Eliza &amp; I have become pretty close in the time since then, &amp; I have been feeling guilty about never telling her about Jack &amp; I. Ive been feeling especially guilty about not having told Randy. The thing with Jack &amp; I happened about 2 years before Randy &amp; I started dating. But since Jack is someone Randy knows, I feel guilty not  telling him. Even though Randy or I don’t talk to Jack anymore. However we did see him at a wedding a few months ago.  I just want to be open with him about my past &amp; not keep secrets from him. 

So reddit, I need advice. I’ve decided I’m going to tell Randy. This has really been eating at me. Would you guys tell Randy in this situation &amp; how? Then should I tell Eliza? Am I overthinking this way too much? Please give me your honest advice/suggestions.

224,"I've just applied to university, and I'm petrified. I'm applying in the art field and as such I need to attend interviews and show off my portfolio. When I got my first interview, I was over joyed, but it's now less than a week away and I can barely cope with the stress and it developing into depression. My college used to be amazing with mental health, but now, it's useless. It took on more students than it can handle, I've asked and spoken to them repeatedly asking for help coping with stress since September. I was originally offered it, but I declined, but my childhood cat and dog passed away a month apart. It's safe to say they were what kept me sane and together, without them I have been incredibly lost. At the moment I don't think I will be accepted into any of the universities I want to attend, I just don't feel like I am good enough, and I will just be making a fool of myself by attending the interviews. I lack humans in my portfolio as well are perspective drawings and traditional other than a small amount of my GCSE art, majority of it was destroyed by a mold infestation. I was hoping to get some examples in, but I've been overwhelmed at home. 

Just thinking about these interviews makes my stomach churn, I'm flying blind, I never expected to be on the path of an artist and I am honestly terrified about everything. 

I don't feel ready to go to university, even though I am already a year behind due to switching from science to games, animation and VFX. I feel so overwhelmed I feel like being sick and I feel like my imagination is going to drive insane.

- It's stressed me out so badly that it's affecting my physical and mental health and my grades, which is really bad news because I'm supposed to graduate in May. 
- My hours are completely random; the last 2 weeks I've worked a total of 5 days, and now suddenly I have to work this Fri-Sun, I get Mon + Tues off, then I work 5 days in a row but possibly even more after. The inconsistency makes it super difficult to plan important things around it.
- Between homework and extracurriculars, I'm in a loop of going to school for 7 hours, ending up needing to miss said extracurriculars for work, working until 9 or 10, and either going to sleep so I'm only moderately exhausted or staying up doing homework but being so tired I can barely function the next day. 
- I have chronic pain that my manager seems to be very unsympathetic towards. Whenever I show signs that I'm having a hard time physically, my manager gets obviously frustrated, and recently almost fired me over it.
- The training is extremely inconsistent, and I'm either being taught things way after I was supposed to have been, or I'm being taught poorly and then blamed for poor performance. 
- People are constantly quitting and being replaced just as fast; I think 3 or 4 new people have quit and been replaced in just the month and a half I've been employed. I think it's fair that I take that as a pretty bad sign.

A third one with the username ""mateareyou12"" comes through and I suspect it isn't a bot anymore, then finally ""ICOMEINPEACEPLEASEACCEPT."" All within the span of like ten minutes.

I wanted to know if anyone thinks I should just send one more message to say “if you didn’t want to be friends can you just tell me it’s killing my pride” or just keep trying to suppress my feeling and try and let it go over time.,31Jan2020,1

248,"I've gotten my first bachelors degree in art education because my original plan was to become a teacher. I just wanted job security bc I was too afraid to major in illustration or graphic design. I never really wanted to be a secondary school teacher but it didnt seem like a bad job.  Now that I've been just working as a barista for a few months I might as well go back and do what I always wanted to do. Since I already had a similar major, I wont have to start completely over. Now I just need help deciding whether to do graphic design or illustration!!!! I love both. School just motivates me to complete and create finalize and more professional works aside from the doodles in my sketchbook. I want to build a solid portfolio for a future career as an artist. I would love to draw illustrations for a cool magazine, whether fashion or something crazy like the new Yorker. I just want to be asked to create something and know how to do it and feel confident doing it.  I really love drawing and drawing people. But I also  love graphic design bc i like becoming more handy with digital art and i feel like itll be maybe a bit easier to find a job as a graphic designer. I'm really tied. If you can give me some insights on your personal experience or what you look for when you hire these artists???

249,"Hey guys,

I just moved into a duplex last August with my boyfriend. My unit in particular was destroyed by the previous tenants and had to be completed gutted/refurbished before moving in (apparently the previous tenants had neglected their dog, let it poop all over the house, and never cleaned it up). 

My landlord mentioned that after that messy incident, he was pretty turned off to the idea of pets. However, he let us have a pet if we'd pay an additional $100 every month. We signed the lease, happy we were able to adopt a cat if we wanted to.

My neighbor (who lives in one of the other units and has the same landlord as us) mentioned that she only pays $20 for both of her dogs every month - which makes sense because she moved in before the landlord discovered that massive turd ordeal. We've been really itching to adopt a cat, but that $100 monthly fee seems a tad steep.

So the plan is to see if the landlord would be willing to lower the fee when we renew the lease in August if we can prove to him we are responsible pet owners (to be clear, I'm not trying to negotiate the lease I have signed and am currently bound by). For example, if we get a cat tomorrow, we'd pay the $100 every month until August, then ideally the landlord would inspect the house in August and ensure we're taking care of the cat and his house, and he'd happily lower the fee!

I've never tried to negotiate with a landlord before. Would something like this be kind of weird to do? Something I should not do? Something that sounds like a good idea? Looking for advice. Thanks in advance.",31Jan2020,1

253,"I've always been an introvert, but I feel like it's getting worse. Since college started, I don't spend much time with friends as they've pretty much all have headed off to university while I'm staying at community college. The thing is, I don't really feel lonely. I wish I had a cat but that's about it. I talk to myself all the time, as I have for years. Don't have any internet friends either, as I really dislike talking over the phone or through text unless I really know a person. I listen to podcasts and spend time with my family. Usually pretty begrudgingly though, as stress is rising in the house as brother is practically in pissing contests with ""friend group"" of who has the most/worst disorders and mom is constantly yelling and stressed due to the job she chose which is working with special ed kids. Pretty sure since she can't yell at her half nightmare of a kid, she takes it out more on us. I mostly spend time with Dad, playing video games and/or talking about my fantasy world/book(s). Constantly thinking about my fantasy world and talking to myself about it. 

Anyway, I don't have much of a social need anymore. I'm getting much more annoyed with people as of late, but that's probably just me getting more annoyed with my family.

254,"My son is 7 years old, Autistic and ODD.  He didn't start talking until last year, and still isn't very good at communicating.  We have known something was off because his behavior has been bad the past week but we weren't sure what was going on but now I think I know what it might be related to.  My son rides a special bus from his elementary school directly to my house.  The bus has a driver and a bus monitor.  The pair are new to us this year and to be honest I never really warmed up to them.  They didn't seem to care much for the kids on the bus, and seemed to not like the route much.  It got particularly bad when before the holidays I saw the monitor slap one of the other kids. I reported it to the bus depot and they said they would review the tape with the monitor and nothing every came of it.  

My son has a particular bad habit with the bus lately.  When it comes time to get off he wants to try and walk down all three steps at once.  I can make him walk down normally, his father isn't as good at that.  So days when his dad gets him off the bus there is a bit more of a struggle to get him to behave and exit the bus normally.  We also have a toddler who likes to try and escape as well, so we have to not only get the older son off the bus but be quick to prevent the toddler from escaping. 

This afternoon I was working the late shift at work so my husband was there to get the older son off the bus.  When the bus came he distracted the toddler and went out to meet it.  The older son tried to step down all the steps at once like he tries to do often and my husband, trying to be quick so the toddler wouldn't come out in the cold, grabbed the older son and picked him up.  The bus monitor then grabbed the older son by his backpack, pulling back sharply and ripping him out of my husband's arms (mostly because he was startled she would do that).  She said ""No, he must learn to walk down right.""  She held my son back by his backpack (my husband said he was making choking noises at one point) until he walked down fully.  During this time my toddler also got outside without a jacket on because it took so long.  

Granted my son had no injuries.  My husband mostly allowed everything because my older son thought it was a game and he didn't want to upset the older son anymore.  Are we wrong to find this behavior completely unacceptable?  What can we do to make them see this from our viewpoint?  Our son doesn't understand things they way everyone else does and can't communicate properly the way everyone else does when he has something bad happens to him. What can we do to make sure he doesn't get into this situation again?  Is this bad enough I need to get law or family services involved?  I am not sure where to go from here.  I just want to protect my son and I find myself lacking the tools to properly do so.  I let him down once and I don't want to let it happen again.",31Jan2020,1

I've already failed three semesters of college and I'm already failing this semester too, not even three weeks after this semester as begun.   
I got into a decent college out of HS, but got put into academic recess during my first semester after I stopped going to classes halfway through after I failed the midterm. I decided to retake the classes I failed at a local community college, but I stopped going halfway through again.. Then another semester and the same thing happens. I couldn't even make myself walk in through the door on the first day of class this semester and have been too much of a coward to talk to my professor about it.

260,"So today I went to a clinic. I'm 15 soon to be 16. My mother told me it was going to be a simple checkup as we're new in this city. I filled out a form and did it honestly. A nurse asked me what I'd like to get checked out and I looked at my mother as I didn't know. My mother just answered ""skin checkup"". I think it was the ""discharge"" thing that I circled that started it all. Now, I've been rocky about my sexuality and anything 'sex' related. (I've also been questioning who I am, personality-wise). I mean, I'd say I'm pretty much open-minded about it but haven't been ready for it. I've been feeling 'messy' about myself for months now. I identify as straight-asexual. I never had anything with anyone.  


When my anxiety spikes up, I freeze, I just don't have control over my body anymore. The nurse just pulled out weird looking equipment and told me to undress from the waist down. I was shocked and looked at my mom and told her 'what?' I don't know but I should've told the nurse I wasn't ready for it yet but I just did it. They were nice and whatnot so I don't know why I even feel the way I feel. I never had anything sexually traumatic happen to me. But this situation has made me feel ashamed of myself.

261,"Not that the details of our relationship really matter for this post, but me (18F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been dating for about 3 months and go to college together/share a few classes.

I'll just jump right into what the title says: my boyfriend has 0 motivation to do anything in his life. He rarely does homework or studies and if he does it's hours before it's due and it's very half assed (he's quite smart and could get straight A's if he tried). Anything work/school related he simply cannot push himself to do, which sounds normal since no one really enjoys doing these things, but it is also with his hobbies as well. He likes video games, creative writing, reading, and making music, yet from what he's told me he even lacks the motivation to do these things. Sometimes he can't even get the motivation to watch Youtube videos. I've told him in the past motivation comes from something to earn or prove and that he should try setting some goals, but nothing seems to work. None of the incentives I suggest or try to implement seem to do anything: he doesn't care about grades (he's not even sure he wants to be in school at this point), he doesn't care about failure, he doesn't have any job that he's striving to get, even just ""do it because it makes you happy"" doesn't work somehow. I can't relate because I have an anxiety disorder and also very strong aspirations so I'm quite motivated with everything I do both out of fear of failure as well as wanting to achieve my goals. Basically any reason he should be motivated that you can think of, I've tried to get him to follow. It just does not work.

I've also brought up that he may be depressed as avolition is a big symptom of depression and similar mental disorders. I know that when I'm depressed none of the things I enjoy make me happy anymore and all I want to do is stay in bed and do nothing, which is often what he does. But he shot the idea down immediately saying he only gets sad and insecure about his lack of motivation and goals like once every few months for a week and then after that's done he just doesn't care/feel bad about it anymore. I'm wondering if it's possible to just have no motivation for no reason at all, and if there's anything one can do about this.

I know I make it seem like he just does nothing all day but there is some stuff that makes him happy it's just not all the time and sometimes turns into being ""meh"". He can also usually force himself to do the things he really needs to do but like I said, it's always last minute and not to his full potential. Honestly the only thing I've found that motivates him is me; he's told me he always gets his homework done when he does it with me, even if I'm not helping him with it, because I'm always there to keep him on track, and that when we have plans if it was with anyone else he'd usually cancel them to just stay in bed but because it's me he gets up. Which is all very sweet, but that is a lot of pressure to be someones only source of motivation in life. I want him to find something, anything, that will motivate him even if it's like the most weird and obscure interest, as long as it makes him happy and feel like life is worth going through because at this point he said that he finds living to be boring and I don't want that for him.

266,"I am a computer technician in Australia. I tried to post this on legaladvice but it was too long.

I will call the internet provider CIS.

A 92 year old woman was with an internet provider and another larger company purchased them and took over. CIS made the existing customers sign another contract. She signed 3 years back in December 2018, since she had no problems with the previous one, everything should be the same.

The phone didn't work properly and used SIP via the modem which was provided by CIS. She could make calls but they would drop out between 2 to 10 minutes on a call. She would have to call people back constantly. She also used Netflix sometimes and it would drop out too.

I was called in july 2019 to sort it out since CIS said it was a problem with her equipment. I tried another modem, and still the same issues remained. I called CIS to work through the problems like i normally do with anyone else. They kept suggesting the same thing, going around in a circle of try another modem, reset this, someone will go to the street to fix the issue. Nothing was fixed, the problems kept happening and on top of it, the lady was being direct debit for excess phonecalls because of the dropouts. I kept talking to CIS about the issues and mentioned the excess charge but nothing was resolved.

In August she received her monthly bank statement which showed CIS deducted nearly $12,000 from her account. She nearly had a heart attack and called me because she didn't know what to do. I arrived at her house and called CIS again. I told the accounts department that the money needs to be refunded. They just laughed and said that their policy states they don't do refunds and that she will need to be put into credit. I told them to shove a big fucking medieval mace up their soft assholes.

I then rang the bank and told them it was a scam. They could reverse the charge and she got the money back. Meanwhile CIS couldn't deduct the next month (which should have been a credit) She received a threatening legal action email from CIS. I then called another internet provider and signed her up for them. The changeover went smoothly and by september she had a working phone and stable internet connection.

CIS sent out a breach of contract $1500 disconnection fee and also wanted the few months before payments. I talked to them again and told them i am going to talk to the telecommunications ombudsman (A legal system government funded organization specifically to deal with internet provider issues) I talked to them and told them everything that had happened. They sent a form for me to fill out and get the 92 year old woman to sign so i could act on her behalf.

Before i could go to her house to get her to sign it, a person rang stating she is from the ombudsman and that i need to call her back. I talked to this woman called Kathy. She said they have negotiated with CIS and that the bill has now been halved to $1200. I got suspicious because half of $1500 or $1700 is not $1200. She then told me nothing further can be done and it is payable immediately to her now. So i looked up her number via reverseaustralia website and the number belonged to CIS.

Impersonating a government organization for any reason is a criminal offense. I told this Kathy that she is working for CIS and that she is a liar. I then called the real ombudsman about this and they had to still assign a case manager to me since i haven't got the customer to sign the form yet. So i got her to sign it and talked to a person from the real company. She told me that there is nothing they can do and that the contract is binding since the customer signed for it. So the full amount they are asking is what needs to be paid.

So my understanding is that, a business cannot supply a working service yet still needs to be paid and when you leave before the contract ends, you need to have their approval, even if you are treated like shit and ripped off your entire life savings. I have never run into such a bad business in my life and i deal with many different internet providers on a daily basis. Then i have wondered about other people with this bunch of pricks doing the same to other elderly customers and getting away with it using these same tactics. I read their whole contract and it actually states that a person can leave if every avenue of trying to fix the issues with the connection has been reached, but it says it must be pre-approved by them which is a big finger to all their customers since they don't even let you get this far into a conversation. I was going to ring a local radio show which many elderly people listen to and tell them this story. Except they advertise CIS. I do believe i should expose these people for how badly they have treated this woman and then more will come forward.",31Jan2020,1
267,"So we just got our kitten, Agatha, a month ago. She’s 5 months old. Came from local animal rescue, was fostered in a local home. We got her and her brother. We LOVE them both dearly!!!! 

At her follow up vet visit yesterday— to ensure she was gaining weight and another vaccine, the vet said she has a heart murmur. A murmur he did not hear 3 weeks ago. Vet got very serious. Had the other vet double check her and concur. He said we shouldn’t get her spayed until issue dealt with because of anesthesia. He gave me number for cardiologist for vet he works with a lot. 

I called to make an appointment as suggested. And the receptionist made sure to tell me the cost would be $600-$800. I clarified that the costs were only if we did all the tests she mentioned. Not just to see the doctor and she agreed. But said that’s the likely cost for full tests. 

Has anyone else been through this? Is this cost out of the norm? Is it possible that the murmur is nothing to worry about? Any advice on questions to ask before going for the full haul of tests?

273,"I’m 17m and I work at a dominos location that is conveniently close to my house and wasn’t bad for the first year, I actually loved working there. That was until a week ago when I asked my manager for a raise (keep in mind I only got a dollar for my first raise so it put me at $8.25) of $10 because I’m one of the pizza makers and one of the more depended on employees so I believe that at least after a year I should at least be getting paid 10 since my other co workers are getting paid $11. she told me that she’d only be able to do $9.25 but that was better than nothing so I said that was great and so she told me she’d apply it to the next paycheck cycle. So a couple days go by and I get sent home early because I cussed and was a little late even tho I’m always 5 to 10 min late and they never said anything about it before so I was very confused. She calls me Into the office and tells me that she giving me a written warning and deducing my pay down to $8.75 instead of $9.25 so evidently I was upset. Then 2 days after that I get sent home early even tho I was the late shift that day because I didn’t help my co worker with something she asked help for. I ask my manager why she’s writing me up and sending me home and she tells me because I ‘disobeyed an order because she told my co worker to ask me to show her how to restock the makeline’. My coworker never asked to be shown or told me that she didn’t know, if my manager would’ve come up to me and asked me to do it i would’ve done it in a heartbeat. And just today she sends the new schedule out and I’m only scheduled for one day out of the whole week. I don’t know what to do, I’m thinking about speaking with corporate or a general manager about this because I don’t feel like I deserve this treatment when I didn’t do anything to the manager, I even tried staying quiet and not talking to anyone at work all day and just doing my job and still I get in trouble for something. I don’t know what to do if anyone can help it’d be greatly appreciated thanks y’all. (P.s. my friend that is my coworker thinks it’s a race thing because I’m Mexican. I’m personally trying my hardest not to look at it that way but from the fact that me and my white co worker were both cursing, I was the only one who got called in, got a written warning, and a pay deduction.)",31Jan2020,1

This guy that I liked for so long happened to be on Tinder and we hit it off so well he ended up coming over to my place. It was my first time to be alone with him and he was so intimate and told me I’m pretty! We went on a date! We had sex! We cuddled! We spoke for hours about life! 

I’m not the clingy type so I didn’t text him due to the 3 day rule at the very least. 
I went oversees to see family and so did he. Surprisingly, he texted me when I was in japan asking me how I’m doing etc. I got him a gift from Japan and when I was finally back, he texted me he’s back as well and wanted to give me tea since it’s his favorite therefore wanted me to try it. I thought that was so sweet! I invited him over afterwards and ever since then... NOTHING. It’s been 2 weeks. How can you do this to me!! &lt;/3 Why to people ghost? :(",31Jan2020,1
278,"Essentially, I tend to make a lot of dirty jokes. I just find them funny because of the sexual innuendo and hope the reciever of the joke also enjoys it. **HOWEVER**

Most female teenagers dont enjoy it. I'm not looking to get laid or have casual sex like a lot of people I know. I've had opportunities in the past and have done sexual stuff but havent had sex yet because I want to have a meaningful experience, with love and care. I want to change this dirty joke attitude I have because I feel like people think I am simply looking to turn a conversation sexual, when I just enjoy a joke. 

Unfortunately, I'm not very good with jokes in general, so my best jokes probably are dirty ones. 

I read a study involving adult females judging a guy based on a clean, or dirty joke on his tinder profile. The ones with dirty jokes who were considered attractive were more likely to be a hookup or one time fling, than the unattractive males. And the one's who had clean jokes were looked at as better relationship material.

How can I change to come off as less of a creep, and more of a charismatic and funny person? How can I get rid of my habit of cracking dirty jokes even in the most inappropriate of situations (pun not intended lol see the problem?). How do I learn how to make a properly timed and efficiently executed joke that isn't sexual, dark, or disturbing, and simply makes a person, whether male, female, friend, acquaintance, or crush have a genuine laugh?

281,So this Thursday night I've been faced with a dilemma. Might sound stupid once I''ve written it to reddit but I have to at least give it a try because my brain is having a stroke right now. So I've had plans with my buddy to do a group activity for a week or two now. Been solid plans. Tonight my good friend asked me to hang out on the same night for drinks and food. Unfortunately he's been going through a very sudden and unwanted divorce and it's been ruining him for a month. I have been offering to hang out pretty much any time he's available but it's been difficult with his kids and house sale preparations. He's been giving off weird vibes with me and it's killing me that there might not be another time in the near future to hang out with him but I don't want to bail on my other friend after having done so in the past. I feel like no matter what I'm gonna be a shitty friend to someone.,31Jan2020,1
282,"My friend was asked out about 3 months ago by a boy who she only had one interaction with during a field trip and apparently he had been watching over her since that interaction. He had been watching her for so long to the point he knew she had no boyfriend, so when she used that as an excuse he shot that excuse down and later threatened to kill himself. She reported it to the counselors and they said that they would later talk to him. 

Recently she has noticed that he's been everywhere that she is and noticed him following her. She thought that after 3 months he'd no longer bother her, but it's getting to the point where she's getting paranoid. What advice would you give us? 

We're thinking of reporting him again, but this time for her safety

She said she would always love me and never leave me, that she loved me with all of her heart. The night she dumped me she revealed she didn’t love me romantically at all during it, only the night we got together. It just hurts so much since it was my first relationship ever. Her saying that made me realize how I watched her fall out of love with me. When I alerted her we’ve been together for 4 months she just said, “That’s today?” All the times she treated me like I was just a nuisance or something. The times she didn’t even like me touching her even though she’s a very touchy person sometimes. It was even worse when I asked her if I would ever be good enough for anyone and she just shrugged. We are still good friends but it is just hard to get over her romantically.",31Jan2020,1

286,"So I (F/18) live in Texas and right now, and I've just been accepted into a college that I was really excited about.  I was super happy and flipped out, even more, when I found out that I had earned an $11,000 scholarship from them.  My problem though is this, the college is in California and while I'm fine with that the fact is, is that it's expensive.  My admission advisor though told my father and I about how the college offers a Summer 2020 program that helps take off a couple of grand of the tuition.  I then became slightly nervous, but then totally freaked internally when the lady told me that based on my graduation date I would only spend 2 weeks with my friends &amp; family after graduation before flying over to start school in California.

I don't mean to sound like a baby but I love my family and small group of friends, and I'm scared of the thought of leaving them in 2 weeks after graduation.  I told my teacher about it, and they said that I obviously didn't want to leave my loved ones so soon, but on the flip side my Dad said that I was just getting ""nervous"" and that ""I'd have to leave the house someday"" and a part of me feels awful because I know that by starting school in the summer I'd help my family save money, but I then lose the last chance to hang and be with the people I love the most.

TLDR: I could be moving away from home 2 weeks after I graduate high school, and I'm scared because I don't want to miss out hanging with my friends and family (very stressed)",31Jan2020,1
287,"I (m21) caught my gf(F20) in a lie.

This kinda thing gives me a lot of anxiety because I’ve been in a LDR in the past where 9 months in I found out that the girl I was dating had another boyfriend there and I was being far too trusting. Also I have serious confidence issues (but that’s another issue)

I have a very hard time saying I love you and actually meaning it. And an even harder time responding to people telling me I love you. Last time it happened (someone told me they loved me), my first instinct was to beg the person to not say that again, but the person kept on so, and I was begging the other to stop saying because I was so uncomfortable, not because it was awkward, because I think that I genuinely loved her too. And I didn’t realize that until much later. The “love you”s from my family don’t mean anything to me, just a very blank statement, even though I know they mean it (and I always realize that I never answer back to “I love you” instinctively).

289,"TLDR: A university colleague constantly tried to take over my work during our first co-op term at the same company, making my first co-op experience very dreadful. They continue to annoy me at university after the co-op term has come to an end. This has been going on for about 5 months now and I could really use some advice.  

Hey everyone! I have been having issues with a colleague for the past 4 months and I could really use some advice on what to do. A bit of background, me and this person (Person A), are enrolled in the same university studying the same program. Part of our university program involves doing co-op terms, and we both ended up being hired at the same company (Company X) for our first co-op. Even though we were both hired at the same place, we both had different supervisors and were working on completely different projects. At first, Person A seemed very nice and friendly with me. But then I noticed Person A would always start coming over to my office to check out what I was working on. Then Person A would do some research about the projects I’m working on and come show off the next day to both my and their supervisor about how “knowledgeable” and “interested” they are in my project. I should mention that both my and Person A’s  supervisors gave us a list of projects to choose from, and Person A got the first pick. If Person A was soooooo interested in my project, they could’ve just chose to work on it in the first place. Whenever I had a site visit related to my project, Person A would ask their supervisor if they could go with me to “gain more experience in other fields”. Then during these site visits Person A literally takes the lead and acts like it’s their project. I am a very antisocial person, while Person A is much more outgoing, so I didn’t really know what to do when Person A did things like that and just kept quite like nothing happened. This cycle of Person A trying to take over my work and showing off in front of MY supervisor asking them for more work repeated everyday. Ironically, Person A asks my supervisor for more work when they can’t even figure out their own project to begin with. I even found out from Person A’s supervisor that they never ended up finishing the project they were assigned (or even came close to finishing it). Person A made my first co-op experience dreadful to the extent that I was counting the days until my co-op term comes to an end in my second week in! I thought all this hell would be over once we’re back to university but noooo I was wrong. In university, whenever person A sees me nearby, they would mention to their group of friends how Company X called them again wanting to hire them for another co-op term, and say a bunch of other BS around those lines. Literally EVERY time I’m around, she’d casually start talking about company X. Whenever Person A does that I just act like I can’t hear anything and continue talking with my group of friends. That seems to intimidate Person A enough and they eventually shut up. I just wish Person A could just mind their own business and leave me alone. I’m so done with them and can’t take their childish behaviour anymore. If only Person A could just forget about me and take the hint that I couldn’t care less about what goes on in their life.",31Jan2020,1

293,"Gonna try to keep this short. I’m a generally, shy introverted guy. In high school I mostly kept to myself and didn’t interact much with others. I decided to change that in college and have been met with good success in making a ton of friends. I mostly hang out with my main friend group regularly and we all are pretty close. Despite all this I’m still quite introverted and don’t go out as often as my friends in things like parties and clubs. In terms of dating, I’m still not very confident and have decided to focus on studies for now and maybe worry about that later. (Something i need to work on). At this point however most my friends are in relationships and they’ve started to worry about me. At first it was here and there remarks like “I can set you up with this person” and then escalated to “why don’t you have a girlfriend yet?” Last night it got pretty bad. We were all hanging out, about ten of us and my dating life (or lack of) became the topic of the conversation. I started to get annoyed that they wouldn’t stop and then things got a bit heated which led to one of my friends calling me a closet incel. As if that’s the only reasonable explanation for me not having a girlfriend. They all exchanged looks and I could tell all of them have discussed this about behind my back.

296,"This throwaway is for anything that I'm ashamed of that I wouldn't want my friends or family to either see or know about in general. 

The specifics on these bad habits and choices of mine will be below my question.

There are a few things I do that I'm not proud of. Things that Wish I didn't do, but I just can't seem to not stop doing. Two of which I will also seek help on in other subs. Most of the time I just do them out of habit, without even realizing I've done it until it's too late. And then on fewer occasions, after the realization, I'll proceed to do it again, and forget that I want to stop until it is, again, too late. And these choices/habits of mine are slowly chipping away at either my finances, family ties, and worth. 

I know I want to stop at heart, yet there are parts of me that convince me to do otherwise, parts that justify my actions.  I rationalize it, and almost did so in this post by saying that ""what I'm doing isn't necessarily wrong"". It's wrong to ME, but no matter how hard I try, I keep doing it. I might take a break from it for an insignificant amount of time, either to me or to those affected, but I always come back to it. I'm always the first to tell someone that it's easy to stop, but in this, I'm a hypocrite. 

How do I save myself from crushing myself under my bad habits and choices? 

The bad choices and habits that come to mind:

Porn and masturbating. Enough said really. I try, or at least I tell myself I try, to get off of it. I delete all of the ones I have bookmarked. I try and watch other things to take my mind off of it. Yet at some point I always go back to it. In the moment, I love doing it, but afterward I hate it. This also applies to the next one

Paying for nudes, going to strip clubs, and the like. It should be easy to simply stop giving my money away to see naked women, but it's not. Maybe it is, but I keep doing it. And thankfully I'm not close to being in danger (financially), but I don't want it to get there. 

Arguing with my mother over stupid shit, and watching her have a meltdown afterward. This is probably the most important to me. I hate this. Randomly, on almost every topic it seems, I will question my mother on something she said, and that quickly devolves into an argument, which never fails to turn into her having a meltdown and telling about how I hate her, how I and others are killing her mentally, how she's 40 and shouldn't be dealing with this. She says that she always tries to end the argument before it begins, but I NEVER hear her say anything to do so. I'm not sure my or her version of events is warped. It doesn't matter really. She completely lacks any form of patience, and because of that, when I question her on anything, I'd say there's a 1/7 chance it will become everything I just said above. I blame myself because if I don't question her, this won't happen. My questions are more akin to not understanding or agreeing with her opinion on topics unrelated to either of us personally than questioning her authority. Yes I still live with her, but I have plans to move out with a few good friends of mine. The only wait is them switching jobs. 

Not getting off my ass and doing things Ive planned to do. I'm slowly making progress here, so it's not as big of an issue as it used to be. I'm doing things one at a time that bring me closer to getting on with my life as an adult. But anything to increase this is still helpful and welcome, so I'm putting this on the list as well.

This is a lot, and I dont know if I'll get a response because of this, but I needed to get it all off my chest and to cry for help. I'm tired of doing things I'm ashamed of, and doing things that chip away at my life, all before I've really started my life",31Jan2020,1
297,"Hi r/Advice. I much appreciate anyone's brutally honest advice on how I might proceed.

I've just ""graduated"" college... kind of, with a degree I don't want to use (music teacher). The reason I say kind of is because the university won't give me my diploma until I pay off the last semester's balance, which must be paid in full by April, else they send me to a collection agency (without a degree). I can't go into teaching, even if I wanted to, without that degree, and I'm not allowed to take the certification tests to become a teacher in my state without the university's approval, which they won't do if I owe them money. Ah... well. 

I've given up all hope on spending my life doing something I love. I thought I loved music and people enough to teach, but let me tell you, teaching is nothing like you think it is, if you're not a teacher. Hell, I'd teach anything to pay off this debt. 

I went to the military, but they wanted me to lie about past drug usage that would have been a DQ. I felt that'd be an unethical thing to do, and so I discontinued the process. Same issue with law enforcement and such, which I feel I also would have been happy doing, and would have been a survivable wage.

In the best case scenario, I'd be doing something that serves people directly. So I looked at CPS, but for that you need to travel in your own vehicle, and mine's about to crap out. 

I took up being a substitute in the district I just did clinical teaching at, but it pays almost minimum wage. There's no way I will be able to pay my debts in the time I must, even if I were able to sub full-time, which I can't (the assignments just don't come in every day).  

I looked for other government jobs. Post office, for example. No luck. I've applied to entry-level positions everywhere I can think of. Solar installation. Banks. Contracted IT. No luck. Tradesmen jobs don't seem to pay you for training or licensing. 

I'm just... I feel utterly stuck. No passions anymore. No prospects. Weighted with imminent debt. I don't know what to do. What should I do? Or can I do? I feel like I'm not thinking clearly enough to be able to sort this out. Should I go to the oil fields? Are there any ""tough it out, get on your feet and figure it out by then"" jobs out there, that pay more than god damned $7.25 an hour? I'll be taking another retail or food service job soon, at least to minimize the impact of the impending debt, but hopefully someone out there knows of something I haven't thought of where I can get a good start into... something.

When I got to my next class, the professor from the previous class was still there and was gathering his things. As a side note, the classroom is really small. I sit in the very front of the room and start settling down. As I take my things out, I look up at the board and it's a picture of a map of Africa. As I'm reading it, the professor says to me, ""Are you mad?"". I had music playing but it wasn't really loud so I wasn't sure if I heard him correctly and politely asked, ""Sorry, what was that?"" and he repeated himself and added how I looked mad when I saw the map. I laughed awkwardly and told him no, I was just tired and hungry. 

I go back to taking my stuff out and he says, "" You know that's a map of Africa, right?"" And I said yes. He continued and asked ""Do you not like Africans?"" I said, ""Well, I have no reason not to so no"". After that, he said ""Do you hate black people?"" and reiterated "" Because you looked mad when you saw the map of Africa so you must hate Africa and Africans"". I was caught off guard at this point so I just said no and looked down at my phone, trying to avoid any further conversation with him. After a few more minutes, he left. 

I told the situation to some friends and I got mixed feedback. One told me that maybe this wasn't the first time he's had to deal with this but I personally feel like even if he did have previous issues with this, he came about it in a really unprofessional way and I honestly felt like I didn't do anything to provoke other than seeming ""mad"" to him. Another friend told me to report him and I kind of want to but I also feel kind of bad if I do? If he had simply apologized, I would've probably dropped it but he just walked out of the room without saying anything further.

Any advice on my situation is greatly appreciated :)",31Jan2020,1

Then there is this other emotional side that simply won’t allow that to just be. I’ll look for any excuse in private as to why this happiness can’t last and make myself miserable every night. I’ll look for confirmation bias that no one likes people where my parents are from (Haiti), that my hair isn’t good enough because it’s 4c even though it’s styled into waves, that I’m not cut enough in my weight,that I’m not smart enough, that I’m not experienced enough with relationships

My OC can get really dark at times, but their relationship helps stop it from getting too depressing, which is important for me as I have a bad habit of over empathising with fictional characters (I was unable to function for a month after I read Sirius Black dying)

So that online friends IRL girlfriend is apparently slightly jealous of their relationship. He says he has explained it to her that they are not real, and that it is just a pretend story but she still doesn’t take it that well. He is thinks that given time his gf might chill out a little on the matter but he’s not sure.

If he’s girlfriend doesn’t budge on the issue, I might have to stop RPing that character.

315,"This is going to be a very long read and I apologise for that

I'll start with a bit of a backstory before I can get into the present situation. Some details will be left vague to maintain anonymity.

About two years ago, ~May 2018, I was single and desperate and dumb and ended up hooking up with someone I met on a mobile app. After cutting things off, I was being spammed with emails and money requests over various apps from this person which I disregarded (they knew my email because I sent them some money to get food once). I closed off connections as best as I could (couldn't block on the money apps and emails were forwarded to spam) and I thought all was over.

A few months later I was cleaning out my spam emails (mostly to check that stuff wasn't misplaced) and noticed an email from the girl stating that she was pregnant and needed money for an abortion. I did what I felt was the right thing and sent her the money so she could get the procedure (I had no proof of the pregnancy or the abortion, but when I did ask for proof I was told that the test was lost).

Fast forward probably a week or two and she emails me again that the abortion didn't take and she needs to go back (I think she said that the pill they gave her didn't work, so they were trying the other method now?). I sent the money over once more and was told that all was done.

That was pretty much the last contact I made with her, but she continued to spam me with emails and money requests for various reasons (some were because she claimed she had cancer and needed money to get treatment). I never responded because they felt really con-artisty. Many emails (still in spam and still not responding to any of them) and many various excuses later we are brought to present day where I recently got another request for money and an email saying that she never got the abortion and I have a child. 

I haven't responded to anything, and don't really intend to because I don't believe the past stories she's told me, and this one seems unlikely as well (like I said, I haven't seen her in nearly 2 years, why would she just tell me this now)

I don't have a clue what to do about this situation, but it's causing me to freak out a lot. If her story is true, I want to do the right thing and provide financial assistance, but don't want to be anywhere near her for so many reasons.

Is there a way for me to check the validity of her claim without making contact with her?

I asked her why she was so different towards me now and she explained how her (very) recent suicide attempt was what made her appreciate me so much more and she showered me in apologies for the subpar friend she was that I persevered through for months and months. She explained how me being there through all those months has made me one of the most important people to her. How I make her so happy and she is indefinitely grateful for being my friend.

So, I have this friend—we’ll call him....Timothy—who recently went on a trip to India and then Switzerland right afterwards. We’re pretty acquainted friends, but I wouldn’t say THAT close (like, not one of my best friends). He asked me before he left if I wanted anything from India or Switzerland. I didn’t really have any specific requests or things I wanted, so I told him it was OK and that I appreciated him asking. This was about two weeks before he actually left for the trip.
Over the course of the two weeks leading up to his departure, he asks me again a couple of times if I’m sure I don’t want anything. I honestly don’t, so I told him that it was REALLY OKAY and that he didn’t need to get me anything. Again, I thanked him for the offer.
Departure day comes and he leaves. I wish him to have fun in India and Switzerland, promising to update him on everything he’s missing in school so that he can keep up with what he can while he’s away. I share two classes with him, so I usually update him once every two days on what we’ve done in those two classes and what he might want to take a look at. 
Now here’s my problem. Timothy, despite me repeatedly telling him that he doesn’t need to get me anything from India or Switzerland, went ahead and bought me something from India (books, if you’re curious...apparently this particular series is only available there?). I feel obliged to repay him somehow, since he spent the time, effort, and money to pick out a gift. I was going to just repay him the cost of the books, but I don’t know how much they are and it would probably be very awkward if I asked him the cost. So I was considering other options of repaying him, such as through my own gift to him, but I don’t know what to give. Then I started wondering, should I repay him? I mean, I told him he didn’t need to get me anything, but he did, so it’s not really my fault? I don’t know—I’m not trying to sound like an a-hole here, but I really don’t know what to do....

337,"I’m looking for advice in ethics, diplomacy and pragmatism. Please excuse length but I could use some outside perspective. 

Context:

There is a new manager at my place of work. This person has really bad people skills but is incredibly intelligent. This person is not my boss but we both report to the C.O.O.. We have a history of getting into professional and constructive arguments about strategy and what not. We do not really see eye to eye but I would say we don’t let that get in the way of getting the job done. But Everyone pretty much hates this manager except for the C.O.O.. Also this hated manager’s father is a investor in the company we work for. Not a majority share holder or anything but still. 

I’ve been hearing rumors from disgruntled employees that this manager was doing things, not illegal but shady and definitely outside of company SOP. At the time I sort of chalked it up to thinking that people were making stuff up about the manager to somehow get this person tarnished or fired. But not because said activity was actually happening. After the fifth report I thought that it was worth actually looking into. 

The security/compliance officer was a coworker I got along with very well. The officer wasn’t a hard liner, meaning I could confide in this person without it being  on record. I told about the situation and that 5 different employees have mentioned this said activity. Compliance officer also does not like this manager. We both understood that there was credibility to the story but we couldn’t really talk about it until we had evidence. We both agreed that it is still possible that this is just an rumor about a manger that everyone hates and isn’t true. At this point we felt no reason to involve the C.O.O.. 

After Camera review this rumored activity turned out to be true but was being enacted by another employee, not the hated manager. Compliance office opened an investigation and officially informed HR. 

Compliance officer puts in two weeks notice, which is really short notice for our industry. Position has since not been replaced, unusual for our industry. 

Flash forward three weeks later.
The next day I get a call from the former compliance officer. The old coworker confided in me. Told me the the HR director reached out and said that 5 employees had written anonymously saying that the hated manager put an employee up to the task that was shady and outside SOP. The HR director told C.O.O.. HR director now nervous about own job security. Didn’t really provide enough evidence about hated manger but rather shared “company gossip” in C.O.O.’s mind. 

I’m of the mindset that even if this whole thing is not true, enough employees think it is and that’s bad enough. But it is true I believe.

Private investigator came to help draw more evidence. Employee that was caught on camera got fired. Pretty bad moral in a company with a staff of 400. Everyone is wondering why manager didn’t get fired too. My time for damage control on employees. And lots of questions for myself.

Advice time. 

Is it worth brining this up anymore? I’m pretty sure this hated manager is bullet proof and crossing him could get me out of a job. What is the diplomatic approach here while keeping my ethics straight?

Should I bother to collect evidence to say “caught you red handed!” . I don’t think that will really protect me....Me or my father is not an investor.

I hate that this manager put a hard working employee up to a task and got the person fired. Never once stood up and said “ that was my call”.

Should I quit a very well paying job for this? 
Where is the line? Do people get away with evil things all the time and I shouldn’t quit my job every time it happens? Is there a way to keep my job and ethics?",31Jan2020,1

She assumes that all people know when she needs help, and will stop what they’re doing and run to help her. She talks down to me and makes me feel like I’m stupid, even though I go to a very prestigious private school, that I got a scholarship to. She threatens to hit me, and when I don’t react, she gets more mad. She goes absolutely ballistic when I lock my door (which only happens accidentally). She throws away stuff that I paid for, with my own money. She micromanages everything I do, wether it’s rocket science or looking at rocks. She gets mad when I don’t want her to get involved with my life, and continues to get involved. She acts like a completely different person in front of other people.

348,"Hi all,

I'm a rising junior (class of 2022) in the US and I've found myself in a pickle. My parents are divorced and share custody of me. My mother just got a job on the other side of the country and is moving there with my little sister (11). I was given the choice of staying here with my dad or moving with my mom. If I move with my mom, my dad will move as well. I'm at a total loss at this point. Here's the pros and cons:

Moving PROS:

I stay near my mom whom I love very much, I stay near my sister whom I also love, I stay with my dog whom I love more than life itself (I would literally die for my dog. He's my best friend and thinking about not being with him brings tears to my eyes)

Moving CONS

I don't like new environments (I have severe anxiety and new environments/people worsen it significantly), the school I would be going to seems strict and unpleasant, I know no one in the new state, its very humid there and I hate humidity, its also very warm there and I don't like hot places, I have no knowledge about this place

Staying PROS:

I would stay in the same environment, I could keep my friends, I could stay at my school (which I really really like. Its perfect for me), I could continue my education uninterrupted (I'm in high school and I really don't want to deal with new graduation requirements and different classes),  I like the weather here, I like the people here, I know everything about this place

Staying CONS:

I would have to live with my grandmother because she lives with my dad (She's mean, overwhelming, and drives me insane), my dad has anger issues and I'm afraid he'll get sick of me and our relationship will deteriorate, I'll be missing 3/4 of my family, my dog could hypothetically die while I'm living away from him which would absolutely kill me, I have pretty bad separation anxiety and I don't wanna live away from my mom",31Jan2020,1
349,"Backstory: I just talked a close friend of mine about the fact that I haven't been invited to any friendship events like birthdays, Christmas etc. One particular event I'm asking about is Friendsgiving. I'm asking about this because I planned a hang out with two of my friends about 4 days before Friendsgiving. Everything was going well and then they mentioned Friendsgiving and they were talking about it right next to me and they didn't invite me at all. I was invited last year so it did leave me confused. 

The reason it bothers me is because we were talking about how I should be a more active friend and that she recognizes that I attempt to be. The hang out that I planned 4 days before Friendsgiving was a huge a attempt on my part and I'm confused as to why it wasn't reciprocated by them suggesting either another hangout or a last minute invite to friendsgiving. 

 I have the text messages here and you can let me know if I'm in the wrong or any advice. I'm overall fairly confused. 
Also we were already have a huge discussion about our friendship and I briefly mentioned Friendsgiving. I brought it up again bc I wanted to have a concise conversation about it in order to move on from it.

352,"Hi all,

I've been struggling looking for the right engagement ring for my girlfriend. Our anniversary is coming up and I'm looking to propose either by then or within the next few weeks. Things I kept in mind were the following:

* My girlfriend is a simple girl. No frills, low maintenance. But effortlessly beautiful nonetheless.
* She was engaged before, but her ex only gave her a family heirloom (ring came from her ex's grandmother). She says she doesn't consider this as a proper engagement ring or even a gift, since it was only passed on to her and not something the guy actually picked.
* I'm a bit low on budget, and for this ring, I can probably only spend up to 150 USD converted to our currency. Not because I'm a cheapskate, but because I've already spent a bit on her over the past months paying off some of her family's debt. Still have to buy a few things for her, too. So I'm a little short on cash. (Just to clarify: She didn't ask for help, never really asked me to buy her stuff either. I chose to help, I chose to spend)

Finally managed to find something I think she'd like, but I'm not too sure if she'd appreciate it as an engagement ring. Link to the said ring is below:

[https://i.imgur.com/YglEoo5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YglEoo5.jpg)

Goldsmith describes this ring as a ""thin gold band with three dainty diamonds set directly next to each other and held together by delicate droplets of metal.""

I'm thinking of getting our initials engraved, if that's possible. The ring is at an affordable range, but might come across as too cheap (costs about a hundred USD, which is still a bit pricey in my local currency). Not sure how she'd react and I just don't want her thinking I didn't put any effort in finding her a ring like her ex.

What do you think about the ring? Do you think it's a ring worth giving? Or should I go all out and break the bank for this proposal?",31Jan2020,1

I’ve been recommended anti-depressants and I’ve considered them as I have little to no motivation to do anything. The only thing is, I’ve been working towards a career in Law Enforcement. Teachers and ex-officers have told me that psychological medication makes the process of obtaining a job as an officer that much harder.

360,"So for some Backstory,

I moved in with my partner and this guy hes been friends with for some time. Said friend is very promiscuous (which is neither here nor there but it is relevant.) and ive had the opportunity to make good friends with some of the women he brings around, most of which are great people. BUT after about 3-5 months of living with them and getting to know these girls i found out that a good handful of them have contracted or come into contact with HSV2, which i know for a fact our ""friend"" has had for some years because he told me that from his own mouth. But when i asked these women if they had known that prior to consent, they all told me he never said anything. he had been telling my partner that he was having this conversation with people and staying medicated, which is obviously not the truth. now ive brought all these women together to compare and contrast and as it turns out, he never told anyone about his STD and lied to them when they came to him about contracting it. so my question is, is there anyway i can help these women pursue legal justice or is it just a loss for them that they have to live with for the rest of their lives? 

&amp;#x200B;

its worth noting that we do have text evidence of him admitting to one of them that he did have it, but then he harrassed and gaslighted her/everyone else so much that she decided to just move to another state.

361,"I am a graduating engineering student from the Philippines. And before I graduate, I already have tattoos and piercing on my body and face.

Question is, do you think I will be ""hireable"" given the scenario? Or is it always best to take down the piercings and wear long sleeves to hide my tattoos? Is it also best to not disclose my piercings and tattoos during the medical exam, if there's any?

366,"TL;DR: I graduated from college back in May and I was forced to move back home. I am having a hard time with the transition from college to the adult world and my toxic family is making it worse, I want desperately to get away from them but do not have the means to do so. 

So I am in kind of a complicated situation, before I go into what I've done or not done, First of all I would like to say that I am a flawed human being, I am not perfect and I am here on the sub to ask for thoughtful insight into my situation, not to be put down or judged. 9 months ago, I graduated from college with a degree in History after which I moved back home because I don't really have an alternative. I have struggled with anxiety, particularly social anxiety which was diagnosed by a therapist a few months ago, these problems caused me to skip classes, not make friends or be in any social circles and as a result, my grades suffered. My original plan was to go to law school after college but as of right now, I do not have the grades or the LSAT score to go to law school. This has put me in a precarious situation and because I've only had experience working retail jobs, I found it extremely difficult to find a full time job since graduating college, naturally I applied for jobs that I've had some previous experience in, I got hired as a supervisor at Sam's Club back in July but the problem was that they lied to me about the pay which was much lower than they initially told me and I couldn't make the commute with the gas so I ended up quitting that job.

From about August until November, I was trying extremely hard to find a full time steady job, I went to an interview for a power company job and was extremely nervous when I walked in there and saw that it was a panel interview, ended up not getting the job. I would apply for a job and would get either rejected or no call back. During this whole process, things become extremely tense with my parents, there are points where they get into a fit of rage with me and scream at me to the top of their lungs and I recorded these conversations on my phone. My mom would tell me that im nothing and that Im going to be living under a bridge somewhere and that I am a loser. Whenever I would explain to her what im doing to get a job, she would cut me off and start screaming at me again because shes not interested in having a conversation with me. Around October, I figured out that I could become a teacher with the degree that I do have with a temporary certificate, which allows you to teach for 3 years until you receive permanent certification. So I apply for that and my parents pay for the licensing fee because they want me to get out of their hair. The only problem is that my application would take months to process and this is not acceptable for my situation.

So I panic and start frantically looking for a job on monster and indeed and literally avoiding my parents while im in my own house because I know they will scream at me. Around late November, I see that Walmart has an opening for a pharmacy technician so I apply. I end up getting hired as a pharmacy sales associate which is part time and paid only 11 dollars an hour. I get hired and I tell my mom that I finally have a job, her response? She decides to start screaming at me again saying that im working a loser job that isnt professional and starts making threats towards me like taking away my car and putting me down by saying that im going to be a homeless bum sleeping on the street and questioning my competence. A consistent theme with her is whenever I decide to talk to her about these issues, she talks over me and raises her voice, When I walk away, she follows me into my room like I am a teenager. As for the the job, it drained me because I was on my feet for 8 hours a day, severely understaffed and making only 11 dollars an hour which isnt enough for me to move out and find a place because rent around here runs 1000+ a month. Around December, my parents bought me a plane ticket to go to New York even though I have a severe phobia of planes. I didn't want to go and my mom decided to start world war III with me, screaming at me, threatening to throw me out on the street and since they were still paying for my phone when I was in college, she turned my phone off.  
So I caved and decided to go on the trip with them. As I was leaving to go to the airport, she decided that my suitcase wasn't packed enough and wanted to help me organize it, So she helps me and I reiterate to her that I am going to be late and she tells me that I wont be late. I get to the airport and sure enough, they told me that I missed the flight, I call my stepdad and her and they start screaming at me again on the phone putting me down like a dog and said that I better find a way to New York or else I wouldn't be able to go back home. So I get the flight re scheduled to an airport that is an hour and a half away and drive there to fly to New York. I did my best to avoid them while on the trip because my girlfriend was with me.

We fly back from the trip and things were a little uneventful except I caught a nasty virus while I was at the airport and I finally received my teaching certification. I decided to quit the job that I had because I was tired of working while so understaffed with such a low wage and wanted to look for possibly a teaching job or a job that had better hours and higher pay. I know you shouldn't quit a job until you have another one lined up but I couldn't bear it anymore. That was a mistake on my part, anyways I applied for a better, salaried position at Walmart with the store that I worked at in college and my old manager called me back and remembered me from when I used to work there. He sounded happy to hear from me and we scheduled an interview. I also saw that a high school in my area was hiring for a teaching position so I applied and they called me to set up an interview. I told my sister about Walmart and she told my mom. My mom says ""I hear that you scheduled an interview at Walmart, what is wrong with you?!"" and she starts screaming at me again and my stepdad tells me to get out in rage again and I refuse to since they have to give me a notice that they want me out since my drivers license address is here and its a civil matter, he threatens to turn the power off in my room and move to another place. Cool heads prevail but I miss the Walmart interview because Im so panicked at this point. I nearly didnt go to the high school interview, but I go and it goes fairly well, they tell me I will receive a call by the end of the week. I never receive a call and they ghost me.

So this is where I'm at now, Im in the process of trying to get hired as a substitute teacher at the district in my area. I may have to work somewhere else until the summer when new teaching jobs start to open for the new year. I have an interview scheduled for Verizon, something that should pay decent. My sister, who is totally on their side without my permission started talking to the principal of a charter school near her to volunteer me for a job. I know my parents would not treat me this way if I had my own place, my own car and my own phone and frankly I am sick of being treated this way, I would almost rather be dead than be in the situation that I am in now and desperately want to move out of here but I simply do not have the means to do so now. I hide in my room all day or go out when they leave the house because I want to avoid them, I know they are going to scream at me and put me down and talk over me and they will never hear me out. They see me as less than which hurts. It is demoralizing to see people my age who are becoming doctors and lawyers and starting families while I am struggling to stay afloat and the people around me are toxic. If you have read this entire essay I've written, thank you for hearing my story and Im sorry that it is so long and I would be willing to answer any follow up questions anyone has for me.",31Jan2020,1
369,"How do I proceed?  

TLDR; friend turned into a stalker, police would not get involved without evidence of his violent threats, i deleted 99% of my online presence and moved out of town to avoid him, i lurked his online profile once after 3 years, the guy suddenly followed my instagram that same night... how did he find me, is there some way he could have tracked my seraches, and how to I proceed??????

Backstory, and I am leaving out sooo many details and events: I became very close friends with a guy.  This friendship went on for nearly a year, if memory serves.  

He became jealous of my boyfriend.  He eventually threatened to hurt bf, even approaching bf at his workplace.  This guy's mother approached me at a local gym and several other places to threaten me for ""leading on"" her son and make nasty comments about my character.

He continued to follow me on social media.  I deleted all my accounts on everything, including my email.  The only thing i kept was my spotify.  He made playlists with long titles trying to convey messages, which I checked continuously to make sure there were no threats to physically harm me.  They were mostly about how he would always love me but there were a few about me just using him to vent, about  being a tease/slut etc.  Nothing violent like he had said to my bf.  I stopped checking his playlists and it brought me some peace.   He slipped my mind.

It has been 3 years.  Today, on a whim, I decided to lurk.  No real reason. Maybe feeling a little anxious after the incident crossed my mind today, and wanting to make sure he wasnt still obsessed with me. I found his facebook.  Nothing of interest. Checked his spotify.  He was still following me and several of my playlists, but no other user accounts.  Whatever, probably forgot to unfollow me after i stopped communication.  No elaborate playlists on his profile directed at me.  This satisfied my curiousity.  I went about my day.

Not twenty minutes after my lurk, I noticed a new follower.  I have less than 50 and mostly close friends.  My heart dropped when I noticed the username was ""killer____"" (killer, then his signature username.) 

His account had no followers and was only following me and three other accounts.  No pictures and the account was brand new. 

I am so f***** freaked out.  Is there some way he could have tracked my searches? What are the chances he found me TODAY on the one day i have lurked him in 3 years? 

Now for the advice:  how do I proceed?",31Jan2020,1

Before him I was spontaneous and very free spirited. Now I want that back. But since he's damaged me quite a bit, I want to take my frustrations out. I know this might sound stupid or weird, but after listening to Maneater by both Nelly Furtado and Hall and Oates I got inspired. I want this period in my life to be fun and dis-attached from any emotion pertaining to men. So guys, how do I become a female fuckboy?

I go and look for jobs and it gets me upset/depressed  knowing that all ill ever be qualified for is Retail/fast food.

383,"I hope this is ok here and isn't too heavy. I just feel sick over this situation, and I can't talk to anyone about it because a. I was sworn to secrecy and b. these are serious accusations, so we wouldn't want to tell others when we're not certain yet.

My mom and I have a mutual friend (we'll call her ""Amy"") who has an 8 year old daughter (""Kate""). Amy has an on again off again relationship with ""Jack,"" who my mom and I also know. Since Amy and Jack's last break up, Jack lives with his mother, ""Mary,"" whom my mom has been friends with for years. Jack has been watching Amy's daughter Kate for her occasionally while Amy's at work.

Mary called my mom this week and told her some things happened the other day that made her suspect Jack may be sexually abusing Kate. I only know what was relayed by my mom, but basically, it was the type of situation that seems too suspicious, but *could* have another explanation. Not something where we're certain that he's doing it, but where it seems that could be a likely explanation.   Jack is not what I would call a good person by any means, but I definitely would never think he would do something like that. Still, things seem too suspicious, and obviously for Kate's sake there's no way in hell we're going to let it go until we find out.

Mary doesn't know Kate much and knows she's more comfortable with my mom, so she asked my mom if we could spend some time with Kate and try to talk to her and see if we can find anything out. I don't know Kate really well and haven't spent a ton of time with her, but I know she likes me and feel she kind of looks up to me, so I'm hoping by some chance she'll feel comfortable to talk. Her real dad is basically out of the picture, and both Kate and Amy don't have much support. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really want to help this poor girl if something is going on. I'm really bad with talking about serious stuff in general and handling this type of thing though, I have Asperger's. I want so badly to let her know and feel like she can trust me and for her to feel comfortable. I just don't know how in the world to go about it. Especially since it's the type of thing where we're not 100% sure, I don't want to start out super obviously asking her if he's done something. Unfortunately Kate clung to Jack and loves him like a father, and he's just generally not a great guy. He's manipulative with others, so I could definitely see him having manipulated Kate and if, god forbid, something is going on, she'll be afraid to talk.

Does anyone have any advice? How should I approach this? What are some things I can do or say that might help her feel more comfortable, safe, and possibly able to open up to me?",31Jan2020,1

393,"I (22m) have been a part of a close-knit group of friends since elementary school. I've realized over the past couple of years that a few of my friends have become more and more racist. 

Things started as lighthearted jokes a few years ago where they'd show me an edgy meme that they saw. Though it made me uncomfortable, I saw that it was a joke and thought that they didn't agree with what they were showing me. Long story short, things escalated more and more until we reached the point we are at today. As of late, we can't go a single extended period of hanging out without them dropping a hard r and expressing how they hate African Americans.  

I've expressed to them before that they've crossed a line when it came to the racism and they apologized and said that they'd cut it out. But then they'd go back to acting the same way whenever we'd hang out the next time. I know that if I gave them an ultimatum the only thing that would change would be that they'd be racist behind my back instead of in front of me. Wherever their hatred is coming from, it's rooted in them and I don't think I can change that.

I'm at a loss. 
It doesn't feel like I'm talking to my friends anymore, and more like I'm talking to a group of closet white supremacists. I'm tired of feeling disappointed in the people that I have so many fond memories with.  It feels like I'm compromising more and more of who I am when I hang out with them now.

I've always hated racists, and if I'd met a stranger who's a racist I'd go out of my way to never see them again. But I just can't do that with my childhood friends.

I understand that it would be best for me if I cut contact, but our memories together and the fear / feelings of loneliness is keeping me from leaving.

395,"Four years ago, I met my current boyfriend. He is ten years older than me. I lost my virginity to him. He was in a relationship at the time we met, and had a two-year-old daughter with his partner, who he was living with. But he kissed me, told me he had fallen in love with me, and told me he was breaking up with her and hadn’t been intimate with her for two years. 

Shortly after that, he told me they had officially broken up, and I started seeing him. We have been a constant in each other’s lives since the day we met, and I have loved him deeply.

But it has been increasingly complicated and painful. I found out he was lying about having broken up with his partner; she was simply staying at her mother’s house temporarily, as her mother was very unwell. 

After this discovery, I spoke to his partner and told her he had been seeing me and had lied to me. He retaliated by cutting off contact and acting like I was the one who had done wrong by having told her. 

Eventually, he got back in touch with me, saying they had finally broken up for real - and I started seeing him again (after doing all I could to make sure he was telling the truth), only to find out he was still lying. He swore that he was simply sharing a house with her and that they had no intimacy, that she was even “seeing other men”, and that their separation was imminent. I said I would wait for him to prove this to me. By this time, we were two years into our “relationship”. He kept talking about our future and how, in just a month, she would truly have moved out, and we could finally be together.

But something felt wrong. And it was wrong. I managed to find out that his partner was pregnant with his baby. I was devastated and in shock and swore I would never speak to him or see him again. We cut contact, even though he kept telling me it had been a huge mistake, that the baby was a result of them having a drunken one night stand, that he still planned to leave her, and so on. I spoke to his partner and she was vicious and said she knew he had been seeing me but she didn’t care because she was “having his baby”. Her exact words were, “You are nothing - I am having his baby, haha”. It made me feel sick.

At this point, it had been three years since we first became involved. I didn’t think I would ever see him again and I started trying to heal and move on with my life. I tried to improve my self-esteem so that I would never let anything like this happen to me again. 

About a month after his new baby son was born, he contacted me, sent me love songs, told me he missed me. I tried to ignore him and dissuade him for several weeks. After having had my heart broken and having dealt with all that pain, finally starting to move on with my life, it just felt like a tease for him to contact me telling me he still loved me. He also started telling me - again - that he was about to break up with his partner. I made screenshots of absolutely everything he said, anticipating that it was all more lies. The past few years had turned me into a completely different person, with zero trust.

I was traveling extensively overseas, but I agreed to see him when I returned, if he could provide absolute concrete proof beyond all doubt that he was for real this time. And he did. He brought me to his house and all his partner’s things were gone. She was gone. He let me stay as long as I wanted. He went through his custody arrangements with me, in depth. For the first time, it felt completely real.

But my ability to trust is now so damaged that I question everything he does, almost daily. He says he loves me and wants me to be his future and we are seeing each other and it seems like it is truly for real, he has even talked about marrying me - but his mother is now terminally ill, and he says the fact that I question him so much is heartless of me when he is going through such a difficult time. He has made me feel I’m being selfish. But he also doesn’t want me to talk to his now ex-partner; I ask if I can confirm with her that everything is true, and he gets angry and snaps and says it will ruin our relationship and possibly ruin his relationship with his children if I make his ex mad by talking to her.

I am so emotionally invested and so close to this situation that I can no longer tell if he is lying. Maybe he is still lying about being broken up - maybe she is just living somewhere else - but how likely is that? I love this man so much and want to be my best self with him, but I can’t stop worrying that he is still lying. I don’t know how to trust him anymore and I don’t know if I’m mad to even be giving this a shot after everything he has already done.

Edited to add - I have never been with or slept with anyone other than him (I am a late bloomer and met him when I was 26). The fact that his mother has mere weeks to live also complicates things as he makes me feel I am wrong to question him about anything right now. He has a history of snapping and being verbally abusive when I challenge his lies. But he can also be very loving and gentle, and everyone who knows him loves him. I am so confused.

tl;dr - my older boyfriend lied to me for years, but now I think he might be telling the truth. Am I wrong to believe him?",31Jan2020,1

Im currently on rotation to South Korea, and before I left, i moved my wife back home. Well now she's in California living with my dad and he's setting her up with all kinds of jobs and opportunities. 

We left each other in September, a month before i was set to come out here and she doesn't want to leave California until around February 2021 (at the earliest), when i get assigned to a new duty location. 

I find it oddly stupid how she wants to get a job out there and keep our family apart (we have a daughter together). She knows i hate the whole long distance thing and I'll hate it even more when I'm back stateside this June, she especially knows physical touch to be one of my top love languages. 

I don't see how we can keep a relationship together when we're not even physically together and her virtual communication skills are that of a potato. I feel completely unattached over here right now and unloved, she even knows all this along with how lonely i feel.

402,"For context I do warranties for the store I work at as some of my key holder duties. Also important that on Sunday my only grandfather passed away suddenly, and we've been planning a memorial, he knows this (though not the exact day of death) and gave me next Sunday off for the memorial. 

So last week my boss (manager) told me he didn't like how I was organizing the warranty binder and he outlined all the ways he wanted me to change how I do it, it's not super complex but it's enough to kinda throw me off since I've been doing it the way I did it before for like 6 months, it takes a bit to get into the habit of doing it how he wants (he's German, and is true to the stereotype of being precise to a fault). 

Anyway on Monday I do the warranties, I make a new category to make filing make more sense, I show it to him and he likes the idea. Today before the end of my shift he takes me in the back and basically tells me that he can't trust me, that he thinks I didn't listen to him, because two pages weren't in the new folder I made, and they didn't have a date written on the back page (a new rule that doesn't really change anything to be honest, it's basically just extraneous information), so he writes me up for it. I can understand if he was disappointed that I didn't do it perfectly, and I actually appreciate being spoken to to iron out the kinks in the new process. But I was pissed that he completely ignores the fact that I was doing it the day after my only grandfather died, that he basically expects me to be a robot unaffected by the sudden death of a lovedone and that he decided to go for the nuclear option on a small and very fixable mistake. 

I don't get paid much at this job, I'm only even here because I like talking to people and using my outdoor experience to help them get the right gear for them and to chat about what they're getting up to, I just graduated with a B.S.c. in Biology and just here to relax in a chill work environment before finding something more serious. In short I no longer feel motivated to stay at a job where the manager can't even be bothered to acknowledge that death may cause people to make small mistakes, if he doesn't care about us why should I care about him?

405,"Hi Reddit, I made a new account for this question for reasons that will become clear.

I’m a male hurtling towards middle aged (not too far to go!) and while I feel quite happy in many areas of my life, I have something of a dilemma when it comes to my relationship. I would greatly appreciate the constructive thoughts and advice of this wonderful community.

I am married with two young children. The children are happy and healthy, I’m glad to say. My issue lies with my spouse. She shows absolutely no affection to me.

When we were dating we had a great relationship and that didn’t change when we got married. Shortly after we were married our first child came along, and things were great between us. There was a period where I suffered extremely badly from depression and it got so bad I had to go to hospital because I couldn’t even speak (this only lasted for a day). I had suffered from depression for a significant period of time and in fact had done so since before my wife and I met, and she was well aware of it, I had been very open about it.

Since she fell pregnant with our second child, she lost all interest in me. I am now without any sexual/romantic contact (apart from the occasional peck on the lips) for over two years. I have tried talking to my wife about it as it is an issue for me but nothing seems to change.

I have expressed that it is important to me that we have a sexual component to our relationship and she pretty much brushes it off.

She started off saying it’s because she is tired all the time. She does take care of our youngest child at night because I honestly can’t cope with a restless child and getting interrupted sleep as it seriously affects my depression and also I can’t manage at work (it’s an important role in the company). My wife has only ever slept 5-6 hours a night and manages well with interrupted sleep. However, despite saying she is too tired for sex, she still manages to play with the children (which is a priority anyway) but also her other hobbies one of which is very physically demanding! She can find energy, it seems, for everything else except me.

When I pushed her further on this, she eventually admitted it’s because she has put on weight since the birth and doesn’t feel sexual at all. She has put on some weight but I find her just as beautiful and attractive and it doesn’t matter to me, which I have tried to make clear to her. She enjoys fitness (running, mostly) but she doesn’t have much time to do it due to work, the children and other commitments she has. I do my best to give her free time by taking the children for a while (I also work a lot) but she never uses it to run, she just cleans the house or watches a film.

To make matters worse, she shows barely any interest in my day to day life. I’m always the one who asks how her day is/was. If I try to chat with her she doesn’t contribute to the conversation. She chats a lot on the phone to her mother and sister so it’s not like she isn’t a chatty person. She seems far more interested in talking to almost anyone else but me. She’s pleasant enough to me, but not particularly interested.

This has become such an issue that I have considered leaving her.  However this would mean I would likely barely see my children as she is incredibly stubborn and would likely do everything she could to be awkward with me. I really don’t want to leave her, I just want some intimacy and someone who is interested in me.

I have received interest from other women who have inadvertently given me an insight into what I’m missing. They want to do things with me, are interested to hear from me and ask how I am and what I’ve been up to. Such a simple thing but I don’t get this from my wife and I wish I did. I could easily pursue a sexual relationship with these women if I wanted to and I have to admit it would certainly be exciting and bring a sexual component back into my life that I badly need, but I don’t want to hurt my wife or live a dishonest life.

I have asked my wife outright what I need to do and she isn’t giving me anything to work with, it feels like she’s either simply not bothered or doesn’t seem to grasp that this is a really important issue to me. It’s like living with a flat mate, she’s not even a particularly good friend to me any more. It’s like she has no interest in sex at all, and she’s not even particularly interested in being nice to me.

I’m now stuck at a point where I feel like I have two choices:

1. Leave my wife. The huge downside here is that I would lose daily contact with my kids (the mornings before work is when I get most of my time with them) and likely I’d end up with one day a week with them, at the weekend.

2. Stay and put up with it. I would face living the rest of my life with no sex, no cuddles or kissing, no hand holding or intimacy. But I would see my kids every day and I love being there and watching them grow (almost literally in front of my eyes, it’s crazy fast!)

Only recently, have I begun feeling better. She, however, is still stuck in terrible mental health. She and I have a common close friend. This close friend told me that his girlfriend left him, so, when I spoke with my ex-girlfriend, I asked if she found out what happened with our friend. She said she hadn't, and then she asked what. I told her it wasn't my place to tell her and that he would tell her when he's ready. She then got pissed at me, saying I was a hypocrite because I talk about her to other people but don't won't talk about this friend. She used the example of when she went manic while on a medication about 8 months ago, I ranted to our common friend about it (we were still dating).

She loves me as much as I love her and it’s evident. She has been sexually abused before. Not raped but still. Very traumatizing. Her father was also not a very good man. Manipulative and selfish and contradicting and a Hippocrate. He is the reason she has trust issues in men. I understand that it will take time to be able to have sex. It would be both of our first times as well so that’s another contribution to the issue. I completely understand. We’ve spoken about it and she brings up trust issues and it’s hard for her and I understand and I’m not angry. I just want my girlfriend to be ok.

417,"I think people exude different levels of approachability and that's totally ok.

Last week, I decorated my room like a princess castle (""Candy Cane Wonderland""). I felt comfortable talking to Ariana and Kenzie about this. I didn't think twice about it. I know they're judgment free. *Even if I didn't know them super well, I could still sense that they were approachable enough for it.*

Michelle is different. She's really nice and we are close, but I would be weirdly intimidated from telling her about Candy Cane Wonderland. She and I joke around with each other. We're friendly. But texting her about Candy Cane Wonderland would be a little weird.

Keep in mind that we're 22.

I have always prided myself in being approachable. If I'm at a party or in class, pretty much anyone can come sit next to me and we can talk. My problem is that I also come off as really approachable to shy weirdos.

In the last month, this guy (who was a stranger until Week 1 of the semester) has consistently tried to make me go on some overnight religious thing with him. We're not even the same religion. I have told him I'm not interested and I have asked him why he doesn't ask someone else to go with him. *He says he's too shy to ask other people.*

This is what's wrong. If you're too shy to ask anyone else, why are you ok with asking me? If this were just about sitting next to me in class, I wouldn't bite. But you can't keep asking me weird requests after I have already said no.

I feel like shy weirdos are afraid of people like Michelle. People like me are shy weirdo magnets.

Even people like Ariana and Kenzie are too intimidating for shy weirdos.

1) She LOVES work. She is all about professional development courses over the summer, she likes to go into work on the weekends (none of us do unless we have have to, but she finds small reasons to go into the office during off-hours). 

2) She frequently criticizes our colleagues' productions. She's not the boss, but she seems to think she can tell other colleagues that they're doing something wrong or if their work isn't up to her idea of standards. She has hinted at meetings that the rest of us need to take professional development courses like her, since she's the only one that does. 

3) She sometimes is hostile towards our boss during staff meetings - she likes to challenge him and there was one time it ended up in a screaming match across the table. 

4) She is rarely happy for other colleague's successes. I once mentioned that my boss gave an enthusiastic congratulations to me and my colleague's superb performance on a specific project, and her only reaction was to pout and whine that our project was well-executed but wasn't exceptionally better than her projects.

430,"(sorry if there are typos. Writing this on my phone)

So, I'm at a loss and I'm not sure how I should proceed.

I had a friend. For sake of privacy we'll call him ""S"". I met him in mid 2010 at university and we clicked instantly! We worked together on our projects and we hung out after classes too. Go drinking, gaming, sharing dank memes and all that basic shit. It was a great friendship and we definitely had each others backs! 

After university we blossomed more. Hanging out when we could. Even between jobs and even when I moved out of my parents house. We still hung out and talked most days. He was indeed my best friend. 

Over time or circle grew. A guy called ""M"" and a lady called ""T"" joined our fold. The times we hung out in the city getting drunk and eating crap were some of the best moments of our lives!

Anyway, in 2016, S and T decided to start dating and myself and M were so happy for them. On the outside nothing changed and we continued to be a fun lil gang. However in 2018 they decided to amicably split and remain as friends. It was sad but we still got on well together. M and S even went on vacation together in summer that year and shared all their pics! The feedback I heard it's they had a great time and bought alot of crappy souvenirs. I couldn't go and T couldn't either as we couldn't afford it.

When they got back, despite the awesome feedback M have on the trip, S only shared a few pics and then went quiet. Our group chat continued as normal... But S wasn't responding. I raised the issue of silence and the others were indeed stumped. 

After messaging him directly he finally got back to me a few weeks later. He cited he was busy at work and had little time to spare. It would explain his lack of posts online but still...

2019 came. Myself, M and T decided to hang out again. We tried to get S involved but we were again greeted by silence...

I tried to reach out again, by phone and by Xbox. But as soon as I messaged him on the service... He blocked me. I'm immediately confused by this... Why? I looked back over the past year in messages and emails, trying to find something that would look like I said something repulsive. I found nothing. The others had no idea...

And at the dawn of 2020, it happened. Blocked on Facebook. All of us. I was extremely confused by this... Very much so... The others were concerned as well, but they took the position of ""oh well...That's life"".

My best friend in this post decade just gone like that. I decided to try one more time to reach out... So I called him.

He answered.

I asked why... And he gave a reason. Though I'm not sure if the validity.

He said I'm still an epic person and thinks of me highly, but he wanted to remove all traces back to T because of all the stress of it all. I fought and pleaded him to reconsider.

I got a solum ""Goodbye buddy"" before he disconnected the call.

I've never known T to me hostile or one of those clingy girlfriends. So his reaction was very confusing to me.

440,"It's a disturbing thought I've had recently. The way we're naturally inclined has a seismic effect on our opportunities.

Ceteris paribus (family wealth/friendship connections, geographical place of birth, era you're born in, etc), an extrovert, and not an introvert, will get the girl/guy, the job, the help when they ask, the invite to the party, the raucous laughter when they say something funny.

Thus, the paths for the extrovert and the introvert diverge on a daily basis.

You guessed it, I'm an introvert. I can't help but think I've compounded the above hurdles by telling myself a story that's only proven to be true because I believe it every time, and reinforce it with my actions.

The introvert will often not even ask for help (that'd mean speaking up), not apply for the job (that would imply a belief in yourself to engage with others consistently and proactively), not regularly see people who might ask them to the party (why would they want to spend time with a near-mute in the first place), not say the thing you find funny (tumbleweed would be awkward), and not have the courage to strike up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex (the vivacious, approachable people are the attractive ones - you're setting yourself up for a fall if you do).

All decisions that can be attributed to their life experience to that point, which goes all the way back to their first memory.

I'm heavily linking introversion with low self-esteem, but I do think they are linked. I believe all the perceived important things in life come with a greater degree of difficulty for the introvert, and that'll never change.

Btw, I'm a 34 year old male. When I was 15, I no doubt pictured myself as ""complete"" by now. I have a loving wife, but (classic) I don't think I deserve her.

I have worked for a startup company for three months, being this my first job. I am a marketing manager there, and I handle a lot of responsibilities but my boss has not been sincere with me. He has sworn that we were going to sign the contract for the three months I've been there, so I have basically been working illegally and without my insurance covered, paying me in cash. In my country, this is a huge deal, and if sued, he would probably lose the company. This has built a lot of resentment and he has tried to manipulate me into not suing. These three months I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety due to this situation.

I gave him an ultimatum and he accepted to make an actual contract, which we would be signing today.

Meanwhile, I started looking for another job, and there is a company that has actually signed me in, as I was waiting for this situation to develop. In this new job, the pay would be 300euros lower, and the responsibilities are less, but now I feel like I am currently working in an uncomfortable environment and I do not tolerate my boss, even with minor issues. I am constantly thinking that he is trying to trick me, as he has been doing so for the previous months. I am not motivated as much, but there is a big difference in the pay between offers. 

Would you enter a new company, with less pay in the seek for mental stability? Or would you rather take the money and try to digest an evil boss?

I dated someone last year for not even 3 months. To keep it short I’m glad it never went on any longer, and ending things with him was the best decision I ever made. 

He fell for me really hard but I honestly didn’t like him the way he liked me (which I told him three times after he persistently asked me to give him a chance in the beginning until I finally gave in). After breaking up with him he literally went crazy and his toxic qualities were madly exacerbated. Suffice to say, leaving that relationship was a very good thing for me and I’d be happy to never have to see him again. 

So right now, I’m currently in a relationship with a guy who I truly see a great future with (honestly it’s so good I keep thinking it’s all just a dream). 

My boyfriend knows the longest relationship I had was 3 months and that my ex went pretty crazy a the end but that’s pretty much it.

458,"For some context; 
My friend is absolutely obsessed with anything associated with Spain. She has been learning spanish for at least nine months on duolingo and just a few weeks ago started actual classes (we're in 7th grade). Me and one another friend have tried to tell her that learning it in school isn't the same as in duolingo and it's going to get harder. We know this because we're both learning russian. She also can't understand that putting spanish ahead of finnish isn't a good idea, because if she doesn't know grammar in her own native language, she'll have a harder time learning it in spanish. I could tell more, but I'm in school right now and don't have the time. 

She's told us multiple times about how she's going to move to Spain the second she turns 18. Me and some other friends have tried to talk her out of it, because she also wants to go to medical school, which is far more expensive there than where we live (Finland). She keeps saying how her parents will just pay for it, or if she can't come up with a response, she'll just say ""well oh no"" sarcastically.

I'm at the same time worried that she's ruining her future and also done with her. We don't know how to convince her that this isn't a good idea, because she won't budge. I do care for her as a friend but if she eventually won't believe that this is not a good idea I'll stop trying and potentially let her ruin her future, if she so badly seems to want it.",31Jan2020,1
459,"Throwaway account.

I'm feeling ashamed and guilty. Backstory is my roomate get along quite well and were quite close. We were at a party and I drank way too much and for whatever reason started saying things that were really angering my roommate. I can't remember quite exactly what I said, I know I did not threaten anything, but I must have personally attacked him in some way. He started saying that i needed to shut up or else, but I egged him on more saying he wouldn't do anything. Then he tried to remove himself from the situation. At that moment something clicked and I realized I was being a complete asshole to him, so I stupidly followed him with the intention of trying to mend things there and then. As he was at the entrance he turned around and tackled me to the ground and began punching me and shouting at me. People pulled him off me and they wanted for us to shake hands and go out. Neither of us could, and I felt like his violence was being under emphasized. So I stayed home.

Now in a clearer state of mind I feel guilty and ashamed that I said whatever I said. It's shown me I need to change my drinking habits, this is the first time I (think) I've lost a friend over it. I just don't know what to do. I feel the violence is not justified, but I can't help feel that maybe I deserved it or had it coming. I feel so small and weak and am confused on how to approach the situation with him. I want to talk to him, but I feel he might (understandably) not want to make amends. But then on the other hand I'm not sure I want to either. To further complicate things we share many mutual friends and I'm scared that they'll want us to just ""be good"" again and won't consider the violence that I endured. But again, part of me feels that maybe they are right and if I just wasn't so blatantly stupid in saying those things this never would have happened. I guess I'm not really sure what to ask, but what can I do to move forward with him and myself?",31Jan2020,1
460,"Long story but going to make this as short as possible. Been with my gf for 12 years. Her grandpa died (her moms dad). Her mom and stepdad absolutely hate me. Have hated me for our entire relationship because my family isn’t rich like theirs and they do not like my career at all (I shoot music videos/commercials for a living). I live in a somewhat small town and hear every few months that they are saying very horrible things about me that they are 100% making up. I have tried to talk to them very politely and it never helps. I have always been polite but things always come back to the fact that they think I’m poor and not a good person. It makes me sad, it makes my gf sad and now with my girlfriends grandpas funeral coming up things got worse. Her mom said she did not want me at the funeral/ Celebration of life at all even though she knew my gf wanted me there for support. My girlfriend, girlfriends grandma, aunt, uncle and cousins all love me and said they want me there so now I am going 100% per my gf’s request. Going to be about 200 people at the celebration of life. My question is, do I go up to my girlfriends mom/ stepdad and tell them thank you for having me and sorry for your loss or avoid them the entire time? I lost my dad myself when I was younger and wouldn’t have wanted someone I hated to come up to me and act like we were close but at the same time I know they won’t be happy either way so I’m really confused.

461,"This story begins early last year, I'm [20M] and my life essentially turned upside down (rape, cult, quit job, new job won't pay, mental breakdown, self harm, narcissistic parents, narcissistic gf, cheated out of tuition funds, dropped out college). They don't want me here and gave me a deadline of new year's to get out their house. However I'm still here because they began building a new section to the house and they have been using me as labour.  Doing this cripples my ability to go around job hunting (going in person seems to be the most effective method here). My friend has suggested that I quit helping them because when it's done they'll fuck me over, plus they aren't paying me. Though if I just focused getting a job I believe they'll still throw me out but faster.
Idk what to do, everything is taking so long because I possess no marketable skills, talents or qualities. I don't want to do the jobs I was in before, they didn't fit well with my fragile state of mind(as well as encouraging mental laziness) soo I've been avoiding them.

462,"I (17M) am leaving my toxic family because of their constant emotional abuse and having to live in constant anxiety. 

Okay, to start off I have never told anyone about my feeling or opened up to anybody emotionally out of fear of my parents finding out. I've always been quite private and needed to get this off my chest because this has been weighing on me ever since I've had it planned out. Before I forget, I am also diagnosed with insomnia, severe social anxiety and depression. Oh and we also live in Hawaii. 

My parents or more specifically my stepdad has always been conservative, wanting me to do whatever they say at the very moment, choosing my career path, and treating me as if i'm their maid or something. For the record, I haven't always been the best kid growing up and was always looked down upon for doing things unconventional and different to the way he was taught as a kid. I decided to change this and went to a boarding school for 6 months that required me to be away from home in that time. I finished and never felt better about life and continued doing things to help me get farther for my career and education. 

He was proud of me for the first time in my life and I was hoping he would change with the times to get closer with him. That was just wishful thinking because he told me I could open up to him about anything and I took 3 hours with him to talk about my time with attempted suicides, self harm and irregular thoughts. He proceeded to try to give me advice dodging all the talk about my mental illness.  

Bringing me to my next point, losing my job. Long story short: someone F\*\*\*ed me over and I was either forced to resign or get fired. I chose to resign and never told my parents for about a week until I mustered up the courage to tell them. As I had feared, he told me it was my fault and I would never get far in life if I can't keep a simple job. Even telling him the reason over again, he shut me down immediately. 

So far it's been about a month since I resigned and when I got a job offer at a computer shop he told me ""HELL NO, you're not getting a job anymore till I say you can. Your job is here at the house where you'll be cleaning till this house is spotless”. Disappointed I spent today fixing up the whole house for him to just yell at me again because its not to his standards. I can't win with him. Everything I do is wrong and he always slanders me comparing me to other kids and the usual “ you have it so good, other kids would die to be in your situation, while you wallow in self pity crying about killing yourself.” 

So I planned to move to Canada with my extended family. I transferred my credits, Talked to one them about moving with them and they said yes and would help me when the time comes.
 
Sorry for dragging it out so long. I didn’t really know the format and any advice would be appreciated.

463,"So, My boyfriend  has been living here with me in our own little home for the past 10 months.. (originally we met online and visted each other back and forth before he moved up to Scotland, he stayed in England. A few weeks ago he got some news that his dad was in an accident and so he went back to England a few days ago. He was only supposed to be gone 2 weeks, he then told me a day after he was in England that he might not be coming back.. and that he wants to stay in England and he didn’t know if he saw me in the bigger picture because of flaws on both ends.. he then decided that he did want me to remain in his life but he wanted me to move in with his and his dad (his dad needs looking after after the accident) down in England.. my ultimatum is I lose the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with that I love with all my heart.. or moving away from here which I have a job I adore my best friend of 10 years and her daughter that stay here.

464,"I recently made the decision to move 9 hours away to stay with extended family. This decision comes after a bad break up that has left me devastated.

For some quick background, I am early-mid twenties. I currently live with my parents. I have struggled with depression pretty heavily in my teens and into my adult life, and it played a part in my recent break up.

As the break up was happening, I immediately made the decision to move away. I told my ex I was leaving. The next day I called my family. To me it felt like a quick fix to all my problems, to just leave. I only intended on leaving for up to a year, max. 

About a week has past since these events, I’ve had some time to calm down and think. My mind feels like it is slowly returning to a much clearer place. 

My original reasons for leaving now seem very impulsive and emotional to me. 

I wanted to force myself out of my comfort zone to work on my depression. I am now realizing that I can work on myself no matter the location. I do live in an area that can be kind of rough in certain seasons, but realistically I can still get as much done here as I can anywhere else. And actually due to the things I am looking to work on (incl. dental work, school, more), moving away would actually slow down the rate I could achieve these things (for certain things I would need to go through the process of proving my residence in this new state, and then transferring things when I move back).

And I shamefully admit, I think now that my impulsivity in this decision was partially an emotional and childish attempt to shock my ex. To make them realize I was ready to be better. Or to get them to tell me they didn’t actually want me to leave. Stupid and kind of toxic, I know.

But now that I feel clear in the head I am beginning to question what is actually right for me. Disregarding my pain from the break up or anything else. 

Part of the problem is I already called family and told them I wanted to come. We already started talking about dates to move me. I am now worried, if I call and say that this isn’t right for me, that I have wasted their time and energy. 

With so much changing in my life, I am at a crossroads. I want to think only of myself and my own well being in this decision. Now I am just nervous. 

I know that such a life changing decision can only be made by me, but I am curious if anyone has input or personal experiences that may relate.

471,"For context, I’m a parent, I’m older and I have 3 kids. No drugs or alcohol. 

I decided to change careers and went back to college for cyber security. Learning about it has been awesome. I’ve done very well. I’m at the top of my class. Recently, I got an internship. There are 6 students in the program. We all work in the SOC. I was nervous to go in the SOC. There are so many amazingly talented people in there, from forensic investigators to penetration testers... the company is a big company. You would know absolutely know who they are. 

But something is... *off*. The first week we had training. They really pushed the corporate agenda, how amazing this company is. The other interns and I were pinching ourselves. The company values and culture are very modern forward thinking, and they really seem to value their employees. So many amazing programs it took days to explain it all. Cool. 

But then we get back into the SOC. I quickly learned that things aren’t as perfect as they would have me believe. I learned about the various office politics. (Typical stuff at most companies) I was given a laptop that belonged to my manager (a pen tester). I see that it has remote viewing software on it and my screen can be viewed without my knowledge. Then I learn that each desk has a sensor to monitor my habits. I don’t know for sure what it monitors but I know measures motion and heat. And finally, all this is made worse when I searched the company and found some posts written by a few disgruntled employees who insisted that this company invaded their privacy and the privacy of others by having a manager shoulder surf their passwords to things like their bank. The person then went on to explain other unethical things that the company did. 

I just have a bad feeling. I don’t have to stay at this job for more than a year, it’s just an internship. But I’m concerned that I’m starting to feel paranoid and spied on. When I got home yesterday I took my work laptop and locked it in a closet upstairs. I’m afraid to use it on my home network so I am making a guest network for it even though it uses a VPN. I won’t let my cellphone join their network and I keep my Bluetooth off. I lock everything up when I leave. I googled these sensors and the company that deployed them and it’s all very vague. 

So my question is: is it normal to feel paranoid when you start working in cybersecurity? Does anyone have  any sort of job that uses sensors to monitor your activity? Will I always feel this way or will I adjust? I feel so creeped out right now and I am wondering if I made a bad decision in choosing my field. 😞

i have 2 friends lets call them friend A and friend B . friend A has been friends with me since freshman year while friend B has been a friend only since an year. being in a group of 3 can be tough and often people are left behind . in this case i was always left behind by friend B whenever we would talk with anyone she would always try to sideline me (or atleast thats how i felt) whenever i would talk with the ""famous people"" of our school she would somehow end my conversation. she also did not like the fact that frnd A and i were close. then we had a german exchange programme and frnd A and I along with the ""famous people' were a part of t and as a result spent time together alot. her indifference sky rocketed during this time . she stopped texting me and even seen zoned me often . she didnt even like or comment on the posts i had with others . and tbh thats natural and being a good friend i made her sit with frnd A everyday in class after we came back however this was not enough for her. during this period things in my family were awful and i fell into depression the smallest things would trigger me so when frnd B tried to sideline me again i stopped talking to her and frnd A and despite her knowing my mental health, bitched about me behind my back and even called me fake to my face. this happened twice last year and then when things were finally normal we all decided to go to a food fest, if u dont know then depressed people tend to withdraw from social gatherings and thats what i was doing. everyone wanted me to come n were asking me to come except her. since this was the last time we all would hang out i decided to go and when i asked frnd B to book tickets for me she said they were sold out (she bought tickets for the whole grp and even managed to arrange one at last minute). however somehow i managed to get tickets and didnt think much of it . frnd B also lives close to me so i asked her if she could drop me and she left me on read. she did this twice and then o finally said to her that its ok nevermind and she was like hhaha ok lmao . however heres the weird part. i live literally a minute away from her while frnd A and a person of the ""famous group"" live half an hour away . and she picked them up but didnt pick me up . i was waiting for them for an hour as a result of this and when we met at the fest my mom called me n started shouting at me so naturally i avoided them at first however latr on i told them what happened and we continued the day. heres the weird part . after this everything was normal but she blew up drama again and called me fake . she bullied me and my mental health is at an all time low. friend A says she doesnt take sides but still stays with her because she wants to stay with the famous people. friend B says i do all the things she does to me in reality . and has lied to me multiple times and shared my secrets with everyone . pls give me advice. how do i make people see how she really is",31Jan2020,1

I have been slighty builed on my college because of my change,reason for that is mostly because previously i was actually considared to be ""good looking"" by standards i guess and because i was alone and insecure i wouldnt react to any looks be it from men or women,i really didnt think i was worth being made a friend or boyfriend.Commentsi heard were  like""haha,look how he has become"",""he used to be a good looking kid:""this guy,he is playing it ugly""""eww""from men and women.

I'll be honest i never gave notice to features or had any idea about what ideal looks are until i noticed the differnce in treatments due to appearance as well the way others view,it really changed my perspective.Today i walked into a store and a lady with a baby was sitting there,i dont know but as soon as i entered and the baby noticed me it suddently started making noice almost like crying,i know this may be a coincedence,but all the coincedences up to now are too many to count for me and this actually hurt me way more than it should inside,i know people avoid me sometimes when i walk on the same path on the street,reactions like women looking down or behind just to avoid my glare.

Im really disgusted with myself at times,.Im around 6""2,dark long curly hair,and a bit wide build.i feel like my presence is just intimidating,and i realise it as well.I now try to avoid eye contact and keep my head down.Im around 20-21 but problably look quite older than my age,its quite sad that i got such an insecuirty and issue at this point in life that makes me even scared to go out or at my university.

I want to accept this look,but the issue is that i also feel very alone,i actually never once had a relationship and now i feel like there is no chance,I dont have any friends for support of opinions,im very tired most of the time and dont have anything that draws my interest.its likely that i got depression at this point,its been some times since what happened to my face and i have no hope of it getting better anymore,all i just feel is like i lost something very important that could have made my life much better,

Honesly,this is not the first time i make a post like this,i know the answer is to move on and just to productive things with my life and forget about my appearance.But its just extremly hard to realise how it feels to go from top to bottom,the scariest thing for me is when i look at my reflection and being fraid to reconcnize myself and realise why i appear intimidating and even make babies cry.",31Jan2020,1

489,"Hello, first time poster in this subreddit. It’s currently 5 am, I haven’t slept in a few days and my thoughts are getting to me. I’m sorry for misspellings and grammar. 

I just got my first paycheck from my newest job and it was just under a hundred dollars. As soon as I saw this it immediately put so much weight on my chest. My SO and I have been struggling recently and I don’t know what to do. I’m pretty sure it’s all my fault. 

I am currently working two jobs while going to school, I only have one class right now and I don’t have to physically attend most the time so it helps with the burden. I barely get any hours at either job yet I feel like I’m working every single day. 

I had a job as a manager under a good store manager but with other shitty managers at a shoe store and I worked 40-60 hours each week, coming home pissed off and upset.  After my good manager left we got the shittiest human being imaginable. This man treated me awfully because he could. When I brought it up to my district manager she treated me like shit and so I quit. He tried to get me to put in my two weeks then continued to be an ass to me on my shift so I left. 

Ever since then I’ve been jumping job to job, trying to find something. Initially I worked at a Door to Door sales company but I got food poisoning and they made me come in while vomiting. I left there after two weeks and tried to do a stay at home job, that didn’t end up spinning out. 

During this time period my mother has paid half my rent, my SO has paid both parts of our rent, and we’ve been all and all struggling. He refuses to let me put any of the blame on myself. Especially now that I’m working two jobs but...I just feel so responsible. 

The first place I work at I started around Black Friday of 2019. Initially I was making decent hours and decent money but once the holidays were gone I barely work 16 hours within two weeks. This is a big retail chain with a yellow fruit in its name. The second place I work at is a good job but I’m in training so I’m averaging 4-6 hours a week. 

My SO works a full time job with a very good pay rate and will sometimes pick up extra shifts. Lately he’s been calling out but I can’t say I blame him. We’re both exhausted. He insists that I work more than him but I only work two part time jobs. 

I guess I know that I should have stayed at my first job and sucked it up until I found a job that would pay close to the same thing. I’m trying so hard to support us and I’m slowly exhausting myself. 

Am I the reason my SO and I are so financially stressed?  What should I do to improve my financial status?",31Jan2020,1
490,"Tuck in for a long story. So this starts in about March when my Mum gets diagnosed with Breast Cancer. This takes a massive toll on her, but we're all there to support her, Me, my Dad, my Brother and Sister. We want to her to go to appointments etc. But she keeps missing them and essentially ignoring her responsibilities around the house. Now my parents are long term Heroin addicts, they've been doing it since we were young, but we only realised what it was when I was around 14-15, Its why we'd never have money, it's why they didn't work but nevertheless me and siblings were brought up alright (I hope). As I said she'd stop doing anything around the house and instead would constantly go to friends houses to do Crack aswell, then come back to do heroin with my Dad and would always be sleeping, drugged up, fighting with my Dad over money or wouldn't be here at all. It was really hard, i was goign through my end of school exams (A-levels, taken when you're 18) and it absolutely killed me, so me and siblings decided to tell my grandmother what was going on, she lived in Australia and was distraught to hear my parents were drug addicts, my mum was sneaking out to do even more and worse of all, my Mum had been stealing my money behind my back that I had been working for years (almost £1000), I lost every penny. 

Even after trying to help my Mum and to get her to stop she kept doing this, me and siblings could deal with just doing Heroin, they were both too young to move out and I was going into University, so there was almost nothing we could do. So we told my Mum fix up or move out, she was stealing the money used for food to spend it on herself, me and siblings were starving and she'd run away with the money to go and do crack in her car at like 4AM, one time I almost got robbed going out looking for her. So we said she's not coming in the house because all she'd do is scream at my Dad about money (He was no angel either, he'd had the police called on him for choking me only a couple of years back as well as constantly getting into shouting matches with me and my siblings, but the difference was that no matter what, we were whats most important) Me and my siblings just couldn't deal with her anymore, she wasn't feeding us, was never there and had completely lost all of ur trust for stealing all of our money and running off in the middle of the night. So one night we said, you're not coming back in the house, so she had to go and stay at a friends house until she found a hostel, bear in mind she'd been saying she wanted to move out and was literally unbearable to be around at this point, she'd just scream at you over something or ask for money. 

All through this constant use of drugs, she still had breast cancer but would never go to appointments. Then her Mum came over from Australia, by this time (as her mum noted) she'd become unbearable, she'd go out for dinner with my grandma and run away for some reason or another, she couldn't sit still, she would run and scream up and down the street instead of having a normal conversation. She would run out of the doctors when my grandma tried to get her to go her appointments. She was losing weight too. She looked really sallow and would always be an emotional mess when we spoke, we'd see her like once a week and she'd always break out crying or shouting at us in the middle of the road.

Then time came for me to go to university, at this point we had no clue what to do, 50% of the time she'd be fine to talk to on the phone and we could have a nice conversation but the other half she'd scream about something stupid, such as her ongoing conspiracy that my Dad was sleeping with one of her friends (she'd lost all of them through arguments by this point, two of them accused her of stealing from their houses while she was there). What was also more scary is that she had began talking about suicide and we were really worried about her mental health. She looked skinny, her face was sallow, the cancer was killing her but whenever we met her she couldn't sit still, or she would do some unusual thing like sit right in the middle of the street and start drinking coffee or eating a whole pack of biscuits. Even still would often ask for money for drugs by saying she needed it for food.

When I left London for university, I couldn't be there anymore, so I kept good check my speaking to her on the phone every night, my brother and sister at this point thought she was so disrespectful that they didn't care for her. When I get back, she'd still been missing appointments, but eventually did start going to some and getting closer to having her operation. She was seemingly doing better and still is now. But she still did stupid stuff, like spraying shaving cream all over my dads car, posting a letter to the woman she thought my Dad was with that said 'this is war' as well as just standing outside of her house apparently waiting for my Father to turn up. 

Moving on again, last week she had her operation and I came down from University to see her, and I just got back from trying to have breakfast with her, when we met, she instantly stormed down the road screaming at someone on the phone so that everyone could hear. I offered to get something to eat, so we went into a cafe and ordered some stuff. She said she wasnt hungry and whipped out 3 yoghurts and would have one spoon of each before saying didnt like it, spilling it all over the table. She had also just got her prescripting and threw all of the packaging all over the place in the cafe. She was also loud and was constantly either rocking in the chair, walking while talking on the phone, biting her nails or playing with the yoghurt. We then had an argument about how she should act more considerate in public as well as about my Dad. She got up and ran out the cafe, I paid for all the stuff and went to find her, then she was all smiles before again running past me to go into another shop for no reason. We argued some more about how she acts and then I left.

I know thats a lot, but I don't know what to do, i'm exhausted with dealing with her, I have my own problems with university to deal with, and I just can't handle her, she is this massive stressor for me and I can't leave it be or something bad might happen. I'm starting to have my own mental issues thanks to all this and am considering some sort of therapy, but I don't know what to do about my Mum, shes going through something I can barely explain, and I really need some advice.

Sorry if this is long, but it's my life at the moment and I just don't know what to do.",31Jan2020,1

anyone who has had FSAE skills or experience or in general , am i biting the bullet? should i join? or should i lay it down and join at a later stage (rumour has it that it'll be alot harder to join since recruitment has been turning away even the most academic students?)

492,"I’m in school and we are admittedly a tight knit bunch going through the same program. I really feel like I am an easy to get along with person and will be friends with almost anyone. 

HOWEVER, this girl will not take the hint. She’s just annoying. She comes around and truly inserts herself into conversations, asks personal questions, is rude about school, and brags about how much money she has (its very uncomfortable) 

She doesn’t seem to have any friends, which really bothers me so I have tried to be kind to her. But I find it very distracting as she talks constantly, insists that her incorrect answers are law, and will ask “what are you talking about??” When I’m in the middle of a private conversation. She’s distracting and irritating and more than once she has talked to me nonstop for 2+ hours about herself. I know I sound like an asshole but she is giving me major anxiety and I can’t seem to get my giant workload taken care of. Any advice to kindly deter her? I don’t want to be a bully.",31Jan2020,1
493,"I'm a senior in my last semester, and have been part of pep band(band that plays at the uni's volleyball and basketball games) since for the past 2-3 years. The games are fun in general, but I really am not benefitting too much from being in pep band. For me, the biggest problem is that there is essentially no social community. People just show up to games and rehearsals and leave. No organized events, socials, etc. Also, a lot of people are in marching band, so a lot of people know each other from there which makes it even more difficult to make friends.

This is a class you have to sign up for, so you have to go to each rehearsal and game that you have been assigned to, or your grade will really suffer. This is another problem. The first year I did it, it was alright to deal with, but this wasn't the case recently. This past semester, I had to REALLY drag myself to go to the games I was assigned to, and this felt like a big red flag. Now, I was in severe depression last semester and was extremely unhappy, so I am sure that was a contributing factor. Usually, there are about 2-3 games a week and the band rehearses once a week, so it is a fair time commitment.

Essentially, the pros are that I really enjoy playing my instrument and the games can be a fun atmosphere to be at. The cons are the lack of social life/community, and that you are forced to go to everything you have been assigned to. These two cons are a great problem because it really impedes on my ability to meet new people. Since it is my last semester, I have been really wanting to join some orgs, but pep band conflicts with most of the meeting times. Since band does not provide me with any social benefit and is preventing me from attending other events where I can make friends, this could potentially be a huge problem.

I am very conflicted. Since it is my last semester, this will be my last opportunity to be in pep band. If I leave, I fear that I will really regret leaving. At the same time though, I mentioned many concerns where leaving could be the best option.

502,"I am not mentally ready to have feelings for anybody.  My last relationship of three years (on and off) left me with a lot of trauma and insecurities and it is too early for me to be romantically involved with anyone before I heal and learn how to love myself and feel worthy of love.

What is eating me inside is that it is the first time in forever that I am starting to really like someone other than my ex.
We met about 2 months ago and immediately hit it off. We can talk for hours and we are physically very compatible. I know he likes me and asked me to be in a relationship with him which I declined because I didn't feel ready to trust someone with my feelings. We continued to see each other after that, and now I am starting to really like him, but am panicked because I know liking someone in my current situation isn't a good idea.
I already have negative thoughts about myself because of this, thinking I'm annoying him, not good enough, not pretty enough... I am terrified of any type of rejection. 

He is very blunt, and says stuff that someone who loves themselves wouldn't care about, but I personally feel deeply about some of his comments. Yesterday he called me annoying after I made a stupid comment and I was devastated. I feel like if he called me annoying then, he could potentially get tired of me in the future.

Having feelings for him is causing me pain and I wish I could just brush them off and keep seeing him and just enjoy our times together without taking everything so seriously, but I can't.
He knows about my situation, knows that I have a lot of trauma etc. but still doesn't give me the amount of reassurance or validation that I need, and that's normal. I would need an extreme amount since I am broken on the emotional level.
My dilemma is that I want to keep seeing him because our times together are amazing but I also am thinking of just distancing myself because the more feelings I develop the more I might cause myself pain.

It's been an understandably huge blow when uni came along and I kept having to extend my degree multiple times because I couldn't seem to cope. I've never quite recovered from that nightmare experience of ""friendly"" concern from family and peers about when I'm graduating &amp; the unspoken ""what happened dude?"" 

I'm not where I want to be right now, and that just pisses and disgusts me in equal degrees. I just feel my parents' disappointment whenever I look at them and whenever they make comments and follow up by saying ""of course not you"" or ""of course this doesn't apply to you because X, Y and Z"".I say nasty things I regret immediately but can't seem to get control of my vocal chords until AFTER I've said it.

506,"So my parents are both Chinese, before I was born, they moved to the Netherlands and gave birth to me there. I've never lived in China. I kinda look like a Chinese but at the same time I kinda don't. A lot of photos of Chinese guys I've seen don't really match my face. My dad looks kinda Chinese but my and my brother both have a very different face structure from my dad's. For reference, both me and my brother look a lot like Youtuber ProZD. Me even more so than my brother cuz I wear glasses that also look similar to ProZD's. Didn't intend to look like him, one day I just came across a video of him and I was like ""WTF that's me"" I'm even somewhat chubby and slightly overweight. I barely move or work out, my dad always brought me to school with his car and I can't even ride a bicycle, I've always been afraid of crashing into a car. I don't have time to work on my physique either in my current lifestyle. When I get out of school I will definitely work on it. I'm 18 and a half and probably no longer able to grow. I'm 1,75 m. I got sent to a school for autistic people after failing class several times in a row. Yes, I was also born with autism and it f*cking sucks. Due to multiple reasons, I struggle extremely hard at at school. The class I'm in is very small, but there are 2 Dutch guys in particular that are a lot taller than I am and also younger. Honestly, I wish I was as tall as those guys. And given that the size of your f*cking member matters a lot now apparently, and Asians get the short end of the stick when it comes to that, I'm honestly pretty concerned.

I barely partake in Chinese culture. Didn't even celebrate Chinese new year. I mostly just sit in front of my computer or grab my phone cuz those are the only things that give me satisfaction nowadays. If I'd be able to choose what food I'd eat I'd surely not pick almost anything that has rice in it, cuz I've eaten enough rice for my entire freaking life. Or broccoli or bok choi. Spaghetti and potatoes all the way. For all intents and purpose, on the inside, I'm a Dutch man. My parent probably also are, but slightly less. Except when it comes to parenting, cuz I get the short end of the stick there. I've been pressured when it comes to school grades countless times. And yes, they're quite conservative. It could be worse, but mom can complain about a lot of itty bitty things that probably wouldn't impact me much if I didn't do the same she'd say. And yes, it's true that children of Asians are more likely to get beaten by them than children of white people.

On the outside, I look a lot like ProZD. But my inside will not be able to protect me from predujices and stereotypical crap. I get attracted to white girls. I don't blame myself for it, cuz I've almost never been able to make social contact with Asian girls and most people I see or meet are white anyway. But apparently my race is the least attractive of all. What is this bullshit? How tf am I gonna be able to not be alone forever? Chinese, ugly AND autism. I'm the f*cking black sheep of the family. And now this whole corona virus bullshit? I just need to f*cking cough, and then everyone will make fun of me. I just need to walk on the f*cking street and people will run away from me?

Since about 4 years ago, I’ve had this progressively worse relationship with my parents. I find myself getting more angry at them, I cooperate less, and I think less and less about them. 

Every single time they approach me about this, they tell me I’m too self centered to care about them. And I guess it’s true.

I know it probably sounds daft but the documentary had some terrifying cases of this, including a woman who survived it, it was a woman in her 30's and she said she suddenly felt hot in her throat, and then flames started spewing from her mouth. She drank water and the fire was put out, but she sustained 3rd degree burns to her stomach and intestines and had a scar on her abdomen because of the heat of the fire coming from her gut.

The others weren't so lucky and were found reduced to a pile of ashes. For example there was one where a son was talking to his mother upstairs, then he went downstairs for 15 minutes. He then came back up to find his mother was burned to death in her chair, with her legs and arms and head intact but the stomach area was completely burned out and reduced to ashes.

Ever since that I can't stop thinking my gut will suddenly catch fire. The documentary had a British chemist named John Emsley mention that our guts produce a self-combusting liquid called diphosphane but in tiny amounts, too small to cause self-combustion, but in some cases it can produce too much and this ignites all the other flammable stuff in the gut and can blow a hole through the abdomen in some cases as it's more like a fiery explosion.

Another terrifying fatal case was witnessed by relatives and the woman was just reading a newspaper when suddenly blue flames burst from her mouth and gut area before she died. The documentary had a terrifying reconstruction of this, specifically when her relative looked away for a second and suddenly saw flames in the corner of his eye, only to see her spewing flames out of her mouth and abdomen like a dragon, while she was completely motionless/in shock.

Ever since I can't stop thinking about my gut just bursting into flames and burning to death from it. I always have a glass of water next to me in case it happens, and when I go to sleep I have a 2 L bottle of water next to me. I hate being human sometimes our bodies are so badly designed, I've never heard of birds exploding into flames and there's like a hundred times more birds than people.

Whenever I'm talking with friends I get anxious, thinking they might suddenly start having fire bursting out their mouth and gut, then keel over and burn to death from the inside out, and imagining how traumatised I'd be if that happens. This case is one of the most haunting ones for me - [https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226](https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226)

Is it possible to remove the gut surgically? Ever since I saw this documentary I want to get rid of it because I feel like I have a bomb inside of me.",31Jan2020,1
515,"My boyfriend and I started dating back in December 2018. We were perfect and everything was great. We had been intimate and I found out I was 6-8 weeks along in early April. I just found out recently that he had made accounts on three different cheating/hookup sites: AshleyMadison, Benaughty, and AdultFriendFinder. He had also made two accounts on MeetMe and a different Snapchat. 

I was told that he only took pictures of his bare chest and that it never went further than him calling a handful of girls attractive. I found out this morning that he had actually posted a photo of his penis on one of the websites for everyone to see. He had done this in June but was active on one of the accounts back in January, after I had our daughter. 

He swears he'll never do it again and keeps trying to hurt himself. Says he's disgusting with the thought of himself. He can't even stand to look at me, much less kiss me. I want to try to still make it work because we had plans for marriage. Am I just asking to be hurt again? Should I believe him? He's never lied to me before now and has never cheated on anyone before. He's had a long history of depression and suicidal behavior. He said he just wanted to feel a void because we were fighting a lot and weren't being loving towards each other at all. Was it my fault? What should I do?",31Jan2020,1

Instead of just emailing me back “Sorry these are mandatory/ Suck it up”, they complained about it to the RD (that they are close to) who then reprimanded me for daring to ask not to be emailed.

They feel so distant from me. I’m only a tiny part of their life, but they’re everything I have. I feel like they don’t care enough to talk to me. It’s always me reaching out. If I ever stopped reaching out, we would never talk again.

Idk what to do. All I ever wanted was a little group of friends that I can trust and have fun with. But there’s no place for me anywhere. I’m not looking for online friends. I want to see people in real life. I’ve tried friendship apps, but the majority of people on there are military wives and 90% of their descriptions are some variant of “looking for gal pals who love wine, hitting the beach, and taking insta photos” which is...not what I want. Plus most of the people on the app live in different cities, and I can’t drive.

All I do nowadays is work and play games. My coworker suggested I join a DnD group, but I am horrible at math and improv.

536,"I've tried to avoid coming to reddit with this because I thought it was done and over with but apparently not. I'll start from when the problems started. I (19f) was friends with (18m) ""J"" for around three years. This was two years ago (when I ended the friendship) Our relationship took a toxic turn when we started dating and he became jealous of my male friends. We broke up and for a little while we didn't speak. We reconnected strictly as friends and were great, it seemed like nothing had ever happened. Then it took a turn for the worse after he found out I'd dated a male friend, but we'd broken up. Long story short I cut contact for a final time and haven't spoken to him. During this time he continued texted my fb and number, threatening me, trying to ""apologize"" but then call me a slut. It went on for awhile until I said if he contacted me again I'd call the police. I haven't heard from him in 9 months. He's tried to get ahold of me using a fake fb with a ""pretty boi"" profile pic (its something he tries to do to ""mock"" me because he thinks I only like boys with a pretty face) but I promptly blocked it without accepting the request. I now have a boyfriend and a new number, the only people who have said number is my mom, a few of my siblings, and my boyfriend. Literally nobody else. I received a text yesterday along the lines of ""look I'm in a really bad place right now and if we we're ever friends you'd text me"" I blocked the number and didn't think twice about it. Until five minutes later when I realized he'd texted me. On my new number. I went back to my blocked numbers and unblocked it but the number was gone. When I block a number on my phone the messages along with it get deleted and because the number wasn't saved its gone. I'm waiting for him to text me again because... I'm not sure. A part of me wants to lie, to convince him he's got the wrong number, and another part of me wants to know how. How did he get my number? Then there's the rational part that says to just keep blocking the numbers as they come (haven't mentioned this before, but he makes fake numbers from an app to text me from when I block them) I don't know which one to do. I just thought I'd get some advice from someone not involved

TL;DR I cut contact with a friend after the relationship went bad and he's somehow got my number again. Demand how he got it, block him, or lie?",31Jan2020,1

I have a friend that have, litteraly, a phobia about the death. She said to me that it's like that since the further she can remember and is making a lot of panic attack because of that.

But she is making more and more crisis like that, and we think that it can be lead to the stress she is having :
- our studies are really stressful
- family issues
- death of the mom of a person we know that could have make her bad (death phobia I remember to you)
- coronavirus (it doesn't help)
And else

Now she is missing a lot of classes because she is tired or panicked of doing them. She even DREAM of doing a panic attack.

So Basically, I don't see us as long-term friends, and he felt that because when he asked me about my postgraduate for next year I always brush it of, because I don't want to be with him.

Until tonight he asked if I want to be with him in the same city next year?

I said: that the best for each of us is to start new experience and each find a group friends from the same country, and I said: that I don't hate our current friendship, but for me I don't want to stick together because I want to experience a new city on my own.

He was mad and said: that friendship is not like this (in his mind he says that if we considered our self friends we should continue as friends) , and he said: being together does not stop us from making other friends and that with my mind set I was using him to hang out with until the end of this year.

I apologized about how he felt and that I should have told him this before, I told him that I had my own personal reasons and that in my mind its ok to be friends with someone for a limited time and then go apart, and our relationship meant something to me. I also apologized if I sent him signals that our friendship was long-term, and in my mind its not.

So then he said he does not wanna be friends anymore, and I said that cool.

**Should I feel shit because I saw an expiry date on our friendship?** I mean for me I consider that friendship, and he stuck with as much as I stuck with him. I think my mistake was I might acted as if our relationship was as a long term one, but in my mind it was short-term (but I don't see a problem with being friends with someone and sticking together for a limited time).

After doing some thinking I realized I was exactly like this last winter as well, and the winter before that. But I always assumed it was because I was diagnosed with several disorders for the last two winters and I was just feeling bummed out because of it. 

I did a bit of research on google and discovered a type of depression called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), now I know Dr. Google is the most reliable source but the symptoms are uncanny to how I've been feeling. So I think I might have SAD, if not then some other kind of depression.

The problem is with my parents, you see last year during the winter I told them one morning that I wasn't feeling very well- mentally, and they just shrugged it off as an excuse to not go to college, this happened several times. Also my parents have that whole thing with the, ""It's because you're always on your phone"". 

Now look, I know this isn't the top priority, there's people out there who need more help than me. I just don't know how to tell my parents who shrug off everything about how I've been feeling. So any help would be greatly appreciated.

I think this will just be mortifying for everyone. I don’t want to tell her that she isn’t a good singer because she does love to do it. And she hasn’t  asked for my input, she just mentioned her plans in passing. Would it be out of line if I diplomatically suggested that she not do this?

This is gonna be a long one.

SO. I (18/M) am a freshman in college and I have noticed in the past couple months that the way I treat my close friends/significant others is really bad and kind of cruel.

A long time ago in the summer between my junior and senior years of high school, my friend group fell apart for really messed up reasons. It really sucked and everything. But I didn't consider myself particularly damaged by it. Like after a year went by I felt grief and everything for a lot of reasons but I didn't think that it had changed how I treated people.

However, went i left for college, I got a long letter from my best friend (he was apart of that friend group) saying that he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He said that I was abusive towards him and he considered himself damaged in a lot of different ways. He goes to school a thousand miles away now and we haven't spoken in almost 6 months or so. And he was right, I definitely treated him like shit. I made fun of how he looked, but I played it off as being ironic and not actually serious. I criticized him for being late all the time. I was really hypercritical to him in a time of his life when he needed my help. He was definitely the most hurt by our friend group collapsing, and looking back on it I totally rubbed dirt in his face. I wasn't even aware of what I was doing, I was completely delusional.

Now my problem is with my ex. We met in orientation and we were dating for the first semester. Around October, I got really bored of her, realized that I didn't feel anything for her. But I had never had a serious relationship before and I was afraid of being single so I just stayed in it. Even though I didn't like her at all anymore. She is an incredibly sweet person and I appreciated that, but sometimes she would genuinely disgust me in a way that felt like I couldn't control. In the last month of my dating her, I knew that I had to break up with her before winter break because I couldn't keep going. But I also was really getting to like another girl. I didn't know her very well, and I explained my situation to one of my best friends here. He said that he would get me to start hanging out with this other girl. so that when I got back from break I could start hanging out on my own with her. I started doing this while I was dating my girlfriend at the time. 

Now it seems like everything worked out. I'm set to hang out with this new girl I like independently, and I'm no longer dating my ex. However, my friend who got the new girl and I together hasn't spoken to me in a week. His tone over text indicates he doesn't give a shit about me anymore. I have another close friend who my ex and I were friends with when we were dating. He's really mad at me. I came clean and told him what I did to start talking to this new girl. While I was dating my girlfriend at the time. He hasn't reached out to me in over a week. I haven't tried to contact them, I figure if they actually want to talk to me they'll do it on their own. I left my ex in an emotional wreck.

I lost three of the closest people in my life because I was so obsessed with this other girl. I want to make amends with them. But also I think this situation points to a bigger problem of mine.

While all of this stuff happened I thought I was in the clear. I have always been considered a nice person. But while I abused my best friend and manipulated my friend into getting me to talk with another girl while I had a girlfriend, I didn't know how morally bad I was being.

My mom hid some phones around the house (they were moving out of), this are ""our just incase something happens"" emergency phones. 

They aren't all that expensive but aren't the cheap ones either. 

Albert found one of the phones and without any ""hey can I have this?"" He put his sim inside and started using it. He wasn't shy about it either. He took selfies, he was using it to call his friends. 

My sister told my dad about this and he said, Albert did not ask permission from him nor would Dad give any because it wasn't his property to give away. 

Anyway, my mom found out and she felt betrayed. Instead of turning it in when Albert was called out, he kept it and continued using it. 

My sister and I are at the same page that its a small amount but the thought that our workers could get our stuff without permission and use them might set a precedent to him and his colleagues, that it is okay for them to take our things without any permission and act as if they own them already.

555,"I (45F) work in a small company and generally get along with everyone quite well. But Fred (\~55M), well, Fred not so much. My understanding through the grapevine is that Fred does not like me for the job and does not like me personally. That’s okay. I don’t need to be friends with Fred if we can work together in the best interest of the company. However, in paying close attention to our interactions, I realized that in our staff meetings he does not look at me or make eye contact if talking to me (though he does make eye contact with others). This is a clear act of disrespect but it’s so subtle that no one else in the group ever calls him out. I’ve also noticed Fred gaslighting me at work in these staff meetings. He does this so artfully that sometimes I don’t realize it’s happened until after the meeting and I’m not sure that anyone else notices. He is a very smart, clever guy. I am sure what he’s doing is intentional and directed at me. I have thought of a million different ways to approach him and I just don’t see how I win regardless of how I approach him. So mostly I limit my interactions with him. Do you have any advice for how to handle this in a mature way that will have a positive outcome for me?

559," I don't intend to share that much of a sob story but I was neglected and socially isolated as a child, leaving me unable to go out and make friends. Now that I am out of this situation, I really want to construct some kind of social presence for myself, as in, I want to make friends.

How do I maintain conversation past occasional small talk with my coworkers? How do I find out who to approach when looking for friendship, and how do I not be super clingy in that approach? If I ever do get around to having friends, how does going out/ hanging out work? What does one do with their friends?

570,"- My friend (who I'm trying to figure out if they were a bully) from the ages of 4 to about 14: she always dragged me around by my ponytail (a weakness of mine, since I had long hair. Everyone used to take my hairband out and pull on my hair. I always wore my hair in a ponytail because I hated it). She forced me to drink a ""concoction"" of chalk and water, forced me to eat glue, locked me on her room and made me tidy it and wouldn't let me leave until I'd finished (she was violent if I didn't do what she said, or even sometimes if I did do it), tried to steal some of my things but my Mum stopped her, was generally manipulative, I was never happy when I came home from her house, but the main thing that affected me was the time she dry humped me on her bed and wouldnt stop. That was when we were a little older, around 12 years old.
- Outside my old school was a bridge over a railtrack, kind of hidden by trees, but you needed to go over the bridge in order to get to the shops or go anywhere other than the direction of town. One time, during gcse exam season when we were allowed to exit the school with permission (eg to go to the shops) I went over the bridge, went shops to get my snacks as any 16 year old would, came back over the bridge (of which I had not had any problems on before), and there was a man standing at the entrance of the bridge, but he was just to the side so you couldn't see him unless you entered the bridge. I thought everything was fine because he seemed to be taking a photo. But he was pretending. Because as soon as I started walking he did too. I got to the top of the bridge and he looked like he had bad intentions. As i walked down the slope of the other side, he started almost chasing after me and I have no idea what would have happened if he succeeded in whatever he was doing. When I got to the bottom of the bridge, I turned and left it onto an open road, and he just suddenly stopped. It's like he didn't want anyone to see him and he was there for someone like me. That terrified me because if I hadn't have sped up too anything couldn've happened, and now I find it hard to walk alone usually at night.
- My dad has been quite violent in my up-bringing, but I don't think to the point of concern. He smashed my sisters old music player device (Zen if any of you remember that), and I was generally scared when he got angry because he always slapped (which I know a lot of parents do). Mum would never involve herself when something big happened with one of the kids, she just told him to stop. There were a few nights where I would be screaming telling him to stop whilst me and Mum watched him pin down my sister (before, ofc, Mum made me go to my room so I didn't have to watch. I'm not sure if he hurt her because I was so young. She had threatened to call the police, but he just took her phone away). Anyway, things were generally fine but about a year ago the same happened to me but for me I ended up with 2 large raised bruises on my legs (with lumps which took a few weeks to go back to normal, and tbh it's still not fully gone). I broke down infront of my teacher the next day and just haven't really recovered fully.  But it confuses me because he is not usually lile that, unless he is very angry or upset. The last time he got insanely angry was when I was taking my A level exams and he and mum were fighting for a few of weeks. He kicked her out at 2am (so i stayed with my boyfriend the night after due to exam). But that time he wasnt violent, just scarily shouty. 
- My year 7 teacher was outed as grooming students, but I think it may have been hust rumours amongst the students because he never got done in any way for it. Anyway I never believed it because he was always incredibly nice to me, would always pull me to the side to talk about my insecurities etc. Now that I look back, I feel like maybe I was being groomed. But nothing sexual ever happened so I'm confused. He would always stand us right next to his desk and talk. When we asked to go to the toilet, apparently he held some of the girls hands but I never saw it myself (not saying its false though). He always came off as a bit of a creep, but I thought he was just incredibly sarcastic. He had a character though which made us all like him and that's part the reason I didnt believe the accusations (baring in mind I was 12). He retired the year we left so there were no other stories from him. But one time someone in my class had a yellow phone book thing and supposedly found his address in it (feasible but again, not sure if true). Anyway my friend was just joking around, asked him ""do you live down _____ road?"". He goes ""No, that's where *my name*lives"". And that creeped me out. Didn't really affect me much at the time but now I find it hard to accept the one teacher I  fully trusted and thought that they cared about me, turned out to be supposedly dangerous.

I just generally struggle with a lot of anxiety and I have isolated myself greatly (as I have since a kid. My teachers once offered help for it but my Mum refused it). And I have very nasty dreams, where I'm usually a victim. It's hard to come to terms with, and I don't know if ^^^ if all just not a big deal and that I'm exaggerating it in my mind.",31Jan2020,1

- It’ll be a good oportunity to expand my horizon and to experience and learn from other cultures. 
- It’ll give me lots of time to practice my spoken and written english skills, which I don’t get to do much since I moved back home from England (I lived there for four years).
- I’m sure there are medical procedures they do differently in NZ and maybe better than we do. If I can learn from that and bring it back home with me, that’ll mean I may be able to affect the system here and make sure our patients get even better health care in the future. 
- I may get to experience diseases and injuries that we just don’t see in my country due to difference in microbiology, flaura, fauna, climate, culture and a whole host of other variables that differ from here to there and this is not only hugely interesting from a purely academic point of view but may or may not at some point happen to be crucial knowledge.

Last year, I was bullied by three people. It was really one major incident, but it was bad. I imagine it took a lot of coordinating and premeditation to pull off. I feel was one of the greatest contributing factors to a psychotic episode I had which took me out of work for six weeks. I had to work with them all afterwards. Still work with two of them. They never apologized or acknowledged that what they did was bad in any way. And that one event had significant, long-term effects on my work and personal life. In short, I'm not sure I'll ever recover 100%. I wish I were exaggerating...

One of them is being bullied by another person. I've read the emails. I talked to the bully. It looks like bullying.

I'm superior to my bully, and now I have to defend her against hers.

And it's not just that I have to defend her, but she is now doing the things that she told me I shouldn't be doing a year ago when she bullied me. She's got to ask my permission to do them, and I will grant her request every time. She's being completely hypocritical. And the combination of defending her while she asks me for the latitude she wouldn't give me last year is... Well.. it's hard for me to do.

I want to be the better person. I do. I want to feel the urge to support and help her, to approve whatever she needs for her job without bitterness. I want to rise above this pettiness and be the type of person I would admire in this situation. I want to let the past go.

And I can't. I do the things, but I don't feel it. I seethe with anger every time I think about what is going on. I want her to suffer and to experience fully the type of environment she fostered for me. I want her to have to confront and live with her bully on at least a regular basis, with her bully thinking that their in the right and making every interaction tense. I want her to think that everyone around her thinks her time has no value, that her family and personal time are not as important as everyone else's and that the work she does has no meaning, that her job is busy-work. That she is at fault for a problem that does not exist.

I'm sure... I'm positive that she can see through my veneer of compassion and helpfulness. That she can hear the disdain in my voice or how to the point our conversations are.

And I wish I was a better person. I know personally how terrible being bullied is. And no one should feel that way. But apparently I'm not... I am not the better person. And so now I hate both her and me.

But over time, the more we get to know each other, the better we get along. My friends heard about the problems because I talk to them for advice. They think she’s a bad influence and that she’s going to hurt me. My friend(let’s call her G) thinks that my girlfriend will hurt me. Like physically. And my other friend( Let’s call him K) thinks that she’s too immature and that she’s going to stunt me in growth. I’ve had many arguments with them about it. Apparently I’ve been making them feel like they aren’t good enough because I talk about her so much. She’s been trying to get better. Yes, she’s aggressive, a little bitter and has cringy humor, But I know she loves me. She cares, a lot. She even stopped smoking for me.  We talked through our problems and make sure to understand each other and listen. To be honest, I don’t know what to do. I know that she’s trying and I absolutely don’t want to break up with her. I don’t want to hurt her and I don’t want to be hurting myself.  I told K I will do it next week but, after spending time with her I just realized I can’t. I held my girlfriend for almost 20 minutes because she was crying so much because I said “ we need to talk.” And she assumed the worst.

Now that I'm out of those situations I was in while I was a minor/young adult (I've just turned 23), I struggle to start and maintain conversations because I live in this 'don't speak unless spoken to mindset' and I'm a bit closed off unintentionally.

My parents and sister live together. I also have an adult nephew who is an alcoholic and addict who lives with them rent free.

The family that live at my parent’s have a habit of criticizing and belittling my kids and I, as well as anyone who does not embrace their narrow world view. They seem to thrive on chaos and negativity.

It was easy to distance myself for most of my of my life.  However, everyone at their house have now, due to various health issues, become immobile, with the exception of my nephew, who has so many DUI’s he wrecked his car and can’t get insurance.

My mom is going through a very tough divorce. It's been ongoing for over 2 years. There is all types of abuse happening that I still cant get my head around but the biggest one at the moment is financial abuse. She is not financially stable as she was a home executive and raised our family our whole lives. She has a lawyer who is charging insane amounts of money for things like sending a letter or reading a file and it has depleted any funds that she had available. My heart is broken that a man who I refuse to refer to as my father is doing this to someone who has given her whole life to support him in his life choices.

I'm really looking for someone that can give her advice on how to get the divorce finalized and answer some questions that she needs clarity on. This is destroying her and I'm not sure she's not going to make it out of this and I don't know how else I can help her.

612,"So a staffing agency called Aerotek reached out to my sister about a job. She wasn’t interested in the position because she’s a full time student and wouldn’t have time, and I was looking for work so she put them in contact with me. Everything moved fast and I ended up interviewing and taking a drug screening/completing the onboarding process within a week and a half of initial contact. Told I was going to be starting on the 6th of January, then on the 5th of January was told I wouldn’t be starting until the 27th. Asked to start earlier so I wouldn’t have almost a month of no income and was basically told “Well the earliest you can start is the 27th, sorry not sorry”. I said okay because the job paid decently and was full time. My fiancé has a job but works primarily on commission so his paychecks vary. We’re living with family right now and are trying to get a place of our own, and need 2 incomes to be able to afford it. Start on my first day and everyone else there was also hired through them. Was told the same thing happened to multiple people (the huge delay in starting). Aerotek contact at the office tells everyone you can’t miss a single day of training except for emergencies or you will be let go, if something does come up stay in contact with her and you’ll be fine. 3rd day of training and my car doesn’t start. Ended up spending all day figuring out how to get it towed/at the auto shop getting things fixed. I tell the Aerotek contact about my situation 30 mins before my scheduled shift and keep her updated throughout the day. She stops replying to my messages after I tell her I won’t be able to make it in at all because they’re fixing my car, which is my only mode of transportation. I go to work the next day, everything is fine. The trainer at work (trainer works for the actual company, not Aerotek) mentions somebody who wasn’t there that day was going to be put into the next training class due to a dental emergency. Then late that night I get a TEXT from the Aerotek contact saying I’ve been let go for missing a day of training. I call her up and she says I can send an email to her &amp; her upper management stating why I missed and essentially plead my case to keep my job, not even a week into working there. Also mentions she apparently had no idea about the other person who was put into the next training class. Then she says she’ll either contact me by the end of the night or 30 mins before the start of my shift the following day with whether or not I still have a job. I send the email. Next day (today) rolls around and she tells me she hasn’t heard back from anyone yet and I cannot go into work. Still waiting on a definitive answer and my anxiety is through the roof.

613,"I looked everywhere for a tshirt I’ve been wanting pretty badly, and i only found it in one place online. It was Takishirts.com . The website looked well made and up to date so I felt like it was trustworthy and made my order for 1 shirt totaling to around $20. 

I received an email as soon as I ordered saying they’ll let me know when it ships in the next 2-5 days, but it’s been 13 days now and I have heard nothing. It also said that I paid with PayPal, which is untrue— I paid with a visa prepaid card, so that felt a bit fishy. 

Since then I have tried relentlessly to contact TakiShirts through their email, phone number, and the “send a message” thing on their website. When emailing them, gmail replied to me and said this email does not exist (even though that same exact email sent me my order confirmation). I’ve called their phone number at least 5 to 10 times, it sounds staticky when it’s ringing which I’ve never heard before, no one ever answers, and at the end it doesn’t say anything like “you’ve reached takishirts!” It’s just the normal robot saying to leave a message. 

They never responded to the message I left on their website. They do not have a Facebook page either.

I have traveled for music before and I tend to work with many different producers/artists (mostly are male, shocker). But, I always tell him who they are and what we are working on. I have never crossed a line or have done anything to betray his trust. I am very transparent due to the respect I have for him and us. But, since I work with men primarily, he still gets insecure. He inserts himself into the situation and basically asserts his dominance with these guys. Then, it gets awkward and they don’t want to work with me anymore.

619,"So, I recently moved in with two friends so I would be able to financially manage to go back to school. Before I moved in, we agreed that I would pay a third of the bills, which I currently pay a little bit more actually. We were waiting for the lease to be changed from my one roommates dads name to ours. However I ended up not having my name on the lease. This one roommate gave an excuse as to why my name didn’t end up on there, that it was just a hassle and the management takes too long to respond. Which makes me feel like I am in a vulnerable state and not in charge. 

I have had to leave home as a teenager due to abuse and also in my early 20s I have had incidences where I didn’t have a secure place to to live even with my name in the lease &amp; although I’ve been continually paying rent since age 16. I’ve also never really had my own space because I shared a room with two sisters growing up, and later into my adulthood I always had roommates.

We also agreed to keep our rooms in a tidy manor and to scoop our cat litter everyday. I agreed to keep my room tidy but did not realize my roommate would be pressuring me to this extent or would be “cleaning my room” when I wasn’t home. Messy to my roommate is when I don’t fold my blankets, or when I drape them over the back of my chair. I have a loft bad and I don’t fold my blankets because I don’t want to because it is a hassle and my roomate hates that.  When I have an art project or homework out on my desk or a shopping bag on my desk that needs to get put away she will take everything on my desk and put it in a pile and/ or line. She’s moved my hamper repeatedly from where I keep it to a different area. On my desk I have an empty candle holder that is a memorial of my late dear friend, and my roommate disrespectfully put all my pens and markers in it. I have only one hamper that I use for clean clothes and dirty and once I had my clean clothes in there and put a day of dirty clothes on top of the closed lid and when I came home from work I saw she shoved my dirty clothes in my hamper full of clean clothes. 

I’ve tried to bring it up to my roommate in a passive way but she always says sorry she can’t help it she has OCD. She really does, she has no other friends and spends all her time cleaning. She is also constantly moving the furniture around. I have anxiety about having a straight forward conversation. I don’t know what’s wrong with me that I can’t straight forward to defend my boundaries or ask for privacy, I guess it’s the fear of making her upset or anxious and then being put out in the street like I have been in the past. She just short of assumed a position of being in control and I don’t like it because I pay an equal part of the bills.

I've spent most of my life quiet, shy and uneventful. I've been mediocre in school. I've been a bad friend, family member, and boyfriend. I've been boring and bland. Needy. Insecure. I've don't know what I do with my degree. I take life too seriously. I am incredibly introverted. I've had problems with porn addiction. I've lived my life afraid of making mistakes. Procrastinating. Lethargic. Depressed.

In the past two years, I realized all of this and committed myself to live a better life. Working on my crippling social anxiety. Being proactive with school, keeping a schedule and working harder on my assignments. Going to class. I've worked on being a more enjoyable friend, being more positive with those around me. Catching up more with family. Observing what I've done wrong with my relationships. Taking up hobbies. Letting go of my need to be liked.  Loving myself. Taking small steps to figure out what I want from my career. Trying to joke more. Forcing myself to be social. Breaking free from my addictions. Being okay with making mistakes. Embracing them and growing from my experiences.

But its all so much. I have so so many things I want to work on, and I can't do it all. There's so much advice that I want to follow. So many rules and values that I want to live my life by. So many systems I want to put into practice. And I'm getting overwhelmed. I want to focus on one thing, but then I feel like I'm falling behind on another. I need to practice everything. And do well in school at the same time.

I think I'm way too hard on myself and I'm expecting perfection from myself. But at the same time, I feel like a bad person, not leaving a positive mark on Earth.

One is the section 20s is concerning the roof, which needs repairing. I believe the total cost is around 40k GBP which will be split 50/50.

My sister is fine and ready to proceed but the woman below, having issued the section 20 is now avoiding this. Not sure on the reason, perhaps she doesn't have the money.

629,"My brother in law just moved in with my fiance and I. He is coming from a state away, where he lived in a small town that was the epicenter for drug use. He has been addicted to drugs since he was 12 years old, but recently (at 21 years old) expressed a strong desire in stopping. After getting out of a physically abusive relationship he moved 7 hours away in order to get away from the drug use of his hometown. He has told us he hasn't done any hard drugs (just weed and anxiety meds) since around November of 2019, but wants to completely quit everything. He does not drink anymore, wants to quit all drugs, and wants to quit smoking. This isn't his first time trying to stop, but it is the first time I really see progress and see him genuinely trying to fight his addictions.

How do I help him quit smoking? We live in the middle of nowhere so getting drugs would be hard, and he consented to periodic drug testing so we can ensure he is on the right path. But I have no idea how to tackle nicotine addiction. He got a job, so he is able to spend money on whatever he wants. So how do I help him avoid the temptation? 

He has a lot going on. He has two children he had to move from (there are no jobs in his home town, it was better to move here and send money home), we are the only ones he knows in the entire state, he dropped out of high school and is really wanting to pursue an education again. I want to help him with all this.

Any advice is welcome. I have been with my fiance for 8 years and basically grew up with both of them, so I don't feel like I am overstepping any bounds by helping. I truly just want to help him get his life back on track so he can live longer for his kids. He lost so much to addiction.",31Jan2020,1

There was physical violence involved and he has threatened her life on multiple occasions. I'm worried that she might go back, as she's told me she's worried she isn't strong enough to resist. She has worked *so* hard for the better part of a year to realize how dangerous and unhealthy he is and finally cut things off earlier this week, but he's been trying to work his way back in. As of now Idk if completely blocking him will work because they lived together and he's currently getting his stuff out and living in a hotel (no job, no prospects) so she needs to be able to respond at least for now.

I'm really worried about her. I know she doesn't want to go back to him but she's been stuck in this toxic cycle of ""everything is good &gt; fights &gt; explosive abuse &gt; break up &gt; apologies &gt; make up &gt; everything is good"" for years and I don't want to see her fall back in. He's using manipulation tactics, apologizing for the things he did but also saying that ""when"" not ""if"" she comes back to him he won't be able to forgive this; telling her he's worried he's ""having a stroke or a heart attack"" to gain sympathy; threatening her children and parents; typical textbook manipulation stuff.

My best friend(16F) and her ex boyfriend(18M) broke up in June 2019 after a year and a half of dating. He was extremely abusive. She wasn't allowed to ride the fucking bus, go anywhere except to school and sometimes grab a cup of coffee with ONLY ME and nobody else. He called her disgusting names and threatenedto beat her. He also threatened to kill our whole class. And she still stayed with him. Even though she was on fucking medications because of him. In May he moved to another city 2 hours away and she would visit him without her parents knowing. One day he didn't let her go home. He locked her in his room and she wasn't allowed to call anyone. The next day her mother called the police and they separated them while he was shouting and threatening to KILL HER AND HER FAMILY. He was reported but nothing came out of it. Ever since then he's been constantly texting her that he will come here and kill her and her loved ones(including me)/ or that he loves her and that she is his forever, and no matter how many times she blocks him he always makes another profile. Last monday it would have been their 2 years anivercery. On wednesday night he came in front of her apartment high on drugs and alchohol(he did that while they were dating too). He screamed and cried and written on the walls of the building in front of her doors. He also left her a letter in which he wrote everything he writes in the texts(you are mine forever i love you ect). She went to the police with her mom the next day and filed a report but i doubt that they'll do anything. She has a little 8 year old brother and she's frequently alone with him.

636,So we have been dating for 2 months now and everything has been amazing and all. At the beginning he kept talking about her ex and I made it clear that it bothers me. The problem is one time we were having a disagreement on something and he called me her name. It made me feel like crap and he noticed that. He felt really bad and deleted his ex on every social media. But today she texted him again talking about whatever drama she had in my life. I understand that they stayed friends or whatever but she was his first love and they dated for 2 years and they broke up because she cheated and lied not because he didnt have feelings for her. Am I right to be bothered by this or should I just let it go? I'm scared I'm going to get hurt. In the past I have been involved with some guy that was not over his ex and I felt used and stupid. I dont want to ever feel like that again.,31Jan2020,1
637,"So I will link a TL;DR at the bottom, but the body of this post gives needed context.

I am a traditional senior (4th year) in college, and this past 8-ish months have been extremely busy in both my life as a student and my personal life. I transferred over the summer following my sophomore (2nd) year to my current college, and due to issues with credit transfer I was told that I was a bit behind. Just before the fall I met with a new advisor (previous was fired or something) and was only then made aware that I was required to heavily load my schedule for the next few semesters in order to graduate in the timeline I want, and that I can afford. The summer and fall semester were enjoyable, and I was able to manage school as well as a job bar-tending late into nights on some weekdays and weekends. In the spring however I began to have issues keeping up with school and life. Early in the semester my girlfriend had surgery and needed constant care as her family does not have the means to do so, and I was studying for the MCAT as well as working and studying for my regular large credit load. To sum up a very long timespan (April-July), I was not able to properly prepare for the MCAT, took it and did not do well, then while taking 17 credit hours of upper division science over the summer and working studied and took it again (at the strong pressure of my advisor) to no avail. I then had a single weekend before going right back and starting the fall of my senior year. At this point I was extremely drained both emotionally and mentally, and I was encouraged to continue applying to medical schools so monetarily I was drained as well.

So I started the fall with more upper-division science courses, and was essentially fighting myself every day to do anything because of mental and emotional fatigue. Given that our school is on the small side, attendance is required in all classes which had never been an issue until that semester (teachers are often lax as long as it is not obtrusive). I was given too much outside of class work and studying than I could manage at the time, and my grades as well as sleep were not even close to what I would call normal. Most of my teachers were understanding, as they had taught me in previous courses and knew something was clearly off though I never shared exactly what with them. 

(If you’re still reading, you’re a trooper I’m almost done)

It came to a head however in my Evolution course, which was a teacher I had never been taught by before. To sum it up, we got a homework packet before thanksgiving break worth a large amount of points, of which had incomplete questions and I spent a very good chunk of time working on it. The teacher herself was even visibly confused when she tried to show me the proper way to go about the problem in her office hours. I then learned no one else in the class had even attempted to work on the packet when I got to class on the day it was due; and the teacher had to leave early due to sickness so she said she would just give everyone credit. This was all the week before an exam and I had spent my allotted study time for that class working on the packet. I then had a family member go in for emergency surgery and ultimately did not study enough. I vocalized the full situation regarding the packet and my family emergency, and she said I could submit a 1-page request to her on why I feel she should allow me to retake a different 3rd exam. In what was likely an unintentional release of bottled-up emotion, I wrote to her the circumstances that I had been dealing with and submitted it, and within 15 minutes she emailed a very snarky email that started by saying it would be unfair to other students (understandable), and ended by saying that she feels I should improve my time management skills before attempting to petition something like this again as everyone has things going on in their life. I dropped the course and am currently retaking it this semester with the same teacher (she’s the only one who teaches it). I tried to patch things up and be nice by going to her office and saying hello at the start of this semester, but I still get very dirty looks from her and she will avoid looking at me or talking to me if we are in the hallway together. I am completely unsure what I should do so that I can get through this class, and also how to patch up the image this teacher has of me/relationship with her as my instructor as it is so counter to anything I have ever dealt with before. What should I do?

TL;DR Life got in the way of school which led to burnout and under-performance. It came to a head in my Evolution class and I was forced to drop and now I am retaking it with the same professor who is still holding a grudge. What do I do to make things right again?",31Jan2020,1

647,"Wife in a pickle at work.

My apologies if this is not the correct sub. Please point me in the right direction if it is not. 

So, my wife works at a bar with the same concept at hooters. I have never worked in the restaurant business, and only worked retail after high school for a couple months before landing a pretty decent office gig. 

With that being said, I don’t think that I understand the inner workings/politics/and level of professionalism (or lack thereof) that comes with the territory of the restaurant business, not to mention inside the niche that it’s sexy skimpy clothing bars. 

About 6 months ago, a new manager was hired at her location. Since then, absolute hell has ensued. 
This manager is the most rude, corrupt, thieving, druggy person you can imagine. 

He sexually harasses a lot of the girls, but they are reluctant to come forward since he also “comps” meals for guests after they leave, leaving the girls with larger tips. He has harassed my wife and her good friend, and when they went to a different manager they said nothing could be done since they didn’t have proof. 

He apparently is always coming in late, leaving the girls to open the restaurant by themselves without him. And when he does show up, he is hung over or completely strung out on adderal or coke. 

He has offered coke, adderal, oxycodone, to girls for sexual favors. 

And last but not least, my wise suspects that he also steals from her when she is behind the bar. Most times she works, her cash drawer is either over or short by about $2.00, EVERY time she works with him, and he counts the money at the end of the night, she is $30-$50 short. 

So not only is he stealing from the restaurant, he’s stealing from ME and my wife since she has to pay back that “shortage”. 

What really set me off - is how he treats the girls as his personal servants. 

I got a crying phone call recently from the wife and the story is as follows. Manager, seated in a booth, asked my wife to go grab him a drink. (Mind you she is busy with multiple tables) 

As she is returning with the drink,  one of her tables is flagging her down. She passes the drink to one of her coworkers and asks her to drop it off with the manager. 

A couple minutes later, the manager calls my wife over. And says “I asked YOU to bring me this drink” picks it up, hands it back to her, and tells her to now
Hand it to him. She does so reluctantly. And he says “see? How fucking hard was that?”

This set the wife off, and she got into a yelling match with him, and told me that he was about to step out of the booth to get physical with her before a different manager stepped in between. The other manager clocked her out, and tried to settle her down and say he has her back, but this is just one example of the constant issues she is having with this guy, and nothing changes after multiple complaints to managers. 

My wife happens to be quite buddy buddy with the owners of the whole entire franchise, so here is my question:

In this situation, would it be best to go all the way up the chain to let the big bosses know what is going on in this restaurant? Is this common in the restaurant industry and will that cause this to just be swept under the rug? Does she need to go to HR instead? Will not having any “evidence” or proof cause this to go no where? She would basically be asking anyone she brings this to to trust that she is being 100% truthful and that she and other girls are having to endure these incredibly toxic and thieving work conditions. 

Thanks for any help.",31Jan2020,1
648,"My friend comes from a strict Muslim family. My family is Muslim, but we are a lot more lenient. I dress modest usually, sometimes I show my legs though.   I don’t eat pork, yet I don’t pray. Anyway she’s just a lot stricter than I am and she actually believes in God. I’m just an atheist from a Muslim household. 

I feel like she judges me a lot unintentionally. One time I wore a crop top and she kept commenting on it making me uncomfortable. She apologized when I responded weird, but she just kept doing it. She kept asking me if I was mad and I said no. This is a common occurrence, she will always ask me if I’m mad. 

This white guy is interested in dating me rn. I don’t know him too well, but I’m starting to trust him the more I talk to him. He goes to a Christian private school. Which I thought could be a problem. When my friend found out she told me “so no. No no no” in response to me going out with him. That was a response I expected from her. I think it’s inappropriate among the other things that come out. I feel like if I was a white girl she wouldn’t say stuff like this. 

I feel like I come from an awkward space. I’m not religious at all, but I do follow some Muslim rules just to please my parents.

649,"TLDR at the end. 


I interviewed yesterday at a non-profit ten minutes from my house for a position that would keep me in a public-facing role, doing similar work to what I've been doing for the past several years. I'm not thrilled about the idea of staying in the answering phones/emails/customer service world, but this organization emphasises internal promotion and there'd be a lot of room for growth. Plus, the role would fit in with the communications degree I'm currently pursuing, and the database they use is really common so the skills I'd pick up would be pretty marketable. 


They told me to expect a week or two before I heard back. I got a call from them today with an offer $10k net annual over what I'm currently making.  


Complicating matters, I'm also waiting to hear back about a possible promotion where I am now. I really connect with my current org's mission, and this new position would both pay more than what I'm currently doing and have the benefit of not being public facing at all. However, it's well outside my wheelhouse--data analysis, report pulling, SQL, etc--and I'm scared that the learning curve will be too steep. I should hear back about what's happening with that early next week, but I've been training with the person who's vacating the position, and a lot goes over my head as of right now. 


So the TLDR is, I potentially have the choice between two jobs. One is hard, scary, and I might fail, which would put me back where I started. The other is in my wheel house and something I'm really good at, but that I really kind of hate doing. What do I do?",31Jan2020,1
650,"So I completely fucked up my first year at uni (I'm doing a Bachelor's in psychological science) and failed the 7/8 units I attempted that year. I took 6 months off to work, then did two units in the second semester and got distinctions in both. I did this to make a more manageable workload. I'm currently doing a summer unit to get 4 completed units in total - I can tell that I have passed by this point so no worries there.

I intend to keep up this momentum, but I'm worried that even if I got HDs in every single subject from now on (I don't think that's likely but I can dream right?), that my job prospects upon finishing my degree would be very bleak.

When I finish my bachelor's I either want to go into HR or continue my studies to become a psychologist (depends on how I go from here on out).

Would I be denied job opportunities based on my transcript? What should I do if the future is indeed bleak with my current situation? 

BTW: Don't tell me to quit uni because ""it clearly isn't for you"" - I'm very aware and very regretful that I lost a year and a half from fucking around, you don't need to rub it in, trust me I know. 

I'm now determined to get this degree to get a job I could be potentially passionate about, have a positive outlook and am ready to aim for those HDs.",31Jan2020,1
652,"Right now I am absolutely livid. My sister is 17. I'm 21 and living at home while I finish college - should be moving out in ~4 months. My sister has absolutely no respect for people's things and boundaries and it pisses me off. First I want to start by saying I have had a job since I was 16. From the point I got my first job I have bought every single piece of my clothing/shoes/makeup that I own myself with my own money. My sister has never had a job and my parents continue to take her shopping on their dime because she's a spoiled brat and always insists she needs more than she does. She has SO many more clothes than I do and yet she feels compelled to steal mine. It absolutely infuriates me because I never give her permission to take my things and she will NEVER voluntarily give anything back to me. I always realize something is missing and have to hunt it down myself. She has historically ruined my things - ripping my pants to the point of being unwearable, staining light colored clothes, messing the leather up in ONE WEAR on shoes I have kept well for 5 years. This is why I tell her over and over to leave my shit alone. She always comes up with this bullshit counterargument that ""I steal her things too"" which is absolutely not true. She's extremely volatile and when I confront her and calmly tell her to stop going in my room and taking things she blows up, calls me a ""fucking bitch"", tells me to go fuck myself, tells me I'm ugly and fat and nobody likes me. The thing is I have a lock on my door. It got so bad that I put a lock on my door that you can only open if you have the key. I have the key. My parents have the spare. There have been occasions where my parents have let her in while I'm away because she claims ""I stole something of hers"" and will even fake a text conversation with me saying I'm allowing her to borrow something of mine to which she goes in and steals something. Lately, she seems to be getting into my room on her own though. I have no idea how. I noticed a pair of my nice pants in her room one day and took them back and stuck them in my laundry basket to wash - didn't say anything to her. Two days later I was doing laundry and noticed they were gone. Guess where they were! In her shithole room again. This time I confronted her, asked her how she got in my room, why she dug through my dirty clothes to steal my pants again. She completely blew up at me and started screaming and threatened to put my pants in her unflushed toilet. I got the pants back and put them in my hamper AGAIN to wash. It's been maybe 4 days since that and I was looking for a shirt to wear out tonight and noticed it was missing. Looked in her room, couldn't find the shirt, but found the pants AGAIN. I never forget to lock my door, have no idea how she keeps getting in here, and I'm genuinely just really pissed off at this point. I specifically told her not to take that pair of pants and she did just that. What should I do? I really don't know how to keep her from getting in my room? My parents can do absolutely nothing with her/to discipline her because she's an actual demon of a child. They also have a lock on their door and told her when she turns 18 she needs to find somewhere to live because she'll no longer be welcome to live in their house. I'm mostly just concerned with not having to pay to replace my shit so any advice on that is welcome.",31Jan2020,1

Now Since last year I make too much to qualify for that. The cheapest plan I can find for my husband and I is over $500 a month! And it covers pretty much NOTHING! The copays are really high and the deductible is ridiculous. 

We would barely use our health insurance, we're in our early 30s and healthy. No kids. It's making us think that we're better off not having health insurance and just paying the penalty and paying out of pocket if we need to go to the doctor. I'm sure it would all end up being less than $6,000 for the year. 

This is just absolutely crazy. Does anyone have advice on other options? I would like to try for a baby at the end of this year or sometime next year and I obviously need health insurance for that.

663,"I take fire safety extremely seriously. I fervently believe you should always be able to exit any building in 30 seconds or less, or you can count yourself toast in the event of a large fire.

Last February, there was a 3am fire in my apartment building. After being awoken by alarms and firemen knocking on my door, I followed a line of people making their way down a staircase. 

I ended up getting stuck behind an elderly neighbor who has great difficulty walking. She needed the assistance of two firemen to slowly, slowly, slowly make her way down the staircase. The path in front of her was clear, but she and the firemen took up the width of the staircase, so I couldn't get past them. 

I was pretty scared from the fact that our building was on fire, but in the moment, it seemed it would be the height of selfishness to say ""EXCUSE ME"" and push past her to safety. Plus, with her being my neighbor, I'd have to deal with the fallout of throwing her under the proverbial fiery bus for my own sake every time I saw her after the fire. And considering neither of us were injured and we believed the flames were far away, I wouldn't have had the excuse of being in immediate danger.

Luckily, with about one floor to go before ground level, one of the firemen with the lady turned around and saw me, said ""LET'S GO LET'S GO,"" and stepped aside with the lady so that I could scramble past and leave the building. Then I got outside and saw smoke billowing out my neighbor's window, and I realized how serious the situation had truly been. It was an all-around frightening experience.

I still think about this often but don't know what the best course of action would have been. My desire to be polite and respectful to an old lady nearly cost me my life during a true emergency.

670,"My husband (40/M) and I (38/F) have a son (5/M) and an almost 2YO daughter.  Ever since he was about 3, randomly if he got change or money (nothing big) from family he would put it in his piggy bank.  It wasn’t until maybe the past 1/2 year ago where he realized the meaning behind money and that you can buy things.  My son has always had a “saving mentality.”  When we would get him little toys or pieces of candy,  he would always “save” it.  Meaning not open it / eat it for literally days until he was ready to open it.  We’ve never taught him this and was surprised he had the patience to not rip open toys or candy right away.  Even for his 5th birthday he got a ton of gifts and we set some aside to open at later dates but told him for the rest he can open one a day.  Surprisingly he was fine with it and relished saving a toy to open a day.  

The past couple of family get togethers his grandparents and aunts have given him money (xmas, NYE and also he gets a dollar from us for helping with laundry).  We let him keep his own money and bought him an ATM toy for Xmas so he can open and close his bank easily.  We let him know if he really wants something (e.g. a toy) he can use his own money or he’ll have to wait for xmas or his bday.  He’s only used his money once to get something and he was torn on using it.  Now, some people might be like wow that’s great a 5 YO doesn’t just blast his money for instant gratification.  But now I think he’s too attached to his money.  He has about $100 in his bank.  He’s good with numbers and the cost of things so he knows that’s a lot (for the things he likes to buy).  He knows candy is like $2 and toys can be like $10-$30.  

Anyway his favorite aunt’s birthday is coming up.  We asked him if he would like to buy something small for her with his own money.  We’re talking like $5.  He was like no way.  Maybe because he knows too much about the value of money that he’s reluctant to spend it, but we were pretty shocked.  His aunt always gets him things so we were like, hey your aunt always buys you nice things, don’t you think it would be nice to get her something for her birthday? He legit cried and refused to budge.

I know he’s still young and the concept of money is probably very black and white to him, but I don’t want him to grow up being so involved with saving his money that he can’t even spend $5 on a loved one.  It’s his choice obviously so we didn’t say much to him and let it go.  We would never force him.  I also don’t want him to learn to be pressured to give money if people ask.  That wasn’t our intention and we didn’t expect the firm backlash from him.  We thought he would be so happy to get her something with his own money.  How do we teach him correctly about spending money?  

One time I asked to borrow a dollar because I needed to refill our laundry card and I had no change.  He reluctantly gave it to me and I had to pay him back, which is fine, but he immediately asked if he could help with laundry to make $1 for his chore - essentially making an extra $1.  It was cute at the time but now I’m not sure.

He’s not obsessed with his money like counting it all the time, or asking for it.  He’s actually a pretty good kid.  Doesn’t throw tantrums if he doesn’t get something.  He knows bdays and xmas are usually when he gets gifts.  He’s just obsessed with not letting go of what he has - which is a good thing but worried it might lead to something worse when he’s older.

Any tips or advice? Or should I not even worry?  For background reference, my husband and I are maybe between lower/middle class regarding our finances.  We tend to live paycheck to paycheck.  We’re in NYC so the cost of living has been hard on us.  We’re thinking of moving out of state this summer to be more financially free.  My husband and I are not cheap people with our loved ones.  We’re just normal.  We’ve also been blessed with very loving and generous relatives on both sides.  So we would like to teach our son that it’s nice to be generous sometimes and give back to those that gave something to him.  Our relatives are well off.  They don’t support us financially in a any way but love to treat us out to dinner and give things to our kids - which we appreciate so much.  Hence I wish my son was a bit appreciative and would like to buy a tiny gift for his aunt.",31Jan2020,1

I've had *long* talks with him about this kinda stuff and while I do not agree with him on many topics, I can empathise and understand where he's coming from. He's a man who has been displaced, had his livelihood ruined, and feels like the world is against him.

Now, I don't think he's a bad guy. He's shown his true character many times as I've known him, and I believe that he is a genuinely good person. I also believe that he has been deeply indoctrinated, in the way that he was raised, and has a hard time breaking out of that school of thought.

At the end of our discussion, I told him that we were probably never going to reach a conclusion that we're both happy with, so we're gonna drop it out of mutual respect and a desire to get along with the people we live with.

Being a kid at 23, I'm kinda conflicted about all this. I care about the guy and his wellbeing, but he's obviously an old dog that's not learning any new tricks.

I won't accept any ""he's toxic, cut him out of your life"" bullshit. He's living here whether I like it or not, and I know that he has the capacity for compassion and empathy - he just has an outdated way of thinking and reacts strongly when his world view is challenged.

This is a person I live with, a person I care about. He has so much good in his heart but he is very angry, very hurt and very lost. What do I do? Do I continue to try and mentor him in being a more open and accepting person? He's dropped the ""I'm older than you so-"" a few times but I can tell he really does consider what I have to say. I'm just deeply unsure about how I should handle our relationship going forward.",31Jan2020,1

I’ve been able to take public transit within my local region and I live in a suburb of Los Angeles. I thing I have a difficult time with is taking public transit into Los Angeles.

I grew up sheltered in a suburb away from the city. My mom is more so sheltered than I am. My mom hasn’t been to Los Angeles in over 10 years easily. On the news she constantly hears about the homelessness problem and crime in Los Angeles. My mom has a very negative image of the city in her mind. I several reasons why I need to take public transit into the city. My main reason why is there is just a lot more going on in Los Angeles and there are a lot more places that I can go to. There is just a lot more to do in Los Angeles than in the suburb region I reside in.

I know many of you are going to tell me that I can solve my problems by driving. There are several obstacles they face when it comes to learning how to drive and I’m not gonna get into all of them. The main thing that people need to know is that I have a disability that makes learning how to drive very difficult. I’m also very slow learner when it comes to driving. Even if I was driving, that does not change my mom‘s perspective of the city all the sudden. If she knew I was going into the city, even if I was driving, she would still have a lot of pushback.

690,"This has been an ongoing problem in my life. Sometimes, I am sure that he cheated. The people around me (best friend, siblings, therapist) all agree that the evidence is irrefutable. But, as soon as I believe that I'm right, I convince myself of all of the reasons that I'm wrong. I have no hard evidence, but so many pieces of small evidence.

I'm 20 now, but when I was 12 he took me to his office and let me play on his phone while he worked with clients. Things in my life weren't going well, and it really impacted him. I found messages with him and an employee in which she sent kisses, hearts, said she loved him, and asked intimate details about my life. She didn't work there long.

Around this time, he stopped coming home at a fixed time. He would go on weekend trips and be unable to locate. If my mom was out of town, he wouldn't come home (this still happens. recently, he said he was going to KMart and came home at 2am empty handed). All of the messages on his phone are wiped out frequently. 

He's constantly losing his wedding ring because he's constantly taking it off. One time, I went to work with him and another woman (who he bankrolls and pays for her insurance) was by his side the whole time. Everyone there spoke to me like I was a victim of something, and someone turned me away from him in time for me to hear kissing noises behind me. He wasn't wearing his wedding ring.

That day I found messages with another woman in which they talked about how he would come over to change her lightbulbs. It sounds innocent, but it felt like an innuendo.

I confronted him, once. He laughed it off and told me that he was flattered that I would think he was able to pull something like that off. He told me that how he texts women is because he's old and doesn't know what's appropriate. He said his ring only comes off so he can get it resized.

I'm losing my mind, holding onto this anger. Half of the time, I'm convinced that he's a cheater and I should just confront him (but he would deny it!). Half of the time, I have so much guilt for believing that he would cheat, that I have anger toward him for something that I don't have real evidence for.

I need advice from an outside perspective. How do I handle this? I know my mom is clueless, she confirms it when I subtly test her. I want to protect my mom and let go of this anger, which makes it hard for me to trust people, maintain relationships, and be kind to my extremely supportive father. What should I do?",31Jan2020,1
691,"So a little backstory: I’m a high school teacher who wants to branch out. Naturally I teach studying skills to my students, but some kids need a little extra. Now some are lucky and their parents can ‘buy’ the help. Others: not so much.

I already have a channel with very low quality vids (voice over on a ppt explaining some basics of the subject I teach, live streams with a mini whiteboard and my laptops webcam to give them extra chance to ask questions before quiz time)

So I’d love to branch out creating Dutch videos of decent quality on note taking in class, different ways to plan, different ways to prep for tests, etc etc. I thought the style you see in a lot of ‘plan with me’ videos made by bullet journal channels. 

With the videos (and a site, already have the site and know the basics in Wordpress) I hope to build content that is basics free for students and hopefully I’d make some extra money to cover the basic costs with adds / selling items on the site that would be (not necessary) but fun related to studying / bullet journals / planning. 

But as much as I know about studying I have no clue  about equipment needed. It needs to do a decent job, not the most expensive. Like I said, the money isn’t the main thing, but providing easy access study help for kids that otherwise don’t have access is. (I would however want to be able to break even on the endeavour).

I ask because my sister told me not to, but I don't know if I can listen to this because she hasn't been in a relationship before. What do you guys think?

Thank you guys :)",31Jan2020,1

713,"My ex and I remained friends after our breakup a while ago, but now she’s currently not talking to me after I messed up pretty bad.

The situation has a lot to it (too much to go into detail here) &amp; we left on terms of potentially getting back together at some point in the future. However, I fell in with one of my friends I’d known from school again &amp; we started talking a lot &amp; I was pretty upset about some stuff going on between me &amp; my ex. I told her something I shouldn’t have, that wasn’t my place to share.

I didn’t think of the consequences of this. It was stupid &amp; immature &amp; I regret it, but I felt like I just needed someone to talk to at the point.

I want to sort this out with her. I know I messed up, I just want to talk to her. How do I do this?",31Jan2020,1
714,"Hello! I might just need some help/advice, or if anyone is going through this as well, well, hugs. Lots of it.

Bear with me please, this is kind of long.


I haven't been in a good relationship with my mum ever since. I've been emotionally/mentally unstable for who knows how long but have never been to a doctor so I try to cope with it on my own.

Recently me and my mum caught another fight resulting to me cutting myself. We always fight and she never listens to me and it has been really unhealthy ever since. I ran away from home back then and she told me to go back and she also told me that she'll change, to which she did... for a good couple of months. It has been hard to have someone whom you think will have your back, but actually does not. She only cares about my physical being, but the rest is abandoned. Talking to her feels like I'm talking to a wall, or at least it's just that she never tries to understand. She hears you out and listens and that's it. Never really digests and give me proper advice other than 'just pray to God' and I don't mean to disregard that but sometimes I just need a little something more than that. Blaming me for not praying isn't helping as well. I've been trying to pick myself back up together and I have decided that maybe this time it shouldn't be with her. I can't call this place I home and I have a hard time having to deal with her everyday. This place has killed all my energy and happiness and I would leave in a heartbeat. 

Here is the thing... I want to move out because I feel like it will do me good, but should I risk it? 

I'm starting out as an artist and I'm not sure if I can make ends meet at the point but from where I stand I think it is also a challenge to make things work. What do you think I should do?",31Jan2020,1

717,"hello,

recently i’ve been going through a lot of shit. my motivation for trying in school has vanished, my anxiety and depression are at an all time high and in  all honesty i haven’t felt happy in months.  

back to my “friend.” i’ve been talking to this person for 4 years now, she’s one of my closest friends and someone i can trust. however a couple of months ago she changed. so this year is freshman year of high school, with this obviously people make new friends etc. me and her met this girl that i’ll call bitch from hell. bitch from hell would be extremely close with me and ask me to hangout with her and text me all the time to go places and yeah. but then second semester after winter break she completely dropped me, and when i say drop i mean drop, she never texts me she never asks me to hang out but now she asks my close friend too. now my close friend is kind and funny and everyone likes her so i’m not surprised but she also completely dropped me as well. she only texts me for answers and to talk trash abt bitch from hell who she supposedly “can’t say no” to when bitch from hell asks her to hang out all the time. i always text my close friend first, i always ask her to hang out, i always reach out first. at this point i’m so lost.

sometimes i think that somethings wrong with me and that i’m not likeable or fun like my close friend. now i do have other friends, i’ve never been alone in a class and i make friends fairly easily, but none of them even text me after school or ask to hang out it’s kind of like a in class friend type situation. i just want more close friends and a better friend group. my friend group rn only has 4 people, 2 of which i’m close too, and out of the 2 i’m close too one of them is moving. the one that’s moving is the person who brings the other 2 together to make a “friend group.” i literally have 2 friends at this point and i’m sick of it. what should i do? what do i need to do? am i some annoying, bland, boring person? i know i’m shy and awkward but is it rly that bad? my whole life i’ve been always disregarded and people never choose me first. i don’t know what to do anymore and i’m reaching the end i can’t focus on school or anything, is this just my depression and anxiety lying to me? please give me some advice i feel like i can’t fit in anywhere.",31Jan2020,1
718,"29M with no savings, degree or any particularly worthwhile trade. Throw in a gambling addiction, untreated and unmedicated bipolar depression...(when I was 21-24 I had various cocktails with varying levels of success. Crippling anxiety on a constant and daily basis is my actual fight).

I'm making $650 a week smashing autocad for a civil engineering firm which I absolutely hate. I taught it to myself but I'm not particularly advanced, I don't mesh with the people I work with, and I don't want to stay in this area any longer than I have to. I also flat out dislike waking up at 7AM and rushing to work to sit on a computer until 5PM. It's not me. I picked up the CAD gig 2 years ago because I had the need to quit my job making a $65K a year salary as a ""maintenance director""/part of a property management team. Very long story short but I was working for my family age 23-26 in commercial/industrial property management/development and was handling just about all of the ""day to day' operations by the end. This is the best thing experience wise for me moving forward...I wasn't making a ton but the family sold to a group who had expansion plans. Great. My family was kind enough to negotiate a salaried position for me within the new group contingent on the sale....while we were under contract to sell I was buttered up and made to think I was ""part of the team"". My first real day of work for them after the sale I quickly realized I was not a part of the team and I should probably feel foolish for thinking I was.

On a personal note I found them to be unscrupulous and unpleasant and despite a nice salary for a 27 year old dropout, with a private office and almost complete autonomy. I had no real responsibilities. I was unhappier in that situation than maybe any other time in my life, save for being off the wall insane suicidal/harmful to self age 19-21. I stayed for a year and I regret not quitting 11 months sooner. The engineering firm is a friend/former tenant, they hired me no questions asked and I also am given a lot of leeway and space. I think we all know I'm not long for a career in subdivision design lol, but it has been 2 years now and I feel like I have to go

That's most of the bad stuff...here's what I have going for me: I want to marry the gf (26), she makes \~$60K as a teacher, she needs another 1.5 years for ""tenure"" and seems on track for that. She has around $60-70K in student loan debt but honestly if we get married I think my Dad would pay it off no questions asked. He...and most of my family are pretty wealthy. Like all families, relationships are extremely complicated and there's a lot of fighting. (divorces, new wives, 2 sisters, family farms, etc) but my family (Dad really) has taken care of me. He asked me to be the executor of his will this year (he has 1 more major piece of land to unload before he can be fully ""retired"" from that life). Dad has relocated to another state and already has 2 pretty busy careers going ""in retirement"" so the other good news to glean is the gf and I live in his house, close to rent free ($115 a month HOA fee. Utilities are under $400 a month. 2 dogs to take care of as well). He's going to sell this house eventually, but I think that's still at least 1 year away. All the old business records/financials are stored in this garage + as previously mentioned there is 1 more complicated asset to unload...I want to move closer to gf's work (she commutes 45 minutes 1 way) but considering my bank account has been dependent on the utah fucking jazz lately that's not happening tomorrow

So um, help? I've thought a lot about wanting to work in the ""nonprofit"" sector, a number of nonprofits made up a portion of our tenant roster back when I was passionate about what I was doing for work...I really like the environment and felt I fit in there than some of the more blue collar stuff I've always been around otherwise. It's obviously intimidating to me to think about applying to any kind of job when I went from dropping out of college to operating a backhoe and never had to apply for a job since. Worth mentioning that I hate ""mechanical"" stuff. I have cried myself to sleep many a night due to my incompetence with cars, tools, any kind handy fixit. The people around me are all so gifted with their hands...me trying to hang a painting would result in a hospital trip. I'm not too shabby operating the heavy equipment though...

I have a niche hobby I'm also going to start passion writing about...it is realistic to gather an audience and ""make money"" I think...hard not to think of myself as a fuckup ne'er-do-well. Also growing up I used to think ""I'll just be a working comedian"" if I don't figure it out by \_\_ but have never tried that either",31Jan2020,1
719,"I've decided to post on here, because, I'm tired of the way I've been feeling lately. I'm just gonna get straight to how this started.

As a kid I grew up in a good environment, and the people I hung out with were also really good for me. However, that all changed during the 8th grade.

I met new people, and these sorts of people are drug addicts. 13 year old me was dumb and I decided to hang out with these people cause I thought they were really cool.

Now, at the time I wasn't depressed or suffering from any mental health issue. These kids started recommending and telling me about certain drugs. I was too scared to try anything because I knew if my parents found out, they would be so upset with me.

**That was my mindset until my 14th birthday**

As a surprise one of the kids from the group wanted me to finally try something. I wasn't as nervous because I started hanging out with people who weren't good for me anyway, and so I just had a no fucks given attitude. On that night I tried acid, that's when my life started to shift around.

I started experimenting with drugs, a couple of weeks after I tried acid, I was already smoking weed.

Even then I knew what I was doing was dumb, but I couldn't stop, I was so caught up with my anxiety and being antisocial, it's hard to stop when I feel so much better high.

But I seriously was an asshole to my girlfriend, whenever she got mad at me, either I would just dip and smoke or give her drugs to calm her down. That was a big mistake, and I honestly wish I could erase those memories.

&amp;#x200B;

But, nothing has changed these days. I would say I'm a bit more careful and mature. But as the title states, life sucks when I'm not high, and when I am high I'm always worrisome of someone thinking bad of me or just not liking me because of my past and things I've done. Drugs mainly help me cope with my mental health and I know that I'm a drug addict now, but at the same time I ask myself if i should stop, and I really don't know anymore.

I'm sorry if this was too long, I just needed to explain everything for it to make a bit more sense.",31Jan2020,1
720,"There was a substantial amount of semen in my clothes, so I obviously washed them. But after I did that and dried my clothes all of my clothes had a slightly ‘off’ smell. I think it stayed in the water and washed to all of my clothing. I washed them again and it’s still not much better. How do I get rid of semen, so far I’ve only been using normal laundry detergent. Is there something else I should be doing or a trick to get it out?",31Jan2020,1
721,"So my friend (let’s call her Ann) said that one of our mutual friends, “Dana,” (whom I know somewhat, but Ann knows a lot better) invited us to lunch (with another girl we both know equally). I agreed to go. Then later, I found out that Dana technically didn’t invite me. Ann was showing me a list of places to eat that Dana sent her, and when she clicked one it scrolled up and I saw previous texts. Basically Dana invited Ann out and Ann asked if I could come too (FYI I never asked Ann to do this), and Dana said yeah. 

Now I feel kind of awkward. I asked Ann why she did that and she said because she wants me there, but I wish she had consulted me before. I feel like it makes me sound desperate (like what if Dana or the other girl assume I begged Ann to get me invited too or something?).  And if I wasn’t included in the initial invite, I’m clearly not wanted. I guess they don’t “not want” me there either, it’s more like they’re just indifferent to my presence. Which begs the question: should I even bother going? 

I just feel awkward about this whole situation, and crappy about myself tbh. I know they don’t dislike me or anything- I guess they just don’t care/are indifferent to me, which in a way is even worse? What do you recommend I do? And any advice on how to deal with feeling crappy about myself? Thanks in advance.

722,"I was involved in a hit and run. I was rear ended, and we both pulled over and before I could even look at the damage, he got out of his car and started screaming at me. Now, I’m 5’5 and 115 pounds so I was legit scared and told him I’m calling the police and I got back in my car. While I was on the phone with the police, he tried to drive away. I tried to follow him but he did a bunch of illegal u-turns and was speeding down neighborhoods. I finally lost him when he drove down the opposite lane of traffic. I was on the phone with police the whole time and they were unable to catch up with him. I filed a police report and they were able to give me his insurance information based off of his license plate. 
I contacted his insurance and they basically told me that because he’s denying the accident ever happened, that there isn’t anything they can do. I don’t have a dash cam, and there’s no street cameras where the accident happened. There may be footage of him driving erratically trying to evade me. I’m not sure.  There is damage on my car, but none on his since he had a huge beefed out truck. My car is still drivable but now has a dent on the lift gate. 
Now, I can pay my 500$ deductible and have my insurance go through arbitration to fight on my behalf, but do I have enough evidence to prove this happened? Is it worth it to pay the deductible and try to fight for this ? I’m unsure if my insurance will be able to prove he was at fault with the current information I have.

723,"This guy and I met on a dating app and have been talking for about a month. There were lots of times where he asked me out just for a casual hangout (or idk what his real intentions were) but i always declined because i was afraid that he wouldn’t like who i really am in real life as compared to who i appeared to be online, so we never really met. We used to talk from day to night, dusk til dawn, basically every time. However, recently we haven’t been communicating like we used to. I keep on getting this feeling that he’s slowly losing his interest but i just shrug it off and think that maybe he’s just busy/tired/asleep. As of now, i don’t like him like THAT yet but i am kind of getting there, like, i just like having him around (we talked about what we’re looking for in the app before and we’re both into casual dates but open for serious potentials). Just an hour ago, he messaged me but i haven’t responded because i don’t know if i should or should not. Some might say that i should just ask him but I feel like we’re not in the right situation yet for me to ask him if he’s still interested or not. Each time he leaves me on read and hits me up a few hours later makes me feel like he just remembers me when he has no one to entertain him, like i’m his second or last option.  Now my question is, is there a way for me to salvage this ‘spark’ between us that is slowly dying? Is meeting up with him the only choice in order to (hopefully) gain his interest back?

We had sex but it wasn't that great for either of us as we both had a bit of nerves, she said it was fine though and we spent the rest of the night cuddling. When I left the next morning she said she was tired, I could tell as she seemed a little emotional or moody. I texted her an hour later with a joke which she responded to immediately, after I responded with ""but hey, thanks for having me over last night. Really enjoyed spending time with you (:""

The latter kid- I really don’t want him around the animals. He’s reckless and apathetic, and these animals require a LOT of care. He’s only here because he’s required to be by the school. I’ve only known the supervisor for a year and intend to sit down for an interview at the end of final’s season (I was set up to be hired last year after half of the workers graduated but they ended up using the budget on summer programs that fell through).  I don’t wanna look speculative or rude. I really don’t want to be around these two at all as I love working here and they’re very unpleasant to be around, but my first concern are the animals. I’ve been working the longest of all the volunteers so my hope is that I’m working with the animals while the newer volunteers do general grunt work.

750,"A while back I met this one girl who was about 15 at the time. We started talking for a bit and found we got along really well, had similar senses of humor and tastes in music. She was somewhat mature but her age showed through on several things which reminded me that whatever i was building here was wrong but she was cute and i was lonely so I continued chatting with her over text. I used the power dynamic I had to basically steer conversations away from sex or anything sexual related because I didn't want to think about her like that, its hard to explain. I got her a necklace which she ended up wearing pretty often which made me feel nice but then I realized. I am 20. I am doing something very wrong here, I am grooming her, I need to stop this immediately. So I slowly became distant with her and urged her to go after this one dude who was around her age and with some advice I gave her she ended up dating him and I felt relieved. Thank god. 

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't the first time something like this has happened. I see a younger girl, she is really cute, and I start to confidently hit on her and strike up conversation. I know what to say and do, naturally. I call it ""predator mode"" because thats how it feels. Like I am some manipulative predator grooming some young girl. I don't really think they are victims, I mean I never go sexual with them but I will admit I do want to be in a relationship with them. Overall, its creepy and I know it, you guys don't need to tell me its wrong, I am very aware of that. The feelings do carry on into adulthood but usually when they do become adults they either already have a long term boyfriend or they are going to college and find one there. They realize they can get better or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

My theory on why I am like this is that I am a loser no girl would want to be with because i don't provide enough, adult women have enough life experience to tell when someone is a loser, isn't worth being with, and in general should remain alone, younger girls don't have that. So when I go and talk to them, and it hits off so well, its because the younger girls don't instantly reject me, they don't know better. Not only that, its because I want power and control. I can steer where things go without her realizing it. I can feel like a protector or something pathetic. Its all predatory like I said, thats why I try to stay away from girls that young but it still hurts in a way because i want to have this feeling towards adult women. Can anyone come up with their own reasons why I am like this and ways I can get passed it?",31Jan2020,1

769,"So I'm 21, study in university (kind of), and am enrolled in a school for Game Design (which is the reason my uni is lagging). I live about about 8-10 hours from my mother and my father is on the other side of an ocean, but I do get most of my money from them (while also giving private foreign language lessons to middle school kids to make some money on the side -most of my living expenses however are still covered by my parents)

In the last few days I decided to put all my out of class game design work on hold so I could study for an exam.  This was working really well in conjunction with some other small changes I was making, like moving my wake up time so I ended up getting out of bed around 8 am instead of my usual 10-11, laying off most of my video game time, and going to training every day instead of skippin half the time like I had been doing.

I was feeling pretty good about myself, but I also had the feeling it was too good to last. I believe I have a tendency to interfere with my own good actions for whatever reason, so I might have been looking for an excuse to feel miserable again. 

Anyway, yesterday I played video games until about 1 am, so today I woke up late, barely studied at all, and slept about two hours in the afternoon before going back to studying for a very short amount of time. I should have been training right now but slept through the beginning so just decided to study instead of going to a later class, but I ended up wasting some (not all, fortunately) time on reddit and instagram before deciding to make this post. 

I believe it may have something to do with a girl I asked out. I wanted to prove to myself I could do it without pussying out so I basically spent a day figuringout what to say and imagining all the ways I could be rejected. Turns out she had a boyfriend, but she took it really well, said I was sweet and switched subjects (instead of, say, being totally weirded out, awkward, and not talking to me at all). And the point wasn't even to go out with her really (well, it was, but I the rejection factor was high here so I wasn't really shocked when it happened), but to show myself I had the balls to ask out this pretty girl. 

Anyway, I realise I've had a hard time accepting this last fact, and have to keep telling myself I did a good job and that everything basically went as planned, but I still have this weird bad feeling hanging over me, which unfortunately I know all too well, that nothing is really worth doing. 

So, how do I snap myself out of this before I slip into losing hope of studying and passing my exam and training and spend two weeks closed in my room sleeping and jacking off? (I'm off to do some minor housework in the hopes it gets me in the ""get stuff done"" mood in the meanwhile)",31Jan2020,1

They're pretty much all I have. They're both younger than me, which causes people to be like, Oh you need friends your age, blah blah blah, do sports or something. 

1. I hate Sports
2. I suck at sports, but really though

I'm homeschooled, which is a huge factor. I don't like it, cuz I don't really have friends because of it. My parents aren't taking me out anytime soon.

I used to be friends with these 2 kids who were also younger than me, but I lost contact with them when I got my iPad taken off of me. (Don't bother asking why, I'm not telling you)

Let me add that these friends are like 3-1 year younger than me, I'm not friends with a group of 3 year olds or anything, lol.

The thing is, I can make a friend, but I suck at getting their contact information or anything.

I have like, 6 friends I met at camp, but I'm not very good with getting their numbers or social media or crap.

773,"Hi.

I could do with some advice. I (m @ about 7 years old)  I had a friend (m @ about 8 years old). Not sure where he learned of such adult stuff, but he started trying new ""games"" with me, including playing ""doctor"" and such. I wasn't exactly keen about it but I was curious and played along a fair bit. I guess I started to feel uncomfortable and we stopped hanging out for a couple of years.

Then around the age of \~9, him \~10, we hung out again, but now these games went to full blown sex. He would make me give him oral sex, put it in my butt, start to finish. At first I said no, but then he would either guilt me, shame me, blackmail me or physically make me (by shoving his penis into my mouth, hand, etc). Over time I guess I got used to it and stopped resisting. 

In my opinion this was rape, and it occurred many times for several years.

Where I need advice is what eventually happened. This repeated exposure and repeated forced sex eventually led to me enjoying it. I would orgasm each time, though I would always be the receiver.

By the age of 15 or so, we stopped talking, and that was the end of our friendship.

For \~10 years after that I didn't speak of it to anyone, until I told my wife, and she thinks it was a close-and-shut case of sexual assault. I'm not so sure since I seemed to enjoy the last of it, perversely, embarrassingly and shamefully.

I have now accepted I'm bisexual, and it's become tough since some people challenge me (""Pfft how do you know you're bi, you're heterosexual and married""). I'm also thoroughly monogamous, I'd never cheat on my wife, and I love her with no plans to ever leave her to ""experiment"". 

In conclusion, I was hoping for some general advice on the following:

1) Was it truly entirely rape / sexual assault, when I eventually conceded and gave consent, and enjoyed it?

2) When challenged about my bisexuality, how can I express that I have experienced homosexual relations without expressing it was via a kind of coerced sex that I enjoyed?

This went on for a while then we got phones and of course secret social media one day I left my phone inside and I had stupidly left notifications on and she found out, I don’t remember what happened there about 6 moths ago in my memory (on top of finding very had but not impossible to remember anything from 5-11).

• I panic when I hear foot steps
• I feel the need to hide everything I do from my mum and the idea of her knowing things she probably wouldn’t care about gives me far more anxiety than it should
• I feel guilty for what my brother went through like it’s my fault
•(this one I don’t think is wrong but people say I’m wrong) I blame myself for my parents divorce, I have reasoning though a while ago I was having tea with my dad and he was talking about how my mum and step sister used to get along before things got to stressful, I also know a child (me) would be stressful and from what I can work out things started going bad between them around the time I was born
• I don’t trust many of my memories whether they are from yesterday or 5 years ago
•I feel lonely even when I’m near people 
• I feel like I’m not a good enough person to be as happy as I am
•I only feel confident when I have people with me
• I crave physical affection but I’m also incredibly scared of it
•I’m pretty convinced I’m useless 
•I feel like I’m a burden 
•I can’t handle being complemented and cry when anyone tries

I have a problem with where I work at the moment. I consistently am disrespected and belittled, and I'm not sure if I have any solid cause for receiving unemployment if I were to just walk out today.  


Here's a quick summary of where I am, and my reasoning for wanting to leave this toxic work environment.  


I am underpaid, and my boss has even told me to my face that the work that I do should be making the company 4-5x as much money as I am being paid. Already red flags, I know.  


Our clean drinking water has recently started smelling terrible, and the tap has started running at a snail's pace, clearly indicating that there is a health violation when it comes to the water, as it is still served to clients(unaware, mind you) and the boss drinks it still. It may not be contaminated with anything that poses severe health concerns, but it most certainly is contaminated, nonetheless. I presented this issue to my boss, and offered a solution to purchase bottled water again, as we had used to do that in the past. His only response is ""no need for bottled water, we'll just replace the filter underneath the sink."" This was weeks ago, and the issue is still not resolved. I have started purchasing my own water out of a concern for my own health.  


I have been given much larger workloads the past couple months, without any raise. I am assumed to be a project manager for an incredibly large job, without the title, nor pay raise, of such.  


I have expressed great interest in being lead 3D designer for our work when it comes to such, and have been with this company for 4 years. Consistently, my boss keeps hiring new recruits, and each time, are given the role/title of doing the 3D work, which is one of the main motivators for me staying here. It feels like blatant disrespect to hire a new person, with no experience, and give them the work that I've always wanted and enjoyed doing.  


I was not given my PROMISED christmas bonus, and am still waiting to receive such to this date, due to some terrible financial decisions on my boss's end(don't want to get into specifics, but essentially just now signed a contract for a large job that we already spent a year and a half of work on. The client could have easily left without paying a cent because there was no contract signed.) He has told me time and again that I will receive it once we get the deposit from them, so I am not upset at that so much, as I am assured it will come, eventually. However, I can't help but not feel assured with his words, as I feel like I'm gonna get boned outta that as well.  


The last guy that worked here(for 6 months, I was training him) was fired right before christmas, simply because my boss didn't like him. He is an incredibly impatient man, and when he doesn't get his way, he gets upset. I have been here for damn near 4 years now, and with each day it feels like the workplace just becomes much more hostile and toxic.  


I wear a necklace around my neck on the daily. A couple weeks into wearing it, my boss makes a comment about how he doesn't like it, and wants me to tuck it into my shirt at work, which is understandable, except for the fact that I am in my own office, with a door, alone, for 95% of the day. Again though, dresscode is w/e and I'll do that if it's needed, but I can't help but feel like it's out of contempt for me and my person. Along with this, one day he actually came up to me, grabbed my necklace, and shoved it inside of my shirt, completely disregarding personal space or anything.  


There's much more that has happened, but it's just so much to type out.  


I am just completely miserable where I work, and feel like there is no path to success here.  Along with that, I have absolutely zero freedom to express myself or my creative mind. We have a demand for 3D renderings, and I really want to work on them, and yet I am disrespected in that regard entirely, as my boss continues hiring people to fulfill that spot. I desperately want to quit due to the hostility of this workplace, along with being severely underpaid, and yet, I am in fear of not being able to afford bills if I were to, as I am uncertain of whether or not these things would make me eligible for unemployment, even for just a month, before I can find another place to work, one that is much healthier, with a boss that won't belittle you.  


I appreciate any and all constructive advice given.

795,"So let me just start this off with some context, my mom was in an abusive relationship with my real father, whom she left in 2015, I was about 12. Then we met her current boyfriend that year and have been together for basically 5 years, at the start he helped alot, then around 2 years ago he changed and started being a fucking cunt. He tried to act dominant and alpha male towards me, constantly making me feel less than and shit, he tried to act like a father without the father and son bond, just the part where he thinks he can tell me what to do, argue with me for no reason. And I don't take that kind of shit, I only have a mother and I do not want a father figure, and from two years ago to this day he still tries to treat me like shit knowing my boundaries of how far he can go with his ""dominance"". But the thing is my whole family hates him, and my mother is starting to at this point. Recently about 6 months ago I've been dealing with a lot outside of my family life, and have been very stressed, so I've been more irritated than before, which made me stand up for myself. I don't take his crap anymore, when he tells me what to do I would Ignore or tell him to fuck off, if he starts to argue with me I just say the worst things I can to him, because I mean it and I don't regret it. It feels good because it gives me relief to know my own strength and to fight off my anxiety when it comes to these things. He used to be nice to my mother's side of the family, and now he's just disgustingly rude to them, when he is around my family, if anyone disagrees with him he starts raising his voice and not letting the other speak, even if it's my grandparents which is disgusting, or at least considered that in my country. But guess what, the guy still thinks everyone should respect him, he even says that shit out loud after making a scene. I honestly feel like he's crazy, my mom's been complaining to him that he should fix the toilet because piss is leaking out of it but no. It's not leaking, it's just ""your son constantly pissing out of the toilet"". Yep, I'm the only one who had a penis in the house. Anyways, he's also pulled this type of shit where he starts arguing, packs up all his shit tells my mother he's going to leave the following day (I wish he did) then sleeps on the couch for a night and starts asking my mother if she wants him to go or not, I suspect that he does this so in case she tells him to leave he can tell everyone she kicked him out. Let's not mention the fact that he tried to ruin my mothers sisters relationship, he's just done so much shit that makes me wanna move out I just can't even fit it into this text box, he even claimed I wanted to beat up my mother during one of me and my mother's arguments, and he knows the past involving my father so that's something I would never forgive him for saying. Honestly im tired of my life, this is barely a fraction of his bullshit, and I'm just mentally unable to take it anymore, I'm going to be 17, and he makes me want to leave the house I grew up in, most of the time when I finish work early I spend 2 or 3 hours elsewhere so I don't have to come home. I really need some advice on what to do, I can't move out, I can't stay at my friend's places, but I can't stay here either, at this point it's either him leaving or I am once I save enough money until I'm 18. I'm really lost at this point of my life. I just need some way to cope, or something.",31Jan2020,1
796,"Backstory: When I was younger, I found a new phone in my dads car. He took it from my friends and told me that he found it on an airplane. Then, a couple weeks ago, as the person who set up and manages our internet, I found an android phone connected to our network. This was weird as nobody in our family uses and Android phone. So I blocked it. Then a few days later, he comes asking if it’s possible to block devices from the internet. So I show him what I did and how I blocked it. He then asks for me to unblock the device. I tell him I wont because the device is suspicious and it may not be someone in our family. He gives up. Eventually, I get a hold of the phone at night and noticed some Tinder notifications on it. Then I took the SD card out, and copied the files to my computer. On the SD card, I find some photos with a very sexual nature and him playing golf with another woman. I also found a Tinder folder on the phone. I saved the files on my computer and another place and put the card and phone back where I found it. 

The Problem: My dad is the money maker for my family and he still ares about us and I don’t want to tell my mom as she doesn’t really have anyone to talk about this to. I don’t know where to turn to and talk about this with. What should I do? Do I confront him and show him the evidence? Or do I tell my mom and show her the evidence?

798,"Okay so this happened last year but it’s still feels fresh to me and I still can’t cope and need to vent and some advice. 
I should start by saying that the most difficult thing about all this is that I had an amazing relationship with my dad. I would hang out with him all the time we  have a lot in common, so many hobbies and interests that we both enjoy. And now I lost him. I’ve been grieving for a year and I don’t know when it’s gonna stop.
Last year my dad dropped a bomb on me calling me while a was in class (college) to tell me that he told my mom it was over and she left the house and he’s scared for her wellbeing. I NEVER saw it coming. I mean I should’ve since my parents relationship was never “great”. But what I didn’t see coming is that not only he broke it off with my mom after 30 years and he never talked about how he was having problems with my mom, he buys a house (that’s 5 mins away from my moms house) with my cousin (my mom’s sister’s daughter so technically it’s not incest lol). I ignored my feelings basically so I could keep my relationship with my dad since he meant so much to me. My mom almost k***** herself and she went through hell. (Still going through it but she has a really good support system thanks to her friends, not her family since my cousin manipulated almost everyone into thinking my mom is the bad guy in this) . So I would still go visit him from time since I was missing him, and I asked him if they could not show affection towards each other while I was there since it made me so uncomfortable. They did it one time and then stopped caring I guess and showed affection anyways. It became too much and I stopped visiting as much. Then I moved to the other side of the country with my fiancé. And in august he FaceTimed me to tell me that they are getting married. That was too much. I stopped talking to him ever since. He texts me here and there letting me know that he still loves me and that he’s still there for me if I need him. 

I don’t know how to explain how I feel. I don’t even know if I love him anymore... he just broke me. I don’t miss him, I miss the relationship we had before all this,  I miss him from before all this.. I don’t know how to cope? I think about him every day he’s in my dreams almost every night and I hate it because I don’t want to think about him, but I’m grieving so I guess it’s normal but it’s destroying me. My moms brother, my uncle, was like a second dad to me he took care of me and I loved him so much and he hasn’t talked to me in almost a year? Why? Because of her. I saw her as my big sister and my mom took care of her like her own child. There is so much more about this situation that’s f**** up I just don’t know how to cope with everything and it’s been a year already.. If anyone has advice or just some kind words I would appreciate so much. If anyone has questions about it I will answer them .

802,"Trigger warning (suicide and drug abuse)

Hi, my bf and i are both 17 years old, he has mental illnesses like me although it doesn’t run in my family other then my dad. idk his exact diagnosis but i do know it runs in his family and so do suicides, he’s had multiple suicide attempts but it was before i even knew of him. I have expressed my dislike for taking pills recreationally multiple times probably too many to count, i was addicted to adderall at like 15 even though they were prescribed to me, it was sad and what’s even more scary is xans are known to be more addictive. So i felt pretty betrayed when he posted on his snapchat story about taking them at school with one of his “best friends.”  We had our first fight a week or two ago we have only been dating for 5 months and for 3 or 4 days we were good but then out of nowhere this happens as well as i text from that said “I’m warning you im barred out” or something along those lines. He was telling me how depressed he is, which I’m pretty sure he was still high at that point he wasn’t really making sense and contradicting himself and like just kinda ranting about how our fight really messed him up and i feel like he was kinda blaming me for the fact that he’s taking them. He said he had done it one time before and today he said “i only took half, would you rather me be doing crack?” And I was in shock, i completely lashed out at him quite honestly i was furious. I understand i can’t control what he puts in his body. He’s smokes weed everyday and has done acid which i would much rather him be doing it’s way safer then xans. I think the two thingsthat made me the most upset was 1)The fact that one of his “best friends” are selling them and gave them to him, most likely knowing he has been depressed recently. Like wth kinda friend does that??? And 2) The fact that he lied that he would never take them and the reason i found out was cause he posted on his snap story. I was crying cause how furious i was at him and he kept saying “you don’t know how i feel” and etc. and saying some extremely hurtful stuff. He also managed how he didn’t have money for his court fees which 200 ish dollars for a illegal uturn that caused a wreck which i was in with him luckily not matter got hurt. But he did have money for the multiple times he bought weed though so that was pretty hypocritical to me at least (I used to be a stoner for about a year but had to stop due to my panic disorder causing psychosis whenever i smoked i also didn’t know him at this time) . I have bipolar 2 and panic disorder so this makes me extremely distressed. I feel completely disrespected. My friend saw him in theater class one day and i was telling this story to a gc with multiple friends i trusted and one friend said “oh that’s why he was acting really weird the one day in class.” Just yesterday night i was talking to him and gave him kinda like a lecture where i told him to take care of himself more and then he goes around and does this. I feel as if he has broken my trust, and i told him that we need a break not like breaking up or like a actual break just where i don’t see him in person cause we are both extremely clingy and Ik that would be hard for me but i need him to realize what he did was wrong. I am super supportive when he gets upset and has fights with his parents but this really hurt me and it caused me to have a panic attack. I also have two relatives in the hospital right now and he knows this so that’s causing me alot of stress.

803,"My team is currently growing rapidly and we've been hiring a lot of staff. Some of them fit in well, however, some do not adapt properly. We've had issues where a senior manager would treat an associate poorly; like yell at them, overwork them, blame them for their own mistakes, etc. The joiner staff never complain to the management and usually complain to their direct seniors, where they would relay that to senior management. So our senior management want everyone to feel comfortable enough to talk about the issues they're facing and not feel afraid of seniors.

But now that I no longer smoke or drink I've been feeling trapped, I don't know what to do and my anxiety has been increasing. I used to go to the coffee to smoke with my friends and talk about stuff, and go out to the clubs and drink. 

I know what you're gonna say. I could still go to be with my friends. But can I? Last time I did I couldn't resist and I smoked and drank. And I don't wanna do that but it's very hard to be in a place where everyone is doing it. 

""Go somewhere else"". Well I literally only have one friend and she smokes and drinks (too much if you ask me) and we only hang out to do those things.

I don't know what I should do. Before I had her as a friend I used to go to the park by myself read books and listen to music but I guess I've just been too depressed to do that and it's winter.

812," Good afternoon, morning, evening, wherever you are in the world!

I have a problem with where I work at the moment. I consistently am disrespected and belittled, and I'm not sure if I have any solid cause for receiving unemployment if I were to just walk out today.

Here's a quick summary of where I am, and my reasoning for wanting to leave this toxic work environment.

I am underpaid, and my boss has even told me to my face that the work that I do should be making the company 4-5x as much money as I am being paid. Already red flags, I know.

Our clean drinking water has recently started smelling terrible, and the tap has started running at a snail's pace, clearly indicating that there is a health violation when it comes to the water, as it is still served to clients(unaware, mind you) and the boss drinks it still. It may not be contaminated with anything that poses severe health concerns, but it most certainly is contaminated, nonetheless. I presented this issue to my boss, and offered a solution to purchase bottled water again, as we had used to do that in the past. His only response is ""no need for bottled water, we'll just replace the filter underneath the sink."" This was weeks ago, and the issue is still not resolved. I have started purchasing my own water out of a concern for my own health.

I have been given much larger workloads the past couple months, without any raise. I am assumed to be a project manager for an incredibly large job, without the title, nor pay raise, of such.

I have expressed great interest in being lead 3D designer for our work when it comes to such, and have been with this company for 4 years. Consistently, my boss keeps hiring new recruits, and each time, are given the role/title of doing the 3D work, which is one of the main motivators for me staying here. It feels like blatant disrespect to hire a new person, with no experience, and give them the work that I've always wanted and enjoyed doing.

I was not given my PROMISED christmas bonus, and am still waiting to receive such to this date, due to some terrible financial decisions on my boss's end(don't want to get into specifics, but essentially just now signed a contract for a large job that we already spent a year and a half of work on. The client could have easily left without paying a cent because there was no contract signed.) He has told me time and again that I will receive it once we get the deposit from them, so I am not upset at that so much, as I am assured it will come, eventually. However, I can't help but not feel assured with his words, as I feel like I'm gonna get boned outta that as well.

The last guy that worked here(for 6 months, I was training him) was fired right before christmas, simply because my boss didn't like him. He is an incredibly impatient man, and when he doesn't get his way, he gets upset. I have been here for damn near 4 years now, and with each day it feels like the workplace just becomes much more hostile and toxic.

A couple weeks into wearing it, my boss makes a comment about how he doesn't like it, and wants me to tuck it into my shirt at work, which is understandable, except for the fact that I am in my own office, with a door, alone, for 95% of the day.

813,So a few hours ago I decided to log onto my account and look at the comments I have written.I don’t really write comments much so I wasn’t expecting much but as it turned out I had written quite a lot of them. Some of them I remembered right away but the rest shocked me completely. They were very rude and had some insults or other things in them. I have absolutely no memory of ever writing such awful comments so I was pretty confused. Could it be possible that someone has hacked my account? The thing is I barely even use that profile now at all and most of the comments were 1 year old. But of course I could have just forgot about them. Should I be concerned about this or am I just overreacting for no reason?,31Jan2020,1
814,"Alrighty so I'm in therapy for a LOT of reasons, and it's mostly been helping stabilize but also giving me hope- my therapist thinks while I definitely have ADD and issues, I might not have a pure chemical depression but just a shit load of trauma and shitty luck. Like I got hit by a truck and two months into therapy, on my way to the therapists I got hit again, and then my grandma dies. It's nice hearing that I'm not inherently worthless, but just have hard times. 

He recently told me to try keeping an eye out for classmates or people in public who are also sitting alone- I think, i don't have my notes with me. This was after I told him I feel everyone avoids me or just instinctively hates me, or senses my depression and avoids me, and maybe if I was a pretty girl, people would talk to me, but I have a hard time sorting out looks of disgust vs indifference vs my paranoia vs my facial blindness from cone dystrophy. 

Well, I hate to be the Beatles, but holy shit are there lonely people everywhere. And everyone complains about it during icebreakers (Today's the end of the first week of the semester) but no one makes a move. Five classmates have upright said ""I've been very lonely in college"" or similar and I've replied well, if you ever want to do anything, just reach out, and nope I'm still spending my weekend alone. Commuting doesn't help. 
 Today, I had to give an intro speech for a grade in public speaking, and everyone laughed and I got a good grade and told I was hilarious but when I mentioned ""oh, so I'm not just colorblind but photosensitive and facially blind from cone dystrophy,  if any of us do get friends with each other or anything, I can't recognize any of you"", one man goes ""oh I thought you were just a jackass and ignored me"" 

How the hell do I get pass this? How many times have I done this- is this why I feel everyone hates me? They just think I'm an ""edgy loner"" in shades when the light just burns my eyes and I don't know faces? Even my therapist says it's  unhealthy to have no social network or connections.

821,"I'm in loss with all my savings, in other country, I have 21 years, people step all over me, take over me, have no girlfriend (although I'm told I'm good looking, whatever that means), don't pursue my passion.

I have a shitty job where you today work but tommorrow you don't know if they need you, expensive rent, shitty social anxiety and a lot of insecurities that blocks me from forming any relationships. I stay in a shared house with peasents, have no intimacy.

I stay in dirt, literally. Have a small room, you can't get yourself together and I always procastinate to do stuff: sport, jogging, reading, whatever. I see others are no better than me. 

It frustrates me how ""inferior"" to me are. Yet I'm left last at anything. I'm always told how shy and scared I am. I'm not talkative. Hahahahahahaha.

My opinion doesn't matter. They look to put you down when you are alone. Most of them did not even go to school. Are all alchoolics and no teeths in their mouths. Gypsies.

I'm not retarded (like most of them really are, I mean, a lot of them suffer from some handicaps), I'm well articulated, I'm not even that ""shy"". People see this thing in me. That I see my bussiness. They don't like it. I'm left outside of anything. 

Every single human interaction for me it seems abusive however ""kind"" would anyone be. I had a crysys tonight (I hitted objects in house) and they seemed to get the idea. No longer shy hahahahah.

People don't insult you or badtalk you in an overtly way. It's always passive. It's not even about how you are (look, face, intelligence, money, etc.). It's about your ""personality"" (whatever this means aswell) always. Others around you may not even notice.

I see no purpose in life. It's hard to keep a job. Always social challenges or you'll get fired. You always have to do as told at job. Outside of it, you don't have to be too passive, or people step over you, but you can't get too ""aggressive"" aswell, they screw you. 

The equilibrum do not exist. Everywhere you go you risk being labeled as either passive (shy as they tell) or aggressive through stupid games. 

It's hard to get a girlfriend aswell. I see way worse looking dudes than me fucking girls. Hell, others are old. When I talk to them it's always, sort of, I don't know how to call it. I inspire them nothing. I talk to female/ girls (most of the times they start first the conversation), they give ""good signs"", but I either don't talk, or the conversation goes friendly (not too personal). They smile and talk, ask me personal questions (how old I am, where I live, my native country, share stories, etx.), but after this they turn cold. It's always like this. This is at work.

In my private life I don't talk to anybody. Not to mention I never go to pubs, talk to strangers, never start conversations with girls, or meet new people. I'm stucked in this phase where although the fear would not be that big, I simply don't do anything.

I'm in this point, I lose money trading now (over 550$), but if at least I would not have this social problems that affects me absolutely anywhere, even at a fucking job.... And trust me I'm not even that kind of guy that is.... don't know how to call it. ""Pussy"" dude I guess.

I also don't talk to my parents. I hate them. Although theoretically I'm the only one responsible for my life and BS, my parents played a role in this. Therefore, there is not even the question of forgiveness. We do not even talk about this. I simply cut the ties with my parents a long time ago. They are in my native country.

Tl;dr: to summarise, people always tend to take me for granted. I have this curse I swear. I'm always seen as childish, shy and naive. With girls stand no chance. 

They don't like ""shy"" guys (whatever this means aswell). I've been told by some of them they want ""personality"" (I mean for real, girls told be to talk more, but only if I'd be wired differently). I'm not even ""afraid"" to talk. I simply don't need too. 

Now, this is useless. I'm still depressed, alone, stand almost no chance to if not impossible to simply not delay anything, so I can start ""change"". Glad I went to prostitutes so I managed to fuck something lol. So they can talk to walls next time.",31Jan2020,1
822,"This situation is maybe a bit strange but I could really use an outside perspective and some advice from anyone that's gone through something similar. I'm going to keep it vague enough that anyone involved doesn't recognize the story entirely...


I'm living with a hoarder of sorts. I had a relative that was down on their luck and needed a place to stay. We have a spare room in the house we own and I am more than happy to have them stay here. 
They are funny as heck, keep shared spaces cleaned, help me with random errands and what not. They're great and I love them. 
So the problem is that I was trying to respect the fact that the spare room was 'their room' and not a place I could invite myself into. I really wanted them to feel like this was home. After a few weeks of them staying here there was a VERY POTENT smell coming from their room. I said I was collecting all the garbage and if it was ok if I went in their room and they said 'of course'. Once I entered the room.... my lord..... the garbage... I shit you not.. I used half a dozen BIG BLACK GARBAGE BAGS to haul all the trash out and only about one bag of it was actual trash. The rest was ROTTEN food. Now I'm not talking old stale chips bags, I'm talking some girl interrupted shit with rotting meat from half eaten rotisserie chickens carcasses, take out food containers half full with rotting food, drink cups completely full of mold. 4 of the garbage bags were strictly just rotting things that were hidden around the room (shoved under the bed, under piles of clothes, literally squirreled away and hidden) I basically pulled every single thing out of that room and cleaned in including having to wash the carpets, furniture and walls to get the smell out.


Mice and roaches are a real thing that I don't want in my house.. so as sensitively as I could I brought up what I found with them and we had a conversation about how things can't be left in that kind of condition and that they can have a space in the fridge or a cupboard in the kitchen, whatever they needed and it was a good conversation and in the grand scheme... they've gotten a bit better but... now I just straight up ask to clean the room once a month or just go into the room every time they're gone and pull rotten food out from under the bed. They've never questioned me doing this and I feel like I'm imposing on their personal space but at the same time... houses are expensive and I don't want this room to be trashed.


So they don't seem terribly concerned that I clean and I actually don't mind cleaning although I would prefer that they kept the space clean themselves. The real problem is this: obviously there's some kind of eating disorder going on here if they're hiding mass amounts of food (unhealthy foods). They eat super clean when they're around myself or other people but it's an outrageous amount of food that's being eaten and hidden in the room. They have eating disorders on their side of the family that's resulted in deaths and I just need to know this: what can I do to help them? how do I ask them if they need help? I already feel like maybe I'm stepping on toes with the cleaning although I'm assured I'm not (by them). This is one of my favorite people. They've dealt with a few traumas in their life and I think this might be some kind of coping mechanism. I just need to know how to go about offering help in the right way. They obviously probably need a professional to help them out but they can't afford this on their own and we can't afford to front that bill. I'm also not sure how to say ""you might need professional help"" without making someone feel offended, like they're broken or that something is terribly wrong with them. What are some things that might help them?",31Jan2020,1
825,"I (21F) am going to graduate in a few months with my bachelors degree before going onto to get a masters degree. I am thinking about skipping the ceremony though because of my parents.

My parents are divorced and cannot be in the same room together. They absolutely hate each other. It’s causing me a lot of stress to worry about them and having to keep them separate on that day. On holidays everyone is separated and it’s the same kind of frustration. I am probably going to tell them I am not going to walk because of some credit thing, when in reality I could walk in June. I am taking some summer classes to make up some lost transfer credits so they probably won’t think anything of it. 

It was not an amicable divorce. My mom essentially cheated on my dad while he was away for a few years and divorced him shortly after then remarried within a year. She remarried and took everything my dad worked for. I understand why in some ways my dad doesn’t want to be in the same room as her but it makes things difficult for my siblings and I. 

I want to walk and want to celebrate because I’m happy I worked this hard, but it is too stressful to deal with separate events for each parent. I just don’t  want to deal with it. They have been divorced since I was in the 8th grade and still can’t be in the same room together. At my high school graduation my brothers and dad left immediately after so they didn’t have to see my mom and they sat on the opposite sides of the gymnasium. My mom went with my friend’s mom so she wasn’t alone. 

It bums me out because my boyfriend (22M) is graduating at the same time as me from the same uni and his family is going to be there and make a big deal about it. His family is normal and his parents aren’t divorced. His grandparents and everyone is coming down to celebrate and watch him walk and km really happy for him. I’m just a little envious that his family is so close and are normal. Sometimes I feel like they are more a family to me than my own honestly. His parents include me in everything and we just took a family trip a few months ago. I would love to have my family be with me and watch me walk but they can’t be civil to one another. 

I’m the first of three kids (I’m the youngest) to graduate with a bachelors degree so my brothers don’t know how annoying this is. Even if I did walk and just didn’t invite them it would hurt their feelings even more. I can’t just invite one or the other either. That would make things worse probably. 

the ceremony is separated by each department so the graduation ceremony is smaller and I know they will see each other if they both came.. I don’t have any grandparents so it’s not a huge deal anyway since my family circle is so small.  

I’m not really sure what kind of advice I am looking for or if someone has had the same experience. 

Thank you for reading my rant. I know it is stupid to be kind of sad about this, but I’ve been dreaming of getting my college diploma since I was in the first grade. 

TL;DR 
Parents have been divorced for almost ten years and can’t be civil to one another, nor can they be in the same room together. Creating anxiety about my college graduation in June.",31Jan2020,1

827,"Here's some background, I've been brought up in a conservative surrounding. This means, not only is having a boyfriend or a girlfriend taboo, just being friends with the opposite gender is ""controversial"" and better if avoided.

Now for my current situation, I have a male friend whom I grew really close to in the summer of 2018, and we've only grown closer since. But because of my upbringing, I haven't really had any closeness with any other guys like that, nor have I ever dated anyone. And I've had feelings for this friend almost since we first became friends. And it's really getting to me now. I thought I overcame this ""crush"" last year, but after talking to him again after a while I guess all the feelings just came rushing back. 

I need advice on how I can go about getting over him while still being as close as I am with him as a friend. He means a lot to me as a friend and I really don't want to lose that, but I can seem to control my feelings either. Also, is the reason why I'm so into him, that he's the only guy I've ever gotten this close to? I mean I do have some other male friends, but I don't like them like this.

 I am not fully aware as to what they have access to but I've found some suspicious activity concerning my YouTube account (Videos on my history that I have obviously not watched...

This controversy included people harassing me IN PUBLIC, trying to shame me for the contents of my private information. They made up this story that I ""accidentally"" leaked my own information... I was not sure if that was the truth at the time but I am 100% POSITIVE now that I did not send my private information out to anybody, especially on purpose. How do I know? I got DDOSed last week... lol. :( These people have a motive to fuck with me as they themselves outed their own intentions by harassing me repeatedly and consistently in public for a whole YEAR.

829,"Okay so I joined a youth group around 3 weeks ago, in the hope to make friends. I made alot of new friends, which is good. 

At this group last week we were doing a quiz. I knew one of the boys who went there as I used to see him around school all the time (he left my school a few years back) even though we never really spoke, ill call him R. We all had to sit round a table to take the quiz and there were no seats left except from one next to me, and R came to sit down. All through the quiz we were making conversation and stuff, and we were just talking about the school I attend, also the one he left. I was only talking to him about this stuff to be friendly, as he seemed quite lonely.

Next time I went,  I was trying to talk to my other friends and he wouldn't stop following me round. He was in all my groups for activities and kept trying to but in all my conversations etc. And on the way home, I get picked up by my parents and walk with them as I live a little while away. R walked the same way as me, and constantly tried to talk to me when I was on the phone.

830,"Moved away from home. Parents visiting. Got a new bf. Got help behind my parents back for truma. How do I make them understand I'm a new person? 

Here is it cronolocially:
I have some issues from getting bullied. I'm stuck in my past, with nightmares, flashbacks, memory issues, always being on gaurd and repeated bad memories. 

I didn't tell my parents after I changed school that I got issues from the bullying. That's pretty normal. It just got worse and worse. After a year, I told my parents about it because I was leaning against suicide to make it stop. ""Don't make a fuss. The past is the past. Don't lie."" Okay. I didn't tell them ever again. 

In highschool I got myself a boyfriend. Nice. My parents liked him and my sister adored him. 

After highschool, (4 years after the bullying) I told my Grandma about my problems. I was at their place, got a flashback while cooking. My grandma noticed how I changed and my crying. Then I told her everything. It took her a few days to understand it, but now she noticed how much it affected me. This lead to she got some help for me. (Some healing-voodoo stuff) that worked and removed 80% of my problems.

Then I moved away from home. Broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years. He didn't like the new me. No hard feelings there. 

After I moved,I stated to learn how to live. How to have a life. I volunteer every week, is a good classmate in college, the teachers believe in me as a future leader (I'm taking a leadership-machine education. Known for being the tuffest you can find) 

I got myself a new boyfriend that more matched me. He is older than me and he helps me with the things I can't. (I never learned how to use a coupon in the super market as an example. Or how to get a refund) I am really independent now. 

The interests I have my parents don't know anything about includes, but isn't Limited to;
War history, forensic science, biology and death. My political views are off their chart too. 

When I'm visiting my parents, we sometimes argue over small stuff. ""It's not okay to have that opinion! We didn't learn you that!"" Welp. I sort my suitcase when visiting them with the heavy part in the button and the light ones at top. Apparently they don't like that. It should be sorted after category of items. Just small things like that. I sometimes try to have a discussion with them, like, fuel prices, transportation of supplies, nationally, politics, news, etc. I leaned from home, nothing is black and white. But apparently something is. You can't say any cons about dictatorship. (Not even it would take minutes to make a choice on a national plan or the political stability it will bring). 

I just want them to accept I got myself a new boyfriend who supports me more than they ever did, even when they don't like him. I want them to accept I have opinions of my own. I done my research. I have seen things happen.",31Jan2020,1
831,"Hey everyone, this may be like a rant or something, but I need help. I'm a 20 year old male and I have been going through crazy mindnumbing thoughts about masturbation for the past many months and I'm at the point where I've tried so much but don't know what to do. I worry about what I masturbate to and what arouses me so much. I feel as it's because I'm not 100% certain on what I'm into. The problem is, the stuff I think I'm kinda into, stuff like muscle growth and futa, is obscure. I worry that masturbating and getting aroused by that stuff will hurt me later on. I want to enjoy the vanilla stuff but whenever I try to masturbate to more normal and regular visuals, I get kinda bored. I want to learn how to enjoy the vanilla stuff again, and not rely on this obscure things.

The main issue with why I feel to ask for advice is that I can't stop thinking about this stuff. About what I'm doing now with masturbation and if it's hurting or helping me. Whenever I'm done masturbating I talk to myself about if what I masturbate to, usually something obscure, was hurtful or bad for me. I end up having to look for advice and it feels like a constant loop of anxiety, worry, masturbation, and back to anxiety.

I want to learn how to stop worrying about this. I don't wanna stop searching for what arouses me and how to healthily masturbate but it has been causes me an crazy amount of stress, so I want to learn how to stop and be able to live a healthier life and not a stressful existence.

During my relationship I’ve met up with an old friend (A) I’ve known for about 3-4 years. Last year around Feb-March til Dec2 I was in contact with “A” and Dec 3 was the day it was revealed. in my eyes I’ve never saw her as nothing more than a friend, but I’ve did things I wasn’t suppose to do while in a relationship. Remind you, I’ve never really met up with “A”, it’s been a distance thing. We’d send pictures, talk dirty to each other, and when “K” saw what I’ve done, she was broken, and I was guilty. I never had a reason for it but the “she was nothing but a friend” excuse and I never really felt like “A” was more than a friend and so did she. Within that time period I was confused in a way about what that meant. About what anything I’ve experienced meant. So now it’s been a month we’d been living together trying to work it out. I vowed I would never cheat again bc it is never worth it, but now I’m seen as a liar and manipulator so “K” would have trouble trusting me, get upset at me for little things like asking to repeat something if she says it too low or even me eating alittle too loud.

837,"A few key things: my boyfriend and I also share a 3 year son who is beautiful, funny and healthy. He is my biggest joy. 

My boyfriend has two other children from a previous relationship, 5 &amp; 7.

My boyfriend struggles heavily with bipolar depression. Almost committed suicide last year on February 3rd. 

He got a vasectomy in July 2019, and never went to his follow up appointment to confirm it was successful. We had unprotected sex since them with no signs of pregnancy.

Aside from breaking up and getting back together multiple times, we definitely are not the perfect couple. He’s verbally abusive and my relationship with friends and family, and MYSELF changes immensely when I’m with him. 


December 2019 I found out I was pregnant. I am now 11 weeks pregnant. The moment he found out he begged me to get an abortion and that this would ruin his life. He threatened wanting to kill himself if I didn’t get an abortion. He believes we can’t have another child financially and that I’m naive to the whole situation. (Regardless of my financials, I’m 100% competent of raising a child, and I’ll do it by myself if I have to) He says this is the reason he got the vasectomy in the first place. 

After weeks of him telling me “it’s just a pill” “what’s the big deal”, I scheduled an appointment with planned parenthood to talk about abortion options. Luckily, I was too far along for the pill and the only option was scheduling a surgical abortion. 

That abortion was scheduled for today at 10:10am and it’s now 12:45pm and I can say with a smile on my face, I did not go to that appointment. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself and there’s no way I could lay there and have them suck a baby out of me. 

Now, my boyfriend refuses to talk to me, and when he does it’s yelling and constantly belittling me. I am ready to walk out and spend the next 8 months doing this by myself. 

The reason I’m on here is, did I do the right thing? Part of me wishes I could go through with the abortion and just walk away from this man entirely. But I can’t. I’m going to have this baby and I’m at a loss of what I should do.

842,"Some backstory for you:
I (24f) was talking to this guy (25m) I really liked for a few weeks now. After a few weeks of hanging out, we were drunk and ended up hooking up. I thought we were really getting along great, but then all of a sudden he was being weird, and stopped replying to my messages. He ended up blocking me on Facebook. 

About a day and half later, he calls me in the middle of the night apologizing. Saying that he made a big mistake and that he was scared. Basically he made it out to be that he was scared to get hurt, because we had moved really fast and he didn’t know he could have those feelings for someone that fast. He asked for me to give him another chance and I am a generally forgiving person, so I agreed. 

The next week we were talking like normal and hanging out. Come the end of the week, he cancelled plans with me, and then asked me to come over late at night (a booty call, but we didn’t hook up) we just went to sleep. The next day, he was being extremely weird again. Taking forever to reply, using basic replies that didn’t include a lot of effort. 

When I realized he was being weird, I texted him to see if everything was okay. He replied stating that he was perfectly fine, that he had just been busy. We went on to have a conversation about how my last ex was very flakey and I didn’t want to miss any signs that he wasn’t interested. He assured me that he was fine and he said he would let me know if something was wrong. 

Well it turns out, something was wrong, like I thought. About and hour or so after our conversation about him being fine, he blocked me on Facebook again. I didn’t try to text him, I was so annoyed by this point. About a week went by, and I just got a text from this guy. He basically said something along the lines of work, school, his parents, and his ex were all causing some kind of problem with him, and he “shut down.” He said that he “owed” me an explanation. 

I just don’t know what to do in this situation. Over the last week I have thought about many possible conversations and how I would react and what I would say if I had a chance. Now that he’s actually texted me, I am clueless. I thought about a simple “fuck you,” I also thought about a long reply telling him how shitty of a person he had been and how I hadn’t deserved that. Nothing seems to be a good enough reason to reply to him. Will not replying send the message I want to send? If I message him, will I lose all of the power that I currently hold by being the one to not reply to him? It’s so frustrating because I gave this guy an opportunity to tell me something was wrong, and he flat out lie anyway. 

I need some advice. I’m not sure if I should even give him the time of day considering how he has treated me, or if I just tell him to fuck off and move on.

844,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and for the most part it's been a happy relationship. Within the past year or so though, things have taken a weird turn. It all started one day when he told me I should start wearing old watches, because he found it sexy. I didn't want to judge him because he went along with my food kink (celery up ass, etc), so I started wearing them occasionally. I would catch him looking at it during sex but I didn't mind. It then evolved to him saying before he climaxed, ""What time is it, what time is it?"" I would say ""cum time"" and then he would ejaculate over my wrist/watch. This continued for some time and at first I thought it was cute. But then it kept progressing.

Another time we were heading to my parent's house for Thanksgiving. I decided to wear a watch that day to look more formal. It's a pretty long drive to their house, so I figured my boyfriend would nap along the way. I didn't hear a peep from him in a while, so I looked over at the passenger seat, and he was jacking off under his blanket looking directly at my watch. I tried yelling his name, but he was almost in a trance. That was the last time I wore a watch in public. All day at my parent's house he was saying ""tick, tock"" in a seductive way. He later started doing that whenever he wanted sex.

On his birthday, per his request, I wore 4 watches up my arm during sex. He ejaculated in seconds.

Now I'm not a prude by any means, but this kink has taken over his life. I've tried sitting down to talk with him about it, but he always says ""I am who I am, I can't help it"". I told him recently it makes me a little uncomfortable, and he's said he'll try to wind it down.

Then there was yesterday. Again, I was over at my parent's house with him. He was sitting on the side couch while my mom and I were having a conversation. I looked over at him and he had a full hard-on, you couldn't miss it. I think my mom saw it too. I didn't know why he was so turned on, but I then I saw what he was looking at - the clock on the wall.

I really love this guy but I don't know if I can go along with this kink anymore. It might be time to end this relationship. Thoughts?

My father and I have never really been too close, but he was always okay until after the divorce. He tried to make it work with us, but gradually we stopped seeing him because he decided to get remarried. Sometimes months would go by where he never even talked to us. We didn’t even get an invitation to his wedding.

My mom is literally an angel sent from heaven compared to my father. She’s raised me and my brother practically by herself since my father always worked at night when they were together. I think it’s safe to say that my father downgraded on his new wife. I don’t think she has a nice job, their house is really dirty, she has 4 grown up kids who seem weird, and she’s a redneck..... From what I can tell by scrolling through my father’s Instagram, I don’t think he’s that happy with his life.

So here’s what made me ask for advice. Before yesterday, it had been over a year since he had contacted us last. With me graduating and getting my diploma in May, I decided I wanted to change my last name (my father’s) to my mom’s (her maiden name) since she raised me. He found out about this and messaged me on Instagram with this message.

“Since you are all apparently done with me please tell your mother to drop child support since you obviously don't need me for anything anymore. Then you can call yourself whatever you want.”

He sent the exact same things to my younger brother in middle school. I told him to never message us something like that ever again. We are shocked and disgusted by what he said, and that he sent it to us instead of our mom. How should I deal with his behavior?",31Jan2020,1
855,"So I’ll try to summarize for you all. 

When I was a senior in high school, I became friends with a girl, long story short she came to love me, however, I did not love her in that way and made it clear to her. We remained friends (which I’m sure was hard on her and I mentioned at times, if she’s sure) and she eventually introduced me to her friend from Out of state (she transferred schools) me and the girl from Out of state who we will call “Y” hit it off and talked a lot, she had a boyfriend at the time so we were just friends. Anyways, me and the first girl who we will call X, were still friends and she was obviously jealous of the situation, and made it clear. So me and girl Y came to the conclusion even though we enjoyed talking to each other, we put girl X first and stopped talking. Now throughout all of this, girl X would occasionally blow me (not proud of this as looking back I basically took advantage of her, even though I always felt shitty immediately afterwards as well) and I’d sometimes go a day or two without talking to girl X as I felt bad about this (trust me I know everywhere I screwed up here) Fast forward about a year or so, me and girl Y started talking again as she messaged me out of the blue since her and her boyfriend broke up (this was around when I started first semester in college).

We eventually talked more and started liking each other, I drove to meet her after a few months of this and we ended up starting to date in a long distance relationship. Girl X found out before I met her and was obviously upset about it but we wanted to be selfish this time. Long story short, we dated for about a year until I broke it off as it was getting fairly toxic from both sides. Me and girl X started talking again as we stopped for a bit since it was hard for her to be friends in that situation. We became friends again, and we hung out about a month or so after my relationship ended. She ended up blowing me (again still not proud of this, while I didn’t ask for it at all, I didn’t stop her from advancing, and thus am just as guilty) anyways she told girl Y and they both got pissed at me, for good reason, I was absolutely a shitty person. Which led to me and girl X not talking again. 

Now present time, about two years later, I’ve been thinking more and more about girl X, and how badly I screwed up. I want nothing more than to be able to talk to her again, as I genuinely have come to realize I liked her back then and the feelings are coming back. My question for you is this. I want to message her, even knowing how I have hurt her in the past, how she may not like to receive a message from me and how she may be doing a lot better off now. Should I do so? I’ve reflected a lot on these times and we had a lot of good times and she has pretty much been the only person in my life so far I’ve felt comfortable sharing personal deep issues with and who I knew I could go to about anything. I’ve also long since reflected on my own actions as well. I want to be friends with her again with the intention of dating her, but I’m not sure whether I 1. Deserve to after my actions, 2. She would welcome a message from me and 3. If me doing so would just bring her more pain, as that’s the last thing I want to do.

So that’s it, thank you so much for reading the whole thing and I appreciate any advice I can get for my book long post haha!",31Jan2020,1

866,"(throwaway account) I hope this is the right sub for this .

I recently did a photoshoot with a photographer. in the beginning we established that the reason for the photo shoot was for me to put together a model portfolio. He’s a pretty good and known photographer and he’s also a model counselor so he assured me that he could help me out. 

He told me the stuff to bring to the photoshoot. (basic model clothes a white cami, jeans, heels, a bathing suit, lingerie and anything else i wanted pictures in)  I only hired him for 3 hours but we ended up shooting for 6+ hours with multiple outfits. He was amazing and super professional and I felt more confident as a model leaving his studio. 

He asked me if I wanted to pic the pictures I got (we agreed to a certain amount according to what I paid)  of it i wanted him to. I told him to do it because i felt like he would pick the best ones for my portfolio. 

Fast forward to now I got my pictures back. I got one headshot, one in a beautiful dress we had shot in and the rest were the pictures i took in lingerie.  All of the pictures look GREAT but i don’t want my portfolio full of lingerie pictures. I don’t get any of the pictures of me in just the pain cami and jeans  or basic mode headshots. 

He has been sending me the pictures spaced out because he’s getting them back from an editor and editing them himself. he also said he’s giving me extra pictures free just because he’s nice and want me to succeed (it’s not about the money for him). At this point he’s sent me the number of pictures we agreed on and a few extras.

People I know look up to me and compliment me a lot on my attitude, my accomplishments, etc. but I really just don't love myself. I feel like a loser, a failure, a fraud. I think this all stems from the fact that every relationship with women I've had has been negative (and ending with them leaving me), and the one relationship I had where I felt truly loved ended when she one day told me she was moving across the world, so I felt abandoned and pathetic. This has left me feeling like I don't deserve love, I will never be good enough, and no one will ever love me. If I look at all of it objectively it seems ridiculous, but... It's how I feel, and how I think. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be the person who everyone thinks had everything going for him but ends it all because he couldn't love himself.

874,"(TLDR at the bottom.)

I have an extremely annoying roommate. Generic, I know. I've been living with this person for about half a year now, and all this time I've tolerated them. But now, I'm beginning to lose it. Not only are they constantly being obnoxious, rude and a dick in general, they refuse to acknowledge it. Every attempt at communication (whether it be in the form of roommate meeting or passive-aggressive notes) have ended in them throwing a tantrum. I have other roommates who also share the same opinion as me. I have thought about calling the landlord, but I highly doubt they'll do anything about it. I would've snapped a long time ago but the only reason I haven't is because I'm best friends with this person's sister and am on great terms with the rest of their family and would prefer it if things remained that way. 

Here is just a small amount of examples of things they've done. Keep in mind, this person is paying reduced rent in exchange for doing some basic yard work (ex. mowing lawn, shoveling snow, etc.), which of course, they neglect.

\- Failed to shovel over six inches of snow. When confronted, threw a tantrum and literally broke the shovel in half.

\- Refuses to clean the area around their room whilst continuously expanding their stuff out of their room.

\- Takes others' food from the fridge without asking.

\- Bitches about **literally everything.** And I do mean, everything.

\- Has incredibly loud parties and friends over at stupid hours.

\- Unrelated to the house, but cheats on their SO and brags about it.

\- Takes others' established parking spots.

\- Too many others to list.

What I'm asking for is a way to get this person to move out. Preferably anonymously and stealthily since I would like to maintain my good relations with their family. At this point, I don't really care how ""unethical"" the method is, so pretty much anything short of murder is on the table.

Thanks in advance.

PS: To the aforementioned roommate. If you're reading this, you probably have a good idea of who you are. You also most likely have a good idea of who wrote this. Of course, I'm using a throwaway account so don't bother confronting me. I will deny everything and you have no proof. Instead, maybe try and act like an adult so the rest of the house doesn't despise you. Just some food for thought.

I remember drinking about 2-3 beers and then my memory just completely blanks until the middle of the night were I find myself having intercourse with one of the boys. At this point I start crying because I’m confused as to what happened and he is very sweet to me, tells me I was drinking and went up the very very steep stairs myself (even though they told me that earlier that night I had fallen down other stairs due to lack of balance) and basically invited him to sleep with me. I believe him at this point and do not try to stop him as I was actually attracted to him although I was very uncomfortable with the situation.
The next day (apart from extreme soreness and some mysterious bruises allegedly caused by me falling down the stairs) I don’t feel hungover at all and actually go to work as usual.
Over the course of the next weeks I get a weird feeling about the whole thing as I never blackout from such a small amount of drinks and if I do blackout I usually remember a lot more and I am always hungover badly.

We recently got a new manager and turnover of employees, and the cattiness, gossip, having to go behind people and do their work, waking up at 5:30am and sitting in traffic, and underpaid labor has been weighing on my mental health and morale. I won't go into details but I attempted suicide last summer (things are much much better now) because of my mental health, and this job was a huge factor. I take home 500-850 every 2 weeks, depending on my hours. I'm renting a car with lyft in exchange for being a driver. The rental fee is 191/week (so you drive and after you make this amount, whatever you make after goes directly to you and you can cash out instantly). Also I would rather rent than have my own car since I am planning to save up and move out of my country to somewhere with better public transport, that way when I'm done driving lyft I can just return the rental car-no commitment to a car, no car note, dealing with passing emissions test, etc. 

My city is a pretty decent busy market and I'm pretty sure I can make 100+/day driving full time, and way more fridays and saturdays. I work 12 hr shifts, so I'm sure driving in a car for 12 hours or less won't be much different or maybe even less stressful. Yesterday I drove from 9:30am to like 8pm and it wasn't that bad. I would be making my own hours. Also I will be quitting with 3,000 in savings. My rent is 500/month. Cellphone, gym, and spotify 100/month. Student loans 35/month. 

I don't have another job lined up but I've been applying. Also I won't have health insurance anymore and have to pay out of pocket for my medication and therapy. And if I get into a car accident, even if it's not my fault, I have to pay lyft a $1000 deductable, and people in my city can NOT drive.

So I (19f) and my boyfriend (18m) both have depression. We both take medication and overall it’s helping us to be happier, however when it comes to sex, none of us are able to finish. It hasn’t been a problem for him until he started the medicine back around September or October. For me, I’m on birth control, 2 antidepressants and have a history of sexual trauma. I don’t mind not finishing but I know it bothers him and it bothers me that he is unable to finish. Before we both started antidepressants we were able to have sex 3 or 4 times a day and he would finish every time, however I couldn’t due to birth control and my above traumas. Is there any advice on how to increase our chances of finishing? It’s becoming increasingly frustrating to him that he isn’t able to finish and it makes me feel like I’m not doing enough, even though sometimes he does finish with me, it’s just more than not he isn’t finishing. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!",31Jan2020,1
900,"I have a roommate who has lived with me and my dad for 6 years and she is an alcoholic, she went to rehab for it and relapsed then when back again 2 to 3 years later aka a few months ago, she just got out and is now back with us.

She had taken my dads kindness for granted time upon time upon time again treating him like shit, yelling at him, insulting him, accusing me and my dad (me mostly) of stealing her stuff, not helping pay rent and not getting a job, she had one for one month and quit because she did not want to get up in the morning to take the bus to work.

My dad cares for her when she leaves out of the blue and not say anything. Recently she went to go have sugery and said nothing to my dad or me and was gone for almost a week. She sits in her room all day on her computer and does nothing.

She doesn't clean her dishes and she used to drink vodka behind my dads back when he has told her and chewed her out about it over 50 times quite literally over 50.

She plays the pity party game everytime my dad chews her out, starts crying and yelling and saying no-one cares for her and that she should just go. And of course my dad comforts her after chewing her out and she gets to stay.

My dad refuses to kick her out because he hates the fact that she would be living on the streets because her two daughters refuse to take her in and deal with her and get her better and they have called the cops 3 times 2 times claiming my dad threaten her and abused her.

I can't stand her or her daughters anymore I just want them out of my life and gone. I can't convince my dad to kick her out. He always says ""she has to figure out a place to stay first"" she doesn't, I don't care just pack her stuff and tell her to get.

She insults me and makes snide remarks to me when she passes by my room and threatened to call the cops and my ex's mom because she wasn't allowed to be over even though I asked my dad and he said it was fine.

905,"After getting attacked and threatened by someone else I trusted over my political choices, I recently went into a very destructive and overly-reactive state of either depression or anxiety. I have a friend who has been nothing but a good help and influence to me, and while she disagreed with my choice as well, it was not to the extent that my other former friend took it; I have my beliefs, she has hers, that shouldn't be reason enough to end a friendship, because differences be damned, our mutual appreciations and similarities are just worth more to me.

She also has a boyfriend, but is have to be clear, I don't think of her in that dimension. If anything, that makes me uncomfortable with engaging with others if they are to bring it up. Because even if she is attractive, I personally find the idea of lack of consideration to them, and a lack of honour in myself to be utterly disgusting. Not only is no individual seen in that context, but the credit of being secure in themselves isn't even given to them. This isn't a case of blindly worshipping someone or merely seeking their validation: I have goodness to return to someone, so that I can show their faith in me wasn't wasted. 

Regardless, I was kind of lost in my own fears and pain at that point when my other friend turned on me, and I.. Lost any sense of composure, I emotionally broke down, and overloaded her. I overstepped a boundary. And I have no intention of being so lost in the situation of anxiety or the external factor of political differences, being so entangled in that that I lose someone else in my life so terribly again.

I'm getting help now, and I have some bookings for the right kind of help on the way. It's just that, when I'm better, I'm wondering how I can make it up to her, and of course her boyfriend who has also been friendly with me. They want for nothing, they're both quite creative, and have a sharp taste in cuisine, so I'm not sure that regular gifts would cut it.. But she said to me one time, that sentimentality is not something that you hold in your hands. So what kind of action could undo this heavy strain, and bring genuine smiles to their faces?",31Jan2020,1

We had sex 7 days ago and I didn't last a lot, my banana wasn't strong as always.  
I thought about it the next day and found out that for 4 days before I didn't watched p\*\*n or mas\*\*\*\*ate, and I also didn't feel the need.

Actually I still don't feel the need of sex, fap or watching p\*\*n, usually I watch them once per day or every two days.

It has nothing to do with my gf, I still love and find  her sexy.

909,"Hey so I used to strip on omegle. I stopped doing it about three years ago. But about one year ago I was on omegle just for talking and a guy I connected with on there said he recognizes me from before (I know he was not lying), and if I didn't show him more he would upload the footage from when I stripped. I guess I showed my face by accident.  I refused to show more because I'm done with all of that. Nothing has come of that threat since. Not that I know of at least. It could be floating around online somewhere and I'm unaware of it.

I know I'm probably overreacting but I still get anxiety over it.

So someone at my company quit. They have worked with the company for 10 years and they trained me to do their job in 2 days before disappearing. I have been with the company for 11 months fresh out of college. I am currently working the position I was hired to do, which is an entry-level position and the other, which is a huge step up from what I have been doing (definitely senior level).  Two months ago, during my performance review, my manger expressed how impressed they were with my work and that they are so amazed with how well I have worked. My manager explained that the two people they hired before me had so much work experience and that they just bombed in the entry-level position that I have been working for months and that she was so impressed with how I have worked with no experience &amp; fresh out of college. 

After my review, I received a $0.62 raise for merit for having a great review. 

When the person who has worked with the company for 10 years quit, I took on their duties and I have been doing my work and their work for the past two months. My manager let me know that if I was overwhelmed with anything, just let them know, so they can allocate my old duties to someone else. I was honest with them and told them that I really did not have much to do before and that I am perfectly fine doing both positions. They were shocked and was impressed with my answer &amp; told me that they have submitted the paper work to HR for my promotion and title change to the higher level position. The HR department at my company decides salary. Is it possible to get a $20,000 raise?

912,"To simplify this, I want to stop being friends with someone I've know for several years. 

Even when I'm feeling extremely bored, I dread it when my ""best friend"" asks to hang out.  

I've known her since high school and now we go to the same college.  However I don't enjoy her company as much as I used to probably because we don't share much in common (we never have).  

She has said certain things that I disagree with.  She is very political and anyone that doesn't share her same mindset are automatically not worthy enough for her to speak to.  There was one time that she started arguing with a random old lady to prove her point and I was just there in the background wishing I was home.  

She is constantly trying to have things her way. For example, despite telling her I am not allowed to sleepover she insists on contacting my dad at her own will to try and convince him.  (I hate sleepovers and don't know how to tell her that either). 

Most of our conversations are her ranting about someone or something.  I find myself regretting being her friend.  The worst this is that we've gotten close enough that my parents consider her their second daughter.  In all honesty, I'm horrified by this because it makes me realize I can never get rid of her.  I dont know how to stop being her friend.  

I probably sound mean but I'm just tired of feeling uncomfortable around her.  Nothing she says is of value to me. It's mostly shit talking.  Shes extremely negative and I'm tired of it.

914,"I don’t want to get into the details, but my coworker has been acting standoffish for a few months. The past week she’s been hardcore ignoring me at times, which is awkward, since we share a workspace. 

Yesterday, I asked if something was wrong and she blew up at me about how I’m always out of the office (to literally go to meetings that my boss asks me to go to) and how I didn’t work on a project that was due (I thought someone else was working on it due to a miscommunication, and it ended up being finished just fine). She has been really irritated with me for a while because people typically go to me for help or for tasks to be done— she’s made digs at me before about it.


I’m thinking I should go to my boss so he can decide what to do, because I am NOT going to continue work with someone who accuses me of slacking off just because I get my work done WAY faster than she does, so sometimes it looks like I’m not doing anything. Also, I don’t trust her, and I want someone else to be involved. There were red flags before this and it seems like she will never get over this dislike of me, even though I try to help her as much as I can (when people come to me, I often redirect them to her, I always include her own my original projects, and I’m never rude or anything).

I’m thinking I should go to my boss because she clearly chose to vent her misdirected anger at me knowing that it would end our friendship. I’m kind of a pushover, because my first inclination is to apologize and be timid and subvert myself. But I know I didn’t do anything wrong.

Should I go to my boss? What do I tell him? How do I tell him without it seeming like this is purely a personal issue? (by the way, he is somewhat aware of this; he once remarked that I shouldn’t let it upset me that I get more projects than she does, because he knows it does make me worry).

I’ve always had shitty mental health dealing with anxiety and depression when I was really young. 2019 sucked hardcore (like it did for most people) and my mental health really took a hit and everything was really shitty. In this time I’ve been dating someone who I can confidently say is the love of my life. After my mental health deteriorated and I got difficult my parents wanted to end the relationship right before New Years. Of course I understood but I wanted to find a way to work through it for the both of us- we are engaged. Well the entire conversation we had honestly traumatized me. Hearing him say all of those things, I can’t get them out of my head. If I’m not fully distracted I spiral directly into a panic attack about it. It’s to the point where we’re having issues (My panic and depression is back) but I don’t feel like I can talk to him because he might go. I started self harming again and honestly it’s just really bad. I’m in therapy and we’re working on it but I don’t know what to do. I sit and cry most of the day because I just feel so helpless. When something goes wrong everyone says “I don’t understand” or “I didn’t do this” and I get it but like it’s so minimizing.

919,"I’ve(20/F) never been able to get friends. All my classmates considered me as a fat weirdo and I was bullied because of it. After I lost weight in high school I became an anorexic weirdo(was 130 at 5’7. Very healthy weight...much healthier than 200). 

I ended up gaining my first friends ever in my junior year of high school. I was so excited to have people to rely on. But I soon realized I felt like I was an outsider. They all had conversations without me and sometimes hung out without me. I didn’t think much of this at first because I knew people could hang out with each other and not include everybody. 

But then I got sick on prom and couldn’t go to the movie night they planned. I was guilted and shamed for not going even though I had the flu. 

I shrugged it off. Didn’t think much of it. I also never had friends before so I thought this was normal. 

When me and my friends started college we were so excited to go to the same school. But that’s when things kinda started to fall apart imo. One of my friends started being incredibly cruel to the rest of us and even resorted to calling me anorexic and harassing another of my friends. We eventually had to cut ties because he was simply terrible to us. 

Then my period started to attack me. My flow was so heavy and my cramps were so bad that I couldn’t move for nearly a week. I had to change my pad and tampon every hour or else I’d get blood everywhere. It was not a good situation. I asked my friends to please bring me supplies because I was running out of food and pads and couldn’t go to the store because I could barely make it to the bathroom. All they told me was that “I have class I can’t. Sorry” “I’m too busy sorry”

I even asked if they could just run and get some pads and tampons for me after class and they said they were too busy too. I emphasized that I couldn’t move and was running out of supplies and that I would 100% pay them back. Still they said they couldn’t do it

I didn’t have a roommate at the time and ended up having to order tampons and pads off of amazon and hoping that they’d get here in time. I even held off on changing my pads and tampons just in case(which was a huge mistake and ended up getting blood on so many pants). And I forced myself to go and get the package from downstairs in my dorm, all the whole fighting passing out because I was bleeding incredibly heavy and so tired and in pain(turns out I had fibroids and since Im young and don’t have any kids I can’t do anything about it yet. Birth control is my only way to kinda manage it. So dumb.)

Then i see another one of my friends ask for soup in the group chat a week later and everyone ran to get her some. I felt betrayed and me asking for help and not getting it seems to be a common theme in our friend group...and then another person gets help when they ask...

I also end up getting told things much later than anybody else. One friend got into a relationship and I was last to know. 2 months later. I regularly ask how everyone is doing and whats up with their lives to make sure they’re doing ok and they usually ignore me when I ask. So I was definitely hurt. 

Most recently, I asked our group chat if anybody had used the counselors at our school and if they were any good because I might need them. Nobody responded and about an hour later they started talking about Trumps impeachment...so that hurt a bit. I’ve told them my grandpas anniversary of his death is coming up and I’m having a difficult time with it so I might act weird the next few weeks and that was also ignored. 

Luckily, my boyfriend is very supportive of me. So he’s really the only one I can rely on. After I started dating him and saw how his friends treated him i started to question if I was even friends with my friends. His friends are so nice and supportive and are there for him and mine just constantly abandon me...

If I need to be picked up, either him or his friends are in the case. His friends have become my friends. I need pads or to go the ER? My boyfriend and his friends are there for me. 

But the weird part is that if I don’t respond or make my presence known in our group chat they get worried and wonder if they should check up on me. Lately I’ve been distancing myself from them because they hurt my feelings constantly. I went a week without talking to them and they considered checking up on me but in the end didn’t. I learned of this after I sent a picture of a cute cat I saw on a walk. 

Is this how friends are supposed to act? It just seems so wrong compared to how my boyfriends friends act. I just feel so ignored and abandoned by my friends.",31Jan2020,1

She has a thing for always telling me how much she wants to hurt me or see me get hurt, I always took it as a joke and she seemed jokingly with it too.

I thought that was odd so watched her walk away and she looked at her phone and i could see a picture of me. So about a minute later she walked back over to me and i asked her why she took a picture of me and she denied it. I just shrugged it off, about 30 mins later she gave me her phone and said take a picture of me and my friends which i did, they didn't like it so told me to retake it but me being funny I took a selfie of me and my friend and she shouted ""dont look at my photos"" and came over and took the phone off me. Which made me think she probably did take that picture of me/saved it.

She also text me one time to tell me to get off my phone and socialize, took me a minute to realize she was watching me on works cameras before i started my shift. She laughed and told me she stopped because it was weird after a couple minutes.

926,"So ill try to make this as short as possible and not ramble too much. (this eventually leads to a solo travel question by the way haha)

Im 20 years old, male, currently working in an office space with only about 8 people in the building, Ive been working here for about 8 months and its been pretty good besides the almost bi-weekly/monthly blow up one of my bosses has on me, today it happened again on something that had almost nothing to do with me but he still angrily told someone to come get me and when I walked in his office he was really mad at a part of the problem that happened which I took resposibility for but it also wouldnt have happened if he didnt also mess up along with about 3 other people, but he took no blame or said anything about the other people that caused this (they are all in there 50s and I am 20, this could be the reason? not sure)

anyways long story short he starts ranting off in front of one of our transporter drivers who starts to leave the office and gives me an (ouch, goodluck man) look as he is a regular here and has seen his blow ups on me and pretty much everyone else that works here besides the people above him, little bit of backstory on this guy, he has extremely bad anger issues and blows up atleast 3 times a week and you always hear him cussing people out on the phone or over email when you are CC'd in the conversation, everyone here knows about this and tries to stay out of his way as much as possible but he always seems to find something to blow up about, anyways in summary he has an extremely bad personality and very bad anger problems but he isnt going anywhere because he was at this company at the beginning and has been here almost 20 years and is extremely good at his job.

So here is my dilemna, i actually like this job, he is probably the only negative but it is an extremely bad negative almost unbearable, hes been almost fired multiple times ive heard from stories people told me but he always hangs on, Ive mainly been here for so long because I live with my parents currently which is only like 8 minutes away and Im able to get college work done after hours here.

Anyways, today was a near breaking point, I dont think I can take this much longer but I have no idea what to do, I was already planning to take 2 weeks off at the end of March to travel to Italy but now I dont know if I even want to be here anymore, but im not sure I have much of a choice.

I adore traveling, I want to travel for a longer term few weeks-months but dont have that option here and im not exactly sitting on money I can burn without working.

I have 8k in my bank account, 3k 401k and another couple thousand in bitcoin which I should probably move, I pay $300 a month on a car payment (my parents pay my insurance aslong as I dont get a ticket) no other payments besides gas and phone bill.

What do I do here? am i just being a stupid kid and this happens at every business? Should I just keep pushing through this or should I quit and travel for some time and find a job when I come back (Id like to make some money while traveling to reduce the cash leaving my account)

I can almost never get a hold of her or spend time with her because she's always with him, and the few times I do get to spend time with her, somehow he always ""shows up"" despite the fact that I usually don't invite him to hang out with us. She seems to do everything he says, promoting his club's events, making dinner for his friends, taking part in hobbies she didn't have before because he likes them. He seems very possessive of her in public, having her wear his clothes, talking very bluntly and in public about ""special things"" they plan to do (innuendo fully intended), and leaving love bites all over her. She dismisses his behaviors that she otherwise would not hesitate to call out (ie him saying the n-word while we're all white people, something she doesn't like but didn't seem to care about when he did it). I mean, the age difference also skeeves me out just a bit because she's fresh out of high school and he's about to graduate college, but at least they're both adults. She very rarely spends time with me, or really any of our other friends anymore, and when she does make plans with us she either breaks them or he comes along.

Part of me wants so desperately to believe that this is just some weird honeymoon phase and that I'm just so fucked in the head that I cannot comprehend normal human relationships, but something about this seems genuinely wrong and I can feel it in my gut. Other mutual friends of mine and Em's have shared the same sentiment that something is very off-putting about their situation, and I'm just scared for her that once this ""honeymoon"" wears off, she may be in some trouble. I want to talk to her about it, but I don't know how. I also know exactly what it looks like, too. I mean, think about it: ""a single woman trying to coax her attached friend out of a relationship"" practically screams jealousy, and I'm afraid J might try to spin it that way and convince Em that I'm trying to ""steal"" her from him so that I won't feel so bad about myself because I'm evil, and bitter, and blah, blah, blah.

938,"So, I'm a data scientist in advertising. I've always felt like a super social and communicative guy. 

Recently, I got a new job, the payment is exactly what I wanted, and I'm being really recognized by my work. People like me, my insights and work are being referred as ""super smart and useful"".

Now, I'm a super social guy. At my previous company, I was the happy hour guy, everyone knew who I am. 

But I feel like, even though my current company is great, everyone is part of some clique. Its common practice for managers to bring people they've worked before into the team. My manager, which has a different specialisation than I have (I'm a data scientist, she's a media manager) has two other media supervisors. They are basically my team. But, they go to each others house to drink, do happy hours, gave inside jokes... I'm hardly a part of it. They treat me fine, but nobody ever asks me nothing about anything. I'm pretty sure nobody knows I'm engaged. They know nothing about my weekends.

I know it's kind of silly, but I'm a social person. I've been feeling lonely. I'm happy professionally, but since I'm the only data scientist in the team, I don't feel like a part of the team. I don't know how to proceed.

941,"Heya! 
I (F18) have started college last september and moved out. I live in a dorm now, have made some good study friends, about 5, and have a lot of fun when we have the time to spend with each other.
It’s in the evenings or nights that I really feel lonely, and miss talking to people. 
Making more friends is not a good option, since they won’t be around every evening, and trying out hobbies that I can do either outside or at home wouldn’t help me either. I have some mental health compilations and need my “unwind” time, so physical contact or meetups can quickly become too much for me. Hobbies that you can do yourself such as art or reading usually get repetitive, or lonely as well. 
What I am looking for is places to be online where I can regularly meet up with friends, that share my interests or are always up for a friendly chat, but I’m not sure where to look. Some communities can be a little harsh or wild, but I’m more of a “wholesome”, friendly type of person. 
Anyone have some advice?
Thank you so much in advance!",31Jan2020,1

Disclaimer: Post is longer than I expected. You don't have to read it.

Today I went to work to bring a part of a prototype we are building to a coworker as a good favor. I had the part at home, to work on it a couple of hours and I wanted to study for my exam in 10 days. When I went to work and got off the train I had that feeling of dizziness and loss of control - as I would faint at any moment. I went outside the train station quickly and didn't know what to do. I smoked a cigarette quickly and calmed down a little. Then I took the next train to work, got off after one station and walked the remaining way to work, which took about 5 minutes. I brought the part to the coworker and chatted 10 minutes with him, while my heart was still racing. I drank a glass of water to help my completely dry mouth and then headed back home. I felt a little bit better on the way back and even chatted with an old lady on the train for some minutes because something funny happened. I was telling myself all the time ""only 3 stations left, you can do it"", ""only 2 left "", ... .

Right before I neede to get off the train - before home - I felt that dizziness again. I walked to my bicycle feeling more and more weird, everything was spinning and I felt light-headed. I felt like I would fall to the ground at any moment, but I told myself anything would be fine and I can do it.

I unlocked my bike and rode home as fast as I could. I could barely breathe and I felt like I need to puke at any moment because my mouth was so dry. After 5 minutes in this state, I got home, rushed inside and sat down, wondering what happened. I thought maybe I haven't eaten enough and this was the reason for my dizziness. I ate some fruit and some sugar and drank water, sat down and I started to feel better a little bit.

I have had many - I would say - mild panic attacks, but not like this. The feeling of anxiety is something I have all the time. The weird thing is that it is sometimes gone. E.g. when I was afraid to go to a party that was far away, where I couldn't leave the situation quickly, or where it would be unpolite or weird to leave the situation and I went despite my anxiety and had a great night. The way back from these events, where I had the most anxiety going and had overcome it, was a great feeling.

I would have gone to a birthday party today, where all my friends are today, but I just canceled it. Normally, I would go despite this anxiety. I read online that this would help, to force yourself into these situations you are afraid of and not let the anxiety restrict your behavior, but I still felt weird - nauseous and with a racing heart. That's the reason I feel bad to cancel my plans today. I canceled it because the incident today was too much for me. I hope that doesn't make anything worse.

What if I cancel any plans now? What if that's the incident that makes my life that's slightly controlled by anxiety and panic completely ruined?

I have too many things that bother me going on in my life right now.

My mother had cancer and survived it, but needed to see the doctor lately, because something is wrong with her liver - nothing live threatening and objectively nothing to worry about, but hearing about that reminded me of her cancer illness and it threw me back into this feeling of nearly losing your mother.

Additionally, my father was a monster. Hit her, my brother and me. The police came often, but they did not do very much, only fixing the door that he kicked and broke. They didn't do anything, because it was his property.

He had an affair with an employee of my mother when she was in the hospital for cancer. That was 10 years ago and since then, my father sues her and me for anything he could find.

I work, but I don't make money off of it, because there are legal cases going on - long story. The main case going on is that my father needs to pay child support, because I am still in university and under 25, which is the law here. Besides that, he bombards me with letters from his lawyer. E.g. I have like $200 in my bank account and got a letter a month ago from the lawyer of my father demanding $13k to pay. I couldn't understand the 10 pages long letter. Since then there are legal cases going on, which worked out in my favor. I don't need to pay anything. The lawyer and cost of the case (cost of the court) need to be paid by him and not me, the judge ruled.

Last week my lawyer called me that I might need to go to court and sit in front of the judge and my father, I said I can't do that. I would rather loose the case. He said that this would be very unlikely and he would handle it for me and would do anything to not put me in this situation - he's a very nice guy.

Besides that, there are many more things going on. Brother had a heart attack 3 months ago, I needed to change my subject in university, because I failed too much, my twin brother got diagnosed with autism and my stepfather is very harsh to me and my mother, which reminds me of my father.

I didn't want to make this so long, but it felt good to write that down. I haven't told anyone that much -ever. Even if one person reads this, I would feel better.

Objectively my life is pretty good.

I am only 21 and work with people that have a Ph.D. or master in computer science. They always say I know more than them and I can stay in the company forever even if don't get better.My boss even told me some weeks ago that he sees a lot of potential in me and wants to help me get better leading people and sees me as the boss of one of his 4 companies in the next 5 years. Since I was 12, at least 50 % of my day was learning new things regarding computer science. Like coding and developing stuff, but I feel like that hasn't paid off and learning all of that was a mistake.

University is pretty good too. I feel like I understand everything well, despite not often going there much and learning from home.

Friends are good too. I have like 5 good close friends.

I don't know what to think anymore. I feel exhausted and confused about life. I feel like it's unnecessary to worry that much. Life is pretty good, but I don't know how to handle the emotional stress and all of these things.

Sorry for the long post. That felt good to write that down. All I wrote, was stuff I kept only for me so far. Maybe someone can help me understand all of that and give me another opinion because I feel exhausted re-thinking all of that every day again.

Have a nice day.",31Jan2020,1

My girlfriend (24) recently graduated college with her degree in teaching. Low and behold, she has an outstanding balance of $5,000 for the school. I'm at a loss of what to do here to get her on the right track, as she has been denied a loan (she's always been a contract worker and has never had steady employment), and the school won't work out a payment plan so that she can receive her transcripts and get her license because she already graduated. I'm trying to help by using my tax return (if I even get one) and getting my PTO paid out (which could take months) to help pay her bill. She's trying to save up to start paying it off as well, but her financial situation isn't the best. 

Does anybody know of a good way to get her on the right track as soon as possible, or if there are any types of organizations put in place to help out teachers with outstanding balances like this?

She has tried asking if we can stay on the couch together outside of their bedroom in the living room and they said they were ""deeply offended that she would even bring that up"". I was planning on taking her to a music festival with me or going for a day but the issue is she couldnt be home in time for something like that.

For the next year we were crazy passionate and decided to move in together. In our third year of living together life got really hard. Our physical intimacy had slowed to a once in a blue moon thing as far as sex, or any form of sexual acts with each other. Some of the issues we faced were: 

-Both of us changing of jobs and taking them more serious which included leaving behind identities of young and free and careless.  
-my car being totaled out and splitting her car for a few months (she proposed this idea) 
-my mom getting sick and passing away 
-I stopped smoking weed &amp; she didn’t (we smoked everyday together, she was always more habitual &amp; dependent &amp; had feelings about me not smoking) 
-her endometriosis got severe and she missed work and had to have surgery and recover( I helped her with around the clock) 

Those are big key changes that happened along with so many others that come with growing up. 
With big changes there became a huge change of opinions and views on certain things on both sides. We struggled because sex became non-existent while even before it was very slow. She stated this was because the surgery made her extremely fertile &amp; and she was too scared to get pregnant, even when I offed to use every form of protection including male birth control she still insisted that there’s always that .01% chance she could get pregnant and that I would need to propose and us get married so we could have sex without her worrying about getting pregnant. Engagement was a constant pressure and brought up anytime sex was mentioned.( you can imagine how that would effect our dynamic) my mom getting sick and passing away was a huge deal, with her not understanding my grief and feeling like she was constantly filling my bucket and her was empty with no more to give and it was hard on her too( she told me this) she had planned a trip to California for a week with her girlfriends prior to her passing before she got sick, and her leaving date landed on the day after my moms funeral. After some difficult conversation she said that she could figure out a way to cancel it if I really felt like I needed her after the funeral. Well when it came time for the funeral I told her I would pay for her ticket and that I would really like her to stay and I want her to be there for me. She argued she couldn’t get a refund because it was packaged with her friends ticket and you couldn’t refund just one. When I insisted and pleaded with her that I don’t care I’ll pay you I need you, she put my back against the wall by saying no she has to go and that she needs this to be able to refill her bucket. She left the day after my moms funeral and spent a week in California drinking and smoking weed on the beach while always acting inconvenient if I tried to reach out and talk to her, claiming I’m not on my phone a lot were doing stuff, and even got confrontational with me when I said I needed her and said that she isn’t going to let me ruin her trip. Somehow we bounced back from that, I was just happy to have her when she got back home. Following these events led to resentments &amp; feeling misunderstood. The following last months were filled with arguing &amp; blow outs and then taking space and then coming back together. She always claimed that I had issues and was selfish and she needed me to change, I would also do things to improve my mental health &amp; be a better person but anytime we would have any scuffle she would hold it over my head I couldn’t change. It’s not like I had no part in our struggleS, I was difficult at times, insecure, combative &amp; wish-washy. I had gone through a lot, I’m not justifying myself and saying she’s responsible for it all. She constantly felt like I talked down to her or that I said stupid shit and never thought before I spoke or I was always being combative. A lot of times I felt misunderstood and I would always want to try and talk it out, in which she would always get angry and loud and give me silent treatment or cold shoulder and be passive aggressive. This went on for a long time until recently we had a big blow out where she didn’t like what I said ( how I wanted to handle something with a friend) and got confrontational about the disagreement, when I tried for us to just talk and hear each other she wouldn’t actually work for a solution she would just mock me when I got frustrated about her not really wanting to work through she just wanted to dismiss and tell me leave, after I got mad and showed body language of frustration and told her I’m sick of never being heard out and being dismissed she took her phone and started to record me. This made me more mad, so while she recorded I settled down and told her exactly why I was forced to get mad and she freaking through that yelling I want space, and when I said that I’m tired you dictating how this relationship works and I feel like your purposely making it hard to be with you, she freaked and started screaming so I impulsively said the relationship was done and that I can’t be the source of her always being unhappy like she made it out to be. She cried and cursed telling me she couldn’t believe me after all the blow outs we had before that she forgave me for. I took my clothes and left which led to texting about us arguing about our point of views which led to more arguing and no understanding of each other’s sides. She was furious and we continued to argue she said she was really done and nothing could change it, when I calmed down I offered that I love her, we’ve been through a lot and that we should atleast try some counseling before we throw it all away. She said no to counseling and wouldn’t even consider it anytime soon, so we continued to argue about it and she kept pushing she was done and that there’s no way that we are getting back together.After some time of me finally agreeing and saying okay then let’s talk logistics, and making it known I want to be together. We had a talk in person where she said it doesn’t feel right anymore and we need to move out and take some space to figure each other out, but she doesn’t want to make it hard by hating each other and said that she wants to be friends, and if after some space and separation we could see if we could be friends and then work things out but she said I can’t promise you anything because I don’t know she said. She made it known she wants us to work but now she’s questioning everything and being with me and we need time to work on ourselves. It’s been the same story since with her inviting me over after a tough day and cuddling and then her proposing could we just be friends for a while and make this easy on each other, and that she can’t garuntee  anything but if we work on ourselves and it’s meant to be then we will end up together. She doesn’t know if she’s the one for me but ofcourse she loves me. We’ve been separated for a week with small chats about emotions with her basically saying that it’s nice to know we can break in peace &amp; not fight. I’m pushing more for separation and space, with both of us working on each other but keeping a goal in mind that we’re committed to doing things such as counseling to come back together after we both get the time we need. She says that she won’t agree to anything and that she wants to be friends for everything to happen naturally, with no set system in place to get back together, she wants everything to be naturally done and not put in any goals or systems. She’s stated it feels wrong to be without me but also doesn’t feel right to be with me and that she’s town in two and needs to move into her own place and down her own thing for awhile, she stated she’s not interested in seeing other people but states that she wants to be single and even took our relationship off Facebook. Is she just wanting to be friends with me to not have to lose me, bc she knows I’ll go no contact right away, or do you think there’s hope for separation and becoming friends and working to build our relationship back up?  I fear she’s asking me to be friends so I don’t cut her off and then when the time comes when she’s emotionally ready she will just say nope it won’t work I never promised, while In the mean time I had my hopes up the entire time.  

Should I comply and keep little contact with her? 
And trust that the process that she wants to be friends to get back together?",31Jan2020,1
973,"So, my sister has this attitude where.. like of a better term, bully people into doing things. For example:  

My grandmother is capable of doing dishes. Everytime I ask my grandmother if she needs help, she always says she's got it under control. (We have a rule that we should always wash our own plates, bowls, pans, etc.) So I just let her do her own thing. But, when my sister is home &amp; sees my grandma doing dishes, she comes up to me like ""hey, why aren't you doing the dishes? Did you ask her if she needs help? You know you should always ask her, its unfair to her"" Yet, she never offers to help, she just looked at my grandma, confronted me, &amp; bitched me out.  

She acts like we are obligated to listen to her &amp; her way is the only way. She's a teenager.. the youngest out of everyone in this household. My mom is afraid to say things to her about it cause the last time we confronted her about it she started screaming &amp; crying.  

Luckily, this is a temporary stay for me till I pay off my debts. But I digress. I'm not sure what to do in this situation.",31Jan2020,1
975,"I’m currently a junior in college and last semester (around Thanksgiving) I met someone that I am really interested in but the problem is that we have only met once. The way we met was, I was going to get some bubble tea and take it with me to go and study at one of our academic buildings. As I walked into the bubble tea place, I see a friend that I haven’t caught up with in quite a while (we only see each other like twice a semester now). He was sitting with 2 of his other friends and introduced me to them. One of his friends turned out to be Lebanese just like me. My friend asked if I wanted to sit down and chat with them and I did just that. After our conversation, I felt like the Lebanese guy and I had a lot in common and he asked for my snapchat. After that, we never really spoke to each other because of finals, the semester ending, and winter break starting. Now it’s the beginning of a new semester. We are 3 weeks in. After the first week of school, I asked my friend if he wanted to go to a Lebanese bakery and to bring the friend I like along. Turns out the guy I like wasn’t going to be free because he was out of town. My friend told me the guy I liked said, “It was sweet that she asked” and “I didn’t think she would remember me” and “we can do it another time”. 

Last week I had to go back to my hometown for something so I couldn’t ask again. 

I feel like I am losing my chance and I’m just gonna appear desperate if I ask again. I really like this guy and I want to get to know him and hangout with him :(. I don’t really have that many friends in college and I feel like we... I know this sounds cheesy... “clicked”. My two friends that know him say that we both have similar personalities too. I don’t want to come off as desperate, but I also don’t want to miss out on a new friend, or possibly a relationship. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just ask him? 

...Another thing I should point out is that we are both engineering students (different departments) in our junior year, which is the hardest year. Could this also factor in to whether or not I should ask him? Maybe he’s just too busy?",31Jan2020,1
976,I got my watch for Christmas and have been wearing it since that day and have only missed wearing it once or twice. I haven’t had any problems until recently a few days ago my wrist started hurting right around where my apple watch is. i tried to loosen the band but unfortunately i only have the original band my apple watch came with and there’s either a setting that i think fits perfect or the next size up with is too loose and it wiggles all around and i wouldn’t want my watch that loose. I love it so much and it has been very handy. I want to be able to make it work as I don’t have enough money to waste like $500. Yes it was a gift but it was the most expensive gift I have ever gotten I want to be able to continue to use it. I have even tried switching wrists and my other wrist is even worse than the one i usually use that one starts to hurt just minutes after putting it on. What can I do to relieve this? I need to keep wearing it and I don’t think I can return it anymore. If i need I could try buying a new band but I don’t want to waste my money on one if it won’t help. Has anyone else had this problem? What did you do? Thanks!,31Jan2020,1
977,"**Here’s the thought**: I started out in college as a CIS major, then I went to BSN a week later, and now I am doing this Bachelors in Digital Media. 

**I currently do Videography and a bit of photography as a hobby as of right now, and I love working on cars** (working on my drift car with my dad as I type), **and I also love aviation** (I was in Civil Air Patrol back in 2015). 

**I saw on r/cableporn** (yes, it is called that... I’m a Christian and I don’t particularly care for that phrasing, but whatever...) **the flair was called “Data Cabler”, so I researched it, and I instantly fell in love with the idea of having a job, creating networks and making them so neat, because I am a very OCD person when it comes to neatness.

979,So i(F17) got my ex best friend a job at my work when we were friends like 3 weeks ago and our friendship has ended on reallyy bad terms this week which makes it impossible to just be fake to her during work to avoid drama but i don’t think i can even do that. Should i bring it up to my manager or my boss? I don’t want to make things difficult and i’m scared of sounding unprofessional. Also it would be hard to avoid her because it’s a 3 person shift and we work closely together so I have to talk to her.,31Jan2020,1
