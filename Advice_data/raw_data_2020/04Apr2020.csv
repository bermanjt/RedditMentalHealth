0,"To begin this, hoping to not regret though I would regret not to speak out any sooner, in truth I will only speak in this post. In truth. 

I have been living in a very dysfunctional abusive household for 22 years. This is very hard to write as I would have to literally gather 22 years of moments and memories that have happened. That have been normalized. My reality doesn’t feel real, nor should it be.  I wonder why my life is like this.  I’m tired of this sick cycle of abuse. Short repairs and then a tirade hate, aggressive behaviour, pretending to call certain people to shame me ? Lying ?  No one in this world gets away with their lies. Not in this world. And if they do, God, and the next world will be after them.",04Apr2020,1

4,"I asked out one of my co-workers last week and got rejected. Total surprise. She lead me on and I asked her out after we've been flirty with each other for 6 months and after my boss said I should. She said yes to Starbucks date 2 weeks prior but backed out an hour before due to family issues.

She got mad saying I'm too old. I'm 23. She's 17. Might seem like a difference but literally everybody at work and my parents are fine with it.

Well anyway her sister started work today and totally started laughing at me and snapchatted a picture of me. When looked up at her she did [this with her face.](http://imgur.com/a/bjzg2jy) Hand on face above eyebrow smiling while looking up then down and away.

I gave a mean stare for a while. The. She was doing it again a little while later so I went up to her and asked what she wanted and why she was staring at me. She said I don't know I just stare at people a lot.

5,"ive recently started talking to a coworker that I have a crush on. we work at a store and we're both around 19 year old. so far i've just had smaller conversations with her based on what we're doing at work. 

today there was a group of four of us, including me and her, loading up a truck we were all having a great time and enjoying eachothers company, so i feel like that definitely helped break the awkward barrier of not really knowing her. 

Im thinking that next time i see her at work, i'll ask for her snapchat (how do i do that without being creepy?) and then hopefully we'll start sending snaps back and forth. 

then i really don't know what to do after that, that's why im writing here. any advice is appreciated, thanks",04Apr2020,1

7,"I usually take Zoloft but started a few months ago and it’s a low dose. Wanted to increase it because things have been rough all week.t psych never contacted me and I have called the office many times and their communication is really bad.

I’m really stressed I don’t know what to do.

I don’t want to go to the hospital during a pandemic, especially to take up space for someone else.

I had a therapy appt but I always feel better seeing my therapist and it’s hard for me to even recall what I’ve been feeling when I start talking to someone. I kind of become emotionally blind.

I was doing great in terms of the pandemic and felt good honestly, comforted by the chaos.

But things otherwise are starting to drive my crazy and I can’t take it. I am a failure for not telling my therapist... and I can’t even get someone to care about me by paying them because my psychiatrist is MIA.

I feel really overwhelmed and don’t know what to do. I could probably try and contact my therapist tomorrow but it’s Saturday. I could wait until Monday idk I’ve never contacted him outside of appt times and don’t want to be admitted and fuck up the much needed resources right now.

Thanks for listening.",04Apr2020,1

My mother is the most amazing woman in my life and I(M23) love her more than anything. She has always been there for me to support me and I can talk to her about almost anything. Now life was not always easy for us she has dealt with depression and large social anxiety issues since I was a child and I also have my battles with depression, social anxiety and low self-esteem issues. 

My brother is a schizophrenic with a big drug problem that caused a lot of stressful moments for our family. A lot of friends of him which we both know since I was little also struggled with drug abuse. So I have always told my mother I would never use drugs and understand greatly why my mother is against the use of drugs. But even though I have been going to therapy the last few years I have just become more stressed to the point where it is also started hurting physically, I simply just can't relax. I tried relaxation methods like meditation, mindfulness and yoga but it's not working.

Social anxiety, low self-esteem, stress and pain have become such and issue that I'm having more and more problems trying to accomplish anything.

This is also the reason why I want to try MDMA as I have read, and a friend of mine that struggled greatly with depression as well, tell me that it has positive effects on these problems.

Now I love my mother with whole my heart but it would break her if she knew I would do drugs. I have never done drugs but I am also not completely against them. Of course I can just not tell her but I still would hate to break the promise I made to her and I always like to be honest with her so if I'll do it I'll probably tell her one day.

So my question is would it be worth it? What are your personal stories on the use of it and how it benefitted you?",04Apr2020,1

I met this girl on Snapchat a while ago not sure when, she had a boyfriend at the time and I knew that and I know I’m wrong for doing so but I managed to flirt with her over Snapchat enough to get her to FaceTime me, we FaceTimed and she she started off very timid but after a while we were chatting away, I ended up convincing her to come to my house and we ended up having sex, it was rushed because she was lying to her mum about where she was going and was stressed out about getting caught but still we had sex and we enjoyed each other’s company. 

She told me that after she left my house that day she was so ashamed of herself and cried all the way home and couldn’t believe she had lied to her family and cheated. 

She came to my house 4 more times, we had sex each time sometimes more than once and on one occasion she told me she loved me during sex, we would cuddle after and I felt loved up and she told me she would break up with her boyfriend for me, she even met my dad at my house and sat and watched a movie with me and my dad. 

She didn’t break up with her boyfriend and she’s been with him 5 months after everything happened, it was her birthday on the 1st or April and i messaged her on Instagram to say happy birthday and we ended up FaceTiming again and the feelings have all come back. I’m single I feel like I should have mentioned that, she’s still with him. She says she wants me and she has feelings for me and she wants to break up with her boyfriend but that she doesn’t want to throw away what her and her boyfriend have for me because me and her might not be as compatible as we think. 

I love this girl, I tried to tell myself I didn’t but talking on FaceTime and the amazing chemistry we have in and out of the bedroom is just too good to ignore, I feel like her relationship with her boyfriend is already fucked because she cheated , they’ve only been together 1 and a half years and it just feels like she should break up with him for me because either he’s going to find out and break up with her or they’ll break up for another reason that will hurt more plus I might not be there waiting anymore. 

Her boyfriend is part of her friend group, her 2 best friends know about our fling and know her feelings for me, they are friends with her boyfriend too and they haven’t told him, my cousin who is dating this girls other friend also knows, along with my cousins friend who is dating this girls other best friend. Everyone’s keeping the secret from her boyfriend. 

I don’t feel guilty, I’m a piece of shit but I know I want this girl and I don’t mind stepping on others to get her, sounds bad and is bad but it’s the truth. 

What do you guys think she should do? What should I do? 

Any input is appreciated.",04Apr2020,1
10,"I live in a neighborhood with a lake that has a walking trail around it. Since we have been trying to do our part and stay home and keep our distance me and my 5 year old daughter have been going to the lake everyday so she can play.  Where is sit in very close to the lake and always 20+ feet away from the walking trail. Two days ago I was there by myself with my dog just sitting enjoying the view. I suffer from extreme anxiety and sitting outside is really the only thing that helps keep my mood up. Now to my issue. Two 9 or 10 year old boys came within a few weeks of me so they could fish. I politely asked them if they could move to a safer distance and reminded them about the corona virus. The one boy listened, but the other boy refused to move and said that is where all of the good fish are. I got up and left as I did not want to risk infection. Today I was at the same lake with my daughter. We moved to the other side of the lake which is the extreme opposite of where I was just 2 days before. We were sitting and enjoying ourselves blowing bubbles, playing games and eating snacks when the same boy came along. First he was about 50 feet away which was fine, but then I watched as he slowly moved his way untll he was right next to us. I again asked him to move,  but he refused and said I live right there so I was to be by my house which is a lie so I pointed and told him I know that is where you live. He then said this is were all of the good rocks are and I want to skip stones. This time I admit I did lose my cool and called him a little shit. I should not have done that as I am the adult. My anxiety and anger got the best of me. About 30 minutes later after I moved to yet another spot his dad came and rightfully was upset that ""I cursed at his son"", but he would not listen to why I was upset and that this has been an issue for two days now. My question is this, what can I do so this doesn't happen again? The lake really calms my anxiety, but I also really don't want to have any further issues. Should I just stay home?",04Apr2020,1
11,"Hello. I work at a company the name of a rainforest. I am in a certain department that deals with packages as they leave the station and get ready to go into the trucks. I used to be in one place for the most part where I would get the lighter packages and put them on a conveyor belt and I am really good at it. I’m in the top 4 fastest in the whole department. (I can put over 2,300 packages in an hour on the conveyor belt). Recently, the management have been sending me to the heavy box job where it’s different and have to put them on palets. The boxes can be up to 50 pounds. I’ve had an arm surgery in 2017 and have screws in my arm. It hurts when I lift heavy boxes and is extremely painful. Not only that, but I have tilted knee caps that makes it easy to injure my knees. I have injured my right petula (knee cap. Not sure how it’s spelled) at least four times since I was thirteen (I’m 21 now), and it’s been very hard on me. There was one time where I was in the heavy box job and I had to leave early because I was in so much pain and couldn’t handle it anymore. I went home and my knees were red and swollen like softballs. That was awhile ago and hasn’t happened since, but I still have arm issues. I keep asking to be put in the light box area and try not to mention my arm and such because I don’t want them to use it as an excuse and possibly even fire me. My parents have always told me not to tell them about medical issues and heavily insist I don’t. I did however say on my paperwork that I have a disability. Also another note is you can see the scar that goes along my arm on both sides since I had broken both bones in my arm. It’s very noticeable and you can still see where the stitches were and had some bumps there too. I also suffer from anxiety. I’ve been having anxiety attacks at night before bed and when I’m getting ready for work and haven’t end up going these past few weeks since I literally can’t go since I will throw up in the car on the way there if I went or have a full on panic attack on the way there and eventually leave early because the pain and anxiety is too much. I keep asking to be put in the lighter section and they keep telling me no or that they would later if the need comes up. I also find out that they send labor shares after first break (people from other areas of the building) and ignore my request to go. I don’t know what to do at this point because my anxiety of knowing the pain of what’s going to be ahead is too much. I’m also afraid of what everyone will say about me being gone so long and judging me. I did go back one day to have everyone giving me a look that makes me anxious even more. If I get too anxious or stressed, I get physically sick and will throw up and will start hyperventilating and I’ve been getting to that point. And also since I’ve been gone from work and I’m not even sure if my mental health doctor would even be open because of what’s going on with the COVID-19. Should I just search for another job? At this point I don’t even know if I will be able to go back because of my anxiety. I really want to. I want to go back because it is such a good job and I had made friends there. I also don’t want to leave like this. Do you guys have any suggestions for me? Please be kind and soft because just typing this and writing for the world to see is making me anxious already, but I don’t have anyone to turn to that would generally be honest and consider my mental health rather than just say, “go to work!” They don’t understand what it’s like to have anxiety and at the level I do where I can throw up, hyperventilate, and in some severe cases even pass out. When I even think of work I get lightheaded and my anxiousness goes through the roof.",04Apr2020,1

14,"So me and my girlfriend have been going through a rough patch well at least I think so because I have suspicions that she’s cheating because of the amount she talks to her ex and how secretive she is with her phone... anyways I met these 2 girl on a groupchat and one of them seemed really smart so I told her the story and some minor details that no one should know, she asked for my girlfriends name and this girl already knew my location from snapmaps so she found my girlfriend and her dads number and then just left it at that...

Anyways that other girl is that one crazy friend who’s stupid and gets satisfaction by fucking other people up. Apparently she took the other girls phone and found both numbers and decided to add Nice girl, my girlfriend, girlfriends dad and herself into a groupchat and FaceTimes it saying that
 “op is cheating on you and got me pregnant, he also told me these minor secrets about your last relationship and I’m also surprised he never broke up with you yet”
My girlfriend got super scared and texted me asking me this and basically her dad kept getting the ringing from the FaceTime so he joins and yells at all the girls to go to sleep and now my girlfriend and her dad are in a fight because that weird girl said she was 11 and not 16 like she really is... my girlfriend blocked her dad because she was mad at him for yelling at little girls and calling them all fucking wh*res and c*nts... she called me crying saying how I shouldn’t talk about her past with anyone and that I need to keep my mouth shut and to fix our relationship I should’ve came to her....

Yes I know I shouldn’t have spoke about this to strangers and yes I regret this, now my girlfriend is tryna put it all behind her even though this happened last night

she hasn’t even spoke about it but i know it’s probably killing her, what should I do?

I should also mention she lives 4 hours away from me back in my hometown, but I visit there at least once a month to see my friends and everyone I know. She’s also a year older but I believe it is legal where both of us live as far as I am concerned (I am 17). However, when she told me she liked me, I was pretty happy because I would totally like to try and see what would happen because I’m attracted to her, but this is where things get weird. I asked her what now because we both like each other but she just responds with “idk” (we talk on Snapchat mostly). Then I asked her if she wanted to date because we liked each other and she said she didnt know, so I told her I want to try but I’ll let her think it over as long as she wants. We continued talking for the rest of the night, but it confused the hell out of me when she just started sending heart emojis with her messages? Fast forward to today, she kept talking to me but it’s been kinda dry because idk what I’m supposed to say because I’m not exactly very entertaining, and I know she has dated multiple guys as I have known her for years, so relationships shouldn’t be anything new for her. Now I’m starting to have second guessing and stuff because I get paranoid about these kind of things easily (low self esteem, I’m a clingy person who finds it hard to find someone who is at my level of clingyness). I have no idea if she’s messing with me or what, because signals go from her sending random hearts to her being a dry Texter.

18," I need advise.

So I (F22) was seeing this guy(M22) for a bit, he went on vacation to a current Covid 19 hotspot and now I haven't heard from him in 10 days.... last message I got was a selfie....

We met via tinder and I expected it to just be a hook up, but when he leaned down and kissed me, it was just a soft pressing of lips, i couldn't help but to smile into, i felt something new. We got along way to well for it to be a flook. We had great repour and chemistry. We just... it was like pieces that fell into place.  (Sex was insane). We kept jokingly saying, ""don't ghost me.""
So I live 100 miles away so after the day of meeting and the next day that included In-n-out and a quickie, I went back home for 2 weeks.
I'm a logical and reasonable person, so I wanted to take time, go on dates, put sex on the back burner. He was so infatuated with me... yeah I was tentative towards starting something, but I don't have much of a romantic history.
We talked all the time untill his phone broke, it was showing signs of breaking so I had a little heads up.  After it broke we had no way of contacting each other. I thought about stopping by his place to see if he just ghosted me or what, but I was taking a random walk through UCLA and we ran into each other. It was Serendipitous, I come from a long line of unexpected and incredible love stories. And it made me pause and wonder about my life.

 The next day we talked and he didn't want to start something and have to move back to Kansas.  He said he wanted to be friends but then we both ended up having jobs lined up in LA. So I check in, I asked  directly if there was ever an actual chance of us being together, and he refused to answer. Nothing in my life has ever been 'neat.' So I wanted to avoid this I asked him if he had any potential romantic feelings about me at all and he pretended I never asked, just carried on with updates about his vacation.

But now it's complete radio silence.
His vacation was in a Covid19 hotspot a few days before people showed symptoms.
I found his sister on Facebook... maybe I can ask her if everything is okay, but that's kind of creepy and invasive. 
What if hes on a ventilator... 
While writing/editing that I realized how neurotic I sound. Hes been sending mix signals, and stringing me a long. We fitted so well together, I felt like my authentic self when I was around him... and now silence.
 He made me feel like I was comfortable in my own skin, like the things that made me human, wasn't flaws, but just parts of a greater whole. 
I accidentally left a flower at his place, and he kept it, pressed in a book, he told me he was keeping it when he broke it off. Wtf is that?  Any ideas about that?

1 should I contact the sister, if so when?
2 how/when do you let go of a love unfulfilled, half lived? During a pandemic 
3 I'm working on a painting that includes his likeness, is that okay, I told him about it and he didn't say anything.

19,"I've posted before but didn't get much help, so I am reposting in hopes of getting some advice.  In a span of 24 hours, it's become a lot more stressful for us.

Myself and my co-workers are apart of a wellness center that is located (and connected) to a medical campus that has both students and hospitals (medical students are not allowed on campus nor in hospitals).  We were told that remote working would be extended to April 30th, yet last night we received an email saying we will open up the basement portion of our wellness center so that the medical professionals working at the hospital will have a place to shower before heading home.  Our responsibility will be ""locker room attendants"" which as of now involves monitoring the locker room and being responsible for the towels and laundry to be cleaned once they are done showering.  We had a large meeting about the situation and to put it simply, it did not make me feel any better about the situation and being around high risk individuals who are at the forefront of this pandemic.  Things were said like...

""we wouldn't put you in this position if we didn't think you'd be okay""

""my wife is the head of infectious disease on campus and says we will be fine""

""we are playing an essential role in keeping our healthcare workers safe""

""Its unlikely the virus will be transmitted as long as you stay 6 ft away, wash your hands, etc.""

Now, I understand the need to allow the healthcare workers to have a place to shower, however, I  don't find it necessary for them to staff 20+ people from 7am-midnight, 7 days/week for this to be operational.  I also asked what would happen if we refused to work or didn't feel comfortable and he said ""We can't tell you to do this.  You are free people.""  But 15 minutes after the call, our managers told us that it is now mandatory and if we refuse, it will be put on our HR record and we will be docked pay.  Without any clear instruction and layout of our responsibilities, this is beginning on Monday, April 6th.  They did not consult any of us until after the decision has been made and now my co-workers and I have become very anxious considering our state is on a mandatory lock down.

When 2 years ago I hit a new low in regards of panic attacks I was feeling strong heartbeats, difficulties breathing, dizziness in general. I had to live with them for about a month, 24/7. I went to a psychologist and we had sessions once a week for about 2 months. 

After about 20 days, the panic attacks stopped and I kept going to the psychologist to “get to the bottom of it”, find out why it was happening and blah blah blah. Truth is in the 2 months I went there, beside stupid breathing techniques, I found out nothing of why it was happening.
Nothing at all. Apparently it just happens to me. There must be a reason under it, but if I didn’t find it in 2 months, it’s just.....

Now sometimes I just get them. They happen. I feel like I’m dying for as long as they last. And they they go away. 

I don’t need this shit. I learned how to handle them. I learned how to ignore them until they pass. How to realise when it’s happening that I’m not actually dying. 

But it’s useless. I can’t sleep properly when it happens. It just fucks up my whole day, week, month. 


I think I need to see a psychiatrist, one that can prescribe something. Something I can have when I need it. Something that screams “whatever, stupid panic attack, I’m done being afraid of you appearing during important moments in my life. I have a pill, I can kill you right away if you attack.”

I think that having that kind of power over a deep fear of an attack coming, will make the fear go away, and consequently make the panic attack never.... attack.

30,"I have this friend, he isn’t an asshole by any means. He is a kind person who always puts others first. He is funny. We have fun together. 

However as we’ve grown closer and spent more time together, he increasingly gets on my nerves. I feel irritated by almost everything he says or does, and I feel like an asshole for it because I have less and less patience for him. 

There are things which have made me lose respect for him - he doesn’t stand up for himself, he makes excuses for everything, he doesn’t take initiative. Even something as small as going to the gym, he will ALWAYS ask “what are we doing next” etc like just make a decision dude, I’m not your babysitter. And I’ll ask him a question and he will be like “I don’t know, should I?” and it grates on me. 

He doesn’t have any savings and is always in financial trouble, despite having the time to work more and advice on how to improve his situation. 

He repeats questions that I’ve answered 5 times before. 

He doesn’t address when things are bothering him, for the most part. 

I am someone who values assertiveness above all else. I feel a growing resentment towards him because I feel he is not helping me grow, but is pulling me backwards (through no fault of his own).

I’m also mindful of the fact I could be way too high maintenance and easily frustrated. If that’s the case, I feel it is not good for HIM to be friends with me who is low key annoyed by everything he does. I’ve been watching YouTube videos, forums, trying my best to work on my frustration but I shouldn’t have to put in this amount of effort to tolerate someone. 

Again he isn’t an asshole, I care for him but i’m losing respect for him. I’ve tried to ride it out and just promise myself I won’t get annoyed, but every time we hang out or talk there’s something that annoys me and it’s becoming more draining than anything else.

31,"Freaking out rn because the weight of what I did finally hit me today. I’m a 19f in my sophomore year of uni. This entire school year has been extremely rough for me mental health wise, depression, anxiety, etc, including I’m starting to suspect I have an undiagnosed learning disorder. I opened up about this to my mom a few days ago, most about how depressed &amp; anxious I’ve been &amp; how stressed school is making me &amp; she seemed to understand and suggested I see someone, which I intend to once this whole pandemic shit is over. Anyway, early this semester I dropped my chem lecture &amp; lab because I did poorly on the first 2 exams &amp; there was a very slim chance I would have actually passed the class. My mom was supportive in this and suggested I take some classes over the summer to make up for it, which I’m fine with and agreed too. Fast forward to online school, none of my teachers are actually posting lectures or holding online class and instead basically told us to teach ourselves from the book &amp; I am struggling but trying my best to keep up &amp; stay organized. I had a paper and a few homework’s due today that I decided to work on yesterday. I open my blackboard to find that I had gotten the dates wrong, and they were due that day (yesterday) at 5pm and it was already past 4pm. I spiraled &amp; went to my classes &amp; hovered over the drop button and hit drop on my remaining classes. In all honestly I probably still could have pulled a C or asked my teachers for an extension but I just wanted this semester to be over. I suck at teaching myself &amp; reading from the book &amp; I haven’t learned anything since online school began &amp; have just been cheating on the assignments (which I know doesn’t help me in anyway, especially when these are classes I need for my major). My parents and I are 50/50 on my tuition and I’m prepared to pay for this semester because this is my fault. I’m just freaking out about how to tell them, or if I even should. 

TLDR: I’ve been struggling with online classes &amp; teaching myself at home &amp; freaked out over missing some assignments &amp; dropped my remaining classes for this semester without consulting my parents.",04Apr2020,1

35,"A few months ago, my friend told me they had a foot fetish.  They were deeply ashamed about it and had trouble admitting it and coming with the realization that it was something they couldn’t just make go away.  I was honestly quite shocked when they told me, as I would have never marked them as the type to have that sort of thing.  After getting over my initial shock, I tried to comfort them, saying that fetishes are perfectly normal, and that I still accepted them for who they were.  They then responded by saying that if I truly believed that if I truly accepted them, and didn’t see them as a monster, then I should send a picture of my feet.  I responded by saying that I would do that, but only if they promised not to use it for pleasure, and I told them to please delete it right away.  They said yes, and I sent it.  they then said thanks for trusting them, along with proof that they deleted it.  But I still felt guilty for being talked into it because I wasn’t really comfortable with sending a picture in the first place.  We talked for a little while after the picture was deleted, and they truly seemed grateful for my trust in them.  I still care about them as a friend, and see them as a sibling.  But I still can’t shake the feelings of shock and disgust with myself for being talked into it.  What should I have done?  What should I do to get past it without dropping them as a friend?  What if something like this comes up again?

My father has mental problems that made their marriage hell. He was stubborn, had no common sense and never listened to my mom when she tried to show him the right way. She'd say something and get ignored. She'd fight for it and he'd still do it his way. Of course it would go wrong and had to be done the way my mom had tried to point. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

Unfortunately, I have inherited his same exact mental problems. She tries to point out the obvious solution and I ignore her. We now have to redo or fix what I've done.

My mom went through it so many years with my dad before that she emotionally can't take anymore. I hate myself for it, but everytime it happens I only after the fact and she's already been hurt.

46,"I started rewatching Avatar connecting it to the TV in the living room and I was already at episode 3. My parents watch TV every afternoon.

A day later when I wanted to continue watching my parents as usually watched TV so I waited till their episode was over. I asked them if it's over so I could watch my show now. I never asked them to join. They said yeah it's over and I started watching. I'll admit that it was wrong of me to not ask if I could watch now. I just asked if the episode was over. I learned from that mistake and won't repeat it. That's not my issue anymore I got that myself.

Anyway, I went to watch a couple of episodes and my parents watched along. I told them *this* is a good show and that's something they should watch... maybe they took that a little too serious. I thought that they want to continue watching with me now because they sat there and kept watching which I don't mind at all. That's why next day I came earlier to the living room for us to watch because I thought they wanted to watch my show now instead if theirs.

We watched multiple episodes as I usually do. They didn't like that and said that that's too many episodes. They clearly had no interest in the show at all. They usually don't have any interest in anything I'm interested in. But I can't just tell them to get up and do something else because it's usually their turn to watch and since we're watching together now I feel like watching ahead is rude. I joined their turn because I thought we would be watching my show now. I think this was a mistake too. Maybe they wanted to watch with me aside from their show and only a few episodes so that they could balance the two in their free time? Anyway, if they're not interested they should just tell me. I told them I skipped the unimportant ones already assuming they want to keep watching.

Today exact same happened except my mom just left us and went to sleep earlier than she usually does. My dad told me that that really are too many episodes and that we could continue tomorrow.

And that'd been fine, I never asked them to watch with me. They just did and if they hadn't joined me I would've kept coming after they watched their show I told them if they're not interested they should just tell me so I wait till the TV is free to use again. But they insist they keep watching but that we should only watch an episode or two a day. I asked them how they do with their own series and they said they always watch an episode or two, no more. And that's fine but why should I be bound by their preferences after I started watching and they joined?

Now I'm thinking of watching by myself from now on but Idk maybe it is my fault and I'm being a butt. If they want to watch they should watch the way I want to, isn't it like that? I know all of this wouldn't have happened if I hadn't done those two other mistakes but now is now. My main question here is AITA if I watch solo from now on? They could watch their show and I'll watch mine seperately? Would that make it OK?",04Apr2020,1

51,"Hey everyone, 

I am 23 years old from the US, and due to health issues, I was not able to go to college after high-school. The gap has been 5 years. Now, I need to back to school, but I am extremely stressed out because I don't know where to start. I want to know the best possible options given my circumstance. The goal is for me to end up being in the best possible college (rank/strength wise) given my circumstance. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Location: So, I am traveling outside the United States, so I don't really have a place. One of my parents lives in the US and another lives outside the country. So, for me location is not a constraint, and I am open to relocating, living, and studying anywhere in the United States. 
2. Finances: I do not have any financial constraints, I have the capability to afford the most expensive tuition. And, I do not need to work, and I do not have a family or other constraints. 
3. Interest: Ideally, I would like to be in business school and major in business related verticals such as finance, applied economics, international business, and etc. I am also interested in colleges that have options to obtain a double major or multiple minor.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes: 

\*In-between my gap, I took classes for a semester at a university and maintained a 4.0 GPA, before I discontinued. However, I would not like to return to this university.  I am also thinking about taking CLEP and testing out of some required courses to save time. 

Again, the goal is for me to be in the best possible university (rank wise) given my circumstance. I was thinking about getting a private consultant to advise, help, and provide the best possible options for me. These consultants are knowledgable and have contacts. What do you guys think? And, where can I start and go about doing this? 

From my research, there are many different options, but my circumstances reduces those options, yet there are still many options. For example, I can start with a university affiliated program with a local community college. The program is designed in a way where the student takes certain core classes, and is expected to maintain a certain GPA to then be guaranteed transfer admission into the affiliated 4-year university. If community college was an option, then transferring into the best university would be my goal. This would perhaps help me ease getting back to college. Another option would be to go to a smaller university and then transfer into the best university. 

What do you guys think? What is your advice? What advice could you give me on private consultants, where/how to start, best options, programs that are available, etc. ? 

I am so stressed out, frustrated, anxious, and I desperately need help. You all have no idea how much I appreciate you reading this. Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing from all of you.

all the guys were very nice to me and welcomed me very nicely, i made a lot of straight friends and not one of them called me anything or ever had any hostile attitude about me being gay. still, i was very cautious not to make any guy uncomfortable or demonstrate any type of interest, even when i felt the other guy hitting on me, if i didnt know by fact he was either gay/bi or hitting on me i wouldnt flirt. i never made any move towards no guy and never did anything with second intentions.

so this year i became friends very quickly with this guy (let's name him Alex) and we connected like few people, and got really close. so there was this day when we knew each other for about a week where we went out with a few friends then headed to mine's, we hung out for a bit then went to sleep. when any straight guy sleep here, i always let em choose and they usually prefer to get another mattress or sleep in the couch (even tho i have a king size, but i totally understand and let them make themselves comfortable) and alex just laid in my bed by my side and was like ok good night, and we slept side by side which i found very unusual but didnt really care. evenrtyally we woke up but still where kinda sleepy, so he pulled me towards him to the point i laid my head in his chest and my hand was crossing his body, and we slept a little bit more. we wake up again but dont go back to sleep, just lay there for a bit then i touch his hand and he holds it, and doesnt let it go for some good time. 

not only that, but there were a lot of other times we got real close physically like no other straight guy would ever, but because we both really like contact and long as i knew, enjoyed it. there was this other day in class where he laid his head on the desk and i caressed it for like 5 seconds then he asked me not to stop, so it became kinda our thing to me to be constantly with my hand on the back of his neck and every time we did this i made sure so ask if he wanted to stop and he never, not once, asked me to stop. he never pushed my hand away with any kind of interaction and never demonstrated being uncomfortable with something. 

so around a week or so i realized i was getting too attached to him and creating feelings, i didnt specifically liked him but i wanted his approval so much, so i distanced myself and stopped sending messages, so i could deal with it and kind of try to get away from this fantasy. yesterday, when i was all fine with it and doing really good, not being attached or anything, he messages me. he says he's kinda uncomfortable with me hitting on him and posting things about him in twitter. he's very gentle throughout the entire conversation and just kind of want to know whats my deal. i told him i never made anything with any second intentions and never considered making any move, besides not looking at him with any subliminar thought. he says he just felt i was hitting on him a lot of times when we were together and thats what chocked me the most. i really didnt expect it because all the time i never do stuff i really feel like doing and i hold myself back sooo many times. he used an example of when we were in the beach and i jumped in his back then made us both fall in the water (which is something i do not only with people im suuuuper close with because its something very common to do when playing in the ocean, at least here in brasil) and i start crying and all of the memories of my childhood comes back and i feel so gross, so guilty, so disgusting. i cant help but shake and ask for his forgiveness and say i never meant anything and saying if he wanted to stay friends i wouldnt act like that and he proceeds and say his intentions were never to , he says he loves me a lot and wouldnt want to ever not be friends, he was just bothered a lit bit because of this but he loved my company and when we hung out. oh and also the girl he likes (that also likes him back and they act kinda like a couple but are not officially together) was living in the us but came back just a few days ago. 

i dont know how to feel other than very dumb and naive to believe a guy would actually feel comfortable with my presence and touch and i dont know if its 100% fair how he acted with me because he never demonstrated any signals he might be uncomfortable with how i act and not one friend of ours (i spoke with a few of our closest ones) ever felt i was hitting on him or trying to make a move, but at the same time i dont know if its my right to say that because if he felt bothered then i have to respect it. what are you guys opinions about it? 

long story short / abstract (idk the acronym im sorry): a straight friend which i was super close and never demonstrated any discomfort with my way of expressing affect suddenly texts me (in a non-rude way) saying he wants me to stop hitting on him bc he doesnt like it, and i feel like i got mixed signals and want to know if its a fair view.",04Apr2020,1
61,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. All of these things happened from August-March by the way.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",04Apr2020,1

undergraduate cumulative gpa: 3.24
science gpa (only undergrad classes): 3.13

I am currently in a masters program and doing really well. I am the teaching assistant for anatomy and I am doing a ton of research. (Its a thesis based program). I haven’t calculated in my classes that I’ve taken in the masters into my overall and science but there will be small increase to my cGPA and sGPA. I majored in health science as an undergrad and currently doing a biology masters. I am a first gen student. I was neither encouraged or discouraged to pursue higher education it was all my own choice. This left me very lost in terms of major/classes/gpa and figuring out what I wanted to do. I come from a disadvantaged background (i have lived on no income in the household since the 8th grade other than high school summers I worked and when I started college workstudy jobs etc) and before then we have about $18,000 of income per year for a family of 9. The high school I went to was focused on getting students to graduate not into college. This in no way is an explanation for my low undergrad gpa however I didnt have the skills to do well in college when I started. I didn’t develop good study skills/time management skills until I was in my junior year. I also worked a lot 20 hours a week while taking 18 units.

I have not yet taken the MCAT still have theee  prereqs that I need to take. Ochem 1&amp;2 and Calculus (i plan on doing that in the fall). I’m unsure if I even have a chance at medical school. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how I can make myself a more competitive applicant.",04Apr2020,1
65,"Lately I've been getting really really frustrated and upset about little(?) things. It ends up ruining my mood and making me really frustrated all day and unable to relax and enjoy myself. I feel like I never feel peaceful.

I'm 24 F, living in an apartment complex that has lots of college kids (aged 19-22ish I'd say). I got very unlucky and my bedroom is on the first floor of a building that is right next to the basketball courts/bonfire and grills.

People come out there and play basketball with music over loud speakers multiple times a day, and also at night sometimes from 10 PM til even 1 or 2 in the morning.

I feel like I can never relax and enjoy my day when it goes on during the day time, cuz I hear the pounding of the basketball and music I don't care to listen to all day. At night I get so frustrated cuz I want to wind down and drink some tea and then sleep but again I have to listen to bouncing balls and yelling and music. Sometimes I can't sleep because of it.

Lately I'm even more frustrated because none of these kids care about or are following the state mandated order to stay home, social distance, and not gather in groups of more than 5 (and they'd have to be a part of you household anyways).

My apartment complex basically ignores my complaints. They rarely respond. The ""security"" they have is a joke and take forever to respond to complaints. Last time I called them the security officer blatantly lied to his supervisor, saying that there wasn't music playing when there was, and then lied to my apartment office by saying there weren't even people there!? I feel like I'm being made to look crazy and no one is taking me seriously.

I'm so fed up and I can't even hear myself think half the time. I want to pull my hair out that no one is doing anything about it and I don't even have anywhere to go right now cuz of the quarantine. People aren't doing their jobs or caring that these people are inhibiting other's lives. I'm so sick and tired.

74,"(Rant warning) My loved ones have been telling me to for quite some time. The problem is, I love my father very much. Though I know he used to have a drug problem and anger issues when I was a child, it doesn’t seem relevant now. He’s been sober for over ten years and has made many improvements to his temper. 

However, as great as my relationship can be with him, it is affected by my step mother. She and I used to fight a lot when I was young, but when I moved out I thought we have both matured and can have a stable relationship. I was even happy when she came to me as a shoulder to cry on and for advice. But she quickly took it back and told me she cannot forgive me for things I did when I was a child. Okay, I stepped back. 

I try to keep my relationship from my father and stepmother separate, but they are together and I cannot expect that. For instance, when I have been in the hospital for my seizures, she started a fight with my whole family in the hospital room. (She was saying that my seizures are just panic attacks because my mothers side of the family is Hispanic and it’s genetic)My father doesn’t defend me, and takes her side, regardless. He will later talk to me in private and apologize, but he will always choose her. And it’s not the first time. My older sister cut ties with him when she was a teenager for similar reasons with my mother. 

It’s at the point it’s intoxicating my whole life. They are currently upset with me because I cut off a friends phone line because she wasn’t paying me her part of the bill. They took it personally. I told him that she’s an adult, and needs to be responsible for her own bills. They called me a disappointment. 

There is a lifetime worth of details to this story, but the point is my father doesn’t stand up for his kids and let’s his wife say and do whatever she wants. I wish he could be there for me a little. Do I cut ties with him or do I try to make it work again?",04Apr2020,1

So there is one girl going through hell atm, her mental state is crazy. She has asked me out 3 times in the 2 years we have known each other.
Then it gets crazier...

There's a girl at my youth group who we mutually liked each other in 2017, she then dated someone else and because I was really dumb, I looked for someone else, dating one of her friends. It flopped in a week but so did the original girl with the other guy.
After a while, we didn't start dating but we were very close. I felt like she was the one.

Then, this girl left youth and this really beautiful girl came. We started talking for a while but I ended up telling her about the girl who left youth, I still like her to this day but what I didn't realise is that they got to the game school. The girl who left started dating a year 12. Time passed and on new years day, the new girl asked me out. I declined only because I was not ready, were now friends and if things happen in the future, it shall be. I guess...

Last year, in my R.E. class, one of my best friends and I got very close. It just got very bad when she was tugging at my shorts, drawing love hearts on my arms when I fall asleep and not letting me sit with anyone else. We weren't even dating.

For example, I remember back then, I was talking to him about me sending him nudes. I said that I’ve been taking nudes for a long time ever since I was 16 so I think its fun. Then he got really excited as soon as I said that and goes “Do you still have them?!” (referring to the nudes I took at that age) I said no. Then another time I was complaining that I was insecure about my body, and he literally said “you have a perfect teenager body” (I was really thin at the time). Then in another instance I remember him saying something about how he prefers to have sex with younger women, but prefers to have serious relationships with older women (didn’t specify how young though).

We were talking about R Kelly the other day and I playfully brought it up and went “you know hes a ephebophile, just like you...” And he goes no way I’m an adult and when you’re an adult you see things differently blabla theyre old enough to be my kids blabla.

90,"I'm losing my fucking mind.

My anxiety is through the roof with all of this, being nervous as it gets closer to home. I normally take a pill to help, but theyre stopped now because my anxiety is no longer a priority for my doctor.

I've got major cabin fever, which is bad enough from living in a tiny town anyway, but now I'm confined to a tiny house with 6m of garden space to walk around in. My parents make me feel as if i'm unwanted, as if I've chose to come home in the first place. No matter what I do is incorrect, or in the way, or unimportant. My ideas and conversations are dismissed constantly.

I feel so lonely. The only person I had in this town was my boyfriend, whos also isolating, and whilst it was great during normal times because I could have me time and we time, my love language is that quality time with him and not having that and having him so close yet so far is killing me.

My course has been cut short before graduation, so now I have to apply for jobs half qualified, despite the fact they'll expect full qualifications, but what choice do I have? I'm broke, and I can't get a job because we can't go outside. I can't have a hobby (or an additional one) because hobbies need people and money.

I've lost 5lbs in a week from being home, despite being not active, because this whole situation is making me so, so depressed.

How are you guys coping?",04Apr2020,1

92,"I was involved in a 3 car accident. The drivers involved were A, B, and C. I was Driver C. 

B and C were coming off of a highway- i66W- onto another major roadway- SR 28N- and as such had a dedicated merge lane to get up to speed and safely merge. 

The merge lane that B and C were on is on the far right of SR 28. Driver A is in the immediate left lane to the merge lane. A decides to change lanes and come into the merge lane- which makes no sense because this lane ends half a mile down the road- however he does not perform his due diligence in checking to see if he has the space for such a move. As a result A sideswipes B and B came to an abrupt stop which caused C to collide with B’s rear. 

The police were called and they concluded that A caused the accident but that C could have prevented his part in the accident and as such was issued a citation for “Failure to pay full time and attention”. This citation was dropped in court. 

Despite C’s citation being dropped A’s insurance has denied liability to C on the grounds of “Contributory negligence”. However A’s insurance has admitted liability to B. 

I- Driver C- now want to pursue litigation against driver A- the driver who by the police’s own account caused the accident- for personal injury and damages. How can I argue against contributory negligence? Is there any precedent to combat it?",04Apr2020,1

95,"So I (19F) have been best friends with my friend (18F) for about a year now. From the very beginning of us texting and hanging out, we just clicked. We bonded over last summer and became absolute best friends. We hang out in person as much as we can despite me being a freshman in college and she being a senior in highschool (college is in the same town). Whenever it’s not in person, we’re texting nonstop. 

I’ve noticed that for the past couple of months the way we text has changed. Since maybe January, the conversations don’t flow as easily, and it seems like we get into little arguments pretty often (only over text, in person were always fine). 

Due to the current quarantine thing, I haven’t seen her in around three weeks, almost a month. I’ve noticed that when we text, she seems really unenthusiastic, often replying with short sentences or just not really putting effort into conversation. We used to text all hours of the day, so due to quarantine I figured things would be the same, theres not much else to do. But I was wrong. Obviously we still text, we’re both super upset that we won’t be seeing each other in person anytime soon, and we aren’t going to stop being friends. Im just bummed because I’m going through texts from not even five months ago, and it’s the lighthearted and interesting conversations I miss. 

I feel like I still put effort into conversation and she’s not really doing the same.

96,"So basically I don’t have many friends because I tend to notice that a lot of people are fake. Things that most other people would tolerate and put up with I won’t, for example if someone doesn’t keep their word. If they say they’ll do something then don’t do it that’s a sign you aren’t a true friend to me, or if you ignore my texts and I know the person is. Or if they ditch me randomly. These are a few examples, now I don’t expect anyone to be perfect but if I see patterns that’s when I stop talking to someone. 

It almost feels like I’m constantly letting people in then out of my life because everyone seems to do me wrong, it’s almost like no one truly has my back, which I don’t necessarily expect anyone to, it’s just frustrating to see how unloyal and fake friends are. Like I said I feel like I don’t tolerate things that the average person might say oh well about. So my question is, am I wrong for not allowing fake friends or people who do me wrong etc get away with that type of behaviour continuously? Am I being too strict on people?",04Apr2020,1

My ideal life involves me living in the woods in Oregon with a beautiful garden and a partner who loves me. Turns out you need money to live in a house, and you need a job to make money. You also need some kind of social life to get a partner and I don’t have that either. 

I applied to grad school and got in for something I hate but I’m good at. I don’t want to go, I don’t want to do it, but I’m forcing myself because it’s a career and it’s good money but it isn’t me. It’s not what I want to do.

I’m a very creative person but it’s hard to be creative and make money. I don’t think that great of an artist, but I’m not the worst. 

I just don’t know what to do, I don’t know if I should stay the course and go to grad school when I know it’s going to make me miserable. Or maybe that’s the “adult” thing to do? To get a career in something I’m good at and can make money doing.

Everyone’s so disappointed in me and I’m disappointed in myself but nobody seems to have any idea what I should do.

101,"Hi, so I have this friend, who I do have romantic feelings for, but we both agreed to stay friends and stuff (both high school girls btw). And I've known her for almost six years. But recently, I feel like she doesn't care about me as much as I care about her. She says that she does, but actions speak louder than words. Whenever we're in like a club together she never interacts with me, and when I'm with other friends with her, it's the same. I feel invisible. Quick info about me: I do have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

  
I also feel like I go out of my way to do things with and for her. Like get my mom to take us to comic con, in coordinating Invader Zim cosplays, only to have her abandon me in hour in to go to change cosplays and leave with her other friend. But then I have my online friends who stay up late with me and we laugh and talk all night long. It feels so mutual and like I'm not a goddamn burden. 

So, since we're supposed to stay inside, and I recently gave her Minecraft for her b-day, I asked if she wanted to play at all while we're off school. We still haven't played, and whenever I ask her she has a bogus reason why she can't. (She's wanted to play MC and stuff btw). 

I don't think she means to hurt me like this, she's extremely sweet. And I'm terrified that if I say anything, she'll get really guilty and upset. Or many, many worse things (run away, hurt herself, kill herself, etc). My anxiety skyrockets whenever I call her cause I'm afraid I'm annoying her.  

I stick with her for many reasons. One, I love her a lot, both in a platonic and romantic way. Two, she said three years ago, I was the reason she hasn't killed herself yet, and even through all these feelings like that isn't true anymore, I don't wanna risk it.

Any advice is appreciated. (within reason, don't be rude/mean)",04Apr2020,1
102,"I had a sister who have been out in the streets doing meth. It first started when she had her first baby boy &amp; she would drop him off at my moms house claiming she’s going to work it eventually turned from late nights, to days, then months then years. My mom raised her child like it was her own. My sister came sometimes but she’ll turn violent and say she feels unwanted and ended leaving due to a fight she had with my sisters. but she came back &amp; was pregnant but my mom didn’t want to kick her out. She stayed here but she would still leave when she was pregnant. The first night the new born baby girl came home she left and didn’t come back until now. * 4 years past* 
The boy ended living with his dad and the baby girl is still staying with us ( different dads) . She recently being staying here the first few weeks were fine but now she is saying how she is going to take her daughter and she’s seen family living in the streets. ( her daughter is even saying I don’t want to go) And we didn’t raise her children right. Also the reason my sister is the way she is because she was Traumatized from my moms Nd dad arguing when she was young. But my point of this post is that I don’t want her to take her daughter. We heard that my sister sleeps with men for drugs. And these past years she’s collects checks for welfare and food stamps so she was frauding the system bc she would not use that on her children Instead drugs. Can I call the cops and have them take her away? I honestly fucken hate her so much she made my moms life so bad and made her so stressed raising  two kids that weren’t even hers and she doesn’t even have a good job she cleans houses. And she’s getting old she’s 53. But my mom won’t listen she just keeps saying to ignore her. She sleeps inside the living room so everyone is just inside their rooms, but I feel bad for my mom because she pays the rent here * I recently moved back in* and shes just letting her daughter taking advantage of her.

And yes, I vetted him. He has a website that lists past clients. He has social media that shows him with quasi-famous people (the first transgender playboy bunny, for instance) and he’s a nice enough guy, but no results.

He’s been under quarantine since his school cancelled classes March 16th. At first he didn’t quite get it until I explained how the virus worked, using a video from a post here on Reddit. He agreed that yes he should be quarantined to the house and yard. His gf broke up with him because I wouldn’t let her come over (I don’t care, he means more to me than she ever would). He’s been antsy the last couple of days, a little restless, and growing more bored as the days tick on.

Today we went to his school to pick up supplies for e-learning and after we got home, he did some homework. I was outside smoking and he came out and asked me if he would die if he caught Corona. I didn’t know what to tell him so I said  there was a strong possibility that he could be hospitalized and suffer long lasting health effects if he caught it. He seemed rather solemn hearing this, there was no expression on his face. This afternoon he made a comment about dying or being on dialysis the rest of his life and I didn’t know what to say to push him through the thought, and that’s stuck in my brain ever since. In the past he’s been known to only come into my room to talk to me once, maybe twice a month. This week, I’m finding he’s been spending more and more time with me “just hanging out.” When I ask him if anything is wrong or if he wants to talk about something, he says “no, idk?” then is just silent. 

I’m in pain thinking about him trying to process this. Anyone have an idea of how to help keep him upbeat and child-like in this time? We have a truthful, unabridged relationship.

The first two times, the boss was really nice about it. But I don't think the third will be the same (He will see the memo I left him tomorrow morning, so he doesn't know yet). He's the type to say what he needs to say, so I definitely know he won't let this mistake pass all the time. Therefore, I am pretty sure I will get a message from him tomorrow morning telling me to wake up or to get my head in the game or something LOL &lt;-- this is me casually masking my crying by laughing ;; 

My dumb brain only just realized I could set up an alarm to remind me to clock-in every start of the shift, so I am pretty confident the mistake won't happen again. I just wish I thought of this sooner.

If he does message me, how should I respond? Should I apologize then tell him I found a way to solve the problem now, or would that seem like I am talking back to him?

115,"This probably seems strange to many as the answer would normally be pretty clear so let me explain. I love going on walks and where I live it a strange place as mostly elderly are in my neighborhood and while there are many houses there are also big stretches of wood, woods that have step drops as well. The place I live has never been the best as we live in a drug highway, but it has gotten a lot worse directly where I live. For example a few meth houses were discovered, a girl my age ( I am around 18) was kidnapped, people breaking into houses and robbing them, people breaking into houses and just walking around, murders and higher profile drug dealers hiding in the wood and men with automatic rifles hiding and running though the woods to avoid the police. Its definitely not as bad as 15 minutes away from my house as that is all out gang land, particularly MS-13. We also have a local gang or two but mostly MS-13, the Bloods and Crips. The gangs tend to pry on the poorer areas and use mostly family men to move drugs across state lines convincing them a job or two will provide for thier family for months. So it's not the worst place, but not a quite paradise. Now to the point.  A while a ago I was awaken by 2 gunshots very close to my house at around 2:45. Normally I rationalize the more gunshots the more likely it's some drunk guy showing off. Anyway, soon after I went on my walks like normal and about 3 days after this a particular shot near a wooded area smelt horrible. Like I ran to the other side to vomit horrible. Of course I thought about the possibility of it being a animal's carcass, but it seems to close together. Lately a few other random wooded places have started to smell the same. I literally have to remember to switch sides of the road as I walk. Now, I don't want to waste anyone's time and I certainly don't want to gi walking though the woods to confirm as agin I am a young female and if someone was to see me I would easily be overpowered. The places are as bad as it sounds great places to hide bodies. Not too wooded at the top but then a nice drop off and denser woods. Some areas are just denser woods. My issue is that someone hide a body no one found it so now its thier dumping ground. I find it strange around 3 to 4 anmials would just drop dead not to far from eachother. Incase you are curious because I metained the woods, it's a strict no hunting in the area as it would be easy to hit a house. Thank you for reading all this.",04Apr2020,1

117,"
Me and my girlfriend had just been together for 2 years. 6 months in she kissed someone on holiday with her friends and told me straight away and was very apologetic about it, i had a good think about it and decided to forgive her because i had strong feelings for her and she seemed very sorry about it. About 10 months in we were in a very bad place in our relationship and we kept nearly breaking up just for standard reasons. Around this time because i felt so bad about her kissing someone still and it was always in the back of my mind, i felt like kissing someone myself hoping it would make it better which obviously it didnt and was stupid, i didnt tell her because she had just dropped out of uni (i was still at uni) and she was in a terrible place cause of not having anyone at home and just not enjoying life in general etc. Around this time she also kissed another person because she was under the impression we were definitely going to break up - This time she didnt tell me straight away i found out a few months later through some other people (she claimed to not have told me because she knew i would break up with her). this is when i confessed to me kissing someone - hence me forgiving her a second time because i had been just as bad. She was upset when i told her but didnt make too much of a fuss because she had done it twice at this point.

Just over a year in I broke up with her for a few weeks as i felt that i still had trust issues, i explained that i still worry way too much when she goes out and explained that for things such as if she goes on a girl holiday again then i wouldnt be able to cope because she obviously kissed someone on her first girls holiday. She then kept trying to get back together and i agreed as she offered to change things to try and show me that she’s sorry and so that i can build my trust up with her, such as just speaking to me more when she’s out and she did end up going on another girls holiday but every time her friends went on a night out etc she would stay back at the flat on her own and facetime me so i wouldnt be worrying and to make it up to me (i didnt make her do that she just suggested it when we got back together).

Since the last time i found out about, nothing has really happened that’s bad or shady. We have just come back from travelling for 2 months together and have been on very good terms.

Last week i broke up with her as she is due to go back to uni this september and i still have trust issues, if she is out with her friends i just freak myself out about it, even if i am with my friends and have distractions i just still cant enjoy myself. 

This has been the hardest week for me as we have broken up whilst still being very good together and i miss her an incredible amount, it’s frustrating because it has been a whole year since she has done something untrustworthy and it still plays up on my mind, i really want to get back with her and try things but at the same time i know if i cant find a way to start trusting her again it wont be good for me mentally.

I need advice on what to do, i know i cant talk about trust issues because i have kissed someone myself but it has really effected me, and most people will just say that as soon as someone cheats you should end it, but it has been a while since all of that happened and we have built a healthy relationship up apart from my trust issues.

Is there any ways i could start to trust her again? The last thing i want to do is never see her again because we get on so well, I also think that I may just have this issue with every girl from now on so it might not make a difference if I move onto someone else, but then at the back of my mind I know it is her fault for doing it in the first place.

121,"I will preface this by saying I'm incredibly awkward and shy irl, and have never even used a dating app/site before really. I've never had sex or even kissed a guy. I also have intimacy issues/ trouble getting close to people in both a romantic and friendship sense. so that's why I am lacking in experience and have no trust in my ability to interpret things whatsoever

I've been talking to this guy since before social distancing started, about a month, and I just kind of went on said app out of curiosity mixed with loneliness. I've been doing therapy and on meds lately so I think that's why I even was able to consider it when I haven't before (despite honestly being incredibly lonely). He messaged me and I thought he was cute and liked his music taste (good music taste is weirdly important to me lol) so I messaged him back. We've been talking for a while and I really like him

He lived somewhat far from me even at the time so I don't know if we would have been able to meet up irl, I wasn't really thinking about that at the time though. But then I was kicked out of my college's dorms and moved further away, and with corona on top of that it's not possible to meet up (and I would have a high chance of chickening out anyways even if it was). But I'm still talking to him. After I moved further away I just figured there'd be no real chance of it going anywhere and stopped messaging him for a bit, but after like a week he messaged me again and I couldn't help responding and starting to talk to him again

I get the vibe that he's also introverted and fairly nervous (he told me as much), we both are pretty careful in our conversations and seem to kind of mirror eachother in a passive/careful/""I'm afraid of stepping too far out of line"" kind of way. We talked about music and were sending eachother a lot which was cool. But the conversations just kind of went in the same direction unless I changed the subject, and I sort of feel like it's also hard to have full convos over text. Obviously it's also sort of impossible to know if you really have chemistry with someone or know too much about them unless you talk to them in person, but due to either my lack of experience or just really liking him (maybe both) I have a massive crush

But I just don't know how to continue with things. He hadn't really implied where he wanted things to go out of our talking so I asked him and he said he was looking for a relationship. He's never asked to meet up and I haven't asked him, again feel like it's pretty impossible right now at the very least. So I don't know where to go with this and I'm just not really sure what to do.

122,"Some context: I am a guy who has recently turned 18. I worked very hard in high school and I am going to university on a full-ride scholarship: tuition, housing, books, meals all paid for. I was raised by a single mother who has been excellent, but somewhat overbearing and helicopter parent-ish. Nothing extreme, I was allowed to go out with friends and such but there were a few times where she crossed some boundaries (putting a tracker in my car without telling me, going through my phone in secret.) 

For my living situation, she *suggested* that I live in the honors housing at my school. The honors housing at my school is known for being full of quiet, studious students. I wasn't too crazy about this but I didn't really mind that idea, so I just went with the flow. I was a bit anxious that I wouldn't know anyone there/ wouldn't know my roommate. However, some of my friends are staying on a different dorm, and want me to be roommates. I was very excited about this and I told my mom. She got very upset, unexpectedly so, and insisted that I live on the honors housing. I dropped it and she warned me not to be mad about it. 

I would much prefer to live with my friends in the different dorm - which has more sociable people in general. To be honest, my mom can't really stop me - I am an adult and because of the scholarship, I will be financially independent of her. I'm not really sure how to handle this because I have never stood up to her like that before and I'm not sure how she would react, or if I should just suck it up and live where she wants me to.",04Apr2020,1

He’s mad at me (and not speaking to me for days at a time) because I asked him to stay at his place since he can’t self isolate. We’ve done long distance before because of his job, so the not seeing each other isn’t completely new. I’m devastated because it was a really really difficult (and heartbreaking) thing to ask him not to come here, and of course I don’t want to be away from him, but the way he’s treating me because of it is making it 1000 times worse.

128," My parents split up when I was really young. I’ve seen my dad and mum in really bad states, my dad was drunk throughout the week. I thought it was normal for most of my young life and my mum would have breakdowns all the time, her husband died before she met my dad which probably made her an extremely anxious person.  

When I was around 10/11 I realised I was gay. Which was scary in itself but what didn’t help was everyone around me constantly bashing gays, including my dad. He would compare them to predators and say how horrible they are. How if he caught gays kissing in public it would need to be stopped, and he would stop it himself. 

All this caused me to have horrible inward feelings constantly, my anxiety was so high when I was young because I was afraid if I looked at a man or anything I was basically committing an act like a predator or a pedo. It was so horrible. I carried on and became very self conscious about who I was, it manifested and I became self hating. I hated my appearance etc. 

At 18 I came out to my brother and mum because I was feeling suicidal. I figured it couldn’t get any worse than death so I just said it, it didn’t help because my anxiety and self Hatred continued. I was in a hole for a few months where I wouldn’t leave my room. I decided to get a move on and go to university to flip my life around. I then got diagnosed with alopecia and went completely bald, I went to uni anyways. 

I did really well my first term and mer my flat mate who really brought the best out of me, I started to Catch feelings but he turned out to be straight. I was really heart broken and got upset one night, another flat mate offered me coke so I was like yeah why not. The day after I did the drug I had a psychotic breakdown during the comedown. I tried desperately to continue my life , went to uni the days afterwords but it felt like I was in hell. 

Everything was off. Took me like 2 months to get to terms with What happened. Every day was hell. I had anxiety so bad I couldn’t sleep. My relationships with my flat mates fell through the floor I couldn’t function properly. Now I’m here at home and I think I’m really depressed. All of this has made me feel so bad and I have no idea how to get out of this funk. It feels like I’m not me anymore that I’ve lost my old self.

So, my Dad lost his job in February, long before the Covid-19 layoffs hit my state. He was a very hard worker and the only reason he was laid off was because the company he worked for was sold to a liquidation company.

Tonight I made a sarcastic facebook post about how I have been basically sleeping my ass off and then playing animal crossing and how at least when I go back to work (I work at a grocery store so I'm considered essential) I'll finally be forcing myself to do something. My dad was posting some weird pictures in the comments of my posts and I said ""Well at least I'm going back to work"". Keep in mind, I'm 19 and live with my parents since I am not at college atm. My dad shouts down the stairs to delete the post. I did so immedietly and tried to apoligize because I had not realized that joke was too far until he mentioned it, but he wouldnt hear a word of it. He said we would have a discussion about this in the morning.

My dad has anger issues. He has never hit me but he does get extremely upset at any little thing. I want to be able to explain that I was joking around and feel guilty that I took it too far, especially on social media. Things between the two off us have been tense enough as it is but I am afraid that this is going to be a breaking point. I'm afraid that this may ruin my living situation for the next few months.

 Again, I don't want to seem like I'm just covering for myself. I do feel guilty and want him to understand that I didn't know I was taking the joke too far. However, I do have many reasons to be scared right now. I'm afraid that he is going to give me a massive rant and then make my living situation very tough, or worse, kick me out.

What do you reccomend I do?

133,"My current job is managing truck drivers. These drivers have a set of regulations and cannot work over their shift hour window. This week I was put to go to another office within our company. I was trained last week as a refresher but have run this office a few months ago. I was taking over for the manager there who normally runs this location, so it was essentially a taste of a promotion since where I usually work I am a supervisor under the manager.

Well this time it was much different. Seemed considerably more busy and with more drivers there was a lot more planning and daily problems that arise. I ended up taking a small amount of work for me home everyday because I had so much to do everyday. All went well and even had an issue I resolved with recognition from the regional manager. Until this issue. 

Today my issue was that I had a driver who had a rough day and just one thing after the other that held him up on his shift. He was running behind yesterday and caught up today until he went to his last 2 stops which held him up for 2 hours. He ended up driving over 30 minutes so he could make it home. This lately has become a big topic to monitor, and even though it is ultimately on the employee, us as managers are held accountable for it to not happen. It’s not normal for this type of situation to arise as most drivers wouldn’t push it nor would they continue for 30 minutes. This amount of time will be considered a lot. When we planned we thought the driver would get everything done the first day so today it would just be those last 2 stops. 

I don’t know if I should email the other manager I filled in for about it since he will be back there on Monday. I cannot and wouldn’t blame the driver because he had an awful day and I know he just wanted to sleep in his own bed but I believe it is illegal. I sort of watched on my phone (we can track the truck) as this happened but I was busy and not near my computer to really be able to tell what was going on. I should have called him and made him stop even if he was 30 minutes from his house. This person has an awful attitude and it would not have ended well and he may have just hung up on me and done it anyways. I was somewhat pushed by our customer to make him finish and knew he wouldn’t make it on time. If it had been my choice I would have just told him to come on home and not do his last delivery and we’ll figure it out on Monday. 

I want to say it one more time. I KNOW I need to own it. I know I need to make it a learning point. I know I need to not let it happen again. What I’m asking is how do I make sure it’s not a write-up, and make it more of a “dont do it again”. I’m worried because I should have called him and made him stop before. Or called him hours before and warned of not trying to make it. I could more dumb and say how I didn’t know until I got home and saw the time he went over. But I don’t know why I didn’t call, i tried to call before I left the office but he didn’t answer (already mad from the last call a couple hours earlier)I think I just felt bad for the guy and didn’t want to make him sleep if he was an hour from home on Friday and just hoped he would pull over on his own. That’s not right of me to do either because I need to take charge and not let this happen. What needs to be said and what doesn’t? Do I mention how I saw it after, that he was behind to begin with, that the customer told me to make him wait at his stops, how I should have called him earlier? I can see it being a very direct question “tell me what happened” and I don’t want to ramble on and hurt myself. Do I call the driver and tell him I saw it? His manager will have to deal with the majority of it as I don’t have access to much. Im still learning and want more chances to learn as this was a big one but I’m afraid this may have them say “he’s not ready”.

137,"So this is a long one and a lot to take in, I greatly appreciate any advice given. I’m a 19 year old male. So about 3 years ago I got with a girl who I was with for a while. She introduced me to my religion, which is Christianity, I’ve just had a hard time selecting a denomination. and she helped form me into the person I am now. She left me for a guy we went to church with and I quickly rebounded and started sleeping with a girl I met at the county fair, we will call her B. Me and her were steady for 8 months, my mom loved her, she treated me great and I know she loves me. I genuinely feel a connection to her in my heart. Eventually she began smothering me, and I felt the physical attraction beginning to fade so I told her to give me space, and then I cheated on her. I’m not proud of cheating, and I deplore it. I did meet a girl through that situation though that I fell for quickly. I mean fast. We are practically the same person, we will call her L. I was with her for a month, and then she left me due to religious differences and her wish to practice abstinence. As soon as we broke up my friends convinced me to go back to B because she treated me so well. But now that I’m back I just miss L. Badly. I have that feeling about L and I can’t shake it. It’s been 2 weeks and I feel like she is in my mind on repeat. It’s gotten to the point of comparisons. I don’t want to break B’s heart again and I feel like I screwed up. I’ve told L I was willing to practice abstinence and to look into her religion, which is a part of Christianity, I just want her back. Since the breakup I’ve stopped praying, I’ve started eating less healthy, I’ve almost lost my job, I started smoking and drinking again, and I feel lost. I can’t make this decision to save my life because nobody has ever treated me as good as B, but L is literally where my mind and heart is right now. I know she won’t take me back because of her beliefs, and I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle of relationships. I’m afraid to tell B because if I end it again I know I’ll lose her forever, and I don’t want to be single just to realize she’s the one, and then not have her in my life ever again.

143,"(I’m 14) Ever since I was young, teachers would talk to my parents about my anger issues or difficulties focusing, and my reports would always say things like: ‘He’s a bright kid but he never finishes tasks’ or ‘He understands the topics but he always makes silly mistakes on tests’ or ‘He spends a lot of class time daydreaming’ but my parents never thought much of it, and neither did I. But come high school, and it all starts to catch up to me. Now I was expected to make myself organised, and I concentrate in class, and put my effort into the right things, none of which I found myself able to do, and my grades followed accordingly. Even outside of school I found my behaviour was affecting me. At home instructions would just bounce off my head even when I was being directly talked to, and I would often forget about tasks, or just abandon them half way them when something else caught my attention. And in my social life, I found it hard to keep along with a normal conversation. I’d be off in my own world while someone’s talking then when I think of something I’d just jump in and say it, completely off topic, often interrupting them, going off into my own rant. This was especially noticeable in situations where I was supposed to be serious, where I’d just blurt something out, never really sticking to the right track or concentrating. This led to some big arguments with close friends, because I just looked like an arsehole. For a long time I just thought I was all these things. I thought I was just impatient and stupid because I didn’t pay attention in primary school, and I assumed I was always tapping because I play the drums, but I’ve never been able to fix these problems. It was only when a friend said I might have ADHD that I cautiously googled it, and was shocked by how well all my problems lined up, but I don’t want to be a hypochondriac, so I’ve tried not to look at them too much. But the thought that all these problems I’ve been blaming on myself, that have been making me feel so depressed, might be connected to one thing, that I can talk to professionals to work on, is really overwhelming.

144,"So I’m a 21 year old girl and I am 100% sure I am attracted to men. I’ve only ever dated guys, only ever had sex with guys and only ever crushed on guys.

But here’s the thing. I feel some way about women, but it’s not at all a comfortable feeling. I think I do feel attracted to girls, but in a wildly different way that I feel attracted to guys. I often masturbate thinking about girls or threeways, maybe more often than I do thinking about guys. But I feel very uncomfortable in the way I view females sexually.

I consider myself a very progressive person, very much into women’s rights and other issues, but when it comes to sexual attraction, at least in my fantasies, I always think about women in an extremely dehumanising way, most of the time actually imagining them just as a body of sorts, without a specific face. I often wonder if I actually am attracted to women or if I simply am attracted to the over sexualisation of women. When I’m attracted to men, I always feel like I like their face, their body shape, I always feel some sort of chemistry. With women, it never goes beyond “nice boobs” or something like that. I’ve made out with girls before, and I actually got to groping and stuff with one girl, but while I was extremely excited in the beginning, I really didn’t enjoy any of those experiences. I have never had a crush on a girl and I think I would never develop romantic feelings towards a girl.

I actually feel wildly uncomfortable picturing my female friends in a sexual context, and the only real girls I’ve ever thought about when masturbating are my boyfriends’ exes, and it always involves some sort of humiliation (them humiliating me).

I really hate that I think about women in this way, and I feel really guilty about it, because it goes very much against my beliefs. I wonder if I may actually be bisexual or if this is the effect of the depiction of over sexualised females. I also wonder why do I ever think about my boyfriend’s exes in a sexual manner, because it makes me feel really insecure afterwards.

145,"Some backstory,  
signed a rental agreement around last August, first time living away from my parent, (with my Significant Other.) we kept up the front unit's yard/sidewalk, shoveling, making the place look nicer and such.  We pay less and are in a back unit (which has a side entrance, poorly laid out) and one very small parking space. A while ago I had my vehicle breakdown, and currently have to rely on my father to get around for things like grocery shopping and laundry, the trouble is his truck doesn't fit in the back unit parking space, and the alleyway is fully blocked if he parks or stops there. Since this has happened he's just been parking in the front along the street, and almost is never there for more than 5-10 minutes, and only has it happen once a week, he's not rude, and doesn't trample through the yard or anything.  


The problem arises where we recently had someone new move into the front unit of the duplex around a month to a month and a half ago. About a week after they moved in they had their kid come out and complain at my siblings (12) for using the front entryway to bring their stuff in to be spend the night. I just assumed that it was a mishap or maybe they cut through their yard, but to be sure we called the rental agency to confirm that we were able to use the front walkway for guests and other situations, as long as we weren't being intrusive, and were told that it was fine and also requested that the rental agency relay this to the tenants in the front unit.   
Well now fast forward to my experience with them to today. They are very very loud, kids playing around thudding, screaming, etc. They have a considerable amount of cardboard boxes (trash) sitting in the walkway since they've moved in, their kids go through our walkway to play in the alleyway, and are very loud in the alleyway too. 

When bringing in a large amount of groceries from my fathers truck earlier today the front tenant got very snippy, and remarked ""They shouldn't be using the front walkway anyways"" in a loud manner (very blatantly making sure that I heard it), and in my own stupidity, I snapped back that we were told that this was fine according to the rental agency, with their response being along the lines of ""well when they called me they agreed that you should be using the front walkway"", I brought up the garbage, and the fact that their kids are constantly using the alleyway access. No yelling, no cussing, no threats, just a frustrated exchange on both ends.  


I'm at a standstill and lost right now. I've cooled down from the situation and have been considering going and talking to them civilly, apologizing for my behavior and basically being like ""Ok so we need to figure this out."" But a large part of me feels like we're past that point and them living in the front unit is a hostile situation.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, maybe I need a fresh perspective, but I don't even vaguely see the issue with us using the front walkway once to maybe twice a week.  


I reread this a few times and it seems comprehensive, hopefully it's not worded too confusing. Thanks for any help and advice on this.",04Apr2020,1

there was this guy I used to have feelings for, but I later found out he was leading me on for 8 months. we were supposed to go to a convention together but he ignored me the whole convention. on the last day he told me we shouldn’t see each other and he stopped messaging me for a couple months.

148,"I should be happy. I know that. I am married and have 2 cute kids. Some people would kill to be in my position.  There are some downsides though... First of all my husband doesn't make a ton of money.  I don't work but I do get SSI, which also isn't a lot either.  We are always on the verge of eviction and having our electricity cut off.  I don't even know how we manage to scrape by some times.  We are both so far in debt from student loans and medical bills, it's ridiculous. 

Also, my husband was my best friend when we got married.  I still consider him my best friend, but recently things have gotten a bit tense between us.  When ever I try to talk to him about anything, even just stuff I saw online that day, he always acts so uninterested.  He just rolls his eye, and keeps looking at his phone game or whatever show he is watching.  He also wont have sex with me regularly.   
It's been about 2 months since we did anything intimate.  He has told me it's because I don't keep the house clean.  Now that he is working from home with all the virus stuff going on, he sees that I don't do a whole lot around the house.  Not as much as I should, I'll admit.  The kids don't respect me, they tear the house up everyday and have to be told 5 times to do things before they half ass do it.  He sees this now and says it's my fault.

I'm not trying to make excuses, I know that I should be doing more to take care of our home and do more ""wife"" things that I used to.  I just have a hard time because of my mental health issues that still haven't been taken care of fully.  And the fact that I have a medical condition that makes me tired all the time. 

I guess I just don't know what to do to be happy with my life.

154,"So basically we have restrictions here which include not going out unless it’s to buy essentionals and can only we around 1 person.

So my friend is throwing a party on the weekend. The thing is I’m scared and I’m also very hypochondriac which is increasing my anxiety. Last week she got upset I couldn’t come to her house because I was feeling paranoid and told me that i shouldn’t be paranoid if it’s gonna not effect me. I had allot of anxiety going trough public transport that day not to mention my uni literally just ended face to face classes since I still had to go last week as I had an assessment. 

Although I do wanna go I just feel a bit scared and I most likely most even be allowed since my parents are getting more stricter with the regulations as well.
I know there’s gonna be another argument soon

Btw we used to be best friends until we had some major drama last year October that turned out being not true and she ended up apologising this early year. She also had missed my birthday which I had been planning my 21st for a long time. Didn’t end up happening since I got Trojan under the bus and lost friends. So part of me thinks it’s okay as long as I wish her a good birthday. But yeah I’m pretty sure there’s gonna be an argument soon..

When she called me a week ago she didn't bother to ask me when I was available to work, but rather told me when I was supposed to work. When I told her about my online classes she basically ignored me and we were in square one about when I was to work. She wanted me to start right away, but I asked her for a two weeks before I started. My parents recently let me know that although they can drop me off to work they can't pick me up from this location, due to their work conflict.

I emailed her my situation, she ignored the situation and repeated the time I would be working and bluntly said how long I want to push this back. I don't know what to reply to her because I think she is completely avoiding my situation (I was hired knowing that I don't drive). My solutions are A) push back a few weeks B) say nevermind I'll be there and hand in 2 week resignation that day?? \*I'm hesitant to say anything because she clearly understands what I'm dealing with, but is avoiding it.

157,"There was this sweet girl I met at work last year, we began talking on facebook actually and we connected pretty well...
I was kinda the misunderstood black sheep at work because I keep to myself....

I could sense some sort of attraction there, we're both good looking and have good personalities, and she actually was giving me a chance and opening up to me a bit,and we learned that we relate quite well in important ways... we talked on our lunch break and it went well...

Yet to make a long story short, stupid me ruined that gradual progress when I began messaging her about how painful life is and how tough things are...
I also asked her to go to a town fair with me, and was just way too overwhelming and awkward... I apologized for that a few times in the upcoming weeks...

one day she just politely told me to stop messaging her and she blocked me. she had her own stuff going on and didn't need me messaging her constantly, it was too much.I was mad because who knows how things would've transpired if I played it casual and with patience.
Anyways, since day 1 of her blocking me I never showed any frustration towards her at work at all... I simply acted like it never happened and respected her space.

.... that was six months ago and I've remained totally respectful and casual around her, and for the first time during these six months she said hi to me.

She is beginning to say hi to me and actually be pleasant around me, when she used to ignore me and act like I was invisible.

Hopefully there's a chance this growing relationship friendship between us can be restored? I've clearly learned from my mistakes and maybe she sees that after 6 months and feels comfortable?

The biggest thing for me, is that she has seen for six months that she doesn't have to say ""hi john"" to me just to keep things casual and stress free at work...

She knows full well I respect her boundaries because my actions have clearly displayed that... so her saying ""hi john"" has to mean something right? (she's in her mid 20's and I'm in my late 20's)",04Apr2020,1

169,"TL;DR : 
A friends girlfriend has been stalking me on social media. I have had some inclinations that she didn’t like me. Me and him weren’t even close friends nor have we ever had anything flirtatious going out. [we did “date” when we were 11, we are both 18 now. The last time we have seen each other we were 12] so I don’t understand why she has a problem with me. Now he’s removed me from all social media. (Read the last paragraph for my question) 






   This might be a bit long, I’m sorry. 

This is new to me so I’m in a position where I don’t know how to feel or if I should even feel anything. I’m kind of venting/seeking outside perspective.

I’ll start with giving some background. We will call this guy Isaiah. Me (f18) and Isaiah(M18) were best friend in fifth grade. We “dated” briefly in fifth grade for three days. I don’t even consider this a relationship, lol nor should anyone. We had crushes on each other all through 6th grade but decided to not date again because we valued our friendship. Half way through 6th grade year I moved to a completely different state. To this day, this is the last time I’ve ever seen him in person. 

I moved back to my home town (the town he still lives in) about two years ago. Between the time we were 11 till we were 16, our interactions were typically on social media timelines. Nothing crazy, usually just laughing at memes. 

When I was 16, I started getting into political and social issues. I was very vocal about my perspectives. For the most part, he always seemed to agree with me. So we interacted a bit more than usual on Facebook via political/social issues posts. Not even private messages. 

We didn’t start DMing on Instagram until a bit after he broke up with his girlfriend. (We will call her Katy.) The entire premise of this conversation was us discussing photography. We had both learned this was something we loved to do and discussed if we should link up and take pictures. Again, very causal. Strictly w a friendly demeanor. Never actually ended up hanging out. 

We chatted quite a bit during this time, then I noticed we didn’t really talk much. I didn’t really think to much about it, nor did I even notice it until one day Katy adds me on Facebook at like 6 AM. I was confused by her adding me. It was very clear she didn’t use Facebook socially. All of her posts on her page were her being tagged into posts by family. (As opposed to her making posts or sharing things on her own) I accepted the friend request anyways. I went to sleep then woke up still curious about this. I decided to do some digging and noticed on her VSCO she recently posted pictures of Isaiah and her together. It was clear they were dating again. I figured that she probably added me on Facebook because she seen he and I were friends and she might’ve wanted to be friends too.


I didn’t think about the situation till a few days later she randomly adds me on Snapchat. I didn’t post my Snapchat on Facebook or anything which means she had to have really look to find it. I was kind of weirded out at this point, and was concerned her adding me would turn into the whole “are you talking to my boyfriend kind of thing.” But instead she slid up on my story and told me I was really pretty. At this point I was thinking “see you think the worse, she’s being kind and probably just wants to be friends.” To myself. So I was really happy by her sweet response. I responded thanking her and telling her she’s very sweet for reaching out. 

That was the only interaction I’ve ever had with Katy. Now, the main basis (besides our photography interests) of Me and Isaiah’s friendship was laughing at our old cringy posts we made. Anytime they popped up on our Facebook memories we would comment laughing at ourselves. There was one from 2013 were he had made some corny joke calling me pretty. I commented on it “LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO”. Which is *very* normal for us. But this time he responded to my comment saying “bro you need to chill out.” Instead of laughing at himself like we typically would. So I realized that this was him setting a boundary for his relationship so I respected it. I didn’t reach out to him anymore.

He was initially commented every one and awhile on my posts but after awhile he completely stopped as well. I also noticed that Katy had unfriended me from Facebook. I took this as an further more indication that there was some sort of issue with me and I needed to keep my distance out of respect for their relationship. 

About a month ago he messaged me on Snapchat telling me he thought it was a cool look that my eyebrows are blue to match my blue hair. That’s the last I heard from him. 

About a week ago I made a new Snapchat and Katy once again added me. I don’t understand why, she removed me from Facebook, and never even interacted with me on my last snapchat that she was on for months. I didn’t even know she still watched my stories on that account for her to even see I made a new one. This time I didn’t add her back because I realize now she’s probably doing it for surveillance purposes. 

That brings me to today where I seen a meme about middle school Isaiah and I would’ve typically laughed at ourselves together. It then dawned on me that it has been months since I seen his posts on Facebook only to then see he removed me from Facebook. And Instagram as well. 

There’s a few things to note, mainly that since we were 11 years old NOTHING about our friendship was romantic or even flirtatious. I don’t even think this guy has ever even casually complimented me before (vice versa). Which was one of the best parts of being friends! Most guys ruin it by flirting. Isaiah and I’d conversation never ever alluded to anything more than chillin and taking pictures or laughing at how cringey we used to be as kids. I really saw this guy as a potential best friend [again]. ALSO we have had many conversations discussing how we despise any form of a romantic relationships! 


I’m not really asking for advice on how to handle this situation, because I know my place. I know if a friendship with me was causing issues within his relationships I wouldn’t expect him to remain friends with me. I’m really asking for perspective from other people. I have been thinking about this situation and I am noticing I can’t see outside of my own perspective. It seems impossible to understand how anything even escalated to her being uncomfortable with our friendship when there was absolutely nothing that gave her a reason to me. There was never anything romantic about our friendship outside of us “dating” when we were 11. Can anyone think/ or speak on behalf of a similar experience of why my existence or our friendship became an issue for their relationship? [he has other friends who are girl, is there anything specific about our friendship that stands out that could make any sense?]",04Apr2020,1

171,"So for context I'm an autistic transgender male going to a very conservative school. The kids there are violently against the LGBT community and every few seconds you hear somebody making fun of autistic/mentally ill people. Due to this all the ""different"" kids lump together in one big friend group because they aren't accepted anywhere else. 

So obviously on my first day I stuck out since you can kinda tell I'm not cis and since I'm autistic, I kinda act... Different. So this girl, we'll call her Alex, immediately took me under her wing. I was very thankful because I struggle to make friends and she seemed nice. We did get along very well for some time but then things went downhill when she admitted she was ""in love with me""

I figured it wouldn't hurt to go on a date with her and humor her. She seemed really nice and I thought maybe I liked her. But then she saw my birthname on a medicine bottle (while snooping in my bathroom) and threatened to tell everyone if I didn't keep going out with her. I'm awkward so I just kinda said okay, I thought we might as well get along until her mom came to pick her up. 

Alex kept claiming that she wanted to be a boy just because she only likes gay men. Which was a red flag for me. After that date I tried to avoid her as much as possible. She made me really uncomfortable and I didn't feel like I had to put up with someone that make me feel uncomfortable. 

She started following me around like a lost puppy. It was IMPOSSIBLE to have a conversation with her, she wouldn't respond to anything you say. Like you ask how she is and she just starts quoting some plays she likes instead of answering. Or you'll just be like ""oh your lunch looks good, what is it?"" And she'll start talking about some drawing she made. It was frustrating because if you didn't talk about what she wanted there was no conversation. 

Then we got school laptops. Every few seconds teachers would be yelling at her to close it and pay attention. She had it taken away constantly for looking at gay porn and stuff. It was kind of embarrassing to be seen with her when everyone knew. 

When Alex started asking me about my sex life (Not literal sex, I'm only 14, just asking about how I masterbate and shit) I told her I wasn't comfortable talking to her anymore. She got really aggressive and told everyone my birthname. I hated her after that and we didn't talk for about two months before she started talking to me again. 

I try to be nice. But she's completely embarrassing and invasive, she makes a mockery of mental illnesses. The past few months she's gotten worse, I'm just gonna make a bullet list to keep this short 

•Claiming to have over 30 mental illnesses but makes up symptoms for them (Claims her autism makes her hear stuff from miles away...)
•Just saying out loud ""That's making me horny"" or ""I wish I could jerk off right now"" constantly, making everything sexual
•Claiming she doesn't have to be a boy to be a transgender male, saying she doesn't want to be associated with men, she doesn't want to be a boy but she's totally a trans man
•Draws sexually explicit drawings of me and my friends, and sometimes even my own ocs when I repeatedly tell her not to do that to my characters, showing them off as her own after
•Says she has tourette syndrome but only remembers to tic when she wants to curse at people without seeming mean
•Touches me constantly even though I have issues with it and seeing no problem with her behaviors
•Has sympathized with and backed up the kid who sexually harassed me every day 
•Everytime I block her she texts me from a new number... And stalks my Instagram, constantly making new accounts



I tried asking her to stop and leave me alone but she won't listen and is convinced if she wants to be my friend, I have no choice. I tried talking to my teachers and guidance counselor. They moved her away from me in classes but during gym, between classes, and at lunch she can still get to me and harass me by telling me sexual things I don't want to hear and insisting matter what I do they'll never keep us apart. 

I literally have no other adult in the building left to complain to to get this to stop. She will not stop. I'm starting to have anxiety attacks literally on weekdays in general thinking about going to school because she is always harassing me. 

I don't know how to convince her to leave me alone. I don't want to hurt her feelings, no matter what she does to me. But I don't know how to get it through her thick skull that I do not like her and I am no longer comfortable being near her.",04Apr2020,1

175,"Sorry for format, grammar, etc etc I’m kinda a wreck right now and on mobile

So today I had another argument with my father about my mental breakdowns. For context these breakdowns have been happening for the better part of 3 years.


to make it short i often have mental breakdowns when my (14) brother(6) is screaming around the house, something just happens and I can’t control my emotions and anger, and this usually ends up with me in my room crying until I calm down. My parents have never once checked on me while having one and sometimes when I start yelling before going to my room to cry, my parents will laugh at me and call me Insane.

I have come to realize that it’s not my brothers fault as he is just being a kid but I still can’t control how I react in these situations, because my parents refuse to get me help or even diagnosed.

Now today I had a mini breakdown where I only got to the yelling part and then calmed down a little. After calming down however my dad decides to tell me this 

“Listen he’ll always be your brother and your gonna have a good relationship later in life, me and my sister used to argue all the time but we are so close now.”

So I tell him this “yeah but did you have mental breakdowns because of your sister?”

He responded “no I never had temper tantrums because I was mad at her”
So I tell him straight up that then he can’t compare his life to mine and that this conversation is over and how I’m done talking about it.

He as always says something along the lines of “oh my god will you calm down I’m sorry” 

His I’m sorry didn’t even sound like he meant it. So I went to my room and didn’t come out till dinner.

 Later on at dinner he said sorry but he sounded like he was annoyed at having to say it and I was done with it so I ignored him. This has happened so often that I know he doesn’t care anymore about me and if he does he does a real terrible job going about it.

I just need advice on how to get help for what ever is wrong with me mentally and how to get them to understand how when I have a mental breakdown it’s not a temper tantrum.",04Apr2020,1

178,"Long story short, a very dear friend of mine whom I have asked many advice in the past (and who took a lot of time out of a busy schedule to help me) is in need of a cross-country move due to family emergencies. This friend is very important to me, as I don't think I would be the person I am today without him, or even alive. However, to help my friend move, I need to fly up to that city, and fly back from the new city after the move (which would have at least two connections).

I am living with my SO at the same time. Traveling during the shelter-in-place order would be an irresponsible thing to do to my SO and other people vulnerable to the virus. If I go and help my friend move, I would be driving a 30-hr road trip and taking some flights. This could be potentially dangerous to my SO, and other people who I might encounter on the way.

I feel very guilty as I am indebted greatly to my friend, but at the same time I don't want to put my and my SO's health at risk, plus traveling is potentially adding extra stress on the already overwhelmed healthcare workers. I am very disappointed in myself and am not thinking straight.

What should I do?",04Apr2020,1
179,"I was an administrative professional and left my job 3 years ago. I left to spend more time with our kids while my husband developed his own company. Our kids are approaching the age where they can stay home alone now and I really want to pursue a career in fitness. Fitness has always been more of a hobby than anything. Since I was 12 I can remember taking the public transit bus to the ymca (I live in Canada) almost everyday after school. I LOVED going to the Y! Then I started running almost daily when I was in my mid teens and when I developed runners knee I stopped exercising for a while. I picked it back up again in my early 20s but this time doing classes at GoodLife. I forgot how much I just LOVE exercising. It’s my medicine. 

So now that I have time to figure out what the heck I want to do with the remainder of my life...I am honestly thinking I want to become a fitness instructor. I really think I would be great at it. But...yep here’s that damn BUT...I am freaking scared to death about it. Scared I won’t measure up, scared of failing, scared I won’t get the science that comes with learning about muscles and stretching and all the language that goes along with the fitness industry. Scared scared scared. What the hell!!! Scared of my own damn shadow. 

Can someone, anyone, relate to me and my fear of entering this industry? Especially coming from an entirely different industry previously? I am hoping for some encouragement here. I think this could be so rewarding for me, I just need that extra push. Thanks so much in advance.

TLDR: scared as heck to enter into an unknown industry of fitness, coming from administrative background. Need advice and encouragement from anyone who can relate. This could be my happiness if I just step out of my own way!!!",04Apr2020,1

181,"So. I’m a high school senior, and a few months ago a guy that graduated from my school 2 years ago slipped into my dms (pretty casual). We’ve since then been talking more and more often, and now it’s an every night thing. And it’s turned into more than a friendship??

I’ve never been in a relationship before, and so I’ve never had my first kiss or sex or anything. I wouldn’t consider myself that sexual, but I mean I do enjoy goin on the ol p0r**ub once in a while. Anyways. He’s started calling me hot and babe, and saying how he’d like to kiss me and my chest, and a few other fairly harmless things.

I think I like him back, but obviously I’ve never experienced this before and am really taken aback on what to think and how to react. So he’s saying stuff like “once this quarantine’s over I can’t wait to see you in person + some mildly sexual stuff” and although I’m excited I’m really scared too!

I trust him, but I’m so inexperienced I’m afraid I’ll embarrass myself. Btw, we compared scores on the rice purity test for fun. Mine is an 86, and his is a 19. Obviously he’s more experienced than me lol. But he seems to not mind which surprises me for some reason. Any thoughts on my situation would be very much appreciated, so thank you in advance!

Also, writing this is like therapy so I’m gonna put this out there as well. You don’t have to read it if you don’t want to. I get socially anxious easy, and find it easier to be more confident and express my ideas eloquently over text. In person, I’m more quiet and awkward. He’s pretty smart (goes to the best college in our state that I’m also going to next year) and seems to be a smooth talker. I’m afraid once we meet in person I’m gonna be a lot more lame than he expected. How do I get over this fear? 😭",04Apr2020,1
182,"To start off, I'm 19. My stepmother is fully aware of what she can and can't tell me I ""have"" to do, or at least I assume so. So recently, after being in a behavioral therapy unit because of suicidal thoughts, I thought it might be a good idea to move back in with my parents. I was sure they'd be supportive, and try to help me through what I was going through. However, as soon as I got home, I was met with glares from everyone except my father. My sister, her husband, and my stepmother all just looked at me angrily all the time. A few days after that, I was given a list of rules, the worst of which were that I was ""required"" to let my mom into all of my doctor's appointments, therapy and psychiatrist appointments included, because she thinks I'm lying about having Multiple Sclerosis and depression, and I'm also ""required"" to hand over most of my paycheck(her words, verbatim) so she could forcibly save it. Now I'm aware that they can set whatever rules they like, and if i don't like them I can leave. But even though she wants me to save up, fix my car, and leave, she won't help me get my license(I've had my permit for 2 years now, she and my father have barely tried to teach me to drive) and when I got an interview at a high paying job that's just an hour away, she all of a sudden decided that my one possible method of transportation, my father's scooter, was no longer available to me. My father tried to argue, but was quickly shot down.

But I have been feeling like my mom would rather spend time with him than be around me, and she makes everything about him. Recently I notice that she doesn’t cook dinner early like she used to, she now waits until he gets off of work and then she will cook dinner. This usually bothers me because I’m literally starving by the time he gets off of work, which is usually around 11:30 at night. She isn’t done cooking until about 12:30-1:00 at night which I think is a ridiculous time to be eating.

184,"Co worker is asking for help to establish independence from toxic mom.

A co worker of my wife and I (we work at the same restaurant) has been complaining of having issues with the relationship with his controlling mother. She prohibits independence, tells him he shouldn’t work, won’t let him get a drivers license, charges him a significant amount of money “for gas” to pick him up and drop him off at work, and then takes whatever else she feelslike for herself, etc. Your real grab bag of toxic parent behavior.

The taking of his money got so bad at one point he started buying things for other people just because he would rather spend it on others than have his mom take it from him and if he spent it on himself she would just take it and sell it to use for cigarettes and alcohol.

My wife dropped him off tonight and they had a long discussion about what has been going on and he is really struggling living in a house with a shitty mom and a lot of young kids. We convinced him to come over tommorow (and any other time he needs) to just relax with us under the condition we spend some time making him more independent so he can eventually take care of himself completely.

What I need advice on is how to prepare someone about to turn 18 how to take care of themselves and provide some independence from a toxic family.

What we are looking to do is the following:

-open up a checking account in a bank and beginning to transfer a small amount of his direct deposit there so he can build a rainy day fund and eventually have money for himself.
-Apply for a State ID
-prepare to pay some of his own bills so that he can build his own credit
-discuss a future to figure out what he wants to do so that he can eventually make his own future.

Is there anything else we should discuss or look into with the intention of teaching him things that he should know about being an adult. What other things (other than emotional support) should be talked about and brought up.

Thank you for any help!

I want to seek out a passion job this way, of making mistakes and trying again. she advises that I continue school to college and learn the basic information to be able to succeed. it's clear to me that it makes sense, but I don't care about easy or hard, I want to have a story. to inspire others that not only can you succeed even being a college dropout, but that you can do whatever you want with your life and that you don't need what people tell you you need. and I can't decide if this is the motherly trust on whether I should continue school or do things my way. in the end, all I want to do is learn through my passions, and be able to make mistakes and be happy, rather than waste a lot of my life paying off loans and focusing on money to do that. the things that make the decision hard is understanding if my mom's right because she's my mom, or if I'm right because its what I believe.

193,"Background 

I come from a low class family. My Sister graduated college a few years back and got a decent paying job right after (took out loans each year co-signed by my father). During her time working she moved w a friend to a nice apartment complex and signed a 1 year lease.

The Snowball Effect 

During the 6 months my sister was financially irresponsible (traveling, concerts, etc). She decided that she was not happy w her job and applied to 2 nursing schools (1 in state, the other out of state) the in state school is cheaper and starts the next year and the out of state is very expensive and starts the following semester. She chooses out of state and abandons her lease (6 month left and father pays for it bc she is broke). Nursing School is paid for by loans which were co-signed by parents, aunt &amp; uncle, and her boyfriend. 1 &amp; 1/2 years of rent + bills paid for by dad. I helped her with half a year of rent + bills (a couple thousand) and gave her my MacBook when her laptop broke. She was not working at the time.

Problem

Now that the COVID-19 has taken effect, she is working as a nurse and she said she most likely will be moved to the COVID-19 floor. I am concerned bc (god forbid) she gets infected something serious can happen. She has had problems with her lungs b4. I want her to know that she has a lot on her plate and not to work there and if something happens it could put a lot of ppl close to her in rough positions as well as destroy some relationships (family and boyfriend co-signed loans).

198,"I am a 22-year-old female college student who has been living about 750 miles away from my parents since freshman year of college. Because of Covid-19, my college has switched to online classes for the rest of the year and I have returned home. I live here with my 17-year-old brother and mother. My parents are divorced. My dad has a home here and in another state; he is currently waiting out the virus in the other state. 

We have been quarantined for four weeks. My mother works from home. My mother has become overbearing in the last few days. She’ll make remarks about how I eat too much junk food and I don’t eat enough of her leftovers in the fridge - for example, she refused to let me (when I say “refuse” I mean that if I had eaten the cereal, she would have screamed at me) cereal for dinner the other day because there were rice and beans in the fridge. In my opinion, we’ll be eating all of the food anyways during quarantine, so I don’t think it’s a big deal what I’m eating for each meal. In college, I typically eat whatever I’m in the mood for, and in the example above, it was cereal. 

We have not gone grocery shopping in 4 weeks and we now only have leftovers in the fridge. My mother is too scared to go to the grocery store and she keeps putting off ordering groceries to be delivered because she’s scared there will be Covid germs on them. (We live in a suburb 20 miles away from one of the largest cities in the US that has 7.6k cases). Hence, my tiredness of leftovers and turning to more unconventional meals of cereal or popcorn.

She’ll also comment on the amount of food I’m eating (“you’ve eaten too much popcorn, no more popcorn for today”). This is not her giving me health advice (she herself is overweight). For reference, I am 5’4” and 130lbs. I exercise 6 days a week, I eat relatively healthy, and I have stayed the same weight all throughout college and my last year of high school. 

What are your thoughts on this matter - should my mother be allowed to prevent me from eating certain foods or doing other activities (e.g. ordering a new cleanser from an online skincare website because I’ve run out of it and it’s not found in other drugstores) because I’m living under her roof and she is my mother? Or should I be allowed to have more independence because I am a legal adult who has lived on her own for the past four years? 

I also want to make it clear that when I say my mother is preventing me from doing things, I could do them. I could eat cereal for dinner. But she’ll end up screaming at me for about 5-10 minutes. We would often have fights when I was in high school that would end up with her screaming at me. My father has surmised that she has undiagnosed bipolar disorder. I will say she has a very short temper and I have often lied to her to ensure she does not find out the truth about something to avoid an argument. Take that as you will. 

I graduate in 1 month. People my age would be living on their own and working as early as this June. It just feels frustrating to have my independence curtailed by her to such an extreme extent considering my age and maturity level. I understand that these are extremely trying times, and that this is a very privileged issue to have, but I’m starting to lose my patience. My other close friends have very dysfunctional families and so they may not be the best people to turn to.   

TLDR: My mother is controlling and not letting me eat certain foods during quarantine. Should I speak up because of my age (22F), or listen to her because I’m living in her house?",04Apr2020,1
199,"I have this friend, let's call her R,  That i met when i was going through a really hard time a couple years ago. I won't go into details- but i lost my boyfriend, was sexually assaulted, and none of my friends believed me; i lost them over that. She was there for me a lot in the beginning, but as the friendship continued i felt that the balance was slowly deteriorating, or i was doing a lot more for her than she was doing for me. emotionally and physically. We started getting into fights, which were usually because i had done something to upset her that she held onto until she would blow up. when we fight, she gets mean- tells me I'm a bad person for a variety of reasons. She is very insecure and honestly the most socially anxious person i have ever met. I enjoyed being her friend and helping her grow but lately she has been so negative all the time i can't take it anymore. We got into a fight the other day; I didn't reply to her text messages from 4am that night but later that morning i said something in the group chat with our friends. she texted me a hostile and sarcastic text about it and i kind of lost my shit, told her my life doesn't  revolve around her and she accused me of not caring about her or other people. i started by trying to explain myself, telling her that i had just woken up and started online classwork, but she then accused me of turning on my read receipts just to piss her off? I never touch my read receipts. i don't even know if they're on or not. Well the fight escalated and she got around to accusing me of being a liar and always playing the victim. I ended the conversation by saying i didn't want to be friends with her anymore if she wasn't going to trust me or talk to me with any ounce of respect. she concluded the conversation by saying she hadn't taken her meds and it was my fault she was freaking out and that i always act like i have it worse than her.I have been thinking about it for days and reading over the texts, and i was pretty hostile from the get go- and the argument probably wouldn't  have escalated so much if i had stayed calm, but i guess i got so sick of her negativity and blaming her insecurities on me.i guess my question is- was it wrong of me? am i a bad friend? should i make amends and learn to deal with her negativity and blame until she figures herself out or was it right for me to let go.

201,"Ok reddit here we go....

So warning some themes of abuse.  

Also I’m from the UK and a boy, just so you know. Also also on mobile. Also also also be aware of my spelling and grammar which I’m sorry for. 

When I was 10 years old I moved from a public school to a private one. I moved because I was getting bullied pretty badly because was literally the gayest kid ever and I have Asperger’s syndrome (but I didn’t find that out til I was 18).

It was a very small class size about 15 when I first arrived. Being a pig-headed  10 year old and having a tendency to get erm... lost in my imagine (I was a bullshitter) didn’t make it easy to make friends. I had a few but then I became close to a boy named Andrew (not his real name). 

I also made friends with a really smart girl and another girl who was pretty toxic. We became a small group. This group was formed in the years crossing over between Year 6 and Year 7 where the class size grew from 15 to about 23. 

I was not well liked mostly because I was a dick and I was a mean dick. My friends now describe me by saying “you’re a dick but you’re never mean” which is improvement I suppose. 
This is all set up. 

Andrew and I became increasingly closer. No this doesn’t get gay. Tho I think at one point or another we both probs had feelings towards each other but were too fearful of other people’s opinions. 
Andrew had/has anger issues. Like seeing a therapist because of it. I’m not condemning that, I just want to make it known. 

Andrew would get mad, he’d kick me, punch me, call me fat (admittedly I’m rounder then some) the works. 
I am no saint in this. I was mean and petty and a dick like everyone is aged 10-14. I would call him short and he’d kick me in the balls or punch me. I never took it to that level.

This lasted a long time. Sometimes he was fine other times he really really wasn’t. 

Then a couple of things happened. In Year 10, just after I turned 15 I went on a trip to Spain with the school. The kind where you stay with a host family. The only one from my little poison pit of a friendship group was the toxic girl. 

It’s on this trip where I realised just how toxic she was. A bitch straight up and a dampener on any mood. 

I started hanging with the other people on the trip. Much to her disapproval. This trip humbled me. Is known these people for years but I always thought they’d hate me cos I was a dick to them. But it was fine. I was a lot quieter then usual and I just felt free. I felt like people could actually like me. 

When I got back a cried a lot because I knew that it meant that I would be forced back into the extremely toxic friendship group and that did happen. 

One day, we were all sitting and chatting. I made a joke and Andrew kicked me in the face. I remember my eyes doing that thing where everything flashes and goes black for a second. I was bleeding. I think my lip had burst or something like that. 
I think that’s when the class got a more direct idea of what was happening. 

I went home that night and my parents cornered me and asked me what the hell had happened. You’ve got to remember that Andrew was my best friend. I hadn’t had a best friend before. After a lot more crying I told them. They were shocked. 
My dad wanted to storm to school. My mum wanted to storm to Andrews parents (who are lovely btw). I don’t remember how but I managed to get them not too. 

Months later, my school revealed that it was going to be closing down. Angels themselves were singing. The two girls of the friendship group instantly changed to another school and I saw a chance. 
I broke things off with Andrew. I didn’t speak to him ever, just stared straight ahead and ignored him if he tried to talk to me. He got the message. 

Eventually we spoke and he asked for one more chance and I said no. 
And that was it we weren’t friends anymore. 

At a parents evening, my mum and form tutor had a conversation where they both seemed to admit that things had gone to far a long time ago. It made me wonder how much the school was actually aware of my situation. 

So the school closed down and most of the students including Andrew went to another nearby private school for our final year of high school (Year 11, I was 15/16). I remember being sat in that hall and seeing Andrew come into the hall and sitting down with the year 10s. My heart soared because I was free. I was free. 

Then I was angry. For a really really long time. My walls were built up so high that in this new found freedom, I still had massive trouble making friend. 

I was bitter and easily angered and just mean. To everyone. I tried to let that anger go. I spoke to Andrew briefly to clear the air a bit, I apologised to him. But he then tried to just come up and talk to me casually which was a big NO. 

College came (aged 16/17/18) and I found a new friend group. I met my best friend from these years. He wasn’t really part of the group I was in. Which was probably a good thing. Because of my self-doubt, lack of empathy, still trying to get to grips with ‘being social’ and my walls still being too high, I caused that friendship to hate me and that’s my fault. I have a pretty smooth relationship with them now but things are still a bit rough. 

Now we get to university. In first year I said that I wasn’t going to be that person anymore. I’ve made friends that I hope to last me for life now. I’m currently at the end of my third year and have plans to do a masters. 

Part way through my second year I got a message from Andrew. It read as follows: 

Andrew : Hey this Is very odd and out of the blue but I just wanna say I'm sorry. The day you came up to me and said u where sorry I was over the moon but didn't have the balls to say you dont need to apologise. I was happy that we where mates but we never talked and never looked at each other again even when we where ok again and I recently just been thinking of how much of a dick I was to you and i wanna say sorry for what i did and sorry that it took so long for me to say this... Your life now looks amazing and I hope it carries on being amazing cos you where a true best mate and thank you for sticking with me for as long as u did considering my life is worse now I think you where defo better off without me as much as I hate to say back then I was just a dick to you but that mostly because I didn't really know how else to show my happiness for having u as a mate as since we stopped talking I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression along with other shit and life is overall not good but enough of me im here too say sorry and I now we pribs wont talk again as we have both moved on a lot with out lives but would be nice maybe to catch up one time idk we don't have to at all but ye anyway sorry

I didn’t reply. He then sent.

Andrew : Anyway Ye emm I guess have a good life?!

I semi popped off.

Me:  You understand that I’m trying to process this. We haven’t spoken in literal years and you continuing to pop up throws me. I need time to decide what to do to next, which might be not speaking to you again, so just wait

Andrew: Ye okai sorry just last time we spoke i thought we where ok again mb sorry i assumed sommet i shouldnt off anyway ye sorry again

Me: I just need time. 

These messages were sent in November 2018.  Then in the August 2019. Bare in mind I haven’t sent him any messages at this point. 

Andrew: Hey, I want to end it on good terms if it has to be ended as I know it's too late to most likely be friends again or mates, but for myself I just want to know that we ended it on good terms as your a good guy and I treated you wrongly and it just took me too long to see how wrong I was. Sorry.

Now I had already been considering asking what I did next so I replied. 

Me: I’m throwing a party a small one just my friends from uni probably on the 13th of sept and believe or not I was considering inviting you. To be clear this isn’t me saying let’s be bestest buddies again and it’s not even me saying friends but if you want to come to that and actually meet and speak and things then you’re welcome to.

Andrew: Oh ye sure I'll see if I'm free and yeh that's fine I'm not expecting it to be just wanted it to be good terms if that makes sense but ye thank you

Me: Ok then

Andrew: If you don't mind me asking what made you think of inviting me? You don't have to say if you don't wanna talk or anything I don't mind

Me: I been thinking about meeting you for quite a while. I was placement for three weeks in (old school) a month back and I hope between (the place that I am from) and (the place where I go to university) all the time. Now Inviting you to the party would be because it’s in my house and all of friends would be there and there’d be alcohol lots of it. So it’s where I’d be most comfortable

Andrew: Fair enough anyway It was nice hearing from you not saying I'll be able to come but hopefully I can as would be nice to see you and have a catch up or just simply talk

I ended up uninviting him from the party. I decided I didn’t want what I predict would be a very heavy conversation dragging down the mood but I made it clear that I still wanted to meet. 

I tried twice to meet but each time he turned me down or just didn’t turn up.

The last time I spoke to was in September 2019. It’s now March 2020. I know that I still want to talk to him. He seems remorseful about it. I want him to know that I don’t hold a grudge anymore (because that basically destroyed me). 

To be clear he’s never going to be my friend again. Never. He doesn’t get that privilege. But I want to be able to fully close this in my head. 
I’m still cold at times, I can still be blind to other people’s feelings. But i always say sorry. I’ve tried so hard to be better. 

I want a final meeting. So I can let all of this stuff inside of me go. 

So I guess what I’m asking you reddit is, is this a good idea?",04Apr2020,1
202,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. All of these things happened from August-March by the way.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",04Apr2020,1

209,"So. The other day I was reflecting on a lot of stuff and the the thought of one of my closest friends came to mind. This person and I have had a lot of blow outs before hand. Most of the time what ever, we moved on and went about our shit like friends normally do.. 

Latley, all it seems this person wants to do is just sit around the house, not have a job(hasn't had one in about 2.5 years and does not have a GED((highschool diploma equivalent)), smoke weed and get mad at the world when they're out of weed and always ask me to either give them money(keep in mind, just got laid off myself due to COVID-19) or smoke them up with my personal stash of weed and this person doesnt seem to understand why I cut them from my life when they have 0 self drive or motivation to better themselves and do something with their life.

211,"Is anyone else who has a parent(s) working as essential healthcare workers on the front lines literally strapped with daily anxiety and panic attacks like i am?? 

My mom is working front lines in Detroit and we are getting hit hard. One of her close co-workers passed away, we have family and friends who are all falling extremely ill, it’s petrifying to think that she or my dad might be next to get sick. They’re both healthy and in their early and mid 50s, my mom has no underlying health issues and my dad has asthma, but aside from that they’re technically low risk. My sister and i (18 &amp; 21 f) aren’t my worry right now because we’re as low risk as it can get. 

However i can’t help but think daily about them getting so sick they end up in the ICU or worse, having visions of what could happen. Am i just putting energy out there that will come back to haunt me and my family?? Or am i just magnifying reality??

212,"Hi, all! This may be a long post but I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. 

This post is about my mom, whom I love more than anything but there are some things that have happened in our relationship that are still unresolved. I didn't have the best childhood, I have trauma from my childhood and because of that my development is/was stunted. So, in many ways, I am very child-like even as a 22-year-old. 

For as long as I could remember, she was always looking for love in men and as a result of that, I had men in and out of my life. Some were abusive, some were just assholes and some did some extremely inappropriate things. Well, she just recently got out of a relationship with someone who lived with us and was very toxic &amp; abusive. Well, she made him move out but still talks to him.

Not only that but she also started talking to someone else that she knew from high school. And now she's on the phone about 10 hours a day. That's not the problem. The problem is as a child I always felt like she tried to replace us with a man. She drops everything, will put us on the back burner when she finds a new man. It's like the world revolves around him and because of that, I would feel like a low priority in comparison to her man. I've really never been able to have my mom as just my mom without a man.

Now, if we're just talking and he calls she will answer with no regard to me. I've talked to her about it, but not much has changed. 

I should also mention that she feels a lot of guilt about what has happened in my childhood even though I forgive her. However, due to her guilt, I've held a lot of my feelings in, to keep her from feeling bad. It's starting to weigh a lot on me now because I feel like I can't be honest with her.

I'm sure this may sound childish, but this goes much deeper than what I can say here. But, am I being too sensitive or unrealistic? And how can I express my feelings to my mom without her getting defensive or hurt? 

Thanks!",04Apr2020,1

218, 19 M So there is this girl who I’ve wanted to fuck for sooo long. She used to be an old friend of mine around sophomore year of high-school and I knew there was always some sort of sexual tension or flirtatious manners that would happen between us well me and my friends stopped talking to her in high school and she got very distanced from me and my friends. She was pushed out bc she was very clingy and hard to be around sometimes. But I’ve recently gotten extremely enticing fantasies about her some time later. So about 2 years later I texted her to smoke and she pulled up and I was super high and horny but I didn’t smash. She then later sent me nudes and I’ve wanted to fuck her more ever since. So now nearly 3 years later I asked to h/u with her and she said “yeah sure” and is sending me nudes again. I really want to smoke and smash her but idk if my friends would find out and if they did I would never hear the end of it. Advice??,04Apr2020,1
219,"It just feels stupid. I have no job. I can pay rent this month. Possibly next month if those stimulus checks come out. I just found out about unemployment so maybe I can get that but I see like a lot a lot a lot of people applied for that and I don’t if that affects anything.

Say this thing lasts a while. In the beginning I was down to look for a new job especially thinking 
It’d be easy because groceries, or anywhere that’s essential and all you need is a high-school degree, are hiring in mass because people need stuff. But I’m looking into this stuff more and more and honestly I’m fucking spooked, terrified. I’m starting to get some serious anxiety going around because people still go outside for leisure and crowd areas and grocery stores, at least near me, are still fairly stuffed.

I’m going online like is it fine for me to be afraid right now if I were to be going to a job with a fuck load of people and it seems my fears are pretty valid. It doesn’t ease my mind in the slightest that this thing has an incubation period that can be as long as two weeks. It’s pretty confirmed by deaths you can die from it at any age. My immune system is not known to be strong. I’m not immuno compromised but I get a lot of colds throughout the year. I don’t have insurance so I wouldn’t go to the hospital but I could die if I don’t so I’d potentially be playing the debt lottery ticket.

I recognize I need shelter and food. There’s a few other bills I need to pay. But my god I’m questioning a lot if it’s all worth my life. I’ve never had pneumonia. I don’t want to have pneumonia, let  alone a more severe version. I was homeless and very reluctant to join any sort of military. This feels like I’m signing myself up to the front lines for minimum wage. And I see some people have their hours cut so I may not even get full time.

I just imagine I’m working. I’m doing my part to stay clean then boom I’m hit with the virus. Every groan and moan I’m wondering if I’ll live or die. I’ll most definitely regret working that day. My small apartment won’t matter. Those sketchers I bought and put in storage to wear in the spring won’t matter. The job definitely does not matter. And for sure the direct deposit cash of a few hundreds do not matter because my life is on the line. But it all mattered when it wasn’t. I respect everyone continuing to work because the economy for some reason doesn’t stop so we can’t stop. But I just turned 19. I barely have any family I talk to if any at all. I have no children to take care of. I’m a depressed suicidal who still wants to live. And I don’t know if this sounds absurd but in my case none of this seems to be more important than my life. Than seeing tomorrow.

Even before today any day from the moment I was born I could’ve died. Hell I’ve had near death experiences. But chances were so slim. And the chances are not slim right now. It’s not the virus itself that scares me it’s just like you can die from this. And people are dying, it freaks me out. I don’t know if I should look for a job. I’d feel like a fool if I did. I’d feel like a fool on the nursing bed. I’d feel like a fool everyday purposefully putting myself out there for some money. Some paper.

For the economy to live on it’s necessary for a few of us to go to the promised land if there is one. It just doesn’t seem worth it, maybe I value my life too much, I don’t know.

I’d feel different if I was doing this and things to help people out. I’m sacrificing myself to help another but in this case I’m doing this to help myself by also not helping myself. It’s a lose lose situation but one loss has possible sickness and death in it.

TL:DR I live alone, I have bills to pay, food to put into my mouth. If this virus goes on longer do I cave risking my life and find an essential job. Or wait it out some more with risking my money but not putting my health at risk.",04Apr2020,1

223,"First and foremost: Yes, minors having sex get all fucking christian about it. My parents are fine with it, on my end and my parents responsibilities are taken care of.

My brother M15 likes having sex with his F14 girlfriend and they LOVE being loud. They do it at home when everyone is home and as far as they know, also awake. His bedroom is directly upstairs but not a separate room. Its like a loft, his mom has called it. 

His gfs sounds, as much as I despise slut shaming people, are very obviously fake. They are loud, annoying, and stop when theyre done having sex. (Not normal, as traditional sex is done when the guy is done.) Shes doing it to boost his ego, i get it, i understand, im also a sexually active teen. BUT I AM NOT LOUD, LET ALONE WHEN THERE ARE CONSCIOUS AND PRESENT PEOPLE. 

The walls are very thin, and I cannot turn anything up super loud to ""cover it"" as im a light sleeper, so during my sleeping hours its annoying. Even when I'm awake, we have apartment neighbors and I get headaches and overly stimulated when stuff is too loud like that. 

Every other site ive checked and advice is related to adults. ""Let them be loud!"" Or ""do [insert something i cannot do, like leave the house or play loud music].""  I have told my brother to stop, everyone has commented on it, and not only does my brother seem proud, but he's correlated it with his dick size. (Which is funny, considering the main origin of womanly sex noises is to show enjoyment in an exaggerated manner, or to please the man.)

229,"I'll explain my situation. 
First of all, I'm 25. 
I had a different upgrading wasnt close to my parents growing up but we get along now. I moved out of home at 16 (3 hours away) and moved back at 18 when I got pregnant with my now 6 year old. I havent lived with my parents since other than a couple short stays while waiting to move into a new place. I also have a 3 and 2 year old son. 
I have a history with drugs from 15-18. I got clean when I was 21 and just recently starting using again, however I'm now a week clean and plan to stay clean. I've had no desire to use since my last use. 
My children are currently staying with my parents. They took them in November 2019. I had a breakdown, to keep it short. 
Now, I'm feeling back to myself, I miss my children more than anything and I just want to be home with them.
I am a great mother! People can judge that's fine, I know the whole truth! 
Now this part, my grandparents have always been way to involved and opinionated when it comes to my children, especially my daughter. They have never respected me as a parent and listened to my rules. It's getting to the point where it's a bit overbearing. I need room to breath, to figure out who I am as a parent and as a woman. I know they mean well but I just need space. 
I've already talked to my mom and they are looking for a place after covid, they took over my lease as they were living out of town and wanted to be in town for sometime before, anyways I will then take my apartment back. 
When the lease is up, I want to move. 
We live in a smaller city, it's nice but there are a lot of drugs here and for me bad memories and feeling like I cant move on from who I was ... 
I cant go far my boys visit their dad every other weekend. 
I was thinking about a bigger city about 2 hours away. 
I'm conflicted. I know the move would be good for me. However, all my support is here. My parents and my grandparents. It makes life easier with three young children, and they all love my children to bits and I'm sure they would all be hurt if I moved and they couldn't see them as often. 
I know I can take care of my kids and I just want to be able to feel independent and like I'm living my own life and building my own future..... 
My family likes to gossip about everyone and are very judgemental. 
I'm so conflicted, I dont know if I should just stay here and have my family close by or move a couple hours away and be on my own. I know Its my life and my kids, I just dont know how to deal with all of the backlash I'm going to get from my family about taking my kids away from everyone. Especially after everything my parents have done for me. I will say again, they didnt completely uproot, they were wanting to move before everything happened.

The older I get, the more I see how much he's ruined the rest of the family. I want so badly to blame him for all of this because every single problem in our family, I can trace back to him. Im just so tired of it.

I have blown up at him before. I've said so many things along the lines of ""old bum"" and ""self centered and egotistical idiot"" (I would never curse) and I do regret it momentarily. But, as soon as he starts up with ""Im only paying this for rent because you didnt give me this money when I wanted it"" or ""why dont you act like my sister? She cared for us at age 11 and got married at age 14 and was a good woman"" I blow up. Im at my wits end and my fuse is getting shorter and shorter.

When I was little, I loved him more than anybody. I idolized him. He was my dad, and he was always seen as the one who was always around. Turns out it was because my mom worked for us to stay afloat. He was kinder back then, or at least to my perception he was. I never heard the fights, the screaming, or the cursing I hear now. Over time, I started to realize that my mom has been dealing with too much from him, and is on the verge of breaking down. The straw that broke the camel's back was when my mom suffered a stroke. She had gone to the hospital, lost feeling in her right arm, and was admitted for a night. The day she came back, no remorse from my dad was given. He acted like it was all a con to get my mom some time off from work to lay around. I was absolutely furious that he would treat her that way. I cant remember exactly was I said on my tirade, but its was along the lines of ""You're never gonna stop until she's dead huh? What are you gonna do when your teenage daughter suffers a stroke too from dealing with you? Are you gonna treat me like a housewife no matter how sick I get? You have absolutely no sympathy.""

I've made attempts to get to him despite the pent up rage from that point on. I try so hard to get him to understand why we cant keep letting him blow 1/2 of his check on bingo and expect my mom to bail him out when he needs cigs or wants to go to bingo again. Or why its unfair that Im forced to act like an adult and budget our entire family just for him to ignore me. We are in no way poor, but his antics are driving us down a hole that when, not if, we get into a bad situation, we will be flat broke. Everyday it gets so much worse, from calling me and my mom ""old hag"" or ""b*tches"" when we disagree. Me and my mom have clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression, hers much worse than mine. Its a never ending cycle of torment for her. This family is in absolute shambles, and with the current problems in the world it's escalated.

With me considering why I may be an issue, I do have a touch of sympathy for him. I know his parents never treated him right, he was disabled at a young age, and has kids that are old enough be my parents. He has a good side and I know it. I try to get him to enjoy life since we all know he hasn't got much left, whether its painting, talking about his childhood, or even just letting him talk. I dont know whats wromg with him. One minute he's looking at me like im the most important person ever and the next he's threatening to ""sell me off"". He has so many medical issues and it almost makes me cry to know he's gonna spend the last good years of his life angry and in pain. He wont listen to me, the doctor, my mom, or any of his other children. I am no saint either. I feel im slowly gaining his viewpoints and anger, and it's hurting everything around me. Ive been having terrible episodes of pure rage at small things and have had tensions migraines for the past few weeks from everything building up. 

I just want some advice. Either help for myself if theres no way to change him, or help for him directly. We cant afford a therapist, so the most logical option is out of the ballpark.",04Apr2020,1
236,"About a month before our quarantine my friend and I got into a huge fight and entirely stopped talking. She was out of my life in a flash and I didn't know how to properly cope. Going from driving to her house for 5 hours after school and hanging out nearly every weekend to nothing at all so suddenly was a huge shock to my system. What really stung was that she started hanging out with someone new, the same way we normally did, the very next day. And two weeks later she started dating him.

Being totally honest, I have more than liked her for the past two years. I would never tell her that because I don't want to ruin anything, but it hurt so much to see her dating someone other than me. I kept telling myself that feeling jealous was understandable, but that I had to distance myself from her to give myself some time to process this before we talked again. But no matter how hard I tried I had to see them together in class and in the halls, walking by while she outwardly ignored me. Our friendship has always been more important to me than any other feelings I may have, so watching my friend fade away hurt the most.

That's why when quarantine started for me it seemed to be a blessing in disguise. Sure it was for a truly devastating reason, and I knew that I would quickly come to resent it (rip prom and graduation), but I was able to see the bright side of finally being able to properly distance myself from her and spend time on myself. For three weeks I learned some new things about digital art. I picked up my fancy camera I was gifted however long ago. I went on walks? I was never the type to go out and do that. Sure it got boring at times, but I finally had time to focus on myself.

That is, until I got my first text from her in two months:

""I know this is a bad question to ask during this period but is there any chance I could stay with ur family for some time?""

I said yes without hesitation. She had refrained from asking to stay over in the past under very serious circumstances, so I knew it had to be even more serious this time around. My dad has diabetes, my mom has blood pressure issues, and I have lung problems, so it was a huge risk for all of us considering we live in what's considered a ""disaster area"". I begged and begged them to let her over, despite her having parents that are continuing to work throughout the pandemic, because I knew she wouldn't have asked if it wasn't serious. My mind was blank of our fight, focusing only on making sure that she was okay. They eventually caved and said yes.

I still love her, even through this fight. And not in a romantic way, more in a way that she is one of the best, most important people in my life. Which is why I also said yes with hesitation when she asked if she could live with us. Being that we're in a bad area of the pandemic and my parents won't let her out of the house, we're gonna be stuck together under one roof until college, so at least 5 months (that's assuming fall classes aren't online, which it's looking like they're going to be).

We drove to her house where she had an explosive argument with her parents, threw all her stuff into a few bags, and said goodbye to her cats before we drove away. We haven't talked about it since except for taxes and other various practical reasons, but I can tell it's eating away at her. I know for certain that she hasn't told anyone about how she's feeling in all this. Knowing she's a private person by nature I haven't pried, but I can't help but feel that there are things I can be doing to help her our more. She misses the Korean food she's always eat, but I can't help with that because I can't go to H-Mart. She misses her cat but everyone in my house is allergic. She clearly misses her room, but she can't go back for the same reasons she left.

I know that just giving her a place to stay could be considered ""enough"", but I feel like I'm falling short in a million different ways -- both with her and myself. So this all boils down to two main points:

(1) Any advice on how I could help her feel better? It could be as simple as activity recommendations (she loves Korean food and loves to bake) to advice from people who have had to move in with friends themselves -- or anything in-between. I mean it when I say anything helps!

(2) Any advice on what I should do to get over this whole situation now that I'm going to be living with her? Again, anything helps.

Feel free to answer one or both questions, and if you don't I hope you enjoyed reading my story anyways (it's my first time using reddit)! I hope all of you and your loved ones are healthy and continue to be so.",04Apr2020,1

239,"Last year, I had just gotten my period. At that time, I didn’t know how to put a pad on correctly, so my mom would always fuss at me about that. We ended up going to Walmart, and I had to change. She was demonstrating how to put a pad on, which I didn’t pick up. Couple minutes later, she started pulling my arm, and started yelling at me. There were also two other women in the restroom, who were looking throughout the crack of the stall. I told her, because I was embarrassed. I truly was. She said, “They have the same damn thing as you,” and proceeded to pull my arm again. After we’ve both left out the stall, I was embarrassed, yet shook. The two women looked at me as I walked past them, with tears streaming down my face. 

To make things better, she ended up switching up the story. Calling me a “big baby,” and yet, come to think about it, I didn’t receive an apology from her. Just laughs? As if, I deserved it. I was clueless, so it’s like, it wasn’t my fault. 

But, every since then, shit hasn’t gotten any better for me. All my mom does is speak down on me, while she brags about my sister, who is older than me. To cut shit short, I hate it here. Truly do. Lmao.

240,"I have no idea who I am anymore. I haven’t for a while, basically since my senior year of undergrad. A close friend of mine offered me a place in her apartment after her 4th roommate graduated and moved out. I moved in and everything was fine for a few days. After a while though the close friend decided out of the blue that she didn’t trust me, and accused me of talking behind her back with one of the other roommates. I found out soon after that she had been talking behind my back and lying to my face, which was why she decided she couldn’t trust me (because she knew I couldn’t trust her). I lived with them the rest if the year. One roommate got weird as fuck stole our food and didn’t talk to us, and the close friend and the other roommate talked shit behind my back while the close friend constantly picked at everything I did and said. I knew she wanted some big dramatic blow-up so she could play the sympathy card with other people and have more shit to talk behind my back. So I didn’t do anything about it and just let it happen until I moved out then phased out contact with them.

My issue now is, at some point, I completely fucking forgot who I was. There was a lot of accusations of “copying her” from the close friend. She picked at my intelligence constantly (we had similar majors). She cock blocked the fuck out of me, and would physically place herself between me and the people I was talking to at parties. She was controlling as hell and I don’t know why but I have forgotten who I am. I have no idea anymore. Every time I do classwork I think of how she would criticize my effort and pick at my intelligence. Every time I talk to other people she’s there mad at me for drawing attention to myself. Every time I do something creative she’s in my brain telling me I’m copying her (she was a big art person).

243,"Hi, so I (F19) am just finishing up my first year of university, and I’m coming to realize that after everything I’ve experienced this year, girls are actually really pretty. I’m not 100% sure how I swing yet but I’m pretty sure it’s not only one way. Anyways, the dilemma I’m in is that I’ve been in a loving long distance relationship with my boyfriend for just about two and a half years (we’re talking Canada-Hawaii long distance). I know I should probably tell him how I’m feeling, and I’ve always felt like I can tell him anything, but I’m scared he’ll think he’s not good enough or that I don’t want him anymore, when that’s just not the case. I have a lot of love to give and I think I’ve been afraid to explore this side of myself due to being brought up in a very conservative community. I don’t want him to take it the wrong way or think I love him any less or want somebody else instead of him.

244,"Didn't feel like this should go in r/relationships because we're not exactly in a relationship but anyways, some background.

Me and this girl dated back in 2016-17 and we had a weird break-up but I thought she hated me afterward and didnt want anything to do with me. I was never really able to get over her, I still had feelings for her, but I mostly moved on.

Fast forward to this year and I am just getting out of a year-long relationship with another girl when she hits me up over Facebook to apologize about the way the break-up went. We start chatting, start flirting a little bit, and then she admits to me that she still has feelings for me after all this time, and that she never hated me at all, it was just a complicated break-up for her involving personal stuff. So we end up meeting a few times, and I learn that she's in the process of going through a divorce after she caught her husband cheating on her. Since they're seperated, we make out and spend a night together and everything seems really good. In fact things feel better than they did even when we were dating. We both agree that since neither of us are really in a position to get into a full-on relationship right now that we'd keep it casual but intimate for a bit. It's a situation that I had always dreamed about but never imagined that it would actually happen.

Cut to a week and a half later and I'm in another state because of Covid-19 and we've been texting on and off since I left, when suddenly she just completely stops replying to my messages. I worry that she's gotten sick or that something else bad happened, and even message her that i was concerned. When I go onto her twitter a few days later, it turns out she just took a break from social media for a couple of days and is back to using it as normal. However, she continues to ignore my previous messages. Even when I just casually sent her a funny post on twitter she completely ignored it. And I know she did because she commented on other tweets after I sent her the post, so there were time-stamps. She hasn't blocked me or anything, she's only ignored me.

I'm really hurt and worried. This is a girl that I really want back in my life and I wish she'd just communicate what's going on or something instead of ignoring me. She's not the kind of person that would lie about if her feelings remained for me, and I feel like she was and is genuine. And I don't think it's about her ex-husband, because while we were texting she tried again with him, found that he was cheating again, and then kicked him out of the house. But I also can't help but wonder. I just need some advice about what to do or what not to do.",04Apr2020,1

246,"(Sorry if this isnt the right sub? My friend said to post things for advice here so!) Let me explain; i'm 17, and my dad, the parent i live with, never enrolled me in high school, not even online school. I've always liked school due to a horrible home life, but now i havent gone in i dont know even? 3 years? I cant remember honestly. 
The reason he didnt enroll me is a little complex. I was abused pretty bad when i was very young. Due to that, i had very obvious behavioral symptoms of abuse for a long time, and i still struggle with them due to people not realizing its abuse symptoms and demonizing these things, making me hate myself for them. Things as simple as anger even, so id often hold it in until it exploded because i was just taught to hate being angry, and that i was absolutely garbage for doing it. 
Hes used that to his advantage, by saying those werent abuse symptoms! I just had mental disorders! I was always too terrified to speak against it, so i never really pretended i had any mental disorder, nor did i actively stand against it. He would convince my teachers that oh, all our money was going into therapy for me, and for medication, etc. Hed somehow throw together such a sob fest, theyd feel guilty, and suddenly would give me trash bags full of new clothes purely because he was too lazy to just buy me some. Then it bit him in the butt when the education board sent me to a school for kids who arent mentally well enough to be in school, usually due to extreme mental issues the schools cant handle. After a while, i got to go back to normal school, and i sas going to be put back into a normal high school!!!! And then my dad found out they wanted to put me in a classroom for the kids who have such bad mental problems they cant do school work, all they do is go on field trips. My dad thought i was too smart for that and instead of talking to them about it, didnt enroll me at all! 
Obviously this can effect my future incredibly bad, especially when i dont actually have any mental disorders. I cant disprove any mental disorders because my dad not only doesnt believe in doctors, but he got a new job recently where the insurance isnt available for the first 3 months, which is amazing for this pandemic. I cant get a job even because i need my social security card; but for that i need a school id and my school records (according to my dad at least)
I want to save my future, and i want to better myself. I just dont know where to go or how to start. What do i do?",04Apr2020,1

250,"I first met her (let's call her Joana) at school 3 years ago when we first started 8th grade(we are in the same class by the way) and at first I didn't feel anything towards her at that time. But as time went on we became close friends, started spending more time with each other in school, hugging every time we meet, going out together. She started sharing personal stuff with me and even kissed my cheek a couple of times. Going back to those moments makes me think that she had something for me then, but ,of course, I was stupid enough not to do anything about it.

It continued that way until I realised I have strong feelings towards her in the beginning of the summer holiday after 9th grade. For one reason or another we ended up not being able to see each other for the whole duration of it even though we both wanted to. During that time the I was constantly thinking of finally meeting her and making a step forward to forming a relationship with her.

So the holiday was almost over and we decided to meet the day before school strated. After hugging me for a minute straight and explaining how much she had missed me she said that she had found a boyfriend. I pretended to be happy for her, but boy it hurt like hell. Of course, her bf happened to be the classic jerk with shaved head and a total of two brain cells who treated her like shit all the time. I fucking hated that guy. Their relationship lasted till a month before the end of the school year when he told her he didn't love her anymore and broke up with her. I made everything in my power to make her feel better and it felt like we had never been that close to each other before. But then school ended and I didn't get to see her for about a month after because we had to go on family holidays and stuff. 

One evening she called me and said that she had gotten back together with that guy and explained how happy she was about it. As you can probably tell, that hit me hard into the feelings once again. I decided that I don't want to be pussy anymore since it doesn't even matter at that point and texted her the next day. I told her what I felt towards her and that I knew she doesn't feel the same way about me. She said that she didn't want me to feel bad and that she wanted us to remain friends. And so we did.

That didn't make me feel much better and I felt really fucking bad for the next two ot three months but then I met another girl and thinking that an eventual relationship would help me forget the shit I was going through, I started dating her and we got together pretty soon after. I was hoping that with time I would develop feelings for her but that never happened. On top of that Joana broke up with her bf very soon after i got into that relationship and I knew for a fact that she and the girl I was dating didn't like each other at all. I broke up with that girl about two months after we became a couple. During that time Joana acted like she was very close to me and that made me think she had finally started seeing as more than just a friend. But as soon as I ended my relationship, her behaviour went back to normal. 

I soon realized that it was all just false hope and decided that the only way to move on with my life is to just stop any communication with her. I called her and told her just that, she started crying and said that she understood and admired my decision, that she loved me(as a friend) and that she will always be there for me. That happened 3 weeks before the quarantine shit popped up and we haven't talked since. 

Sadly, not being able to communicate with her is even more painful than being just friends with her. And now that I'm locked indoors I can't help but think about her all the time and I'm not sure if I made the right decision. I know that I have to move on and forget about her but I really really love her and have never been more frustrated in my life.

What should I do?

251,"Hello All, 

I know this may seem stupid to some, but I need guidance.. but first I must give you some background information about myself. If you stay and read everything I would appreciate any and all advice, constructive criticism and anything in between from you. 

I left the military in 2014. I struggled to find a job. I had one job that paid $14 an hour but I hated it. It had no room for advancement and I wasn’t passionate enough about what I was doing so I left. So for more than a year and a half I was unemployed minus the time I was in a dead end job. That was, until I found a job in gear manufacturing. I joined that field in September of 2015 making $13 and hour with zero experience, but having a family I knew this was my opportunity to do something great. So I worked my a$$ off and learned as much as I could as fast as I could. By 2016 I was programming setting up and operating many machines. By 2017 I was a supervisor for second shift. And in November of 2018 I got the promotion of a lifetime. I was promoted to high level management. I had a leader who believed in me and gave me this opportunity without a college degree or really any experience in management. 

Since then I have improved our on time delivery and sales quarterly, monthly, and yearly. We went from around 70% on time delivery to this year in the 90s. I have had everyone I work with on management tell me how successful I will be. How “bright of a future” I have. And I see it. I get it. But I don’t feel it. 

Overall, I’m not happy. I know it’s selfish for me to say. I have an opportunity in front of me most people would kill for. I’m not even thirty yet, and I’ve jumped over many of my friends who went to college to do the same thing I’m doing now. I know all that and I feel terrible for not being happy about it. Don’t get me wrong I’m very happy for the opportunity, I thank god all time for this. Even just for the opportunity to support my family, but something is missing. 

What I’m asking is if anyone has experience with rising quickly and much faster than you expected, how did you handle it? I feel like I’m at a wall and I need to break through it. How did you break through that wall? Maybe it’s the stress of the job or my inexperience, or my self doubt. I want to do a good job. I don’t want to go on a decline. How do you keep the energy up for this demand of this kind of job?

I don’t know where else to turn and I don’t feel like most people will understand where I coming from. So please, if anyone has any advice or guidance I would love to hear from you. I don’t want to screw this up. 

Thank you so much...",04Apr2020,1

My insecurities have been around ever since middle school - I am in college now.  I used to constantly worry about my appearance.  But once I started to wear makeup, it felt like guys would aproach me more.  Being noticed was probably the most therapeutic thing for my confidence.  

I've tried to stop wearing as much makeup because I want people to see what I really look like.  I want to feel pretty without making it artificial to others.  Also, I hate the fact that I look 10X worse without my glasses on.  I could list a huge list of my insecurities, which is extremely worrisome to me.  

My low self esteem is affects my daily life sometimes.  It used to be that I couldn't leave the house without makeup but now I don't care so much.  However, I have an unhealthy need to have at least some makeup on when I spend time with my friends.   No one outside my family has ever seen my bare face.

I did see it, in fact, i put that paper on the desk in the computer room, however for some reason i said no. I don't know why, but i did. After that i just went to the room, picked up the paper and gave it to my dad saying that i found it.
When i was attending school some months back, my friend asked me if i put a specific answer to some test. I said yes when in reality, i didnt!
Same thing happens when somebody asks me if i had seen something, i say no when i did saw that something, i don't know why i lie without reason, i don't wanna hurt people, nor do i want to be such a lying friend.

260,"I'll start this from the very beginning, back in grade school I had feelings for a girl my friend was dating, but respected him and just kept things cool with this girl who I'll call ""Jane"" for anonymity. Jane ended things with my friend shortly after graduation and I didn't really know how to talk to her about it as I actually had a girlfriend at the time who was very jealous. Going in to grade 9 my dad was diagnosed with cancer and my girlfriend was a total bitch and didn't care for me at all. All she would do is complain I wasn't calling her enough as we were in a long distance relationship; but Jane  began talking to me more personally as she heard what was going on. We got a little closer during this time and she actually told me as nicely as possible that I should take a break or end things with my bitchy gf. I didn't listen because she was my first kiss and I was blinded by ""love"" if you could even call it that. Now going into grade 11, my dad ended up recovering fully, only losing his taste. My gf had dumped me somewhere at the end of grade 9 for some other guy and to put another nail in the coffin, Jane was now dating another guy. Every time she had an issue with him I would help her destress and just talk her out of being upset out angry (even though the things he did were wrong, I didn't want to ruin a relationship for my wellbeing). We would play volleyball each day at lunch and would always talk about pretty intimate things, but since my semester ended, we aren't in the same classes anymore an due to Covid-19 we don't see eachother at all. We are as far apart as ever and I haven't spoke to her at all for at least a month. I can't stop thinking about her and just this week she broke up with her boyfriend of 1.5 years! I'm sorry for her but also very happy at the same time as I've liked her for years. She ended up texting my friend about it and he told me as he knows about how I feel. I want to talk to her so badly (over text) but I'm just so bad at talking to girls. I don't know how to start the convo as I don't know if my friend was supposed to tell me. I know I should wait to tell her how I feel of course but I want to get close and when the time is right ask her or tell her. What should I do and how do I start talking to her?",04Apr2020,1
261,"So i (F15) have been talking to this girl online(F14)[ lets call her Alex] for about a year, we've met through a mutual friend [ lets call her Jade] (I knew her in real life). Me and jade eventually stopped talking since she moved away, not relevant to the story. Anyways, so me and Alex met through her. We've video called a few times and i feel like i can be myself when i talk to her. And we were joking around and she flirted with me. And i asked her if she liked me and she said she did. I dont think i have a crush on her, but i was getting incredibly flustered due to the fact that she was flirting with me. I know i shouldnt rush into this, and she understands that it might be abit for me to realize if i want to date her or just stay as friends. We have a plan to move closer together whenever we get out of school ( 3/4ish years) but considering how young we are im scared that we wont stay in touch. I dont know what to do because i know it'll most likely end with us breaking up even if we try, if we try to be in a relationship. I dont know what to do but i know i want to try because she is one of my best friends and i cant really be as open with anyone else as i can with her. Im sorry if this is some stupid teenage bs with an obvious answer, but stuff like this is big for me even if it doesnt seem big for other people. Any answers would be great :)",04Apr2020,1
262,What do I do when my friend is telling me that she is cutting herself?,04Apr2020,1
263,"SOS!!! (Not sure if this belongs here or on a wedding thread, Long read, but please, I need advice!) 
For some context here, my wedding is OCT this year, and she committed to being my MOH AUG. 2019. 
Late NOV. she called me and told me she thought she was pregnant which we later found out was true. She’s 19, and although Im 22 and still not ready to have a baby, she decided this was the right thing for her. Awesome! I was so happy for her. No word from her saying her commitment to the wedding has changed. I assumed her ability to commit to all of it wouldn’t be realistic but I was sure she was still willing and excited to help if/when needed as she was due in June, 4 months before the wedding. 
A coupe months go by, XMAS is always a busy time and I didn’t hear much from her although I DMd to check in every once in a while. I’m an introvert with depression, so I’m not always the most “reliable” friend when it comes to hanging out. And I’m planning a wedding goddamn! Anyways, I went out of my way to make sure she was progressing okay through the months, especially when she was having some medical issues. 
Fast forward again until FEB. I go to visit her at her work, and I get the worst fake/passive-aggressive vibe. At this point, she still hadn’t even asked about wedding planning nor the bachelorette, dresses, nothing. I tried to see past it because of her medical stuff and she’s got a lot going on! But frankly, I was a bit hurt and upset so I wanted to touch base. The entire time I was visiting I asked her about how things were, but not once did she ask about the wedding, now 8 months away. I tried to bring up the dresses and she shoved it off and continued to talk about her baby. 
So here I am, not wanting to be pushy but worrying that she could care less about my special day, has no bachelorette planning done, has no interest in dress shopping for me or the B.P. I don’t want to put extra pressure on her, especially w her medical stuff and covid, but I need to know!! (I tried many times to contact her since then, but always short to-the-point reply’s still with no regard for the wedding)
Now, late March, she’s been posting on her Instagram how she has no one, and is having this baby because she needs someone to NEED her. She said this in multiple posts, word for word. I grew up in a broken home, given up by my mom for drugs when she was 19. I cannot possibly respect that decision. On top of it, she told me she went off the pill only a month before she conceived and previously said how jealous she was of our friend who just had a baby also. Theres much more to this irresponsibility, but I’ll leave it here for the length. 
I’m at the point where I don’t want to say anything, because if I do I’m going to blow up about something I have no business saying. It’s HER life. If she wants this, I have to support her regardless of my feelings of her reasons. But I cannot possibly get past the fact that she TIRED to concieve only 2 months after she committed to my wedding, has shown NO interest in the damn thing, won’t even address it, and is now posting passive aggressive things on her Instagram about how no one is there for her when every time we’ve talked since I’ve initiated the conversation and been very concerned about her pregnancy. After she made a couple of these posts I DMd and asked what’s going on, no reply. 
Do I blow up on her? How do I be civil? Do I even mention the wedding? Do I wait? I have 0 reason why she could be upset at me! She won’t reply. I’m very mad, and hurt. Only 6 months till the wedding now and I’m panicking! SOS!!!!!",04Apr2020,1
264,"In my life I've always lived around abuse, hatred, and anger of all kinds. It was like the negativity brought more negativity so I started to dream how to create a better world. One with less hate and anger. I know it is a childish dream and may be impossible. But I decided I'll start with myself. I'll become better. Kinder. More caring. However due to all the darkness I lived around I dont know how aside from ""not being like them"". What advice or information can you provide to help with my dream? Any information is greatly appreciated and have a great day!",04Apr2020,1
265,"I know everyone is worried about what's going to happen as the days go on dealing with the virus, but as someone who always thinks negatively it's hard not to imagine what will happen. It doesn't help that every day something negative comes out in the news like, it'll be around until 2021-2022, a cure is still 10 years away, we will be seeing another great depression etc etc. In my family only myself and my mom are currently working but I'm only getting 20 hours a week. My dad will be running out of unemployment soon and all the money he had for my sister's schooling is now gone because the stock market is fucked. If the economy continues to fall the company I work for will most likely go under since we were already poor as it is. Before all this happened I was having the best time of my life. I was going to the gym 5 times a week, I cut all the sugars out of my diet, I started a tattoo sleeve and I just got promoted to assistant manager. 

My question is how can you think positive at a time like this? With the current death rate being 1 out of every 5 people dying to the virus and the economic doom that's going to happen, what's honestly the point of living and seeing the world suffer? We will most likely be homeless if the virus continues into June. I just don't see a reason to continue on at this point as it feels like the end of the world",04Apr2020,1
266,"3 days ago I (27F) bought my bf (26M) an XBOX. 

We're quarantined, and I stay busy with the baby and my online classes. I figured this would be something nice for me to do for him, and would keep him entertained while I'm busy doing school.

For a couple that has sex multiple times per day, we haven't had sex since we got the Xbox. I sucked his dick today while he played UFC (always wanted to get a guy off while he games) but that's been it. 

I told him before we got the Xbox that it was important to me that we continue to go to bed with each other. I think getting into bed at the same time does a lot to preserve intimacy and romance in a relationship, so this is a big thing for me. 

The past two nights I've gone to bed and he's stayed up to play ""one more game."" (of course it's always more than that). He said that tonight, so I went upstairs and got ready for bed... and waited on him because I wanted to have sex. 2 hours later he came to bed, and I was frustrated and then we started arguing about it. 

I'm worried the Xbox will come between us... but at the same time I understand it's a new toy and he's super excited to be gaming with his boys. I just want sex and intimacy to continue to be a priority in our relationship.

But, the last retail job I worked at hired me on the spot. If this place does that, or if they ask when I can start, would it be rude of me to tell them I’m still interviewing for other jobs?

272,"My now ex and I were together for 3.5 years. He told me he wanted a break, hopped on bumble, and when I confronted him and wanted to break up for good he begged he didn’t want to and never ended up using it, just wanted attention. We moved across the country together and he lives in my house. If I kick him out he has nowhere to go. I am horrified to be alone. I have no one, seriously, not a single soul. My family is far away. My only friend left is far away. I have very severe panic attacks that I have been struggling to get under control. Once I was hospitalized because it got so bad. He was the only one to help me or at least be there incase of emergency. Alone in a big city in an empty house, stuck. It’s hard to distract myself when I have nothing to do. I don’t know how to do this. I’m already so lonely and it’s so hard with him wanting to fix things because it’s very tempting. I still love him and what he did disgusts me but I can only feel insecure and sadness for loosing what we had and be terrified for whats to come all alone instead of anger.

273,"I have lost generous amount of friends in the last year, and I was curious if I was doing something wrong. My goal is to be a good friend and to always be the best person I can be. I may be occasionally pessimistic, but that never overrides my love for my friends. 

Around last summer I lost a friend because she was always on her phone and didn’t seem to be genuine anymore. I told her how I felt. She didn’t respond well or take action. So our friendship ended.

Around fall to New Years to current time (over a long period of time) I have grown distant from my 4 best friends. The 5 of us would do everything together. I quit the hobby we all shared together because I had to prioritize school. Nowadays, they hang out and stopped talking to me. I text them and they ignore me, and they never text me. So it kinda just ended.

Just around January, I made a new friend and we were pretty close but she abruptly just stopped talking to me. 

Throughout this time I have had two really good friends by my side, but it still makes me sad that all those important people are gone.

I was wondering if I did something wrong? I was always nice to them and I’m not one to be clingy. Nor did I complain about mental issues.  People say I’m funny and easy to get along with. I always tried my best with them, but I feel like they didn’t try with me. Is there a reason why they didn’t want to be my friend?",04Apr2020,1

275,"I don't quite know what I""m doing here. I'm 19/F. This friend is a bit older, think 26/M.

Recently I found out he is doing meth. And has been doing it for a year. Maybe longer.  I only met him in February, and this shit scares me. I haven't known him for very long, but I can definitely say I care about him. But I'm only 19. And I'm aware love isn't enough to wanna make someone quit meth, because of the way it rewires your brain chemistry. He's told me everytime he starts to get it under control, he slips up again and uses. Which I don't blame him, I understand this feeling. But I'm extremely conflicted. If I stay, it seems like a ticking time bomb just waiting to happen, so I've kept my distance emotionally from him.

 But to be honest - we were hooking up for a little while. I had no idea until recently, at which point he's been really forth coming and open about his use, and feelings about his use. But I caught feelings, and we're only kind-of-sorta dating. As in, we're each others main person, but we still see other people. And I don't really ever expect a serious relationship with him, I just want someone I can chill with and have some fun with while I get my life together. But he's a really decent guy, deep down. I know he is, because I see it when I'm with him. He would never purposefully hurt me. But I know meth could change that, as well, if it got too out of control. I'd also like to mention, he's aware I hate meth with a passion, and respects that. He doesn't ask me for anything, or try to shove it down my throat. 

I do **not** expect him to quit. Like at all. I've dealt with my mom being an addict, my dad being an addict, and half of my family being addicts. I know damn well with my mom, she chose that shit over her own kids. And I know when it comes to being in a relationship with someone, the same outcome is very likely. Not to mention, meth is extremely popular in my town so it's hard to escape. But with my mom - she could never hold down a stable job. She still uses to this day.

This guy is a fucking mechanic though. He somehow gets enough sleep, is able to maintain having his job, is very hygenic, and seems to keep his use pretty limited. And I know where he is most of the time because I have him on snapchat, and I can see his location. But I was over at his house the other day, and I saw him crash pretty bad. Not psychosis. Just, he was coming down from it and I was sitting there making sure he had water when he woke up, a lil food, and a blanket while he slept. It was definitely a little scary but I feel like I handled it pretty well. I pretty much just hung out until he woke up because I didn't have anywhere better to be anyway. And I didn't really mind.

But yeah, this situation is pretty complicated. I honestly am not phased by it and enjoy being around him. But I feel like I should be? Like I'm a terrible person, for not turning the opposite direction and running? I honestly just feel bad for him. That he fell victim to such a shitty fucking drug. And what the fuck am I supposed to do here? I still like him. I'm 100% never touching that shit though, and anyone who tries to make me or pressure me can go fuck themselves.",04Apr2020,1

288,"I (F15) am starting to become worried about my sister (F17). 
My family thinks she's just eccentric, but I'm starting to think otherwise.

To start off, her sleeping schedule is messed up.
She'll go a full day without sleeping, then sleep all until noon the next day, and repeat.

She loves cleanliness, and is at her best when everything's clean, but she has a hard time keeping everything clean between our pets and family.
She feels defeated about cleanliness.
She cleans once every other week or so.
That includes showering.
Most of her work is done outside.
She'll keep the hard all nice, and she'll work on her hobbies in the back by her bird houses.

She holds back a lot of things that aggravate her, and although most of the time, She's this wholesome hippie kind of type, she just can't deal with it. You can tell when she's beginning to have enough of her frusterations, because she'll be a lot less carless.
She still tries her best to be kind to everyone, although she'll be more sassy with everyone. 
To herself, she'll be much more clumsy.
Like, for instance, she historically sews, meaning she makes her clothes by hand, using older techniques. When she's at a high stressed mood, she'll prick her fingers really bad.
They'll be bloodied on ""accident"".
She'll also note her tongue and mouth a lot.

She has a lot of hobbies, so she's ambivalent a lot of the time. She wants to do everything at the same time, so she just sits there.
She'll knit, but then she'll want to work on a painting, but then she'll want to play video games, but then she'll want to play records.
She just winds herself up even more.

She's also quite chatty. 
She talks fast, and has a really bad stutter.
She also goes down so many rabbit holes.
She'll talk about the newest doctor who episode, then she'll talk about something that she was ssewing, then she'll ask Grandma about her day, and this that and the other.
It's a mess. She talks really fast too.

She's not anxious per se, but she is paranoid.
She stopped eating meat, because she says there were cases of people being put into the meat, but you can't see any articles, because ""they"" took it down so they won't get sued by companies.
She does a lot of yardwork, but is jumpy, and expressed a lot of fear over spiders, and swears up and down that they're there. 

She has a few quirks, like walking on her tip toes,
Twitching her nose, and she also doesn't like loud noises.

There were a few times that she alarmed me.
For one, the power went out, and she walked out of the bathroom complaining that the bells were ringing louder than ""usual"".
Another time is that she laughed about how our friends phone case was changing colors, when in reality, it was a plain green phonecase.
Nothing more, nothing less.
While vacuuming or using loud machines, My sister turn it off to hear what we were saying, even if we didn't say anything at all.

Like I've said, My family thinks she's just funny, and my sister is too stubborn to realize that she's not a normal teenager. 
What should I do if this is anything bad?
I don't want to see her mentally deteriorate, to the point of no return. I would feel bad to be the one that noticed something odd about her, but never said anything.

291,"I have a four family apartment building. One of the tenants put up cameras on two corners of the external building (pointing toward the parking lot/entrance). Two of the other tenants are complaining about it saying that it is a breach of privacy toward them since the cameras are pointing to the common area and belong to the other tenant, not the building itself.  
I've read online that I'm good to go with telling him to take them down since they're on the building and not his apartment (he is renting the apartment, not the building), AND because in the lease it states that any changes/improvements/additions must be okayed by the LL (me) before it is done. Well, I never heard from this tenant before he set up the cameras and didn't learn about them until two other tenants complained about it.  
My question is whether there is anything he could come back to me with since the other tenants told me that he must've put the cameras up because someone slashed his vehicle's tires recently. I am trying to keep the peace among everyone there as much as possible, and don't want to cause any unnecessary problems.

- “at some point the government has to decide: the stability of the economy, or a few deaths.” 
- “it’s just like the flu, so i don’t know why everyone is overreacting.

297,"Before the new bill giving employees that were laid off or furloughed an extra $600 on top of their unemployment allowance(California), I was asked if I can stay at my job. I obliged cause if I don’t work, I can’t provide for my family. I felt lucky I was kept but they cut operation hours. I am working 20 hours a week. They furloughed the staff. We had one other manager that said they were concerned with their safety and Human Resources furloughed her after the bill had passed. 

After my last paycheck, I am sure they are making more than me by staying at home. I still filed for unemployment for reduced hours and it’s laughable. I am the only one working and have been having anxiety due to possibly me getting sick, bringing it home to my 1 year old daughter or my wife. I am confused and so lost. I am a team player but I don’t know if they will contest my unemployment with the state if I request what the other employee did for safety concerns.

303,"I'm South Asian but I grew up in a Western country. I hate my ethnicity and my culture. I don't know why. It's like a deep-rooted hatred. It frustrates me; I can accept every Tom, Dick and Harry but I can't accept my own ethnicity/culture. There's so much shame attached to it and I don't know how to get rid of that. I want to stop feeling this way. It's ironic because if anyone was to say anything shitty against my ethnicity, I would throw hands (jk but I would speak out). Yet deep inside, I'm like those people. 

I find it hard to admit my ethnicity to people online. I guess I feel such a strong sense of shame and hatred towards it that I expect others to react in a similar manner. I project my own insecurities and views onto them. I know it's wrong and the majority of people don't give a shit but it's hard to tell my brain that. There's a lot of anxiety associated with this topic. 

I have experienced racism as a kid; nothing big tho. Just racial slurs here and there. I didn't realise that they had affected me *this* much, not to the point where I would hate my ethnicity and attempt to hide it. 

There's a song I've been listening to for a couple of years and I never really thought it applied to me but this part just always hit me right in the feels; ""(I'm) From where blacks, indigenous peoples and Asians were once Slaves of the Caucasians / *and it's amazing how they trained them / To be racist against themselves in a place they were raised in* / And you kept us caged in / Destroyed our culture and said that you civilized us / Raped our woman and when we were born you despised us"" (Immortal Technique- The 3rd World). It just suggests that maybe this is bigger than me. I've learnt about the colonisation of my country and the ways in which we were degraded. It's frustrating that ig in some ways, I'm still feeling the remnants of colonialism even though I'm so far removed from it. 

Sorry for the blabber-- gonna blame that on the fact I haven't slept. Also, it probably seems like such a trivial problem but it's genuinely something I've been having trouble with for years. I hate feeling this way. I hate being a bitch to colonialism :&gt;( sooo any advice on how I can stop? I don't wanna hate my ethnicity and my culture and feel ashamed of it. 

Are there any small things I can do? Any tips would be very, very much appreciated. Thank you for reading this essay (if you managed to get this far) :~)",04Apr2020,1

His parents are the strict Christian type and sent him away to a Christian-based program in either Ohio or Illinois for drug rehabilitation for teen boys. He told me it lasts half a year to a year, but I don’t know if he’s coming back. He left just days before the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

307,"So I have this group of friends that I've been pretty close to for the past 5 years. They were my closest friends in high school and I care about them a lot. However, when I reflect on these past few years of my life, I notice that a lot of my unhappiness and insecurities came from issues I've had with them. Countless petty fights that made me spiral into having some of the lowest lows of my life... it got to a point where I knew I had enough and I wanted to walk away. I didn't realize this until the end of high school so instead of dropping them immediately, I just figured that over time we'd drift apart because I'd be moving away for college.

  
But the problem is this ""naturally drift apart"" thing isn't working. Thanks to social media and my indecisiveness, I've still kept in touch with them and just hoped for the best? I haven't been able to bring myself to stop talking to them because every time they reach out, I find it impossible to ignore them. Despite all of the times they have made me feel incredibly shitty about myself, I still care about them and I find it hard to move on, I'm a very forgiving person and if someone does something wrong, all it takes is a half assed apology for me to forget the whole thing ever happened. I convince myself that somehow I deserved to be treated poorly and now that it's over, I should move on. My other friends have called me out for doing this and have encouraged me to say something but I feel like it's too late for confrontation because we haven't had a serious problem in months. It would be weird to say ""Yeah, remember that argument we had 6 months ago? Well I never told you this but it really fucked up my sense of self worth and I still think about it constantly because I never received an actual apology... but I moved on because I was so desperate for you to like me."" I feel like doing that would be so uncalled for and they would definitely handle it badly (I wouldn't blame them).

  
Aaaah. I've literally procrastinated doing this because I'm such a coward and I can't stop overthinking.

But recently he told me that he didn't believe in vaccinations and saying that they cause autism and contain dangerous chemical. So I tried to debunk the conspiracy with facts and logic.

We are always together until really late (2,3,4am). I’ve met his family, been to his house, and they’ve taken me to games and paid for my food on multiple occasions.
A little bit of background: He had a toxic ex that blackmailed, bullied, and was overall not good for him or his mental health. It broke him down. When I told him I liked him, he told me he was surprised he hasn’t developed any feelings for me yet. He even said that with me it feels perfect, but his mind can’t process it further. He thought it was because his experience with his ex turned him away from love in a way. But he’s found other people attractive since then, so we know that is not the case. We have done some romantic/intimate things, but he’s always made the first move. My feelings have only gotten stronger, while the tiny bit of feeling he had in the beginning just went away.

Now that second semester has come &amp; this COVID thing has came about, he finds more girls to gawk over on social media &amp; every time it makes me so sad.

313,"Hello Redditors!

I currently work for a local Chick-fil-A restaurant where I have been employed continuously for 3 years in a high level management position.  I have worked on and off again at Chick-fil-A since 2005 occupying a variety of management positions across 3 stores ( with my current Executive Director position being the highest yet).  Before COVID-19, my goal was to begin the lengthy and grueling process of applying to become a Chick-fil-A operator.  However now I am sort of in limbo working at this current location and wondering how long before I can actually move on.

Before I started at this location I owned and operated a small business entertainment company for over a decade.  The best parts of this business was the income ($80-$90k/year) and the incredibly flexible schedule and free time (I worked at most 20 hours per week outside my home).  The bad parts were the extremely sporadic and inconsistent income (gigs would come and go - some months I would gross $10k other months $2k if I was lucky).

Now I feel totally burned out at Chick-fil-A.  I long to spend more time with my family and my pay is really poor for what I do.  Not to mention I cannot stand being an hourly employee.  Am I crazy to stick with this company to achieve my dream of being a Chick-fil-A operator?  Or should I pursue a new business venture on my own and enjoy more time with my family?

TL;DR - Do I stick with my consistent but time straining job or move on to something that I control and enjoy time with my family?",04Apr2020,1
314,"So I work in healthcare but on the IT side. We don't have a union or anything so we really don't have any backup. I have a manager who is really not taking this Covid thing seriously. He keeps saying it's just the flu even though we literally work in a hospital! Other teams have been completely sent on remote but him and the supervisor are dragging their feet and barely letting anyone go remote or scheduling in person meetings on days we were suppose to be remote. Example my colleague from another area has been remote for 2 weeks while my first remote day and only day remote was last Thursday. Overall he's been an all about appearances boss so if it's something that doesn't Make him look good, then he really doesn't care. He wants to keep sending us out and showing that our team is still working and this remote stuff is just a bunch of garbage. Unfortunately we are exposed to positive Covid patients, physicians and other medical staff on the daily. It can't be avoided due to our positions. Next week, we are having to support a new unit go live that is just going to be used for overflow of covid cases. So basically it'll be us, the patients, and the medical staff supporting them. of course he will not be attending because he has meetings and again those days were supposed to be remote days. but whatever... So I was pretty much volunt told I have to support. My question is what medical equipment is available or needed to be around positive covid patients? Do I need a full gown? And how much risk am I really putting myself in by supporting this go Live? I mean the other medical staff are there too so it shouldn't be that dangerous right? Should there be hazard pay?

315,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. All of these things happened from August-March by the way.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",04Apr2020,1

327,"Allow me to preface this- I am absolutely terrified of them. I don’t want to touch them, see them, or be near them. 

Anyways, so I’m from southern Canada, and house spiders are fairly common. I’m young, so I live with my parents right now, and my house has become a spidery nightmare recently.

Firstly, the spiders typically seem to like my room the most. Why? I don’t know. It’s not really special. I have some snacks, but it’s not like they’re going for them. Typically, they’ll hang out up in the high corners of the ceiling in my room, and I hate it. 

Most recently, my parents forced me to kill three spiders that all seemed to appear in my room at once, with one literally spinning a web in the middle of my and hanging down from it. I was insanely terrified, and did my mom’s recommended method of sucking them up with a vacuum. It seemed to be alright. 

Then, yesterday, literally less than a week later, I was on my bed, and I see a spider, smaller and less lanky than the ones I typically see, crawling on it with me. I freak out and kill it with adrenaline, and then I spot another one that looked like the last on it. I kill that one too. I ended up sleeping downstairs that night.

That’s where it gets better. My mom washed my now spider-contaminated sheets for me, so when I was getting ready to go to bed tonight, I lifted up my mattress to inspect it first. There wasn’t anything going on, so I put my mattress back down on my box spring and prepared to put my sheets on. But that’s when I saw a third spider, the same as the other two, on my mattress corner. I wanted to kill it, but it slipped away. I took my mattress off my box spring, but I still couldn’t find it, not even on my wall.

So after all of that, I end up going downstairs to sleep on a couch. I look at my shutters, and you’ll never guess what was there- another spider. He looked less like the ones from my bed and more like the ones from the corners of my ceiling, so I panicked. It was big (for my standards), so I couldn’t kill it myself, so I woke my mom up. She yelled at me for this and the ceiling spider incident where my entire family refused to kill them for me, but I eventually coaxed her into killing this one.

So, as a TL;DR, here are my problems:
A) My house is potentially spider infested?? What do I even do about that?? I see them frequently. 
B) My entire family expects me to kill every spider I discover myself and not bother them, despite the fact I’m very clear that I’m terrified of them.
C) I can’t even sleep in my own room anymore because my bed is filled with spiders? Help??

So yeah, I’m kind of screwed, and I don’t know what to do. Anyone have any suggestions? ;;",04Apr2020,1

And the issue with my brother is just one aspect of my life. Right now I can’t afford therapy but I would really like to discuss all of it with a professional one day. So if there is someone out there with a similar problem I would love to hear from you, and maybe we can work things out together, who knows?",04Apr2020,1
332,"17F. I love debating and am a generally opinionated person. But secretly. Armchair politician. That being said, I don’t mind when others have a different view than me on a subject, politically or otherwise, and don’t take offense. I try to keep the boat from rocking too much though, but I really enjoy a lively debate when no one is getting hurt.

For the past few years I’ve had a close knit group of friends, since I moved across the country. It started off great—similar interests, a wide variety of personalities, etc. But, as with everything growing up, my friends have got increasingly political, to the point where anyone else who disagrees with them on the subject is instantly bad, horrible, etc. very polarizing. They’re great friends besides that, but it gets old, given that it’s all they want to talk about now about and aren’t willing to listen to any other points of view.

Now I understand my opinion may be unpopular. The other day we were talking about the donations that Zuckerberg and Gates gave to the corona cases, and everyone was on the call talking about how greedy they were for only donating that much, and have the statistical comparison about how much money was donated compared to someone else’s salary, screw the rich, etc. Im by no means wealthy but I was really fed up of just listening, and said, “Well 25 million is still a lot of money that wasn’t there otherwise. It’s not their job to empty their pockets, they’re just dudes who started a company.”

...Needless to say this comment did not fly over well. My friends haven’t talked to me in a few days and a few actually blocked me. . On a call that I was no longer invited to, I was told that they called me a “bourgeoise sympathizer” and said that I should be the “first at the guillotine” and that I’m a “mini-fascist”, all said in complete seriousness. 

And then I found out they made a hate account for me, where there’s a picture of my face on a pig’s body, licking a cowboy boot with Bill Gates and Zuckerberg’s face on it. I applaud the effort put into it, but that being said, it was too extreme for what I considered to be one offhand comment. I have literally never given a political opinion until that moment, and I don’t even think it was all that serious.

That being said, I don’t have many friends in the first place, and I’m afraid of losing the only group I’ve had for a while, especially during the quarantine as they’re some of my only social interaction. 

Should I apologize to them? I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong since it was just an opinion, but I’m fairly distraught over losing my social ties, and I do like them when they’re not extremely political, though that’s becoming less and less prevalent lately. I’m just sort of at a loss. Anyone have any advice?",04Apr2020,1

335,"This might be a long post, but I would appreciate if anyone would take the time to offer any tips, insight, or just wanted to give ideas. 

So to start off I am a 23 year old Male from the state of Texas. The only thing that I have to show for my 23 years of life is that I got a bachelors degree in criminal justice, I graduated in December 2019. I have no clue  in what to do now that I am done with school. My whole life I've had something  look forward to, in my cases it was going to clasess. I would always have some sort of structure, go to class, study, take a test and pass the class. Now that I am done I miss having a purpose or goal. The only reason that i went to college was because my parents wanted me to go. My parents are very hardworking people that emigrated from Mexico to this country. They want the best for me, in their eyes an education would prepare me and benefit me in life. So who am I to deny them the dream of their only child getting a college education. I had no interests in school or the classes. The only reason i chose criminal justice was because its an easy major and it does not require much effort in my opinion. I dont like anything in that field, all I did I'm college was go to school, work, and play video games and repeat.

I currently work at a dollar store where I have been working since my senior year of high school. It's an easy job, doesn't require much skills but it's not what I want to do any longer. I dont like to really talk to others a lot, and well working at a store makes that hard to do, plus the customers are really nasty at times. I also love Texas but the weather is so bad, we never get to experience the full seasons. As we Texas say here  we have the warm weather, and hot weather. To be more exact I live close to the capital of Texas Austin.  After having lived here my whole life I want to experience something new, I am the person that likes some cold weather, but I love the rain a lot. I've always wanted to move north.  I just have the warm weather the last three Christmas I've worn shorts because it's been hot. The majority of states are still getting some cold not chilling weather and here in Texas we are getting close or over 90 degrees already. I hate the feeling of walking outside my house and sweating just for being outside walking my dog because it's so hot
 

But I'm scared of looking for another  job because I'm scared of failure. What if I am bad at my job, or what if i can't do it correctly and look like a fool. And I know I want to find something because I dont want to look like a failure to my parents and my family. Sometimes I feel like I should kill myself because no matter what I do I'll never meet expectations or be successful. I really dont have any hobbies or interests that i can name that might help me get an idea of a job that I could search for. I like to listene to music, watch YouTube, play some video games and that's all I do when I'm at home not working. Recently I've been working out trying to get into better shape. I've lost 15lbs so far. Going from 360lbs- 345lbs, standing at 6'7 I've still got way more but I'll eventually get there and be healthy. Taking it a day at the time. So the only real goal I have is to lose weight and get healthy, and find a purpose in life. 
I think I'm just really scared of being that loser, that lives with his parents and never does anything with his life.

I've been thinking of Just starting over completely and moving. Ive always wanted to live in Washington state. Never been there but had a professor that was dorm there and she would talk to me about it and show ke pictures and to me it looks amazing. Which I know would be a hard and foolish thing. Leaving to a new place with nothing planned and just hoping for the best. But knowing me and I am a super spontaneous person, I believe that I could overcome the obstacles. But deep down I'm scared of doing it, even when its what I want to do.  
So now here is my question, with all the info I have listed what would yall do. How would yall find a purpose in life? Would yall risk it and start a new life? How should I stop being scared? Should I just man up and do it?

Like I said  any help, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If you need to ask more info or have a question i would also be glad to answer it.

337,"Hello Everyone, 

I need to share something, I need your opinions and advice as I'm having a very difficult time. 

I found out I'm pregnant, I'm around 7 weeks. I'm 30, live on my own, have a full time job. My boyfriend, let's call him Josh is 29, he lives at home with his mum and dad but also works. Josh has a sister (let's call her Janet). Janet is 31 she has a 2 year old and is now pregnant with her second child, Janet is around 10 weeks.

Josh and I had been friends for two years before we started dating and have been happy together for 8 months. After experiencing a couple abusive relationships I finally thought I had found the love of my life, my soulmate who also happened to be my best friend. I have never been happier in my entire life. And he always said he felt exactly the same way. We weren't planning to have kids now and I was taking the pill, we were planning to live together, he wanted to buy a house for both of us. Due to the virus we hadn't seen each other in a couple of weeks but we would videocall each other every day. I told him I was pregnant as soon as I found out and we were both shocked. He wanted to wait for the first scan and then tell his family. I had already told my mum, dad and 2 best friends. They are very happy and are as supportive as can be but they live in a different country.

Two days after he found out I was pregnant, he came over and he seemed excited but nervous. He touched my tummy and said he loved us, he said that we could get through anything together, he said he was ready to be a dad and would do his absolute best for us. Josh has always been caring and loving and supportive. I've felt so lucky and loved. I was excited to start our own family.

We ended up deciding to call Janet to tell her and to ask some advice on how to tell the parents. Josh was really nervous to tell any of them. And her reaction was crazy!Janet started screaming at us. She told us we were making a mistake, we don't understand what having a baby means and that she felt sorry for our baby. I became very upset, and Josh told me he would stay with me, not to worry. He wanted to make sure I was okay. Janet then gave us an ultimatum, she said if we didn't tell his parents that evening, she would call and tell them herself. 

So Josh went home. The last thing he said to me was: 'We're gonna prove them wrong, show them we can do this together. I need you to be strong for me.'  And he had a conversation with his parents. Josh messaged me and said his parents were a lot calmer than his sister  and that it would be better to speak face to face. He came over the next day after work. 

Josh told me, his parents talked to him about how hard it is to raise children. His mum said if this baby comes she would be done with us, would not help in anyway (we haven't asked for any help). His mum said she would not even attend our wedding if we ever decided to have one (we're not even engaged). 

Josh then told me, he thinks it would be better if I got rid of the baby. He had a couple of points which I didn't agree with and I told him so (I'mnot writing all of them because this text is already so long, but if you want to know let me know and I'llwrite them up). I tried to make him look at things from my point of view. We both cried a lot that day. I ended up sending him home because I knew we wouldn't agree.

A couple of days later I texted him saying I want to keep this baby. We didn't plan it, but he was made with love. He told me he was coming over and he brought a notepad with him. He wanted me to write down that he is not responsible for the baby and that I'm not gonna be trying to get money from him for the baby. He even spoke as if he was convinced I got pregnant on purpose. He said he didn't understand why I want this baby. He thought he had a smart woman in me. I told me I thought I had a man by my side, not a child who only does what his parents want him to.

I kicked him out of my house. My heart is broken in a million pieces. I don't recognise Josh at all. Did he lie to me all this time? Has he been brainwashed? Do I just need to give him time and hope he'll be back? I never expected this from him or his family...

340,"Facts first: I'm a disappointment. I went to school for four years and racked up 20,000 dollars in debt getting my degree. I graduated in May 2019 and completely and utterly failed to find a job. I searched for internships during school and probably should have taken the dozens of non-responses as a hint, but it turns out the bona-fide degree was equally useless. I've been living with my Mom and stepfather, mooching. My Mom gave me a car three years ago because she was super proud of me doing well at college. 

With the job search failing I needed an alternative. I've worked some random jobs but none of them have been enough for me to move out so far. So I gave into pressure from my family to apply to Air Force OTS. Once again, everyone super proud of me. Great career move, reasonable salary, benefits.

Thing is... I absolutely do not want to join the air force. Nothing about it appeals to me. I did JROTC in high school and even that was terrible to me. BS heirarchies, never having free time or sleep. My family encouraged me to apply to positions related to my degree, which meant rated positions, which carry a minimum 10 year commitment. 

Board results were supposed to come out today. They're delayed, and the recruiter asked for our ""patients"" during this time. I am desperately hoping I get rejected, but rumor has it there's a small pool of applicants so I'm likely to be accepted.

I can't do it. I can't sign myself up for 10 years of unhappiness. Maybe that makes me an ungrateful asshole. But I'm hoping someone understands and can help me on how to talk to my family about this. I feel like a fraud, and the prospect of telling my Mom that I don't want to go down the career path of my grandfather and instead mooch off of her until a date TBD doesn't sound like a good option.

341,"Hey guys, so long story short, I bought a ticket to Coachella which was supposed to happen in April, but moved to October. 
The problem is that I booked an AirBnb through Hotels.com to RedAwning for the Coachella dates in April. When I found out that the festival was postponed because of the virus, my boyfriend and I contacted Hotels.com and they said we would be refunded. They said they would email RedAwning and everything will be resolved; they even gave us a case number. 
However, when we got no email about a refund we contacted RedAwning and they said they aren’t authorized to give refunds, only flexible scheduling even during the virus. I agreed to the flexible scheduling but I still would like a refund. 
I’m frustrated because this whole thing is on my card and it’s $3000+ split between 8 people.

The next day i called him and apprently he is in his parents house, but not isolated.

345,"So, my dilemma here is that the man in my life has never properly communicated or learned to. I dont understand why, but that is the situation.

He either completely overreacts and cries, etc. or attempts to diffuse the situation by going off by himself for hours at a time.

No, he wasnt always this way, but it seems this is what I have to work with when he is stressed.

I dont really know how to approach this gently. It frustrates me deeply when he overreacts because I feel like I'm dealing with an emotional kid. But, when he avoids me by going off for hours I get equally frustrated. 

He thinks that when I say I dont want to argue, I mean avoid the subject. That isnt what I mean. I dont want the situation to explode. I dont like yelling, etc. So I ask him to calm down and we will continue. Thibg is, he doesn't know how to continue without flipping out. It is either anger and frustration from him or crying and an emotional wreck.

When he isnt so stressed he talks openly and honestly. But, there are things going on with his adult kids and it is stressing him out. So, I am trying to be understanding, but honestly we have young kids together and I need him present. Not by himself neglecting the other people in his life because his adult kids are being needy and destructive again. I have suggested he help where he can and try to teach then to be more independent but they dont want that. They just want money.

CW for mental health issues, sui*** mention

Hey there. So i guess i really don't know how to explain this. I've gone to therapists a few times and I would be seeing one right now if it weren't for the pandemic happening. For context i've had panic attacks, s******l thoughts, and pretty extreme periods of depression. About 6 months ago I went through a phase of major paranoia after being triggered back to traumatic experiences. Recently though its seemingly getting worse, maybe because of the pandemic, maybe not. Ive had slight hallucinations in the past, hearing the doors open, hearing people call my name, seeing rats run by. Nothing extreme like seeing and hearing an entire person in front of me, but they still happened. Its gotten worse, its more often now and its making me more skittish. Same hallucinations, but sometimes I see things outside my window or hear more creaking around my house, things like this. Its nothing debilitating, but it's there.

What's debilitating is these weird moments of derealization or dissociation, something of the like. I either become hyper aware of everything around me and who i am and my entire past and everything out of nowhere. The opposite happens as well, moments where i don't feel real, like everyone and everything around me is fake and so am I. Almost every time this happens, which is usually 1-5 times a day, I zone out so much i guess that I cant remember the last few seconds, As if I blinked and lost the past 5-10 seconds. Not a lot of course but it's concerning.

Im sorry if I sound crazy, I know this looks like a post that you look at and think, ""Yikes, what a psychopath."" I would have visited a psychiatrist or therapist regularly if I, 1) Had the money to and 2) Had a family that supported me going. Im 19, so I still live with them. And though they believe in seeing a therapist, they don't really believe in mental health issues such as clinical depression and they certainly don't believe in taking medications for such. 

TLDR: Im having mild hallucinations and moments of derealization that is partially debilitating and worrying. My family is against going to therapy and medicating (if necessary). 

My question for you, the super readers of this post here is, does this sound like it warrants going to therapy? Is it just anxiety getting worse during this pandemic or is it something more?",04Apr2020,1

355,"Trigger warning; 


I was assaulted in high school by a teacher. He wasn’t my teacher but one visiting and reviewing a play we we were doing at the time. He was my theater teacher’s friend; from another high school. 

I was a very angry and lonely kid who didn’t really have a lot of friends because of my anger problem. I wasn’t close with my family and I felt so very alone. 
I was depressed and looking so hard to find something to cling on to. What’s sad is, as an adult, I realize now that I was a very easy target for a predator. But hindsight is 20/20. 

The visiting teacher told me he wanted me to audition for a college play he was in charge of; he thought I was “an amazing actress” and I would be “perfect for the part”. 

I was told to keep this to myself so as not to get any other students jealous (this was supposed to be for college students). So I showed up to the towns university library, where auditions would be held (in the large, upstairs study rooms), and because it was a Saturday afternoon, no one was really there. No one but me and that visiting teacher. 

I felt weird because there was no one else around to audition for this supposed big play. When I asked where the others were, I was told I was the first to arrive and to focus on myself. But no one else ever would show up. 

I won’t go into detail, but yes, he forced himself on me. And I never said anything. Please don’t judge me for this. I was 17 and all I wanted to do was forget that this ever happened. I felt humiliated and so fucking stupid for falling for this. I felt disgusting and dirty and just a complete moron who walked right into this trap. All I wanted to do was forget it. Honestly, I think this was my body’s way of trying protect myself; I was already very low and I think facing this head on wouldn’t have ended well for me. 

Until recently, I kept what happened to myself and managed to bury what happened as far back in my mind as I could. I actually managed to not think about it for a long time. Until I just couldn’t anymore. 

I keep getting so many flashbacks and I’ve been having so many nightmares about what happened. I managed to open up to my best friend and told her everything. I had never told anyone everything. I thought this would help, and to an extent, it really did. 

But, more then ever, these flashbacks to what happened just won’t stop. Everything reminds me of what happened and I just hate it. I try so hard to not think about it...but I’ll see something or hear something and it’s like I’m right back in that place with him. 

I’ve never had anxiety attacks (I’m not even sure if that’s what it is), but I’m having so many breakdowns lately over what happened. Some days I’m perfectly fine and happy and living life then BOOM I’m reminded of what happened and it’s like I’m surrounded by it.  

What’s worse, I’ve had situations happen  aside from what happened to me at 17 and I just hate it. Men grabbing at my body, being ganged up on by a group of drunk men, having a 36 year protective order on a man who just couldn’t take “no” for an answer. I don’t mean for this shit to happen. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong that makes guys think they can do these things. I’ve been told that I’m too nice to them and they misconstrue it as flirting. But even if that’s the case, why do they think they can put their hands on me or try to force themselves on me? I’m often told I’m overthinking or reacting to something...but the truth is, I’m scared of men. You’d never know it at face value, but I am so fucking scared of being hurt again. 

I’m just so tired. I’m tired of feeling so dirty. Especially when I actually am in a very good place in my life and HAPPY. I’m happy. So why does this keep coming back and invading my mind ? I just want these memories to go the fuck away and stay away.

Seems like a decent guy but I'm starting to have doubts about him even though everyone keeps saying he's a great guy. First, we talked over the phone back in 2019 October. He just kept talking about religion and how he wants to travel instead of settling down at one place. I'm not as religious so I just took it as a discussion and talked. We do have similar goals but I'm someone who has no chill. I cry a lot, I'm dramatic but I'm fiercely loyal and I want a guy who will text me or call me not all the time but not go without contact for 3 freaking months. When I reply he leaves me on read and replies weeks later. When I leave him on read he complains to his mother who calls my Mum and tells her to text him back. My Mum is annoying as well she keeps making excuses for the guy. She did not even meet him and she's like oh he's busy etc etc. It's getting on my nerves and I deserve way better than some loser who makes no effort whatsoever. Also before some of you comment, it's easier to say 'LEAVE HIM'. We are NOT together and our parents are already trying to talk about marriage. I tried to explain to my parents but they are adamant about it. I really hate they are trying to even make a decision of a lifelong commitment by being stubborn and trusting words of outside people instead of me. I flat out told them I will give him a chance but the choice is mine. At first they agreed but now it's like they refuse to hear me out or take no for an answer. They say I'm the problem not him. I know who and how I am and I know I deserve someone who takes time out of their day to contact me. Also I'm in the healthcare and with COVID-19, he did not even bother to check up or simply ask how we are doing. How am I supposed to be with someone like that. He expects me to take time out of my day to contact him and call him but he won't do the same.",04Apr2020,1
358,"My mom is extremely toxic, almost everything she says is an insult and she’s constantly yelling and making me feel like shit. Often she’ll come home with her mouth open ready with something to say. I can’t stand being in a room with her because she stares at me until I leave and I can tell she’s trying to come up with something to say. My dad is manipulative and he tries to take advantage of this by always using her as a source of discipline, telling me “mom will get mad at you” as if he’s on my side, trying to get me to see her as even more of a villain, but the thing is, usually she doesn’t care and he’s making her out to be worse than she seems. They’re both extremely traditional - racist, sexist, homophobic, the like, but that’s just a side thing. They’ve also (in the past, thankfully) used physical punishments/discipline. My dad would pinch me really hard and my mom would drag me out of the door, down the brick stairs and sometimes lock me out of the house at night (my memory is not clear but it was probably 15 minutes max, they weren’t that long). To top it off, my sister is an annoying prick, she always gets what she wants out of me and never respects me. Now I don’t understand how someone can be a cunt without a reason, so does that mean I’ve done something to make them all treat me this way? It certainly feels like it because they all say I’m just like my mom, they tell me I’m quick to get mad and illogical and that I’ll eventually drive all my friends away because of it. And the fact that I’m compared to someone I hate so much just tears me apart, it makes it so that I’m never content with what I do because I’m always so afraid I’m being seen as manipulative, or that I am manipulative without realizing it. The thing is I only get mad illogically at them, because they’ve treated me like shit for so long. But then I think I’m probably just trying to justify it so I don’t have to accept that I’m the one in the wrong, though I’ve never tried to be negative towards any of them without reason. So then I go through this loop, each time feeling more and more guilty. Whenever I do anything, I imagine a situation where I’d be doing that menacingly and as manipulation, and I feel like the fact that I can imagine that means those ARE undertones to the motivation behind me doing that thing. Recently I’ve noticed I’ve been getting angry at the tiniest things and I try to justify it by thinking of all the things they’ve done, and then I realize that’s probably me trying to avoid blame. I have suicidal thoughts in reaction to the most trivial acts, and I feel guilty because I know it’s illogical to be having them, and also because I know I will never actually act on those thoughts. But they’re real and they’re constant, and I just don’t know what to do. It’s been almost every day now for the past couple months and I just need to know what I’m doing wrong. I know getting outside help is probably an obvious answer to this, but I can’t do that because I just can’t imagine living a life away from them. As much as I hate them, I’m dependent on them and I just don’t know why. Just want to know how I can cope.",04Apr2020,1
359,"It all started by growing up with an abusive father who became a lawyer at 40. He basically complained hard all his life that if he was born in a better family he would have started his career before and would have achieved so much more, and that life dealt him an unfair hand. He was also desperate to hide is past: everything before 40 was taboo, because he wasn't a born and bred middle class lawyer but the son of two farmers turned factory workers. He was always bitter about this and had a huge Achille's heel to hide.

Fast forward to me, almost 37, and I have done nothing to avoid that fate. Due to various difficulty in my dysfunctional family of origin it took me a long time to figure out what to do with my life. I worked, trained, studied at universities, misidentified my path in life, and then went back to uni and graduated at 33. I now work with a permanent contract in a meaningless job and I'm about to go from flatmates to a small flat rented by me alone.

Everyone keep pressuring me to find what I want to do in life, to invest in a path and make it. But that will make me exactly like my father. The no good f\*\*kup who got his act together at 40 and finally made it. I'm honestly quite scared of replicating this pattern and to live forever committed obsessively to a career and to hide hard everything that was my life until now. There will be a before-and-after that I dreaded and that hold me back from graduating earlier. 

The problem is, if I go on like this, I will never have an identity. He was a lawyer. My friends have titles such as software engineer, biologist, and so on... I can't call myself an anthropologist because I have just a BA, so I'm absolutely no one. Hence the pressure to find a career, to ""name the job"" which will name myself.

I keep blaming myself hard for not being normal: high school, degree, job with a name to your profession. And I find no motivation in it, because if I made it now it will never be a success but just a patch to a shame. How can I go about this?",04Apr2020,1

365,"For the past two years, I have been renting a house with a bunch of friends in my college town. It’s been great and we basically live in a neighborhood where several other college students rent, so it’s a very social and active community. 

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I had to make the difficult decision of whether or not to stay in the college town, or move back home with my parents who live an hour and half away. I decided to move back with my parents, primarily because I’ll be able to save money (I got laid off from my job), and also because I feared that my friends back at the college town won’t take quarantine that serious. 

As I imagined, my friends who stayed have been going about their days as normal and have been doing their best to abide by the rules of quarantine. However, from what I see on social media, there are few people in our community who have not taken protocol seriously at all (let’s call them John, Jane, and Ally). John, Jane, and Ally don’t understand the severity of this situation, and will jump from place to place, drinking and smoking w/ different people, buy take-out often, go to the local grocery store every day, visit their families on the weekend, and so on. I respect my friends who are actually following the rules, but, they fail to understand that hanging out with John, Jane, and Ally compromises them and puts them all at risk of contracting the virus.

Recently, my friend (Sam) texted me asking me if I wanted to come to her house (located at the college town) for her birthday. Sam told me that it would be a small thing with just a few people in the community who we always hang out with. I know Sam has been staying indoors and has minimized contact with the outside world, but unfortunately, Sam also happens to be roommates with Jane &amp; Ally. 

When I found out Sam wanted to have people over, I was pissed, even if it was just less than 10 people. I can’t help but get mad because of how delusional she is for even considering this. We’re given simple rules to just stay at home and distance ourselves from other people, and yet, they’re failing to do so. 

How should I go about telling Sam to reconsider this whole get together without explicitly name-dropping John, Jane, and Ally? I know I have to be careful with how I approach this because I don’t want anybody to think that I’m implying John, Jane, and Ally have the corona virus or I don’t want to be portrayed as envious because I’m stuck at home. I’m actually concerned for their well-being and I really think they need to be smarter about holding each other accountable.

367,"Sorry, English is not my first language...

So, me(21) and my girl(also 21) have been together for about 6 years now. I've been and somewhat still am her first real boyfriend. We've met at the high school and after that she began studying in different city - so now it has been 3 years of somewhat long distance relationship where we got to see each other pretty much every week. It all began about 4 months ago, when she told me that I've been treating her badly for about 2-3 years - (not saying as many nice things to her, no flowers, sex was worse because I didn't listen to her needs (or things that she wanted me to do), I made excuses why I can't come this weekend so she had to drive 200km to me and so on. After a while she told me we need to chill and that we will take a break (she told me that over the phone since she was in her schools city) - I didn't really know what to expect from a break so I was cool with that. Also she though that I've cheated on her since she saw some message on my phone (I swore on my life thst I didn't do anything that would count as cheating - I didn't even talk to any other girl). After 5 days I was feeling desperate that I can't talk to her, realized that I was being stupid all this time and that I need to change in order to make it work again.

After those 5 days she messaged me and told me she want's to facetime. That's when she told me she has been with other guy, she invited him to her apartment and was seeking kind and nice words from the other guy when I couldn't. And she wanted help from him on what should she do. After that she told me that she gave him a kiss and that's it. No sex, nothing, just some kisses (not even making out) and I believe her. After that she told me that she cut off all contact with him and wanted to be with me again. I also asked if she was thinking about sleeping with him and she told me that she was but was afraid of him being better than me. I couldn't believe my ears... I didn't even talk or contact any other girl when we were on our break and she does this? Idk if it is normal or something, but it really hurt me.

So, we've been together again for about a month and a half and I was really trying hard to make up for those years when I was mistreating her - we went to a luxurious hotel, we had planned some trips to neighbour countries, we did some activities, were with friends, sex was much better, I started buying her gifts (because I managed to get well paid job) and so on. About a week ago she wanted to go to her parent's for a week, because I had to work. I drove her there, we normally said bye to each other, kisses, love you, etc. Then she text me that she needs another break to sort things out since the last break was hurried up because she was worried about me (since I didnt tell my best friend about the first break and she asked him how I am and he didnt know a thing...). Now, we havent been in contact that much but I found out that she started following the guy fron the first break on her private instagram (she is an influencer so she has 2 ig's - she only has close circle of people on the private one). I've messaged her that if she want's to end it then she should do it now since I am a trainwreck atm. But she replied that if she wanted to end it she would.. But that she only needs time. Now I wanted to give her space so I didn't message her for about 2 days now but I found out that she archived our couple photos on her bigger ig.

She is still at her parent's and that guy is 200km away. Now I don't really know what to do. Should I wait till she comes with her solution/result of the break (but she might be texting to the other guy or whatever), should I message her every day so she knows that I am thinking about her.. I literally have no idea what to do. My self esteem atm is REALLY low since I always thought I was quite good boyfriend.

Oh and I forgot to mention that the reason for the second break is that she can't believe me that I mean it seriously with behaving like changed man after I was not treating her as well as I could before..

Also I should state that I wanted to propose to her this year so she really means a world to me.

373,"I met this boy; lets call him A, my last year of high school. He is half Italian and half Spanish, this comes into play later.  So we become friends the last semester of high school; mind you he is the most quiet and shy person I have ever met, and we became friends. I even developed a bit of a crush on him. We bonded over a few things in common and we were gonna go to colleges relatively near each other, but we both forgot to give our contact information to each other before we graduated. We had made plans to meet up half way between our schools and he even invited me to go to Italy with him to stay with his grandmother. 

Fast forward almost two years and a mutual friend gave him my contact information. So in February we start talking; two or three times a week until recently. We found out were both history buffs and he is a native speaker of 2 or 3 languages, everything is going good, then I realize I still like him. Right before Covid-19 got bad we were discussing going to Italy; then he said we should invite our friend E, along. Now I have found out that at one point he had a crush on E. We had also made plans to go to six flags then he said we should invite E. We talk about plans for the two of us then he said ""We should invite E and S (My best friend)""  Now here is where it gets confusing: 

For the last two weeks we have messaged everyday; now I don't like texting first all the time cuz i've been told its annoying so i'll wait to see if he messages first half the time; and he does! Not even my own family will message me first just to talk to me. If I post on my story he always sees it, and sometimes will message me and ask me if i'm free to talk. when I go to work everyday he always asks the times, and when I leave he says ""Make sure to text me when you get off"" and I do, then he asks me how my day was, and when we get off for bed he tells me to ""Text me tomorrow :) "", and if I beat him to the punch and say it, he will text first. 

He also invests time into some of my interests (not all). I like a certain building game, and will often send him photos of my builds and he will give me feed back and discuss it with me. However in turn it can be difficult to steer a conversation with him. If he doesn't want to talk about it then the answers are shorter and he will often change the subject. 

He has offered to be my tour guide in Italy. I'm not sure if he was joking a lot since I was joking about my terrible sense of direction. He has told me about places I should see in Italy and Spain. He asked me if I wanted to live abroad and joked that we should move to Italy or Spain.

A wants me to meet his family; both his grandmothers, siblings, parents. He also sends me pictures family photographs and tells me about them; as well as pictures of his grandparents house (we both love architecture). How I would love the houses (which I do), and his grandmothers. He asks me about my family, why I have so many siblings. When I explained that some are step and others are half, I told him since my parents were never married and married (technically) to other people at the time that ""In the literal since of the word I am a bastard"", mind you we had just had an in depth discussion on royal families so I was making a joke alluding to that and he got kinda defensive that I would call myself that word.

Now I keep putting out feelers, My best friend S has got a BF and now she wants me to get one. He knows that. Ill make a joke about it and he will start naming guys I know; like why don't you date \_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_He didn't seem like he was joking about that. We will talk about doing stuff its all good, then when i'm like ""yeah lets do it when the restaurants open back up,"" he will suddenly go yeah and we should invite E and S.  

It make me so happy to talk to him everyday, and I don't want to risk his friendship if he doesn't like me but he is so painfully shy and he will admit it too. I'm a shy person as well, but I mask it pretty well because that's how I was raised; so I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if he likes me or if he just a really nice guy. If he is just a nice guy and doesn't like me like that, then I don't want to loose him as a friend. He is the first guy I have liked that I could kinda see a potential future with. Because of the Covid-19 our plans to meet up have been canceled so I can't see how he reacts in person and I am going slight crazy not knowing. 

I would appreciate some advice :)

376,"I've  never had any self-esteem, and from what I can see it's impossible to  be happy without it. However, self-esteem also really seems to be one of  those things where, if you develop it normally  growing up, and then it  dips, you can build it back up. But if you never developed it all, then it's too late, as you have no foundation to build from and nobody can help you.

I'm  writing this out of desperation more than anything, in the hopes that I'm wrong, because this can't  continue. I can't endure my life the way that it is for much longer, and  I don't know how to change it.

By  way of background, I turn 37 next month. I  grew up in a very abusive   environment. My sisters and I cut our angry, controlling and emotionally abusive father out of our lives  when I was 16. We made the decision jointly, and I assure you that we  didn't make it lightly.  But my mother was angry, controlling and emotionally abusive in her own right, and  I couldn't permanently leave  her home until I was 28 because she and  one of my sisters would have been  homeless without me staying and  helping out financially. While everyone else my age was  having fun,  having  experiences that turned into stories to tell, growing  into  interesting  people who others wanted to be around, I had my mother   screaming at me  day and night about how much she hated me and wished I   was dead, and a sister who wouldn't hesitate to get physically  violent  whenever  she didn't get her own way.

Having  social life of any kind was actively discouraged in my family. My  mother did a very good job at building up walls between herself and the  big bad world, and didn't want me or my sisters to compromise those  walls by bringing untrusted people into her life. That went double when  it came to dating, to the point that my mother was furious when my older  sister, at age 26, went behind her back and started online dating. She   also  once said of my younger sister, when she was 21, ""I am so glad   that the  only people she knows are on the internet, and they're so far   away  she'll never actually meet them"". If anyone can think of a better  word than ""insanity"" to describe that statement, I'd be interested to  hear it. When my younger sister met a guy online she wanted to meet in  real life, my mother *begged* me to find a way to stop her.

I'm  badly traumatized, angry, depressed and socially incompetent. I have   no  friends, have never had a girlfriend or even lost my virginity, my  family hates me, I'm a joke to everyone I know, and when  I  meet new  people I seem to have an incredible talent for becoming a  joke  to them  very quickly. For lonely people, Reddit's standard advice always seems  to be to go to MeetUp groups in your area so you can find people with  similar interests who are also looking for people to connect with. I've  tried, but I find that there's always at least one person in any group  who quickly sees that I'm the socially-weakest and least-liked person  there, and that the easiest way they can show off to everyone else how  funny and  clever they  are is to make fun of me with one sarcastic  insult after another after another after another. What hurts the most is  how well that works. People eat  it right up,  even if you can see they  feel kind of guilty for laughing.

I've   been told to my  face before that the only reason the company I work  for keeps me around  is so everyone has someone to laugh at. I've been  told  people need to  start up a spreadsheet so they'll have an  up-to-date log  of all the  stupid shit I say. I have literally had a  crisis hotline tell  me that  the life that I described simply wasn't  worth living, and that  it was  probably too late for me to do much to  change it. That was ten years  ago this month. A couple of years after  that I had a psychologist  tell  me I needed to realize that socially I  was twenty years behind, and  that I  would never catch up. I haven't  improved since then. Am I 28  years  behind now? How the hell do you  improve from that? If it was too  late  for me then, it's sure as hell  too late for me now. Not even years  and  almost $50,000 spent on  therapy was able to help me.

If   anything, I'm in a worse place now than I was when I was told my life    wasn't worth living and it was too late for me to do much to change it.    I've gained a lot of weight. My teeth are in terrible shape. The gulf    between me and happiness is wider than it has ever been. I don't even   have happy memories. The best I have are memories of a time when I   sincerely believed that things would get better, that it was inevitable,  that it just takes longer for some people than for others. But I don't    believe that anymore. I've always just been a joke, from every school I  ever attended, to every job I've ever had, to my attempts to meet  people outside of work. The world truly seems to not want me in it.

Today she spend all day browsing about testosterone, watching trans man on youtube and stalking trans accounts. I tried to talk to her and she said that maybe she would be more happy if she was a man. She said that she want to see a psychiatrist to understand herself better.

The thing is: I’m lesbian. I don’t see my self on a relationship with a man (trans or cis) and I know that it takes a lot of time to discover yourself. I’m afraid that after 2 or 3 years she discover herself as a trans man and we have to break up, and it will be a lot harder than now.


I don’t know if we should break up now, if I should stay with her even if she transition to male... I don’t know if I would be happy, you know? I asked her  if I transitioned to male if she would still stayed with me and she told me no, because she likes women.


We were planing to move together and legally married after the pandemic but now I don’t really now what to do. PLEASE HELP ME",04Apr2020,1

\--------

I've been dating this girl for about a month now. We met on a dating site and clicked right away. During the first few days, we were already chatting for hours. Sadly, we live in different cities (although not that far away from each other) and given the current situation, seeing each other is a nightmare. We met for the first time after about 2 weeks of chatting. She was very nervous but also excited to finally see me. She has always acted very affectionate during our chats, saying things like ""I found my perfect match"" and ""how could you be so perfect, where is the catch?"". I almost felt that she is falling for me before she even sees me (I was slightly worried about this, to be honest). Then we finally met. I had to go to her place since we were not allowed to walk outside (due to the virus). I felt it might be too much for a first date and hoped it won't be weird. It wasn't. The chemistry was definitely there and we were having sex not more than 30 minutes after I showed up on her doorstep (this is unusual for me). It was all great until the next day. Then right before the moment, I had to get back home, I started overthinking (I have a big issue with that). I said some things that I shouldn't have said, mainly about our compatibility (different hobbies, different interests, etc) and whether or not we will be able to find balance. I have no idea why I did that, it was way too early. It might have been because I felt I'm starting to fall for her and panicked or because I was under a lot of stress. Anyway, I believe from that moment on, she got some red flags and started to think among the same lines too. At least that's what she told me.

In the next few days after I came back home, she was acting very different from before. She didn't seem so affectionate anymore. That changed a bit over time though and eventually almost went back to normal. We saw each other again a few days after and things were great again. She had her moments though, where it felt like she is taking a step back, but I think it might be because she is also under a lot of stress. She has problems at work, her parents are sick and not well and she definitely has a lot on her plate at the moment. I can't help but wonder though if there is another reason for her being distant towards me at times. I try to be supportive as much as can, but sometimes I just leave her be since it doesn't feel like she needs me and I don't want to be too overwhelming. She said that she has trust issues and need more time before she can know how and what she feels. On the other hand, I can't help but think about how different she acted in the first weeks and she was almost telling me that she is in love. Also I kind of believe you either feel a certain thing for someone or not. People are different though.

The third and last time we met was a few days ago and we spent some great time together again. She is always super excited and happy to see me when I visit, and it feels like she missed me. I almost told her how I feel. I didn't say ""I love you"", but I kind of said it without words. She got it. We spent 2-3 days together and ever since I got back, she acts distant again. I don't know if I scared her off if she is feeling something and she is not sure of it, if her other problems are on her way or if it's a combination of these.

I must say that I don't fall in love very often and that's why this scares me. After dating so many people who were wrong for me, I finally saw in her someone that could be that special one we always try to find. I might be wrong of course, probably too early to tell. What scares me though is that she might not feel the same anymore or never did. I plan to take a step back and give her some space, then see what happens. Probably won't suggest another in-person date for now, unless she asks for it or says she misses me. I am also preventing myself from doing any big romantic gestures (although I feel like doing them) or impulsive moves (such as going to see her without notice), because I don't want to scare her off.

Any advice or thoughts will be more than welcome. Thank you for reading through all of this! :)

PS: Not sure if that is related, but you can probably tell that I am quite emotional by nature and sometimes even romantic. She also seems that way, at least when she is not giving me mixed signals though.",04Apr2020,1
379,"I'm just going to jump right in. I apologize for the rant. I am really interested in science, technology and just learning new cool things in general. However, when I'm in the mood to sit down and learn something or read a book I fall down a rabbit hole of just adding things to the list. I know I am overwhelming myself, but it's not the only thing that is stopping me. I also have so many questions such as, 
""How much can I retain?"" 
""How much can I learn at once?"" 
""How is this going to help me?"" 
""Why do this if I forget?"" 
""Am I really interested if I cant bring myself to do it?""
(I cant bring myself to do much)
There's many more that I can't think of right now, but you get the point. Another thing worth mentioning is that I am in college for something I think I want to do and that is part of the reason for my interest in the STEM area. I guess I'm trying to find exactly what I want to do or just do it all. Sometimes I rather do this stuff than my tedious homework. Which is a separate problem.

I would really appreciate anyone's insight on my situation. I just want to be able to sit down and learn things without questions or overwhelming myself. I know theres probably many more factors like distractions, follow through, or just mindset. Nevertheless I appreciate anyone who is willing to give me any kind of advice. Thank you so much for reading and I hope everyone is doing well in this trying time of staying home!",04Apr2020,1
380,"I’m now 15 and I live with my mother. A bit of a backstory here- My father was from what I can remember awful. He sexually abused me and verbally abused my family for years. This is not about him though, he is out of my life since very far back. 
When my father wasn’t around anymore I have some memories of my mother. She used to lock me in my room, not allow me to play with other children in school and constantly hinted at me being a “freak”. She always thought I was going to sexually assault people due to my trauma. And for a 3-7 year old kid to constantly be called “like my father” and saying I’ll grow up to be like him. (Based on the theory that sexual assault as a kid makes you much more likely to be a pedophilia. 
This manifested in me as extreme self hatred and the idea that I was inherently evil. I didn’t understand what I did to deserve to be so different. A few years later there was some legal issues about if my father was going to be allowed to see my brother( my mother never had a legal case against him about the sexual abuse and therefore that happened) and my mother started going insane. 
She walked in small circles on the floor almost 24/7 and screamed, cried while doing so. That traumatized me (now about 11) and I took care of my brother even though my mother still cooked food sometimes but that was it. She didn’t go to work anymore. Here’s when the neglect started. She just didn’t clean, help with homework or even look in my general direction. I strongly remember asking her for help multiple times and her keeping on walking. I remember crying and hugging her- she just looked down so blankly. 
Because of the legal case about my brother meeting my father my mother did sometimes say something. Mostly what we should say to the social workers. We couldn’t at any point say something about the neglect we went through currently or her mental state. She kept saying that we would have to live with our dad again, without her. Never tell anyone. So that’s what me, scared for my life did. Here’s some things I strongly remember. My cat. I loved her so much. She was there for me, loved me when nobody else did. 
One day she started behaving differently, clearly in pain. She meowed loudly all the time. Walked around panicking. Her legs trembled. I got really worried so I asked my mother to take her to the vet. Over And over and over again. She just ignored it. Said cats just meow. Said my cat would be fine. There went months. Almost every day I cried to her in desperation. Please please take her to the vet. My cat just meowed louder and louder, sounding sicker and sicker for every day. She always responded the same as before. I was too young to go to the vet alone. Didn’t know how to- what legal papers to bring etc. (I’m 12 years old here) and one day I just woke up and my cat had collapsed on the floor. Dead. She wasn’t old. 
She was just killed by the neglect. I cried and cried. Went to my mother, she just looked at my cat with empty ness. Said she’ll bury her or take her to the vet. Got out a bag and laid her in it. Said she’ll do that sometime. Every day I asked her to help bury my cat, finally go to the vet. I think I slept with that bag on the side of my bed for weeks before anyone did anything. Every day I’d look down in the bag. See my cat and just say goodnight to her. Of course nobody knew. Then I’d have to live with my father, right?. Stuff like that just happened. I can barely remember when it did, just that it was around ages 11-14. What I’m wondering is, do I have any chance of a legal case/ getting social workers involved? 

She attempted suicide last Christmas and therefor got in forced treatment. She’s on medication and does the bare minimum, cleans maybe once every month and cooks food. I’ve never had any form of emotional support from her since 11 though. That disappeared, I don’t feel like I have a mother. It just feels like a shell of what I remember as being. 
I cannot get over the neglect I went through living here, in this apartment. 
But its not currently happening, can I still do something? 

Do I have to continue living here until I’m 18? 

Is any of this even severe enough or is it just something I’ll have to accept?",04Apr2020,1

385,"I’ve been in a long term relationship since I was 15 and we are going on three years now. He’s cheated a few times early in the relationship, and we’ve had some serious problems here and there, and we broke up from September to December of last year, but we’ve been relatively stable for a few months now.

One of our mutual friends who is in the military happened to come home while we weren’t together. This guy and I had been really really close friends for months. We all played games together a lot and he would call and text me all the time. One thing lead to another and we kissed a few times and held hands, all that jazz, for a day or two. Then he had to leave again. We talked semi romantically for a few weeks and some complicated shit happened and I ended up back with my bf. 

I am still friends with this military guy. So is my boyfriend.  But I feel like those feelings haven’t gone away, regardless of how much I love my boyfriend. I think about this guy a lot and I get very excited when he texts or calls me. I keep having nightmares about him dating someone else, etc. Its really weird and I’ve been trying to ignore it. I know sometimes crushes happen when you’re in long term relationships and you can ignore it and move past it, but even cutting contact with him entirely for weeks did absolutely nothing to help.

I also met this other girl [19] whom I know nothing about besides the fact that she lives in a nearby city. She send me videos on snapchat fucking her own pussy with a hairbrush and then sucking the juice of it. She wants to fuck and I have send her some bids of my own on snap too. It was really hot.

With Zach, I can have a nice conversation, we occasionally flirt with each other and everything is just fine between him and For a few months, I had fun conversations with Xavier as well, but I thought he was kinda weird. He would always ask me why I wouldn’t go on a date with him, if he wasn’t good enough for me and so on. I just ignored it, but about six weeks ago, he started a conversation about how horny he was, if I would like it if he sent some d-pics, asking for nudes etc. I was always clear with my answer, NO. So he stopped talking to me for awhile. Until three weeks ago. He asked ME if I knew what to do if his stepsister would jack him off, how horny it would be if I sent nudes, if I wanted to be horny together, I really wasn’t comfortable talking about this with him. So I asked him if we could talk about something different and then he kept asking why and why I didn’t think this was ‘kinky’. So I blocked him because he wouldn’t stop. I kept talking to Zach, because he was just really nice and never asked me anything weird. Zach and I were going to a party. I felt uneasy as I wouldn’t know if Xavier was going to be there. I texted him about it and he said no, but he wanted to know the reason why, so I told him about the texts his cousin sent and how uncomfortable it made me feel. He asked if I had any proof. I said no because I really didn’t. Zach then started texting his cousin about it. His cousin literally said that he didn’t know me and that I was making it up. Luckily, Zach believed me because he knew that his cousin was texting me. Honestly, Xavier was just trying to get out of it. I asked Zach if Xavier was going to be in trouble, he replied with: of course he is! He can’t just say things to you that make you uncomfortable. I feel really bad for Xavier because I didn’t want to ruin their relationship with each other and I am questioning if I should’ve even said it to him. It was really bothering me and I was feeling down because of it, I just thought that he could help me the best because they know each other. It got me quite upset because I hadn’t been in that kind of situationt before and I didn’t know how to deal with it. Did I do the right thing?

404,"My girlfriend and I live in a shared house in London UK with a flatmate who isn’t following the government guidelines regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.

For the last 3 weeks we have been isolating together and only leaving the house for essential food shopping or exercise. Our housemate is leaving the house at least twice a day and visiting the supermarket every day. He also takes care of his young daughter every two days for 48 hours. I understand his need to care for his daughter but he is also taking her to the supermarket every day which is increasing risk of transmission.

He spoke to us earlier in the week about his wishes to visit his girlfriend (not the mother of his child) in another major UK city. We advised him that this wouldn’t be wise on 3 occasions.

Regardless of our advice, he travelled last night on public transport to visit his girlfriend. Using a forged NHS employee Identification Card to avoid being stopped by the police etc. 

Just before he left we again informed him of our issue with the situation, and requested that no one else is to enter our shared house. He then informed me that his girlfriend would be coming to stay with us next week, which I said would be an issue and that I was not happy with that situation at all.

I called the Non-Emergency police line last night for advice, and the officer explained that although we are on lockdown, the government haven’t given the police the authority to track or apprehend reported individuals. He advised that we stay inside and refuse entry to the property if he tried to bring his girlfriend into the household.

This is causing my girlfriend and I a huge amount of stress and uncertainty about how to proceed. We were due to move out of the property this month but that’s been put on hold due to the lockdown.

    Anyway, while she was living here 5 years ago they together took on the responsibility of 2 dogs, pure bred cane corsos to be clear. 2 years after that , they discussed breeding the dogs and agreed to taking on the responsibility of that and kept 2 of the puppies. That makes 4 dogs over 100 pounds each. I was told about everything of course and took on some responsibility for them as a member of the household however I was not part of the decision making and neither was my brother. 

   My dads girlfriend as I stated is a trust fund baby and doesn't work and never has. So the responsibility of watching all 4 dogs during the a day was always covered even though more often than not they were locked in cages so she could go boredom shopping at Marshall's.  My dad, my brother and myself all work full time.  At differing hours from each other. She has moved out because she doesn't want the responsibility for  caring for them anymore and now all the responsibilities have been dumped on us to share. She still wants to date my father just not live with the responsibilities she agreed to with him. For rotating days we pretty much have care covered but now I feel trapped.

  I have been saving for years for a down payment on my own home with my longtime boyfriend . I have been looking for a new job aswell before all this changed and now unless I somehow find a job that will match my random schedule I have now at a job that I make good money at but I have been ready to move forward from , I'm stuck.

I love the dogs so much of course and I love my dad but I don't want to put my life on hold until he has retired or the dogs pass away however it seems I have no other option.  Either stay indefinitely and help the man who has always been there for me, at the expense of my personal growth or move on with my life and abandon my family. 

Any advice is appreciated",04Apr2020,1
406,"Hi there,

So a friend of mine has previously told me that he is depressed. We aren't super good friends or anything, we know eachother from being in the same class 3 years ago and now we occasionally dm eachother memes and stuff. I don't know anything about him really so I can't reach out to his parents.

 One day we were joking and laughing because he cut up his thumb ""accidentally"" in a really dumb way so we were making fun of how dumb it was when he suddenly told me that it wasn't an accident and he did it on purpose. Then he blurted out that he  was actually depressed. 

He hasn't told his parents and as far as I know I'm the only person that he told this.  Ofcourse I told him that I'd be there for him and that he could always talk to me and that I'm ready to support him and he thanked me but here's the thing: I know he wants to talk about it with me because he sends me all of these depressed quote pictures. (Kind of like the im14andthisisdeep stuff but like not funny and actually sad if he really thinks that way) I don't know how to respond to them. If he straight up talked to me instead of sending these vague pictures then I'd know how to support him but right now, all I do is wait until he sends me something that I can reply to which is usually a meme and I feel like an awful person because of it.

 I feel horrible about it and I don't want him to feel like I'm ignoring him when he's trying to reach out. Does anyone have any advice on what to do when he sends that stuff?",04Apr2020,1

408,"A semi long explanation/question about job related drama and much needed panic advice.

So I have worked for this veterinary Hospital for over 2 years, my boss has always been unrealistic and cruel most times without seeming to care about the employees very much if at all. We have had a full staff change over many many times and my coworker and I have been the longest techs there and have trained all of the newer people, recently weve had to cut down to part time because of the hours we have for schooling conflict with our work hours. All of the people we recently trained are very new at vet med by only a few months. Due to Covid 19, all of the part time people were laid off until an unknown date, the letter states that I understand if you need to find another job instead of coming back during this time. This leaves only 2-3 brand new techs running appointments and working full days with no lunches with no slow down in appointments. They also make the least money out of anyone there.
Next thing I do is file for unemployment with the 3 other people who were laid off with me, has taken about 2 weeks to go through and havent recieved a card yet to begin paying the bills that I have but it is at least processed. Then yesterday morning I revieve a text from my manager asking me to come back in and work 5 and a half days a week which I cannot do because school also begins on monday as well, just over online courses. I am then offered to work Tuesdays and Thursdays which are the main days that I am attending online lectures, so I decline that one. I am then told that if I decline these hours that I am no longer going to receive unemployment from them and will have to look for another job because I'd technically be ""quitting"" when I in fact am already laid off and on I employment. 

The days may be flexible I was told but some weeks I may not be called in, and it is less hours than I originally had even at part time, I was also told that if the pandemic is still going on at the beginning of may, they've hired a new full time person after we were laid off to start then and wed all be laid off until further notice again. I also found out her boyfriend has been applying for Grant's for her during this time and I believe she is trying to hire us all back for as little time as possible in order to file for a grant for not having us laid off and then also stop paying our unemployment 

I would like to know what grounds she has to cancel my unemployment if I reject what I see as a job offer during this time? That does not at all sound like a win for me, regardless of the hours I do not want to be laid off again in a months time, the unemployment process was very time consuming to go through during this time and I do not want to have to do it again. I feel if I reject it i will be unemployed with no benefits and have to find a job that puts my families health and my health at risk during this time. However if I accept, I feel like I am being manipulated in to taking my position back purely so I dont receive benefits during this. My boss also did not contact me directly, instead had my manage simply text me and call me about this so there is no offer in writing directly from her stating any offer at all, but I do have a signed letter from her laying me off and saying I can look for another job if i need to. Any help or advice would help out a lot.",04Apr2020,1
409,"On paper, my life is great. I'm 19 years old, I have wonderful parents and siblings and a great home. I have a long term girlfriend who I love with all my heart, I have a great group of friends and I study engineering in University. To me, it seems like I really can't complain. 

However, I never feel motivated to do anything. My sister always encourages me to exercise with her, I just say no. In the midst of the lockdown all my college work has moved online, I haven't done a single assignment in weeks. All I do everyday is wake up at 1pm, lie in bed for an hour or two, get angry when my parents come into my room to tell me to get up, eventually get up and immediately go to the TV to watch endless hours of mindless YouTube videos, go to work at 6 (pizza boy) then come home at 12, go to bed at 4 after more hours of mindless YouTube videos and repeat.

I have no motivation to do anything productive. I just feel like I'm simply existing, and not living. I don't know where to start. I just needed to reach out to someone, somewhere. Please, if you have any advice for me, I really could use it right about now. Thanks",04Apr2020,1
410,"I'm obsessed with cats, but the thing with pets is that usually you will have to bury them at some point, not the other way around. When my cat died about a year ago, it hit me like a truck. This is rough for everyone of course, but due to mental health issues I entered a very dark and scary place.

Fast forward till today, it so happened that a new cat found her way here and I'm already completely attached. It might be due to issues or just being weird, but somehow I always feel a stronger connection with an animal pet than even with close relatives or a partner.

Anyway long story short, I wonder what I can do if one day this cat is again gone, or should I just not think about it at all?

418,"So a few months ago I got a tinder account and for months I just swiped on guys but didn't go out with any of them because I wasn't convinced. Around the end of February, I matched with this guy and from the get-go, we hit it off. We exchanged numbers and decided to meet up and get a coffee so we could see if we hit it off also in person. The first weekend of March we met up and there was so much chemistry I was stunned, it was like we had known each other for years. I was also surprised by how respectful he was because I had checked out his Instagram before, and he looked like a total fuckboy, so I kind of expected him to be very forward from the start but he wasn't, he was the sweetest. When it was time for us to go our separate ways he said he wanted to see me again and we said goodbye and when I started to walk away he said ""wait"", walked up to me and kissed me. It was great and I was super happy because I felt like I had found someone that I actually liked after a long time of not being interested in anyone (I'm kinda picky when it comes to guys). The next day he texted me and we talked a little, all throughout the date and the texts of the day after he kept commenting things that we could do together in the future (he mentioned teaching me how to play the guitar and things like that) and I thought it was a good sign. That next week we talked about meeting up again and he seemed very interested on seeing me again because he asked several times, but our schedules didn't really align so it didn't happen and that same weekend, my whole town went on lockdown because of the whole corona thing, so now there was no chance of meeting up. He texted me a couple of times the first week of the lockdown, but by the second week I tagged him on something and he replied asking me something, but when I answered the question he didn't reply, to which I thought ""no big deal"". We are on our third week of lockdown and I tried texting him a few days ago. At first, he responded very enthusiastically and said how we hadn't talked in a long time, then I asked him how he was doing and he sent me a voice note telling me and asked me what I had been doing the last few days, so I sent a voice note back and he has never responded, it been a few days and he keeps posting on Instagram. He hasn't even opened it. He's done this before, he responds very enthusiastically and then eventually stops responding and cuts off the conversation. I don't understand, he seemed very keen to see me again before the lockdown and when we talk I do feel like he's interested in me but then he doesn't respond and I start doubting. Could it maybe be the lockdown? Could he have lost interest in me? I know it was just a good tinder date and if it doesn't work out it doesn't, but I just can't stop thinking about it because I don't understand what's going on, maybe if I understood I would get some peace of mind (let's also take into account that I've been locked in my house for 3 weeks and we still have a few more weeks to go, so I have a lot of time to overthink things).

423,"My friend, who I have been close to for several years, has started acting passive aggressively to me despite me not doing anything to him that would incur this. For example, a few days ago during a conversation about hair conditioner which turned into a conversation about how he took short showers, I said, “you take short showers??” to which he replied, “yeah, bc i actually got shit to do.” I felt like that was underhanded, although I could be overreacting. Also, occasionally he would make comments about my body, saying that I’m skinny in a condescending manner. He knows I’m very insecure about my body. 

About 2 years ago, junior year, during our kinesiology class when we were playing catch with some other friends, I made an attempt to catch a football, but I fumbled it and it went straight into his face and hit his glasses. He was furious and kicked me twice telling me to fuck off and saying “no wonder you’re a failure” in front of our friends and his gf. I walked away trying to hold back my tears. No apology afterwards. (Just a little backstory, he is known to have anger issues and has hit people for the smallest issues).

Recently, he posted to his private account restricted to “close friends” only, saying that he has no “real” friends despite us being there for him everytime he needed it despite his actions in the past. About 2 weeks ago, us “fake” friends drove about 10 hours from LA to SF to get him out of SF before he gets stranded there due to the lockdown which in turn caused him to get kicked out of his college dorms. This trip wasn’t cheap as a college student. I had to buy a rental which costed me the rest of my financial aid. I know money doesn’t buy friendships, but damn that was a lot (~$100 not counting the down payment which was an extra $100). I didn’t even ask for him to pay me back. He also posted on his private account about his financial situation and saying “to all the people who have parents with money, this is the reality for broke people like me. sorry you can’t get your fucking boba but i have to deal with housing insecurity and no money to pay for basic necessities.” I feel for him, however, he called me out specifically and it was so unnecessary. It was indirect, but he knew what he was doing. In our friend group, we like to joke about me getting boba often, although i only get it occasionally.

424,"I am currently a first year engineering student. I also have a scholarship from a government-funded organization (luckily). I am even planning to run for student councik for the next academic year despite how my seniors have said that the 2nd year of chemical engineering in our uni will be one of the hardest.

Quarantine has been the equivalent of me having nothing to do for weeks during summer vacation and me ending up reflecting too much and feeling and thinking about many things about myself.

I wanted the challenge and made the promise to myself to study Math and Chemistry in advance to keep up with my studies, hence, choosing the course.

I originally wanted to take a course on theater performance arts back in early high school, but we were reminded early on how it's our best bet to choose a career path that has more certainty to it: finance-wise, majorly. I wanted to my job to consist of my passion of singing and performing in front of an audience... but at the same time, I thought about how it may ruin the fun for me since it will be my source of income.

Yet, I can't keep up with the pace that my classmates have. I don't have this study habit because I always let laziness win over me. The anticipation, making everything seem negative. I hate this about myself, because I feel greatly towards this with academics-- the thing I should be improving on and preparing for even in quarantine... I made it barely alive in my first Calculus subject, and in our second semester, I'm still doing what I did last time, with only a bit of more activity compared to last time.

I am now questioning myself about my decisions. But I guess my studies is not a question because I want a diploma for myself, even if it's just a bachelor's degree. I have come to a point this year that I don't want to excel in anyway with this course and line of job: I just wanted to finish my studies and make myself free and explore what I really want.

Somehow, the thought and feeling of being under a spotlight satisfies me. I want to be a known person somehow. YouTube has been intriguing me since 2013 when I discovered its magical world. The first and last content I made was back in 2015 when I did a cover of Hunter Hayes' Invisible. I think I did not have the confidence to do anymore content. Whenever I come across that video which had less than a thousand views, something sparks in my heart. Passion.

But it always dies. This quarantine, I have already thought of 2 ideas to post. Every month, I will have some idea about a content that I want to work on and post... but nothing has manifested. 

I feel dry when I try hard to achieve.

I feel so lowkey angry at myself to just settle with the happiness I gain when watching other content creators, and leaving myself with nothing created.

""What sparks joy in you?"" that's the phrase that has been echoing through my mind for some days now.

Now, I don't know.

He was cool to just chill with and a good cuddler. About three weeks later, he messaged me again and I asked why he stopped talked to me. He gave some weird answer and then stopped messaging me again. I wasn’t even upset when I asked, I was just curious.

I'm not the type to send 3-5 messages if I don't get a reply either as I wait for them to reply or initiate again.

Now , I wouldn't say I'm bad at texting because whenever we do text , everything is light and happy which often leads them to laugh , ask questions or carry on the conversation to an extent . 

Why is it then that eventhough everything seems to go well over text that they aren't as interested as they usually are ? Am I maybe just a big bore ? Lol.  This quarantine thing isn't helping too as usually I'd see them on campus quite often .",04Apr2020,1
434,"In this Quarantine world, we rarely have any privacy. 

so I guess I should get this started with the fact that I have a boyfriend I haven't told my family about, only because its new and I don't want to jinx it. 

I'm 21, and I live alone at college in another city- I have my own apartment but I'm home because of corona. 

my baby sister and I watch Netflix together on my laptop pretty regularly and because I have the WhatsApp app my messages pop up, she's 8 so I don't really care bc its rarely anything spicy however I had not noticed that she had memorised the password to my phone, so when I went to the kitchen to get us some snacks she unlocked my password and went through my messages with my boyfriend that included nudes, when I walked in she dropped my phone and asked why I was sending pictures like this? 

I was angry and disappointed. im abut scared she'll tell my mom but over and above that I feel violated? is that the word. I've told her not to touch my phone on multiple occasions and she just didn't care. 

so I told her she's not allowed to touch my phone or laptop anymore 

and that im an adult so I can send pictures of my body to whoever I trust 

but now im worried I didn't handle it in the correct way? so what do I do?",04Apr2020,1

Not for me, because once I get used to it my brain just goes someplace else and I can't stop the thoughts or my brain is extremely foggy. I may have ADHD and some other issues that impair my cognitive function. This is a self diagnosis though and right now I don't have the means for therapy or meds. It's just that it's been going on for longer than a decade and every time I try to study I am scared and self critical of not able to focus well and progress in my learning. I say this because, I learned the same material for 4 days and yet I couldn't recall.or retain most of it and I felt ashamed. Like I'm not trying hard enough or I'm not taking this serious, as outsiders may think. Which cusses me doubt myself more and feel anxious. I tried using apps to organize, plan, and for time management. 

Also, i read a lot of the advice for ADHD is to focus on one task at a time and worry about other later which is great to an extent. For me, I'm more of a big picture oriented person so if there's too much of zooming in, I have to zoom out at some point and see how this tiny task connects to the bigger picture or the end goal but I haven't figured out a way to do that without complicating things.",04Apr2020,1

Not really friends at all. Not only that, but they’re just straight up asking for entire assignments. It’s a sticky situation because one of the people is my friends gf.

Right now people are flooding to supermarkets on mass and that includes the sick and I'm quite frankly terrified of catching the virus.I figure the worst places for infections apart from the hospital would be supermarkets because everyones got to eat and not everyone cares about potential spreading a virus.

I have applied for centerlink (goverment assistance)and in about 2 weeks I will begin to receive money from the goverment.I didn't apply for this job my sisters partner did it for me through a friend and I'm scared of rejecting this job because of those reasons.I have the money to survive the 2 weeks before I would recieve the centerlink payments.I have been applying for work but I have been selective about what I have been applying to reduce the risk.

Background of what happened a while back:
-I had been texting X often, and was confused why I hadn’t heard back from X in a month.
-Turns our X blocked our numbers, all social media accounts, except one platform for one of the current members(Y) . 
-X proceeded to let Y know how toxic we all were. X said some pretty hurtful things that cut me deeply.

Current day, X has reached back out to Y saying that they are sorry for what happened and was wondering if we hate them/ if we would be open to talking.

441,"My mom (60) I think may be overly stressed and have some issues I don’t understand and is pushing me (30) away.

Let me start by saying my mother is 60, my dad is 83. My husband (35) and I (30) moved in with them a few years ago when my dad started declining in health and needed a few extra eyes. My husband and I work from home, so when she was gone we would check in on him and such. 

My aunt recently moved in (my parents have 4,400 sq feet so it’s roomy for all of us) and she’s been helping with my father since she does not work. 

I think the stress of watching her husband become more and more dependent has been tough and she has spent less and less time with him. She gets angry at him because of his condition when she’s very stressed. 

Last night, there was a whole debacle with my cat scratching my aunt and my mom said I had to get rid of my cat of 7 years. I explained I wanted to look at all options (including us moving out) before saying I’m getting rid of her. She took this as a threat and has been telling me all day to go off and be happy. Super passive aggressive. I have tried to tell her that I want to discuss all options because if she needs me there still, I will look at rehoming options. Well, somehow it kept coming back to me just getting rid of my cat and not just saying yes. She screamed at me, my dad, my husband and my aunt when we all tried to calm her down. She also tried to leave and say she needs a 30-90 day break. She was screaming about getting her keys and just leaving. Her bags are packed so who knows what she will do.  If she stays, She said she’s just going to put my dad in a nursing home next week. 

I’m trying to give grace because I think she’s stressed with her job and my dad. I am not in a position to be a full time caregiver. But, I’m really angry. A lot of these things I can’t unhear and I have a hard time thinking I’m going to forgive. 

I also have a lot of guilt leaving my dad with her. When we leave, no one will be there to defend him if she’s in a bad mood or tell her she’s being cruel. When it’s good our family unit is great, but I feel like a line was drawn in the sand and I don’t think there’s a lot of going back for me. 


TLDR: my mom had a serious freak out at everyone living with her to be her support system.  I have never seen someone so irrational and irate when people were trying to explain their feelings. The problem is, my 83 year old father is being taken care of by her and I can’t tell if she’s just about to have a mental breakdown.",04Apr2020,1
442,"For about the past week ever since this quarantine I’ve been unable to sleep at night with the lack of a schedule. I lay in bed for hours- no phone, no tv, no anything, just staring at a ceiling until next thing I know it’s 8 AM and it’s not worth it anymore.

I consistently pass out during the middle of the day sometime between 2 PM and 5 PM and try as I might I haven’t been able to stay awake throughout the day without this happening to me. When I wake up around 10 PM the cycle always repeats.

I want to fix this so badly. I feel like a total mess and it’s affecting my hygiene and eating schedule as well. Laying in bed at night being 100% unable to sleep is absolute torture but I’ve been trying for weeks and just can’t seem to find any solution other than trying and failing to stay awake throughout the day after one of these al-nighters each night.

My mom just tells me to go to sleep earlier- go figure, and prescribed medication is sort of out of the question right now. I sleep through alarms and melatonin and niquil won’t work no matter what.

448,"I am becomming mad. I live in Bavaria/Germany and this whole quarantine-thing is making me going nuts. I understand the issue and it's importance, but it fucks my psyche up so badly and I have no clue of what to do about it. 

The winter here was totally garbage, no real snow (I live in the alps, so there SHOULD be plenty) and constantly changing temperatures. Now the spring arrived and with it came Corona, to make it kind of impossible o go outside. 

I am a person that grew up with a lake right next to me (still live close to there), so sunbathing was always a must do to feel good for me. Swimming, maybe drinking a beer with friends, or at least, just simple sunbathing. Last year we had to move into a flat that doesn't have a garden and our balcony doesn't even get one photon of direct sunlight. When the sun is out I am used to going outisde, doing stuff with friends or just simply lay down and enjoy the sun. Now I can do none of it and I couldn't even enjoy the winter, since it was just a rainy shit show. I am starting to feel really depressed and none but my boyfriend understands. 

Everyone I talk to has at least a sunny balcony or a fucking garden and they can chill in the sun all day. It drives me insane. 

I am in my flat, looking outside and wondering what the sun would feel like on my skin..  I think I am seriously becoming depressed from this stupid corona-asshole. 

Now what drives me truly insane, is that for example my boyfriend, his father and his stepsister all see each other at work. I live with my boyfriend. His father, stepsisters* and his stepmom all live together in a big farm-house with plenty of space. 

So if I had the virus, my bf would get it and so would his work colleagues, so to say his dad and sisters* and they would transfer it to their mom anyway. 
If they see eah other daily anyway, why can't we just fucking go over to them and enjoy the sun with them? It's not even allowed with safety-distance, wich I would have no problem with.

What I am trying to say, we are a cluster anyway, so why are the rules so stupidly designed.. I am getting so depressed and angry looking outisde and imagening all the people that can enjoy the sun right now. Two weeks ago we could at least sit down in the middle of a field (I live in no mans land) and enjoy the sun together (me + bf), now, even that is forbidden. We wouldn't even see someone from distance the whole day. I hate it all.

Sorry I just needed to vent and hoped, that someine could help me to calm the f down and explain to me, why it's illegal to visit our family even if they are working together anyway.

Even after emailing them with a page long email about how this COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and causing a massive amount of uncertainty, they wouldn't budge on the 60 day notice. So frankly I'm screwed. I have no idea what will happen in a month, much less 2 months from now.

Hell, I'm worried about my job too. I work in the financial services industry so we're considering essential. My company lends to higher risk borrowers though,: people with marginal credit &amp; income, so a significantly higher portion of our business is situated for Loss Mitigation. However, in 2 days of April we've already reached the average for the number of Loss Mitigation inquiries for an entire month, meaning people are requesting forbearances and extensions or are a few paychecks away from bankruptcy and are trying to save their homes. Obviously my company's business model was created for higher risk borrowers but this is unprecedented. I'm deeply worried that once this Coronavirus dust settles, my company might be hurting badly.

461,"I’m a 19-year-old male and I don’t think it’s normal at my age to not have a group of friends that you do stuff with. It’s weird and I’m not a fan of being like this anymore. it’s an issue that has been bothering me for a good two years now, and I’ve been unable to find a solution to it, or motivate myself to constantly, step-by-step work on this issue, due to my lack of success.

Let me get the first point out of the way. Even though I’ve been living in a certain country for 15 years now (where I live my day-to-day life), I don’t have a “friend group”, unlike like my home country where I have 3 solid people I hang out with, even though I only go there once or twice a year.

When I talk to people; initially, I get along fine with them, but then, for some reason, that relationship just ends. Even if I get along completely fine with that person it always has to be me who has to message them first, and I’m done with that, there’s just no effort to maintain that relationship from the other side.

As of now, I have no idea on how to move forward and make some connections. I haven’t kept in contact with people who I went sixth form or secondary school with, because it’s always me who had to message first and not them, which I got frustrated of doing, so I've stopped.

I’ve had my parents talk to me about this, and when they asked “why?”, I honestly couldn’t tell the way. I also told them that, in terms of a career I’m pretty lucky compared to others for my age, but I’m not lucky in relationships. For others, fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, it’s the complete opposite.

Everyone who I’ve talked to about this says that I should join a club, gym, etc, and that “I’ll meet some cool people”. However, when I do, this never happens, it always seems to happen to others which is frustrating. Also, with COVID-19, the issues aren't much help as currently, we're in lockdown. 

I have no problem in talking to people when I have to, but approaching people “just like that”, seems a bit hard. People here, on Reddit, have said that I should look at myself, and see what I can add to the relationship, and honestly, I don’t know what, apart from being loyal, and random at times – which I guess is something looking at it.",04Apr2020,1
462,"I'm a fresh graduate who started my first job as an environmental 3 weeks ago. I keep making mistakes and it's weighing me down.

On the first day, I was given a project to lead by myself. I was just told what to do generally so I went off based on what I've learnt in school. My first submission was cut so severely it couldn't even be recognised.

The work I'm doing is pretty familiar because it's what I studied. Unfortunately, many parts of what I'm taught doesn't tally with my assignments. How things are done in my school are ridiculous to my company (and my school would find their methods appalling). It's understandable since it's environmental academic research vs applied research.

But it just sucks because I feel like my bosses expect me to know how they do things, and I'm just flailing. But everything I submit is just full of errors and my boss is getting exasperated with me. He repeatedly raising his voice, asking me to use more thought when doing things and was seemingly forcing a laugh when I ask questions, like ""yikes"". I passed it off as me being sensitive/him being stressed from the virus hitting our company, but for all I know, he may mean it.

There's no job training but they're guiding me in the sense that when I don't know something, I should ask them. They'll review what I've done and send it back.

The damning part is that **I don't know what I don't know.** I'm thrown in blind into the project, and the only way I can do it is to use the framework I used in school. But that framework doesn't fit well, so **all I can do is just make mistakes, get it pointed out and learn from them**. But even the mistakes I learn from are context-dependent, so trying to apply what I've learnt doesn't go well.

I want to ask at every step to confirm if I'm doing it right so I don't waste time and my boss doesn't waste time, but I don't want to be seen as dependent -- which I've been getting that vibe from my boss. Yet, doing things on my own based on my knowledge keeps turning out wrong.

I'm love this style of learning -- trying, making a truckload of mistakes and then learning from there. I thought it was normal for me to make mistakes (except some careless ones). I'm not supposed to know how to email a client if you randomly ask me to -- that's why I need to ask so you'd tell me what to specify (Project ID, Project Vendor, etc.). I don't know all the ways my company sets up field testing, so how am I supposed to design a whole experiment without having examples? I shouldn't know these things.

But the way my boss is reacting makes me wonder if *I'm* the one who's too spoilt and not trying harder. There's a huge database of hundreds of projects that I was given access to. I'm trying to look through all of them, but it's so difficult to catch all the little details that become errors in my project. I follow what they do, I get told I shouldn't. When I make a mistake, they refer to this project and that project and I get embarrassed because I should have read it, right?

I'm trying my best not to be negative and just work harder, because I know perception is key, but it keeps bugging me so I'd really appreciate any advice. I'm starting to dread submitting anything else because I just know they'll come back full of errors with my boss exasperated.",04Apr2020,1

There is so much more I can get into, but this gives you the jist of it. We have exhausted all of our options, and my mom has no plans on kicking him out, because her parents did that to her and she does not want him to have to be homeless like she was, and even the counselors agreed with her, its not a healthy thing to do, but we have run out of ideas.

466,"I’ve been friends with this girl online on and off for 6 years. By on and off I mean I go off social media for periods of time sporadically for no other reason than I’m flighty. We’ve recently reconnected after another one of my notorious disappearances and boy did I forget how needy she is. I used to talk to her mostly on twitter (which I didn’t check daily) and now we chat mostly on fb (which I habitually check multiple times a day). I’m constantly getting messages. Upwards of 20 a day sometimes. They come in near constantly throughout the day. 3 in a row. One an hour later. 1 every 10 minutes for an hour and a half. So, so many. Once she sent me 14 1 minute voice messages in a row ranting about how McDonald’s wouldn’t give her ranch for her nuggets. I’ve turned off my notifications and muted her convo but I still get notifications daily because she calls and says it’s the only way her messages go thru. I cannot handle it. I’m autistic and introverted on top of that and the constant barrage of messages can send me into sensory overload. It’s too much stimulation. I can’t respond to the messages as soon as they come in. Sometimes I have to go days or a week without replying but usually I try to respond every other day. It can be a day ruiner. I wasn’t built for constant communication. The thought of it tires me, even with a partner. The thing is though in all of her messages it’s all about her. What’s she’s eating, what show she’s watching, what her mom’s doing, screenshots of posts her teacher makes who I don’t even know. All of this wouldn’t be a problem if we were having a conversation. But we aren’t. She’s talking at me, not to me. I can barely get a word in edgewise. All I say is “wow! That’s crazy!” “Oh no! I’m so sorry!” and other small comments agreeing with whatever she says. If I try to talk about something I like or tell her about my experience related to what she’s saying she brushes it off quickly and gets back to her story. For the time we’ve known each other this is how it’s always been. She hardly knows anything about me other than my name and what I look like. I know she’s lonely and needs someone to talk to but I can’t be what she needs. Do I tell her I need space? If so, how could I say it without hurting her feelings and making her feel like a burden? Do I break off our friendship? I don’t know how she sees me but I don’t feel as if she’s a close friend more like just someone online who messages me. Do I keep my mouth shut and put up with it? Also, AITA for feeling this way about her?",04Apr2020,1
467,"My best friend from high school and I finally got together after years of being friends. Sadly, a couple of days since, we've been under lockdown. It sucks that we can't see each other and it's an all new territory for us, considering the jump we've made from best friends to dating.

Now, however, we text a lot during the day and call whenever we can but I'm scared we'd run out of things to talk about before we meet again as we're both pretty awkward people.

472,"Hello everyone!

So to start with, I am working for a company that requires plastic free solutions. They are looking for ideas to either reduce plastic, recycle it or completely eliminate it from packaging. They sell face wash, hand wash and shampoos. So I have some rough ideas in mind, and I would love to have your input on them. Also, if you have your idea of own in solving this problem, I would be grateful if you share it too.

So my ideas for now are:

1. A single bottle with multiple compartments for different fluids i.e. shampoo, hand wash and face wash. It will save the plastic used in packaging by reducing plastic used in multiple packaging to one. Also the bottle will be designed to access one compartment at a time by rotating the lid (I hope you can imagine it that way I have).
2. Shampoo and stick : This is cylindrical stick just like a mentos one with multiple cylindrical tablets stacked onto one another. The tablets can be converted to shampoo by rubbing it between the palm of hands.
3. Tablets : This is similar to the previous one, just that this time tablets of different colors for different fluids will be contained in one packaging.
4. Tab attachment : This is a device that will attach to the tap. It has removable filled compartment that can be purchased separately. 

So this is all I have come up in 2 days. I would love your suggestions and if these aren't good enough, please let me know what you think should be done.",04Apr2020,1

483,"Hello everyone,

Getting right into the situation, my current Amazon warehouse site now has 8 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and it’s growing fast, and Amazon shows no sign of slowing/shutting down. They just add more intensive cleaning...

My grandmother has been living with me for the past few weeks, she’s 89 years old and is the most strong-willed, badass lady I’ve ever met, and I love her a lot. She was unfortunately diagnosed with bone cancer a week ago and has been undergoing radiation every day to reduce a tumor on her head. 

The position I’m in at Amazon forces me to stay in the presence of large groups of people regularly. In fact, I’m one of the people that are in charge of on-boarding new associates into the building. With this new high demand, we’re bringing in around 200 new people in a week, and have been doing so for the past month.

I know it sounds stupid and that the answer is clear, but the team I’m on is only a group of a few people, so if I were not to show up, they’d be screwed, and they’d probably hate me. On top of that, the position I have is a seasonal position, aka (temporary), but I’m supposed to get my final interview this coming Monday to solidify my spot in that position.

I don’t want to go to work anymore for the health of my family. Because if I were to get my grandmother sick, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. I have a decent amount in my savings so I can afford not to work, but I have a lot of anxiety when making that call to my manager telling him I’m not coming In anymore.

488,"Two weeks ago, I was asked to volunteer in an important local government position overseeing the distribution of medical supplies to health care providers for the COVID pandemic. My director recommended me for the position. While I’m great as a specialist in what I do, it takes time for me to learn things and being thrust into this new position as a manager in logistics for medical resources that have no experience in, I feel like I am not succeeding and it’s causing a lot of distress. 

In the beginning, I met resistance from a new female colleague who refused to share information with me so that I could learn my job. That has been sorted out now, I think. But the job is very stressful and I feel like I cannot handle it. For the first time, I feel like I cannot be a leader. I struggle a lot with my relationships with co workers and taking the lead. I’m just so damn timid. I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes and concerned about pleasing people. I told my colleague that I just want to help out and support her. 

I’m an introvert and I dread the briefings in the morning. Lately, I’ve been having a legitimate excuse not to be there because I’ve been needed elsewhere. Also, i don’t have numbers to give them because I was just able to get them an accurate inventory of everything we have. My colleague was estimating the numbers of supplies before I came in. We don’t have enough man power, just me doing inventory for these millions of supplies and that colleague filling orders. I’m overwhelmed. After realizing the situation we are in, I’m planning on speaking to the logistics chief Monday for help. I can’t do inventory by myself. It’s labor intensive because the supplies are shipped to us  in odd stacks so I have to break down each pallet and restack boxes to count them easier. All. By. Myself. Also, the warehouse only allows limited number of people inside as it’s a non-profit org kindly allowing us to use their space. 

I don’t have confidence in myself. The job itself is new to me and is not my usual job, I have to keep track of all medical supplies and resources for this position that I was asked to help out in. I feel defeated and scared. I’m also Asian and petite and I look young. One nurse said I’m so soft spoken and yelled that I need to speak up when I asked to use a printer.

490,My sister wants to get tic tok how do u stop her before the corruption reaches her,04Apr2020,1
491," I know the title makes it sound like I'm a huge fuckup . . . and maybe I am.

In the latter half of 2018, during my first semester of senior year, I had a talk with my parents: I didn't see it in the cards to be able to apply to college in time for the fall semester of 2019, and asked what they thought about me taking a gap year. They were receptive and understanding to the idea, so I got a job as a delivery driver/cashier at Panera and have been working consistently since then. I tell all the relatives that ask about college that I'm working at my job and on my portfolio (I'd like to go to art school), and plan to go to school this fall of 2020.

Here's the problem. I know it makes me sound like a lazy piece of shit, but working all day and coming home to my parents' cozy house means applying to colleges is the last thing I feel like doing on a daily basis. I help with chores, I keep my room clean, I pay for gas, and I successfully avoid thinking about the future and how fast time is slipping by.

Then, last week over breakfast, my mom said, ""I don't know where you are in the college application process, but this fall, you need to go somewhere.""

Don't get me wrong -- I want very much to move out and go to college. But over the weeks and months I've become complacent and forgotten the urgency of my situation, and now its April and I've managed to not apply to a single school. Most of the admission deadlines to the colleges I was looking at have passed. Plus, I still need letters of recommendation and time to fill out scholarships -- and I wouldn't be mad at extra time to pad out my portfolio.

With my time off work due to COVID-19 I've been working feverishly to reevaluate my list of colleges to see which ones would still take me, as well as looking at community colleges I'd previously have turned up my nose at. Then, slowly losing hope, I've been looking at places to live and [roommates.com](https://roommates.com/). I have $3,000 in my bank account. If I build up a credit score, maybe I could find some roommates in Memphis or another cheap city so I can move out this fall but go to college in the fall of 2021? Then again, that's a stupid waste of money -- even if it's uncomfortable, it is infinitely more cost effective and efficient to beg for another year at my parents house so I can try again at the college process. Besides, maybe the pandemic going on is throwing the fall semester into question anyway!

This is the decision I need advice on. I don't know where to go or what to do. I know this situation is my own fault, and believe me, I'll apologize to my parents regardless of what I choose to do -- but I do need to be able to tell them what my plans are (and beg for mercy if need be). Are there any options I've overlooked? Is it reasonable to find an apartment so I can stop burdening my parents? Is there still a chance to get into college?

Thanks for reading this far. Let me know if you have questions. I hope you have some insight to give, because I need it!",04Apr2020,1
492,"(Warning: Long post. PS: I'm sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, English is not my first language.)

To sum it up, I'm a teen girl and I spend all day every day in my room, on my computer. My mother is the exact opposite of me, she's a complete extrovert and can't stand being indoors for too long. She's outside all day with my little brother while I'm just at home. 

One day, she came across this post on a forum (not Reddit) she frequently browses and asked me if I made it, because it sounded so much like me. The post was made by a teenager who was afraid of social interaction and preferred to stay indoors all day, just like me. (He called himself a '[hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori)') I said no, I didn't make the post.

Afterwards, I noticed how much people were hating on this guy saying things like 'I bet you wouldn't be like that if someone took your technology away, etc.' (The forum is mostly populated by middle aged moms, if that helps.)

Since that day my mom has been teasing me about how I was a hikikomori or something like that. Not in a mean way, of course. Later she told me that my lack of need to socialize CANNOT be legit and I must be staying indoors all the time because I'm too shy to make friends. And while it is true I'm quite shy, I genuinely do not have a desire to communicate. My mom still refuses to believe I'm comfortable living like this, but I don't know whether to blame her or not.

Some more background, I'm likely autistic (not confirmed, but I have pretty much all the major symptoms)  and apparently I was fine with socializing until something just changed when I was 4.

Today, my mom told me she blames herself for the way I am. It almost sounded like she was calling herself a bad parent because she's disappointed in the way I turned out to be. (She didn't directly say it, of course.) 

Additionally, since the whole pandemic started, my little brother has become very attached to me because he can't go out with his friends. He just wants to play, like any other child. But today he seemed unusually desperate to spend time with me. Since he figured out all I do is stay on my laptop, he took mom's tablet and suggested we go watch YouTube videos together, because that's basically all I do. My mom just seemed to really oppose the idea and quickly convinced him to not do it.

I don't know if I was just overthinking, but it was really weird how she just wanted him to not do the same things as me at all costs. I asked her why not.

She said she doesn't want him to turn into a hikikomori like I apparently did, and that hit hard for some reason. I'm certain she wasn't trying to be mean, but it definitely made me self-conscious.

We had a long conversation and what I got from it was that my mother hopes I would change. On one hand, I can understand. But on the other, I felt like a disappointment after realizing it would basically be the end of the world for my mom if my brother turned out like me. 

Now, I'd like to mention that this isn't some 'my parents don't undertand me' teenage emo phase, my desire to socialize dissapeared when I was a toddler. And no, there wasn't any traumatic experience linked to it from what I know. 

I, myself am worried about this whole thing. *What am I going to do once I grow up? If I'm still like this, how will I make communication not feel like a chore?* 

But mostly, *Will my family accept me if I don't change?* 

If I could control my desire to socialize, I would make myself 'normal', but I cannot. I could pretend to hangout with people and make friends, but I'm still debating if all of the stress would be worth it just to appease my mother, considering my social skills are way below par anyway.

This whole thing is really making me feel anxious and worry about what's going to happen if I don't magically change one day, which I doubt is possible. What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm a teen who hasn't felt a legit need to socialize in over a decade and my mom believes I can't possibly be happy spending all my time alone. (Although I'm perfectly comfortable with it)  If I don't suddenly feel a desire to communicate again, should I pretend to be 'normal' just to appease her?)",04Apr2020,1

496,"This will be long, but it’s a complex situation for me.

I had never had a pet before (save for a gerbil) and never really had the desire to adopt one. But over the last year or so, several family members and friends have been adopting cats so I’ve naturally been around them a lot.

I’ve grown to like cats because of this, and people took notice and starting urging me to adopt a cat. I’ve recently gave in and decided to check out some animal shelters.

I found a very nice cat that seemed to like me a lot. The shelter assured me that he was in good health and had a checkup less than 2 weeks ago.

One week later, I adopted the cat. I noticed his eyes seemed to be a little funky, but the shelter assured me this was because his eyes were irritated from being in a cage with his litter box and that they will clear up.

A week and a half later they did not clear up so I took him to the vet myself. Turns out he has several medical issues, one of which is feline herpes. I was then given a laundry list of medications that I’ll need to give the cat- some temporary and others lifetime. The first round of medication cost me $900, not counting the vet visit.

To make matters worse, I’m having an extremely tough time administering all these medications to the cat every few hours. He doesn’t trust me a ton yet and this certainly isn’t helping. He’s already spit up 3 pills.

I have to do a follow up visit in 4 days and another in 2-3 weeks.

This is not something I was expecting to deal with immediately and honestly, if I knew he had this many medical issues, I wouldn’t have adopted him as my first cat.

Friends and family who wanted me to adopt a cat so bad have suddenly all but disappeared, with the most help I’ve gotten was a “try harder” or “this is just something to expect with pets”.

I just had a mini mental breakdown after trying and failing to give him his 3rd medication (out of 6). I’m already struggling financially due to my hours at work suddenly being cut and I don’t know if I can cope with all these medical expenses as well.

But my heart breaks at the thought of giving him back to the shelter, especially when they apparently didn’t properly get the cat vetted.

I really feel stuck and don’t know what to do.",04Apr2020,1
497,"I’m 22 female and me and him have known each other and been friends for 2 years, id say we were close friends too since we talk everyday 24/7 and chill almost everyday, even when he’s busy he’s always down to see me if I ask and tells me he’s not busy. 

It sometimes feels like he might be into me but I know he’s not gonna make a move cuz he knows I hate when guy friends do that. 

So I was thinking of texting him saying “Yeo I have something to tell You” then after he says what or whatever I will say 

“Okok so I have a confession to make but before that I wanna ask u do u like me or do u only see me as a friend? (Be honest I’m cool with which ever one u pick) I’m just asking because tbh I like u a lot and I tried not to and ignoring it cuz I feel bad since I’m supposed to be ur boy but idk I just can’t seem to so I thought I’d tell u. I do really like being friends with you to tho and whatever u say won’t change that and id still want things to be the same and continue being friends  no matter what”

Should I say that or would you change it up and if you would change it up what would you say? I know it’d be better to tell him in person but I feel more comfertable over text lol",04Apr2020,1

I'm an 18 years old guy from VietNam and also a college student.

My problem comes from my father, He always get mad at some random things and brings it to our home, he is like unstable and has a mental illness (when getting mad people can think), I think that he can take a knife and stab me, my mom and my younger sis someday. He is like crazy and always in a anger so we can not sit down and talk. I can't just hate him because I know he still loves me inside and when I was young he was working hard to raise me( I love him too),  I feel like It is my fault that he is suffering and I can't do anything. Recently, I have thought about killing all my family and we'll not suffer anymore, so I think I have a mental problem too.

I worry about 3 things. First, he's suffering and I can not live with that, I feel that my fault and I can not focus on studying. Second, my mom is suffering too and I feel so helpless, I still can not do anything because I can not apply for a job. Finally, I do not know what to do, I am so confusing. I wish that I could help him or kick him out of my life.

500,"By internet OCD I mean shit like feeling so pissed off at making a typo during messages and not being able to edit it or feeling extremely uneasy if I miss a capital letter in a message or if I mess up my grammar on a post or even saving or posting something on a time that ends with either a 6 or a 9, just because I don't like the way those numbers look. Also, I spent like 1h 30mins today just making new Reddit accounts just because I didn't like the Snoos on my pfp and also so I could have one on the perfect time. By perfect time I mean something that ends in a 0 or 5 down to the last second. Another one is that I literally can't make a mistake on an acc or else it'll make me want to make a new one. This is why I never ever comment on any post at all on my main Reddit acc and why I hardly ever post anything because if I mess up it'll kill me. I've even made like 20 different gmail accounts just because I messed up once. I know this sounds like some complete bullshit and u might not even believe me but I'm 100% serious and I don't even know what tf to actually do about it so I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out of this crap.

Some other points:

* I can't even upvote or downvote any comment or post because it feels like I should know where everything that I've liked or disliked is at all times and if it gets deleted then I'll feel hopeless so I don't like or dislike anything
* This doesn't only happen on Reddit this also happens on everything that I make an acc so stuff like YT or Instagram
* If I ever get a pfp on anything then I can't make myself change it cos it'll feel like that pfp has been saved somewhere in my account data but I'll never know where so that's why I have to make a new acc instead of changing the pfp

Some side info:

* I have tried so many times to stop doing this but I just don't know how to
* This only started happening to me around I think either late 2019 or early 2020
* I'm 16 so maybe because I'm a teenager my brain is a bit messed up rn?
* This is a throwaway acc so that's why I'm not too bothered with the grammar
* I'm pretty sure internet OCD isn't a word but I hope I explained it well enough

502,"Hi everyone, hope everyone is trying to make the most of lock down.

3 months ago I quit my job as an accountant in order to find a new career because I was very depressed. Working in finance was very bad for my anxiety as I was often solely responsible for big difficult decisions and had to spend most days negotiating with senior Directors. 

I was studying feline behaviour with the thought to open up my own small cattery but due to the recent events this doesn't seem like a viable option for a long while.
I would like to ask for ideas for a new career choice away from finance.

Hello, I recently turned 15. Im girl a girl. I am from Russia, English is not our native language and I still don't know it very well. Sorry if there are any mistakes.
I have a dad, but he is almost never at home, he is a trucker. We have quarantine until 30 april, but my dad still working, so my mother and I live together almost all the time.
When he sometimes comes home, they find a reason to quarell. Mom always offends(insult,affront) my dad when he is at home. He just tries to ignore it. They are not going to divorce.
I don’t know is it truth, but my dad sometimes buys prostitutes. I don’t know if my mother knows about it. But my dad probably cheats on her. He loves me and my sister, but I'm not sure that he still loves my mother.
My mother sometimes (once a week or month) likes to drink with my aunt. When my mother is drunk, she talks a lot. She recently admitted that she is unhappy. She wants to ""really fall in love"", that she wants to realize herself as a person, that she doesn't like her life. I was bullied at school, so now I study at home. I am not talented as others and not smart as others. I regret being alive, I already tried to kill myself, but it was very scary. I'm afraid to die.
My mother is deeply unhappy, but I don't know what to do. I don’t know what can make her happy.
Since quarantine, she stopped going to work and started drinking almost every day with my aunt. I think she becomes an alcoholic and one of the reasons is bad influence of my aunt. (She says bad things about other people, and believes in strange things. For example, she thinks the Americans created the coronavirus to destroy the whole world. I think you understood.)

511," I'm stuck in a situation where one of my best friends is convinced that my ex-girlfriend, who I dated for 2 years, cheated on me near the end. Before I broke up with her, he already kinda disliked her. Just to be clear, the breakup was completely mutual, we both were satisfied with it, and we continued being friends. My friend group is one of those friend groups who insult each other in a joking manner, but about two weeks ago my friend went off on my ex while we were playing games online, just constantly calling her whore, ugly, calling her new boyfriend a druggie, and trying to pass it off as sarcastic or something.

513,"I’ve lived here for almost two years. It’s an old ass building. I’m in the second floor with no one above me and sometimes it sounds like people are walking above us. The walls are very thin and I tend to hear too much of my neighbors lives. It’s just the price you pay for living in a shitty apartment. 

The first time they banged on the ceiling I was doing laundry. I thought that maybe I could have been walking too loud. The next couple times I was sitting down scrolling on my phone, no noise being made. This has been a few weeks now. 

Last night, my boyfriend made a plate of food and as he went to sit down with it,  just dropped it on the floor. He didn’t even have time to mourn the food when they banged on the ceiling. He looked at me having never heard it before and stomped his foot. They banged back. 
This banging is not a gentle banging. It is a shake the floor banging. 

So here’s the thing, I’m pretty reasonable until you start being a dick. One little noise because something was accidentally dropped does not warrant banging. And I’m pretty sure they’re banging on the ceiling anytime they hear the building creak. They could have knocked on my door to have a conversation with me, they could have even left a note. But instead they want to be passive? 


I can play passive. I’ve started walking with my full weight in every step. Throwing my full hydro flask on the floor every couple of minutes. Thinking of taking up bowling, in my apartment. 

But in all seriousness do I confront them? I can be passive all day, I can also go to their door and be a bitch. I could also just file a complaint.

This morning my father asked me to inflate the tires on his bicycle. So I did it with my mom's help. However when he returned home he angrily shouted that the tires were flat again and demanded I fix them. So I tried to fix them and thought I had done it right but a few hours later they were flat again.

He exploded with anger and shouted angrily at me, my brother and my mother. He called us all useless and demanded we stop doing whatever we where doing and all fix his tires. He then waltzed into my room and my brother's room and pulled out the plug of our computers. He said if we dared to touch our computers before we fixed his tires he would destroy them. I have seen my father angry in the past like this, so I didn't think it would become such a serious situation. So we spent 30 minutes trying to fix his tires and then we finally got it right.

However my father exploded with anger again and said he heard us swearing at him in the garage, which we indeed had done. He called us all useless again and said he was the only person in the house who could do anything useful. Then my brother pulled aside me and in his room and made me realize with a horrible man he was. This wasn't the first time this had happened and he insulted us all, especially my mom. I guess I just kept pretending he loved us all these years, but today it finally came through to me what a despicable person he is. My mom is now planning to divorce him. After my talk with my brother my dad was shouting at my mom again, but me and my brother came to her defense. He continued to insult us all, and we in return called him crazy and a horrible father.

He then pulled out a knife and held it threateningly in our direction. He dared us to call him crazy again and said if we did he would destroy our computers. I had to restrain myself from insulting him again because my computer cost more than €1800.

Me, my brother and my mom are now in the kitchen doing nothing. My father now demands we pay him if we we want to use electricity in his house and is now sitting in the living room.

We are seriously considering calling the police but am unsure what would happen after that. Maybe we should wait until he leaves home to go the work on Monday? My father never hit one of us but he did push my mother and held a knife in our direction. What would happen if we did call the police, would they arrest him and take him somewhere or what else would happen?

520,"I’ve never posted on here before so sorry if I mess this up. I’m 14 (almost 15) years old, I live with my older sibling (18) &amp; our mother. She has an (untreated) illness &amp; she’s unemployed, she’s neglected the both of us everyday for as long as I can remember.


I’ll try to just give a quick run down of some things: she “homeschools” us, but she doesn’t teach us anything. No schoolwork, no online school, nothing. We’re both academically behind, she knows it. My sibling can’t spell the simplest words at 18. I can’t do basic math &amp; can’t even tell you what I think the word division means. If I ever write in a diary, I have to stop after like 20 minutes because I’m so not used to writing that my wrist starts to hurt very badly.

We also have no running water, haven’t since I was 8 or 9. I can’t explain how disgusting this makes me feel. I want nothing more than to be able to just take a shower, I crave that.
No gas either.

I can count on one hand how many times I’m able to leave the house every year. She’ll leave the house a bunch to get groceries with money she’s given from a family member, but she only ever goes alone. Sometimes I open my bedroom window and just stare at nature, it’s almost foreign to me now.

She hasn’t taken either of us to a doctor in maybe 7 years. I struggle a lot mentally and ask her all the time to take me in so I can get help, she never “gets to it”. My mental health is so bad we’ve talked of suicide, but she still won’t take me. I’ve been begging for about a year. (same goes for an eye exam)

The house is filthy and there’s mountains of trash everywhere besides my room, the kitchen is so bad 2 people don’t have room to be in there at the same time, in there it’s just trash as tall as I am &amp; a path to walk to the fridge. The microwave is literally in the living room.

We get into arguments all the time and she’ll mock me, call me names, and yell at me. She says I need to be supportive. I don’t ask from much for her, just my basic needs met.

I have family members I haven’t seen in years because of her, I miss them. I hate lying about why they can’t come over and why I can’t go to their house.

My mother is my only parent, but she’s not much of a parent at all. I need advice.

1. Explain the situation to a family member and ask to live with them.

Since we’ve graduated high school our communication has only been every few months or only consistent every few weeks. 

We were really close, celebrated our birthday together for a couple years (same friend group) and she taught me how to cook and bake. 

I will admit, when I was in a previous toxic relationship two years ago, I would contact her for advice on how to get through to my ex. My life wasn’t going well atm, I always felt she never liked the fact I came to her for advice and didn’t bother communicating more once she’s helped me. 

I understand I messed up there, I worked full time and did college full time however I recognize it’s no excuse. I stopped 1.5 years ago. I comforted her when she went through her first break up and we still talked. 

In November, I realized it’s been a month since we talked and I missed her, I messaged her about her fathers health, wished her well, told her I loved her and she means the world for me.

I never got a reply back, and in mutual groups on social media she stopped replying in it. She posted a video of herself on Snapchat, and I complimented her. Shortly after I was blocked off Snapchat. 

I brushed it off as maybe she is busy? She got her first full time job and I understand the financial stress her family is under. We bonded over that and our toxic family culture. 

Months passed and last week was my birthday, I never got a message from her. She used to always send me heartwarming messages on my birthday or we would’ve celebrated it together. 
(We stopped doing this because of my ex. No one wanted to meet him and so, they didn’t attend my birthday dinner and she did her own thing .) 

Today is her birthday, I sent her a heartfelt message at midnight and never got a reply back. 

I never talked or spoke bad of her. I have too much respect and think way too highly of her for that. I never shared her secrets either. 

I’m not going to confront her today, I want her to enjoy her birthday. But I will. 

I would really appreciate advice on this matter

Thank you.

526,"Strap up, because this is a doozy. There is also graphic description of physical and emotional abuse, so if you cannot handle that please do not keep reading. 

I (18m) have a friend (18f) who needs a lot of help. I’m not quite sure where to start, so I guess I’ll go chronologically. 

When she was 15 she began dating her brother’s friend, and 18 y/o. He emotional and psychologically abused her to the point of breaking. He would scream at her for hours until she was curled into a ball in the corner, and would have no choice but to succumb to his demands. She has described these demands as increasing in intensity, but did not get into the details of the sexual abuse, although I know there was as such. He got her hooked on weed to numb the pain she was feeling. She has described herself as an object in his mine. As “his toy.” This lasted for two years. Two years of her going to school with black, red, puffy eyes from him hitting her and her crying for hours. Her classmates would ask what was wrong and she would hide it. She would say she loved him, and was trying to make it work. He broke her to the point of being “brainwashed,” as she describes. All this time, her parents were busy dealing with her older brother, who suffers from bipolar disorder and was dealing with implications with the law and a drug addiction. He was eventually sent to rehab. Regardless, her parents didn’t know. Still don’t. She says to me that her sophomore and junior years of high school were robbed of her. By the end of the two years, she was essentially a slave. She had no friends, as her abusive boyfriend had forbade her from seeing anyone, and would go “ballistic” anytime she tried to leave. She was afraid he would kill her, or himself. So it went on. Then he started cheating on her, and she finally got out. This was January of 2019. Two weeks later, she got a new boyfriend. 

Let me backtrack a bit and frame this story. My friend, as we’ve only recently realized, has borderline personality disorder. She also has anxiety and depression as a result of this abuse. Her parents, I get the sense, were pretty shitty parents. She is searching for love. For attention. But not in an “attention seeking” kind of way. In a “no one treats me well so I will take any affection and attention I can get.”

Two weeks after her abusive ex-bf and her broke up, she began dating this other dude. Let’s call him “Douchebag.” Now Douchebag, as I understand now, was a significant step up in her mind from her abuser. He actually had friends (she says her abuser was actually psychotic, and used specific methods to break her and leave her with no options but himself, while also having no friends of his own). Douchebag would treat her reasonably kindly, I suppose, but was incredibly narcissistic and downright stupid. Classic SoCal surfer boy who has no goals in life, other than to be a grubby, sandy, old, homeless, beach man who spends his days surfing. This kid has not had an original thought in his life. Just video games, weed, Xanax, alcohol, the whole shebang. She once said to me, “you know how sad it is to have someone be physically inside you, yet mentally and emotionally be so far away? That’s what sex and our relationship was like.” She dated douchebag officially until mid-summer 2019, I believe. But after that they stayed in touch and what have you. 

Fall of 2019 she moves from SoCal to Montreal for university. Big step. A prestigious university, overcoming all of the shit she’s been through. Douchebag was mad. Said she abandoned him “for Canada.” He is currently at a community college in the town over from where they lived. This is where she met me, and other normal, caring, people. She didn’t know such people existed. It took her time to adjust, as is expected. By this time, she was smoking a lot. People didn’t know all of her background though, and she didn’t want to get into it, understandably. When asked about her weed use, she would just say “I have really bad anxiety and weed is the only thing that makes me feel normal” and that was true. She is highly functioning for the conditions she faces. Again, our school is no joke and it’s first of all really impressive she was able to overcome the odds and get in, but secondly able to keep up with all the work and get good grades while constantly smoking and having all this shit going on. People thought she was just quiet. Reserved. She thought everyone hated her. 

First semester was rough. Any time she would drink alcohol, she would black out. I don’t know if it’s that she lacked the self control or was just tremendously light-weight (she is a very small girl, probably 5’ 5’ and under 110lb). Some shitty things happened though. One night she was essentially “kidnapped” (all of these quotations are specific words she has used, btw), by two (or three) boys in our residence. They plopped her blackout drunk in an Uber to head to a club. En route to the club, they took turns making out with her. I’m not sure what else happened that night. I’m not sure she is either. But she told me yesterday that she still thinks about it every day. She’s told me she’s had these kinds of unwanted sexual experiences with at least 4 guys in our residence, who she was then forced to see on a daily basis for the remainder of the year.  This was in the fall of 2019. After some time, she was able to open up a bit with her roommate during a shrooms trip about her past abuse. Also during this time, we hooked up a few times (consensually!), but it’s stopped after a handful of times and we were just kind of friends after that. She had some things going on when we hooked up. First of all, any fingering was a trigger for her, because thats how her abusive ex would touch her. The first time we hooked up after coming back from the club, she ran to the bathroom and began throwing up in the trash can. I held her hair back and chalked it up to just drinking. I’m not even convinced she was drunk though. In the club I had ordered a few drinks for myself but I was with her the whole time and I don’t think she did. She later told me that she used to throw up frequently, triggered by sexual situations, as a result of her abuse. She also suffered from a concussion as a result of getting too drunk and hitting her head on a wall. Not the same night she hooked up with me. This is just all fall 2019. I’m not sure whether it was intentional or not. 

Towards the end of the fall she had opened up to me a bit about her history and I encouraged her to seek treatment. She had done as much before, but it was unsuccessful, and she had reservations. Nevertheless, I helped her figure out how and where she could get help. She was eventually assigned a grad student “therapist” and prescribed an SSRI. 

Winter break rolls around and she heads back home. Having no friends other than Douchebag and another longtime friend “Hannah.” She basically spends the entire time with Douchebag. She later described this period of time to me as a very low point for her. She cried every day of winter break. After having spent months in Montreal surrounded by, for the most part, kind, smart, genuine people, going back to Douchebag was imaginable tough. I’m sure she was raped by him on multiple occasions. Not like a physically restrictive rape, but kind of psychological; she wouldn’t want to have sex and would say no but would end up having sex anyway. That sort of thing. 

We came back from winter break and went to a music festival with some mutual friends. It was a great time. At this point we had not hooked up for several months and I really just saw her as a friend. She was on molly (MDMA) as we’re a few of her friends. I have a strict policy against any drug that can kill me, so I was just drunk. She was grinding on me most of the night, though. She ended up sleeping over in my room (we were in the same residence hall, I had a single she had a double). We hooked up multiple times that night. 

We continued hooking up fairly regularly for several weeks. We were at that point quite close friends and had lots of mutual friends. She opened up to me about her past abuse, but just the tip of the iceberg. Then one day we decided to trip shrooms together. She brewed us some tea (the taste of shrooms is unbearable to her). I ended up drinking most of it because she couldn’t stomach all that much. We decided to head up to my room because hers was very visually stimulating (lots of overwhelming patters and tapestry’s, etc.) whereas mine was much more chill. Unfortunately, she had a really bad trip. Almost immediately upon entering my room, she curled up in a ball in the corner on my bed. I was just kind of standing around, sitting in a chair, looking out the window, etc. Just trying to enjoy my trip. She vocalized to me she was having a bad trip and I asked what I could do to make it less bad. I knew there was nothing I could really do, but if she needed water or blankets, etc. I was of course happy to provide. I just focused on not letting her negative energy corrupt my trip. We peaked pretty hard and at this time we’re laying on by bed together. I was just holding her, comforting her. She later described to me intense visual effects of memories deep in her brain from her abuse being brought to the surface. As we started to come down from the peak, she calmed down from the bad visual effects and basically began just telling me about all of her past relationships. She’s deeply insecure, has very low self esteem, etc. I’m a very good listener and have lots of friends (particularly girls) who have lots of past issues and feel comfortable opening up to me. I’m very objective in my thinking and often can offer insight and solace they may not have thought of, being so emotionally attached to the issue at hand. Some time during this period she also confused on me that she cut herself. She showed me the more recent scars on her legs that I believe she incurred while tripping on shrooms a separate time. 

Anyway, we continue hooking up every so often. I encouraged her to find a therapist through our school and she got prescribed an SSRI. Now For a while she had trouble taking her medicine on a regular basis. She had to start off with one pill a day for a week or two, then up the dose to two pills. She would get incredibly nauseous from the pills so would not take them, prolonging the step up period. Over winter break she didn’t take them at all. It wasn’t until, if I had to guess, 6 weeks after she was prescribed them that she got up to the full dose. It was supposed to be 2 weeks. To this day she has not felt the full effects of them because she has not been taking them long enough. 

At a certain point I felt like we needed to establish a boundary. I wasn’t trying to get into a relationship with her at the moment. She has a lot of emotional baggage, for lack of a better term, although I really don’t see it as baggage. She just has a lot going on and needs to focus on getting herself better. I wanted to support her in that, but iterated to her that I felt I could fulfill that role better as a friend than as a partner. Having BPD, she felt that was a reflection of something wrong with her, and I tried (I believe successfully) to explain to her that it was not that she was broken or undeserving of love, I just didn’t feel I was the one to provide that at that time. I told her that if friendship meant not hooking up anymore then I would be completely understanding and that it would not change how I felt about her or my desire to see her get better. She said she wanted to keep hooking up, because ours was the first healthy sexual relationship she had ever had. She described it as “educational,” after years of being objectified and arguably treated like absolute shit by almost every other guy she had met (aside from some of our mutual guy friends). We continued hooking up and I continued helping her seek help, reminded her to take her medicine (which she would not have if it wasn’t for my reminders). She was also getting incredibly skinny at this time and I was really concerned. I think she was around 105. Her goal is 120. I would make her come to the dining hall with me for meals just so I could be sure she was actually eating. She was told by her doctor she needed to stop smoking if she was taking an SSRI. She has been trying to ween off for months to little avail. I guess she is smoking wayyyy less than she was in the fall, but she’s still smoking which she isn’t supposed to be. 

Anyway, then comes coronavirus. Her and I were some of the first to leave residence. This was 3 weeks ago today, actually. She is home in SoCal right now, eating and taking her medicine. Douchebag has been hitting her up constantly, and she is awful at saying “no” to anyone. Her dad was diagnosed with covid and douchebag would still come over (uninvited) and hang out. She was also mildly symptomatic. Douchebag’s step-dad is immunocompromised, but Douchebag didn’t really care if he got it. In fact he asked my friend to sleep in her house, either because of that fact or because he was just trying to be close to her. I urged her to say no. To say we’re in the midst of a pandemic and you need to be at your own house isolated. Californians do not seems to be giving a fuck about this by the way she’s described it to me. People still out and about, but that’s besides the point. Apparently he pulls up to her house in the morning to “go skated with his brother at a park near my friend’s house. He’ll be bumping rap music she can hear from her room, so she’ll text him “Are you in front of my house?” He’ll say he’s going skating, or whatever, but she’ll go out there and chat w him. For a bit more context, he would drive her out to his dorms 30min from her house and play video games w his friends while she just sat there. Once I texted her “have a scoop of protein w me!” (In an effort to help her consume more calories I encouraged her to get into protein powder, because she practically only eats rice and microwaveable ramen). She asked Douchebag for a scoop. He put a ton (way more than anyone actually uses) in a bottle with both milk and water (I don’t want to give the sense I’m getting hung up on his protein powder recipe, but PP is not super enjoyable to drink in the first place, and he just made it so much worse for someone who has trouble consuming it in its most tolerable form). She didn’t even get any of it. He drank the whole thing. I asked to have a glass of protein powder w her, and he just ended up having all of it. When she asked for another scoop he said no because “it’s expensive.” If it’s so expensive, why’d you put 3 scoops in with milk and water and drink all of it??? It had me pretty livid, I’ll be honest. Another day that week she was at the dorms and feeling really crummy (because she likely had coronavirus) but he refused to bring her home because he didn’t believe her when she said she felt sick. This is the same kid who the next week came over to her house with a fever and a cough (coronavirus) asking to sleep over. Fucking douchebag, hence the name. 

Anyway, I guess this is where it stands. The past few days she sunk into a deep depression and I was really quite scared she would hurt herself. She did, a bit, but thank god not what I was worried she was doing. Or had done. She is at her wits end with Douchebag, but I could easily see her falling back into that trap. I logged her into my Headspace account on her phone so she has access to that, but I don’t think she uses it often. She’s taking her medicine, and I’ve encouraged her to do research into counselors either online or in Montreal for when she returns. She hates being in SoCal and now calls MTL her home. She has a lease for an apartment starting May 1st she is planning on moving into in MTL, but until then she’s stuck in SoCal. I guess I’m looking for advice on a few points: 
1) Is it a bad idea to continue hooking up if I’m really unsure I want a long term relationship? I don’t want to give off the wrong signals, but we communicate quite well and I don’t think that it’s getting close to any point where she expects that from me. 
2) how do I navigate a friendship with someone with BPD who has gone through all this trauma? I don’t want to say it’s unfair to me, because that’s just selfish, but this is an emotional roller coaster. On a nearly daily basis I fear for her life. 
3) any other advice you have is greatly appreciated

527,"I've (M 25) known I wanted to be involved in construction for the longest time - my interest originally started in architecture/design, but when I went to college an adviser suggested I major in Construction Management, get a professional experience, come back for Masters in Civil Engineering, and eventually get my PE.

It wasn't until about three years into a Construction Management degree I realized, through some research of my own) that it's really not as simple as just ""going in and sitting for the FE exam"" like the adviser said without an actual ABET-accredited degree (which most masters degrees are not). I stuck with the CM degree, graduated, and went to work for a general contractor for a few years. At first the job wasn't too bad - but the project I've been working this past year has been terrible for my morale, health, etc. as well as my all-around interest in the field.  So I've been thinking about going back to school so I can get that engineering degree I would need to sit for the exam - before I lose my interest completely.

Not a whole lot of my original technical classes transfer over, so I would be looking at least 3 years of extra college (not including any potential grad school), so I feel like this would put me ""behind the curve"" with other young professionals. Financially, I'm pretty screwed as well - since it's my second degree, so I don't have a lot of options besides loans. Am I crazy?  Looking at all the hurdles I need to get over, it's pretty daunting, but I don't know how much longer I can last with my current position. How should I approach this situation?",04Apr2020,1

Then usually at the end of the day I would do things like get out of my seat and just walk around and talk to random people in my class, do weird things like saying really stupid things like replying to girls with sweetheart, being weird and loud, etc. For me it helps temporarily when I go out of class just for a breather but I can’t constantly rely on asking for a toilet pass and don’t want to rely on this way to keep me in control.",04Apr2020,1

535,"Hi all, I'm 17F and my mother is 54F. My girlfriend thinks my mother is dangerous and abusive, I sometimes think so as well, but I always try to push the thought away, so I might need to hear opinions from others.

I will provide a list with ""negative"" things my mother does, but she only does this sometimes, so it's probably not that bad.

* Doesn't take me to a doctor often
* Gets mad when I don't offer food or cook for her when I want to make food for myself
* Threatens to hit me
* Threatens to leave (I get panic attacks from it)
* Threatens to commit suicide
* Yells and screams at me
* Insults me
* Makes fun of me when I get in a position to defend myself when I feel like I'm being threatened
* Says I can't have traumas
* Says I can't have any mental illness
* Insults my girlfriend
* Gets extremely mad and jealous when I talk good about my parents in law (I like to call them that, just my girlfriend's parents)
* Calls me stupid
* Calls me retarded
* Says I can't stand up for myself because she raised me and she always treated me perfect
* Gets extremely mad when I ""ignore"" her
* Gets extremely mad when I want privacy with my girlfriend
* Threatens to call the police when I go outside during an argument 
* Makes snarky comments when I'm in the room and we argue

I think this is normal, but my girlfriend doesn't. It also seems way better at her place, her parents don't scream and don't threaten that stuff. But my mother has mental issues so I shouldn't complain.

536,"I'm a little embarrassed by this and I might delete it, but I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas on how to approach this. 

So, last week, me (13F) and my mom (50F) were painting my bedroom. I didn't have any old pants that I was OK with getting paint on, so my mom said to just not wear any. Fair enough, I'm inside my own house, that's private enough. Wrong. As we finish up one of the walls, my mom says she's going to take a picture of them. I try to move to the side, out of the camera, but my bed's in the middle of my small room because we moved it away from the walls, so I can't really move. I just stand there, waiting for my mom to be done, when she starts laughing. I ask her what she's laughing at and she shows me the pictures. Most of them are just shots of the new paint color, but the last two are pictures of me, with no pants on, just underwear. I immediately go quiet while my mom laughs. She puts her phone down and continues painting. My mom notices I got quiet and asks what's wrong. I tell her that I don't like that she took a picture of me half-clothed and that I'd like her to delete it. She brushes it off and says she won't show anyone and keeps painting. Later that night, I ask her again to please delete the picture and she told me really unconvincingly that she will. I let it go, until today when she's scrolling through her photos and I see the two pictures. I say ""...you didn't delete the photos...."" and she tells me that she promises she won't post them and she has never promised me of anything harder than she will now. I gave up and just left the room. 

You'd ask, isn't her promise enough? No, as throughout my life, she's taken candid, unflattering pictures of me and then posted them without my permission for her entire 180+ friends list to see on Facebook. I've asked her to ask me first but she doesn't see the problem. Thus, I don't exactly trust her not to post them or show anyone. Additionally, why would she want the pictures if she's not going to do anything with them? So why won't she delete them? 

I also have a bit of a body image issue and I'm very insecure about pictures of me being taken without my knowledge, not to mention ones where I'm only wearing a shirt and underwear. My mom went through a lot of the same issues when she was my age so I wished she'd empathize. She's also a big feminist and always acts so mad when she hears about revenge porn and women getting pictures taken of them without consent, so why won't she replicate those feelings for her daughter? 

I don't want to make her more upset because she hates to be bugged, but it's bothering me, and I don't know if it should. Am I making a big deal out of this and should I just take her on her word? I'm really ashamed and I just wish she'd delete them and get the drama over with. Is that even legal? But I do have a shirt and underwear on... How do I talk to her and sort my feelings out about this?

TL;DR: My mom took photos of me in a shirt and underwear and won't delete them when I ask her to. am I making a big drama for nothing? How do I confront her on this without making her upset?",04Apr2020,1
537,"So I decided to go into self isolation a week ago after three people were diagnosed with the virus. These people worked in positions were they meet lots of people (cashier, school food service worker, and a senior center volunteer). My sister worked as a food service employee but since the small outbreak here she is no longer working for the week. That same day a local person faints and is rushed to the hospital. This is when I decided I was going to avoid contact with family (before hand I only went from my apartment to my family's place which is rural).

I work from home (I'm a teacher) and I usually have work to do if the internet allows (again, rural); however, my family is not excited about my isolation. They see it as cowardly and paranoid. My sister developed a fever (my family told me it's just the spring flu) and got tested (her results return in 3-5 days), but my friends are texting me not to go home.

539,"(First time posting on Reddit so hope I did this right) 
At the beginning of the school year I (21f) developped a crush on this guy (22) I go to college with. I don’t know him very well because we are in different years (I’m a junior, he’s a senior) but we’ve got some mutual friends and he’s always been very nice to me. I know I can’t be 100% sure but I’m pretty certain it’s not mutual, because he was seeing someone else for a while (not anymore though) and while he is always very kind to me and we’ve joked around a few times (not alot because like I said I don’t know him very well and we haven’t interacted that much but still), I don’t think he meant that as romantic interest. However, I am toying with the idea of telling him I like him. Although it’s scary, i’d really like to get it of my chest since it’s likely I won’t see him alot anymore or at all because college closed down due to COVID-19. Although that sucks, at least I wouldn’t have to worry about seeing him around alot and things being awkward in case I get rejected (wich is what I’m assuming). I basically have two reasons I’m considering this:
1. To get some closure for myself. Although I rationally know that he’s probably not interested in me in that way, I keep dissecting every interaction we had, no matter how small, in my head trying to find more meaning in them and getting my hopes up even though I know I shouldn’t. It’s driving me mad and knowing for sure how he thinks of me would really provide me with some closure even though it might hurt.
2. With this being a confusing and uncertain time for everyone, it seems fitting to reach out to those you care about, so texting him about this doesn’t seem like such a bad idea in this context.
I don’t want it to seem like I’m expecting anything from him or hoping too much for anything to happen, I would just like to send a text making it clear that I like him, that I don’t have any expectations but that I just wanted to let him know that he’s very nice and sweet and funny and that I think he should know that.

While my mom was hugging me I cried in her arms. I’m going cray and with the quarantine staying indoors, I think made me go a little not sane. And with the things of me debating if I should text a old friend of mine is driving me to insanity (not really). 
And my sister won’t stop she will never. My mom never disciplines us by smacking up she just tells us or yells. And she said she would start smacking us if we fight more. My sister said some rude things to me yesterday and I haven’t forgiven her I’m still hostile to her for what she’s done. And my mom tells me to stop. I don’t know why it’s affecting me so much and when I get pissed my sister says I have issues. And that makes me think I do. Because tbh I think I have issues m. And I need therapy and anger management.  I just wanna die. Thinking about it brings me tears to the eyes.

551,"Essentially, I have not lived with my father in over a decade. He's verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. He REFUSES to use my pronouns(Xe/Xem/Xyr) and my name, still calls me his daughter, said he disowned me for not wanting to wear girl clothes and PUNCHED ME hard enough to bruise my arm a few days before graduation, my HIGH SCHOOL graduation, because I swore near him during a panic attack he caused.

He complains constantly for buying me things yet uses it to guilt trip me, has given me PTSD, etc. You can go to my post history ranting about him in r/Rants , if you want to see more for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm socially awkward. I have no intention of hiding that, I don't care about that. But the situation that it got me disturbed me.

&amp;#x200B;

SUMMARY.

Someone told me that I should get a girl, no idea why, but I denied it. I did ask why they recommended it. Got called out about it.

The following conversation ensued:

&amp;#x200B;

P1: ""It would be healthy for you and your emotions to get into a relationship.""  
Me, the uneducated idiot I am: ""I have friends, isn't that simply the same.""  
P2: ""OP, you don't have to pretend and try to convince everyone into thinking that you're a sociopath.""  
Me: ""I have no intention of doing that, I'm not even trying that""  
P2: ""Makes me curious, what is it that you are trying to do then? So far you're only looking like a psychopath here, and I've seen people who were actually one, and you don't want to end up like them.""  
P2: ""You've shown me enough times that you are perfectly capable of acting like a normal human being, so you can stop pretending now.""   
Me: ""Well sorry for that then... I'm only trying to confirm if a friendship is a relationship or not""  
P2: ""Dude this isn't your middle school, you're not fooling anyone here.""

After that massacre, someone else shows up and decided to believe I was a person like that and decided that it was a good idea of taking away something he gave to me a long time ago, knowing that it was something of extreme value to me.

The worst part is that I'm forced to keep quiet about it, and I'm receiving questions about it every day, and it's starting to tear me apart.

So how do I get this off my mind? Since it's starting to weigh on me every single day, and it's going as far as forcing me to stay up for 23 hours, while I already get terrible sleep. I'm fine if they don't like me, but they had no reason to call me out like that. At least that was what I thought.

I can’t come near her stomach, and she constantly complains how overweight she is (she’s not, but that’s her perception, so there’s no getting over that) even right before and after intimacy and it really just kills the mood. I don’t feel like she enjoys herself sexually nearly as much because of how self conscious she is. We used to be kinky around the house and have great sex until she put on this bit of weight.

I have reassured her countless times that she’s still attractive, I have offered to jog with her and go to the gym with her, but she never feels like going, and I’ve mentioned us eating healthier but she won’t really change up her diet.

I had an abundance of suicidal thoughts,mental breakdowns ( i drank bleach twice) and i don’t remember my 3rd year of high school since i most likely went thru dissociation. my parents weren’t of any comfort since the only thing that mattered was academic excellence, physical and mental health be damned. luckily i completed high school and was able to get a chance to study abroad but now and then i keep get these disturbing dreams in relations to all the problems i had in high school and they’re always in a high school setting. whenever i think of certain things/ or things get mentioned it triggers a memory from high school which makes me feel distressed and keeps putting a toll on my mental health. i have never thought that those memories and whole experience would still have an adverse effect on my mental health to this day but maybe i’m just being dramatic and it not as serious as it seems?

today I noticed that my neighbor (who is a hunter) set up a bird trap. A pretty small cage in which it can barely move. Now he caught a bird with it. Apparently these little birds (might be a magpie) annoy other species by stealing food or whatever. Anyway he caught one and lets it sit in the trap to attract even more. It can barely move, doesn't get much (any?) food and his drinking place is literally the same size as his cage making him poo in his water every time since  there is no other place. 
Now I really had a bad time seeing that and Im not sure if I should sneak to the trap (pretty close to me and not in his sight) and let that thing go. I dont think my neighbor is the worst guy ever and Im really not sure how harmful these birds actually are for the environment / how much the bird ""suffers"".
I also think these traps are illegal but in the end I dont know too much about the whole thing.
There are also not too many people who he could blame once the bird is gone but I dont really care about that. The only thing that really brothers me is the shit all over your drinking place thing.

I checked my card and nothing on it had any dates or indication that it would have expired. I called my mom (I had moved into a house with some friends so I don't live with her) and told her what had happened. I asked if she could call the insurance company because I had to work.

I believed here due to the current state we are in with the pandemic it seemed plausible. I did get fed up with waiting though and called myself. I got through easily and explained what had happened to the insurance person. All she said was that I ""no longer qualified for the insurance program"" and that was that.

Everyone cancelled on me. Back then, it really hurt. But I noticed that every birthday is the same thing so I no longer celebrate my birthday even though I truly wish I did.

 It has been a recurring thing since, when I invite someone to go out they cancel on me. I became quite depressed because if this back in 2016 and I had no support from anyone. It was one of the worst years of my life. Then I went to college, I thought I'd make friends and so I started making friends, I began drinking and I was invited to parties all the time.

Ok so, this is my first time posting so please forgive me if this is a mess. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I was a virgin when we met, so I didn’t really know much about sex outside of porn sites. It was fine though since I didn’t have much of a sex drive at the time and he was more than happy taking the lead. Fast forward to now, my sex drive has spiked significantly, the issue is I don’t really feel anything during it. There are times where he “hits the spot”, but when I moan to encourage what he’s doing, he feels the needs to shift positions and it goes right back to nothing. We’ve tried a couple different penis extenders, but they just end up collapsing in on themselves. 

He also can’t “last long”. He does try but if he tries to stop himself from cumming, then it just becomes infinitely harder for him to get off. Which just means more work for me, since our sex life entirely consists of reverse cowgirl, blowjobs and the occasional doggy style. Which just adds to the problem since sex with him feels more like a routinely chore than it does anything else. I’m always the one doing all the work. 


Just to give a better picture this is exactly how our sex life is at the moment:  He lays naked on the bed with the lights turned off, and then I come into the room and give him a blowjob until he cums or I just get on top until he cums. That is literally the extent of it. There’s no kissing, no foreplay... nothing. It just feels so empty and meaningless. 

I’m not sure how to bring this up to him. I feel like I should provide a solution to every problem I bring up, I just don’t have any with this one. I’m not sure how to address his stamina and size issues nor the lack of romance/intimacy. Like how do I coach someone into begin romantic and passionate?",04Apr2020,2
577,"I'm on mobile and English isn't my first language.

When I (19M) was in secondary school (Brazil),  I had her as my math teacher. Even though she was very strict, she was also fun and I became friends with her during my years there.

When I was at that school, I used to dedicate myself to do various ""tasks"" to assist the school itself such as editing videos for events, dealing with projectors, formatting computers and etc. I was a very naive kid so my teachers ""paid"" me using grades which didn't matter much because I'm a good student.

When I was in high school, I lost contact with my old school and I discovered that they got a student like me to do their stuff. But the math teacher always sent me a text asking for something and she actually paid me in money for those actions. I felt like my work was finally being valued.

Now that I'm in college, I had to move away from my old town. But the math teacher now texts me randomly asking for the same things as before (birthday invitations, video editions, photo editions...) and now she doesn't pay for the same works I did in the past. Now, she thinks that I am able to draw/use an app to make caricatures of people for various purposes.

Last time she asked me for something caricature related, I explained her that I am not able to draw characters like that because I am not an artist. I told her that she needed to commission an art if she really wanted something like that. She then said that what I said wasn't true because the caricature was a picture on her phone (she thinks artists only draw on paper or canvas) so I had to explain to her that digital art is a thing and I can't do it either.

And yesterday, she texted me saying that she wanted some custom WhatsApp stickers that resemble her like her friend has. BUT her friend actually commissioned and paid an artist for that and my ex teacher wants me to do it for free. I said to her that I am not a digital artist and she ignored me until now. She always starts her messages with: ""🙈🙈🙈 miss you, can you do [thing] for me?""

For context, that teacher helped me out a lot in the past but I believe that I repaid her by getting good grades and getting free tuition for my college.

I don't know how to deal with her. Now that I'm in college, people actually value my work and pay me but, whenever she texts I feel that she thinks that she is entitled to my help because she was my ex teacher that helped me out.

The out of state school is my top choice because I prefer the campus and setting, the people seem really welcoming, etc. However, I still like my second choice and feel that I could be happy at either school. Is it worth it to go for my preferred school, or should I save money and stay in-state?

We've been taking quarantine very seriously. My brother and I have only left the house to go on walks around the neighborhood, that's it. My mom, though, is a nurse, and even though they've been taking precautions at her workplace the point still stands.

My dad is 60 and lives completely alone. He has depressive tendencies and not a lot of friends. He's been able to work from home, but he's been completely isolated other than maybe going to the store. In normal circumstances he’ll sometimes come over and hang out for a while on the weekends.

He wants to come over again this weekend and I’m not sure what to do. We’re not concerned about him giving anything to us, just us giving anything to him, the real point of worry here being my mom and her profession.

He says he's desperate for human interaction, and he knows the risk but is willing to take it to see us. I don't know what to do. I really feel for him and I'm worried about him. He's taking quarantine really hard and I want to do whatever I can to help. I've been trying to reach out to him as much as I can, but via text or call isn't the same as spending time in person and he's insistent about coming over. All I can think about is my poor dad sitting all by himself in his lonely house. To be honest, there’s a part of me that really wants to see him too.

But on the other hand, even if it’s a risk he’s willing to take, I’m not sure I’m willing to take it. We’ve all been doing well symptoms-wise, including my mom, but the asymptomatic aspect of the virus really scares me. None of us have gotten tested, obviously. I don’t want to risk giving him the virus. He’s my dad and I love him and I don’t want anything to happen to him.

583,"Let me preface to say that I already know I’m a total piece of shit so I’m not looking for any sympathy, I merely just want to get this off my chest and just talk about it since I can’t with anybody else. And if you want to call me every bad name in the book go ahead cause I deserve it. 

Where to begin, this may be long so bear with me. She was a Pomeranian and passed away at 8 years old unexpectedly back in late January of this year due to kidney failure and a myriad of other complications and I’m sure me hurting hurt her didn’t help with that and probably had an effect on her declining health. Well she was feeling bad for a month before it happened which my family and I thought she was depressed because of my sister, which was her dog to begin with, not being around much. Anyway a couple weeks later and a week before she passed, I took her for a small walk at the park which didn’t last more than 20 minutes. My memory may be foggy because of how I’ve tried to block it out since but anyway everything was going good at first I was trying to be patient with her letting her walk where she wanted and sniff whatever. We got near the end of a fence where out of the blue she freaked out all of a sudden and her leash came loose. Let me also preface to say looking back now that she probably felt discomfort from her sickness or something which is why she freaked out. 

When I got hold of her the first time I put her leash back on and wanted to continue the walk but then she got loose again and then I tried to put it back on her but she got loose again and again and so on. I don’t remember how many times she got loose maybe 4 to 6 times. This is also absolutely no excuse but a little background won’t hurt to share, but I have back and knee problems and I’ve been suicidal for years and this year especially that last month has been the worst where I was already on edge and ready to flip out any moment at any inconvenience. Well after trying to get hold of her I was getting extremely frustrated especially since I didn’t want to make a scene in public which I shouldn’t even have cared about to begin with but it added to my frustration. The last time she got loose she ran away from me and went to a strangers car and another strangers truck which both looked like my sisters car and brothers truck which I’m sure she thought the vehicles were. But anyway she ran around both the car and truck both once and me trying to chase her down which just added more fuel to my uncontrollable temper. I finally got hold of her and I couldn’t control myself at that point. Damn I swear I’m such a fucking pathetic piece of shit man-child, but anyway I got mad as hell and while walking to the car holding her I shook and pinched her hard numerous of times and then when I got to my car I put her in the passenger seat and then got in myself and reflecting on what just happened. I was in total distraught and mad and then I said a lot of mean things to her most of which I don’t remember but I do remember yelling at her ‘Why can’t you just be a normal dog.?’ I also kept yelling to myself ‘Why can’t things just go fucking smoothly for once???’ numerous of times and cussing about hitting the steering wheel before finally lashing out one last time at her and pushed her off the passenger seat and onto the floor of the car. I remember saying other mean things to her but I don’t recall what I said and then when I finally cooled down a bit I drove straight home not thinking about what I just did until later. I don’t even remember what happened later that day or week besides the day she passed away. I didn’t even get to go when my sister took her to the vet that night. I wish I was there for her but knowing what I did I fucking deserved it. I didn’t deserve her love and I took her for granted. 

What now you may ask? I don’t know which is why I’m asking if there’s any advice on how to somehow lessen the pain of what I did. I’m trying to learn my lesson but the memory of it has been torturing me ever since and I wish I could undo what I did but it’s fueling my desire to die even more if this keeps happening. Some may even say therapy is an option but I highly doubt that’ll work since I’m not very open to talk about this as compared to online and since the therapy offices around here are closed due to the coronavirus that’s obviously not going to happen anytime soon. There’s probably no advice that can help with this and it’s probably best that way because I deserve every bit of the same pain I caused her.  Anyway yea.",04Apr2020,2
584,"Hello,i am a teenager from philippines.
I'm here to ask for advice from y'all,especially those who experienced getting bullied.
When i was in 10th grade people just make fun of me and bullied me,even my friends make fun of me.
One time they make fun of me and all the people in our class laugh at me and make me cry. I was so sad but acted normal when i got home. My bullies stop bullying me for awhile but continue to bully me for my face. This caused me to be so insecure about myself. Usually when they make fun of me i just laugh thinking it's just a joke,but when it got serious and hurtful i dont know what to do and just feel bad about myself. Now even my family bullies me,make fun of me in social media and in front of other people it hurts me. And it lower my confidence.
Im going to be a senior high school in about 3 months. I want to use that time to be confident but i dont know where to start. Please help me so that people will not make fun of me and bully me :((",04Apr2020,1
585,Anyone have any advice on how I can stay positive and motivated during this whole quarantine thing? My mother and older sister constantly argue which causes my mom to take her anger out on everyone else including me. I hate being inside and feeling trapped. I am not even allowed to go buy more makeup at our local dollar store that's like two minutes away (which is something I enjoy doing to pass the time and take my mind off things). Everything feels so negative all the time and I have so much school work to catch up on and no motivation to do it. I recently got out of a depressive episode that I struggled with for a long time and at the beginning of the new year I was so pumped and excited to just start fresh with everything but all my attempts to stay positive has been thrown in the trash because of everything going on and I am starting to feel like crap again. I want to stay happy and motivated but it is so difficult with everything that is going on and not being able to get out and do things I enjoy. I am just so tired of everything and wish I could just take a break from everything familiar to me.,04Apr2020,1

588,"Throwaway account because I dont want this mixed in with comics.

I consider myself a mediocre webcomic artist who tries to post comics here on reddit regularly. I've always drawn for as long as I could remember and comics have always interested me as they combine my love for drawing and writing together. It started off as a thing I did because I loved it. And my friends encouraged me to post them online because they thought other people would enjoy it. 

One of my earlier comics made it to the front page. It was a big deal at the time for me. And from then on, my comics would get a minimum of a thousand upvotes or so. They don't lie when they say internet points make you feel like you're riding a high. I was and still am very not known in the comic world, but it started to turn into a chase for those likes.

I then made a polarizing comic without thinking. I make these at home, in my underwear, sometimes I show them to my cat. I don't have an editor or anything. It unintentionally came off as gatekeeping and though it got a lot of upvotes as well, the comments were brutal. The post ended up being nuked by a mod, that's how bad it got.

Thus commenced my 2 month or so hiatus. I was knocked down. I know putting myself on the internet puts me on the frontline for criticism, but I learned the hard way that I couldn't handle it.

I started posting again thanks to quarantining, I have nothing better to do but churn out half assed comics. My inspiration is still not the same as it used to be. My comics nowadays only get a handful of likes which hurts my ego which in turn makes me depressed and my comics are getting more shit in terms of substance because I'm running out of ideas other people havent made comics on. 

I still keep trying to convince myself I still like making these. That I'm not chasing fame or likes or anything. But I find myself obsessively checking how many upvotes I'm getting, how many followers I'm gaining/losing.

Basically I want to go back to how it was at the beginning. When 10 upvotes was enough to make my day. When I wasn't beating myself up over artblock. I know I should quit just do art as I like. But it's like an addiction, making comics so I can one day quit working at a grocery store and make comics full time. And the people that consistently hate my stuff also fuel the fire to keep making them because I don't want them to win. 

God, when did I become so sad.

TL;DR: I'm a medicore comic artist. Once my comics started getting some traction and I once made it to the front page, I became used to getting at least 1k likes. But after one comic with poor word choice caused such a rift, mods had to come and nuke the post, I haven't been the same about making comics. I guess the decline in quality shows with how many upvotes I get nowadays. But it's like an addiction. I tasted internet fame, I imagined quitting my job at a grocery store and making comics fulltime. Yet here I am, crying over mean comments. But I also don't want to quit and let the people that consistently hate my comics win. I know this is very sad and I should be more concerned about world hunger but here we are.",04Apr2020,1
589,"This may be long but... I'll try to cut it as short as possible.
My best friend and I have been best friends for the last 9 years. I'll call her Cassie. She has always been the quiet, shy, anxious, nervous type. Church going, girl next door type of thing. Never partied, never drank, never done drugs. She was valedictorian in high school, we've been friends since middle school. I was also shy and quiet, but when it came down to it, much more extroverted. She was in an incredibly toxic relationship (he was also her first relationship and took her V) and finally, finally got out of it after two years and he cheated on her. 
I moved 1400 miles away right about here in this story. After the breakup, she started hanging out with this group of friends at her college, and slowly but surely started partying- hard-, drinking excessively (during the day almost every day a week), smoking, skipping class, failing classes, and calling out of work. She started innocently hooking up with this guy in this group, who, even in her OWN words, wasn't in her ""league"". I don't care about looks and am not even talking about them. I'm meaning, this guy dropped out of school, smokes, drinks, lives with his parents, works at a fast food place. But looks... not that great either. 
I warned her when they started hooking up to just be clear with each other it was only hooking up, and that only. She agreed, said she was just having fun and wanted NO relationship ANY time soon. She was even interested in another guy. 
Then the guy she was hooking up with confessed he had feelings for her. And she said to me, ""I don't really like him, but I maybe could eventually, for fun."" And I told her that was a horrible reason to enter a relationship and not to do it. She agreed. And then two days later changed her status on Facebook to dating him without telling me first. 
About a DAY later, she is telling me she loves him. And poor Cassie, when she dates, she is one of those, ""I will die without you"", all in, type of girls. I told her I was happy for her, and just take it slow. I'm not sure if she took this as passive aggressive, but, since, we talk about once a week, where we used to talk about everyday. And when we do talk, it's strictly and religiously only about her boyfriend/her new habits. 

I've kind of strayed away from being as close to her as I was, and basically what I'm asking is, am I wrong for this? I don't wanna be the friend that started critiquing her lifestyle and her hate me so I just... backed off. Help?",04Apr2020,1

594,"The past few years my (24M) confidence, self-esteem plummeled due to self isolation (not the social distancing kind) and maybe a episode of heavy depression, which resulted in me having a hard time to ""feel"".

By feel I mean , empathising with other people on their problems (I don't mean it in sociopathic way), offering genuince advice and being able to relate. These feelings go hand in hand with the ups and downs of my own mental health. So since this pandemic hit and we practise social distancing I basically go from work to home and the opposite route the last couple of weeks. This situation as it can be assumed led to self doubting and such symptoms.

What can I do to put my emotional and mental life back on track?",04Apr2020,1
595,"A few days ago my ex-boyfriend got outed for doing some, not so great stuff. He tried calling me but I was asleep at the time and then messaged me on Twitter saying goodbye and that he had taken an overdose. Tried to contact his family to make sure he was okay but couldn’t get through to them. Ended up doing a welfare check and we found out he had gotten into a car crash. 

I feel so overwhelmingly guilty for many things, especially not picking up that phone call. He had many many psychological issues in which had never been addressed and all anyone wanted was for him to get help. A therapist told me that even with immense psychotherapy there’s a chance he would’ve never changed his ways. 

My ex never once showed any suicidal tendencies, he never believed in suicide. Especially because I’ve attempted before so he’s been around those situations. This was impulsive. It was so out of the blue and I think I’m still in immense shock. He did some very messed up shit to me, when he messaged me last I was just angry at him. He told me he always loved me, he didn’t believe I loved him but it wasn’t my fault and not to blame myself. I didn’t know whether to believe any of what he was saying.

I’m only a younger teenager, I’ve never lost anyone in my life. I’ve never been close with family or friends, never opened up. I’ve had a long history of mental issues since I was a really young child and a history of neglect. I have bad social anxiety so I’ve never been able to realistically be around people in person without breaking down. This is the first person I opened up to, told anything, spent time with in person, trusted, loved. 

He did bad things, but he didn’t deserve this. He should’ve went to jail or rehab. I don’t know if he could’ve changed but I know a part of him wanted to be good. I just can’t believe he’s gone. I can’t get any emotional support from a professional because of the corona virus currently. It would take ages for me to get assessed. 

Ever since he’s been gone everything has gotten so much worse. My paranoia is so intense, I’ve never been afraid of the dark but I feel sick to my stomach at night. I’ve been uncontrollably shaking. I can’t eat but I want to throw up so nothing comes out and it feels insanely painful. I feel like I’m suffocating, like I can’t get air to my lungs. I’ve felt suicidal, immensely. I have no energy to do anything. I haven’t showered, I only get out of bed to go to the toilet. I feel like I have nothing. 

I deleted all of the stuff we had together after we broke up but was able to recover some of it. I made a box, of all the stuff he got me. Was able to find the ring he gave me and hoodie that I threw out. I don’t want to get rid of it, ever. Each night I’ve been cuddling with the elephant he got me and his hoodie. I just don’t know how to cope. 

I’m supposed to start college in a few months time, i don’t know how I’ll focus. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get through this. My family really don’t care, at all. They don’t understand. They hate him. I have some supportive friends which is good. Even then, the loneliness I feel is overwhelming.

When we broke up I got so upset because of the fact when I woke up he wouldn’t be there, but I knew I could text him and check up on him if I wanted to. Now he’s actually gone and I just, it’s like I don’t feel safe anymore. He was abusive, he wasn’t a good guy at all. Maybe even a fictitious cure to my depression. He gave me a good time, he gave me an understanding in what love felt like. What it was like to have a relationship with anyone, not in a romantic way but just in general. It feels so surreal, this happened out of the blue and I don’t know what to do with myself, it hurts so fucking much. I just feel like I’m slowly withering away. 

I don’t know how I’m supposed to cope with this, the last call was the day before. I think I’m the last person he talked to, call and message wise. We broke up but we still acted like we were together, we were still loyal to one another, he said “Awh, I love you so much, I’ll talk later, bye bye cutie” and I just, I can’t get his voice out of my head. No matter what I do. The only thing left I have of his voice is a video telling me he loves me. Listening to it is unbearable. This is all, so unbearable. I just can’t help but blame myself. I don’t know what to do.",04Apr2020,1
596,I've watched maybe half of the marvel movies but wanted to start over and watch them all. When looking online I've realized there are two options (1) the order the movies were released (2) chronologically by the date happening during the film. Which way should I watch them? Why?,04Apr2020,2
597,"If it was every single time we were together I would just say something then, but he does it so randomly that I can’t. I told him once when he waited for me to ask him something just so he could say “bro bitches are texting me hold on” I just said “You are being fake as hell” and all he had to say was “Chill I’m not saying you are wrong, sorry.” He owned up to it that one time, which makes me sad that it’s starting up again.

That was the end of it for a while until we went on a trip somewhere. We aren’t even talking to eachother and he just bursts out with “Some girl just messaged me” 
I am majorly concerned because who would make up things that insignificant and use it as a brag? I didn’t say anything because I would have just went off on him and family was around, but that is 100% toxic behavior. And I can tell that he tries to do it more when he notices that I’m talking to another one of my friends or something, but I don’t even involve him in that in the slightest, because I don’t hang out with my friends to throw my other friends in their face.

Where I need help is how to approach him with this, I feel like me bringing it up 2 days later when he already forgot about it would probably give him the satisfaction and think in his mind “Hey that got him jelous, i need to use that story more often.”
But at the same time I’m not going to hang out with him until he acts toxic.


**CONCLUSION:** Next time he asks me to hang out, how do I bring this up to him without him thinking I’m playing into his game, but instead make him see that I just want my best friend to be real with me 100%?",04Apr2020,1

602,"Don’t worry; there will be a TLDR, but I’ll spend a bit setting up the situation for context. 

So my employers have a very long track record with screwing me and the only other employee at the store over. I work at a run down gas station that can be best described as the epitome of “building purgatory”. It’s not surprising for customers to tell me they were surprised the doors opened because from the outside (and from the inside, until you see the employee) it looks closed. Our employer/boss/owner - who I haven’t seen in person since last November - doesn’t care at all about the store, and I’m not sure why he even keeps it open because our daily revenue is about $200 ($400 on an insanely good day). They can’t even afford to pay 2 people per shift so working nights is pretty much terrifying, but if one of us has to miss a shift... well, we really can’t. Our women’s restroom has been out of order for a little over 4 months as the ceiling collapsed and they never bothered to fix it. Our shelves are nearly empty because they don’t restock us, our beer coolers have been broken since last August (they still expect us to sell and but I refuse), and only half of our gas pumps work. And when they do, cards often get stuck or the pumps are so slow customers have to cancel the transactions. We were told a remodel was scheduled for last December, and then February 1st. It’s now April 4th and neither me or the other employee have gotten any new word. 

Basically, we’re a sh*t hole. There’s honestly no reason for our store to be open at all, nevermind in the current state of things. I live in a state where our governor only shut down bars and nightclubs, only to come out weeks later and say “oh whoops, I didn’t know asymptomatic people could be contagious too”. The general public here is... about on that level. For any frame of reference, I had a man come in and tell me he didn’t need to respect our social distancing policies or be afraid of the virus because “he fought in ‘nam’”. Another coughed into his hand and immediately pulled out cash and tried to hand it to me. I had to ask him to leave. 

But people are getting more aggressive about not following our safety precautions and it’s a double whammy for me because in my opinion, again, we should really never be open. We’re a gas station so I’m not sure if we’re an “essential business”, but even if we are I really don’t think we’re an essential store. If I were to ask my employers though of course they would say yes. Also, if it makes any difference, I can see THREE OTHER gas stations from our cash register and they look nothing like ours.

TL;DR - I work in a run down gas station that makes $200-$400 a day around people that don’t respect our safety precautions and I don’t think we should be open at all nevermind be considered an “essential business” in a pandemic.",04Apr2020,2

Just started dating someone new and we cannot fall asleep together and now that I think about it, there’s been a couple of others that we just couldn’t sleep next to each other.

The only 3 times that she’s slept over we cannot fall asleep, we both sleep like shit, and agree that the next day is miserable.

In all cases it’s not like one of us falls asleep and the other suffers, it’s like we are both sync’d up and just makes for a miserable night.

It kinda ruined other relationships and now she just goes home so I’m guessing this will end the same way...I offer to sleep on the couch but she said she’d rather sleep in her bed.

We’ve tried her place too with the same results.

607,"My SO and myself both live with our families at the moment (we’re both in our 20s) and prior to this global crisis I was supposed to move out right about now. 
We both deal with families that are prone to domestic violence however my SO deals with far worse than I do. 
A couple days ago their parents got into an argument that my SO tried to break up and as a result was kicked out of the house. No car, no where to go, spends most of the day outside and at the moment has a couch to crash on for another day or two. I’m not sure what to tell them or what advice to offer. If I could I would bring them here to me but I cannot. 
Maybe a shelter isn’t an awful suggestion but with Covid-19 being a concern, suggestion that lead to a large group of people is not really an option. I’m not sure what to do or say. The entire situation really infuriates me. I even feel angered by the simple fact that my SO is acting as if everything is ok one minute (maybe just to attempt to reassure me) then freaks out the next, but beyond that will not give me many details about what they are currently dealing with. (Again probably so I won’t worry but we’re beyond that point now aren’t we?) 
What advice does one offer to someone in that situation...?

608,"I’ve been trying to get this through his head my entire life but he just won’t understand. I’m a very private person so I don’t like talking about my job or school or even when I exercise, it just makes me feel uncomfortable for other people to know everything I do. Ever since quarantine started I’ve been keeping a very strict schedule that keeps me in my room almost all day. I have 2 2-hour breaks that I give myself and I usually spend it around my family or I catch up on some shows. For the rest of the day I do a couple at home workouts, study, and work from home. However, my dad doesn’t believe it and he thinks I’m just wasting time. He has never tried to see me while I’m working and refuses to even believe I do any sort of exercise. I feel uncomfortable explaining that I do all of those things so I try to tell him that even though he doesn’t see it, it still happens. My mom and my sister can vouch for me but they won’t so my dad goes all day everyday saying that I’m a waste of space and I’m wasting my life away. I don’t know what else to do.",04Apr2020,1

610,"I am a CNA in a hospital in a major metropolitan area. We haven't been hit hard with COVID-19 yet, but we do have several positive patients. The hospital has restructured things so all COVID patients, positive and rule out, are on one floor. I don't work ICU, ED, or on the COVID units, but there is always the possibility I could be floated there.

My ex and I don't have a good relationship, he's been emotionally abusive and bullying to me, and basically blames me for ruining his life. After a rough divorce, we share 50/50 custody of our son. 

Earlier this week he asked if I would be willing to let our son stay with him for an extended period so I don't risk exposing him to COVID. I told him I would need to think about it. He has made it clear to me in the past that he would want full custody of our son if ""I'm not up to the task,"" and I worry there is an ulterior motive here. Yesterday he sent me a lengthy text message and implied that if I didn't do what he asked I'd be killing our child.

Obviously I love my son and every time I come to the  hospital I worry I'm bringing something home to my family. Despite my ex's behavior to me, he treats our son well. And he has the option to work from home right now. 

I'm nervous how this will affect custody, and there's no way to know when the pandemic and/or quarantine will end. I also would never forgive myself if something happened to my son. I'm torn. 

Should I let my son stay with his dad for his safety?

I’m 23 now and after being in and out of college, I’m finally going back whenever this pandemic clears up to finish my AA. I’ve been using the “still have time to figure it out” card for awhile but me and my degree are reaching that point, the forked roads. My life growing up I was always inclined as a musician. Learned piano, flute, drums, voice. Though I’m not exceptionally talented, I have always thought of myself as creative and wanted some of that to be implemented in my career choice. I have other interests in life, such as math and language, but haven’t sought any careers in that realm. I think what’s really happening in my head is, I’ve worked dead end jobs with shitty bosses etc etc. I’ve also been a consumer at many business etc etc. Maybe it’s the cynicism in me.. I know if I end up with some job where I’m just a gear to the “machine”, my life is not my job. I still have freedom outside of work to pursue whatever I want. The thing is, I’m going to be working for a long time, and I’m okay with that. But the more I think about it, I feel like I can do so much more. I can contribute in a larger way. Especially with the current global state of affairs; I’ve even considered social work/politics. I guess I’m young and still have time to prove myself.. the possibilities are endless.

Together he and i have written a story that he cant post himself because he wants to remain anonymous but he lives somewhere in the middle east. Rest asured he will be reading the comments. Whats written is now his own story. Basically i live in a country where im the only agnostic i know of and the country is 100 percent religious and that makes it so that i cant really let anyone know about it or else my life could be in danger so i need a way to move to another country where atleast non religious people are tolerated I have to go to university to complete my education but that's where the problem gets worse ive had mental health issues since i was a kid and on top of that things havent really been ideal. Im almost 20 now and ive passed college and my dad wants me to work at his store which i do and i dont get paid a cent for it. I dont get any pocket money he thinks since hes my father im free labor so they wont let me continue my studies plus i cant get a job because you dont get a job just from passing college in my country.I need money for education which requires a a job which requires an education (nasty spiral). So that means i dont have a way out of anywhere ive lost touch with my irl friends because my phone broke in highschool and they never got me a new one so i cant even ask my friends for help. I get told that im worthless by my parents everytime i ask for something or in general too. So today after id finally had had enough i decided to end it all and took out all the Aspirin i could find at home. Did some research because id have one shot at suicide because if i survive it will make things a lot worse than they already are but it turns out there is a high chance ill survive using aspirin or any other way for that matter so i didnt go through with it and decided to talk to friends (mental health is taboo in my country). My online friends helped me get my head straight today and calmed me down enough to not do it.

617,"hi so i’m in a relationship with someone that ive been living with for the past year &amp; maybe 6 months ago he started physically abusing me. a lot of things he did come with some sort of reason, i.e slapping me in the shower naked and telling me to get out immediately after because he thought i was cheating on him. he threw a portable charger at me, close range , breaking it &amp; opening a healed scar on the top of my head. (then proceeded to say he “didn’t mean for for it to hit my head only my body”) actual quote. 

there was a situation one night that affected me &amp; had happened because we were together, i told him i didn’t want to do it anymore and i was done. he screamed at me the entire way home &amp; when we got to the parking lot hit me in my face and i bled out of my nose for about an hour. “i was angry.” my nose hasn’t looked the same since. 

&amp; one time which i believe i deserved, i had brought my ex boyfriend into the apartment we shared we weren’t doing anything really but i shouldn’t have done that. he slammed me against a wall opening that same scar, kicked me threw me around and before the police came had me stand in a mirror &amp; wipe the blood off my neck and put on new makeup. i was too scared to say anything when they came. 

so i guess what i’m asking for is anyone to tell me the best way to get out of this. i have his car in my name his insurance and i don’t believe he has anywhere to go. i haven’t told anyone my best friend knows but we aren’t in communication right now. my mom and stepdad would loose it and i don’t want to mess up his life. i still love him i’m just scared and i’m tired of living my life like this. 

he’s done so much more that i couldn’t remember if i tried. i have ptsd from my father doing similar things and being in this relationship like this makes it so much worse. every time i try to leave he gets aggressive or won’t let me he cries in my face &amp; tells me he doesn’t have anyone else. he doesn’t have anywhere to go he can’t register his car he has a child and it would fuck up their lives. but i seriously can’t do it and i don’t know what to do.

621,"My sister has been an absolute psycho as long as I can remember. We're both diagnosed with asperger's, she uses it as an excuse to get out of trouble and I just don't think about it. 

Here's some recent examples of her being a psychopath: 

1. She stole my butterfly knife from me, cut herself, brought it to school, showed it to people, and made a threat. When she got caught, she ran away from school, threw it in the woods, and somehow she avoided police charges &amp; a statewide expulsion by the school helping her transfer to another public school because mom argued she can't help it bc her aspergers. In the process though, she tried to put it on me which was quickly knocked down, but my parents still are mad that I ""let"" her get it. She popped the lock on my door (still broken btw) and took it out of my drawer. My knife is still in police custody and I won't get it back. 

2. She was getting caught with being a bully at school, so she faked an overdose (an rx bottle full of melatonin pills), spread a rumor she was cutting herself, and got a psychiatric hospitalization. She kept intentionally acting up (being a bully ironically) from within the psych ward to extend her stay until she thought it would blow over. It worked and she admitted it on a private musicly. 

3. She had her phone taken permanently because she was talking to older men. She stole my phone, which I paid for, then wiped the contents. I reported it stolen to police and everything because I didn't know she took it. No-one found out until state police caught her 35yo boyfriend and tracked her down. Now my phone is in custody of the FBI permanently because she was doing shit online with old men from across the country. She tried to tell the police that I (legal age in my state) impersonated her online so I could do freaky shit with older men. Between my mom and her she managed to avoid all trouble with the police. 

4. I don't have great evidence for this one, but I think she stole the tool to undo my bike chain, and did it in an inconspicuous spot that interfered with my breaking. I found the tool in her room but have no other evidence it was her. Fyi I use a bike in my job, pizza delivery, the only way I make money. 

5. Any time she gets in trouble, she uses aspergers as an excuse to get out of everything. I have aspergers too and I can't get out of anything even with a legit alibi. 

6. The other day she told me that I'm a retard because our parents let me smoke. I told her she's a retard because she thinks that star-witness mommy is going to get her out of her murder charge when she's caught killing people &amp; stealing their shit to do illegal stuff. I also called her out on all the things shes done lately, told her all the shit I know that she doesn't think I do or my parent just don't believe (ie her admitting everything on musicly). My parents are now mad at me because she fake cried her way out of it, then made fun of me when my parents weren't there. My parents kicked me out overnight and still aren't talking to me.

Help. I'm seriously afraid she'll hurt me or somehow twist something to where I get in trouble. She has all the traits of psycho (ie murdering my pet mouse when we were younger) and I don't want to end up swimming with the fishes.

**TL;DR** - I'm genuinely afraid of my sister doing something really bad to me, and I have nowhere to go. I don't want to end up in jail or swimming with the fishes. How can I protect myself (physically &amp; otherwise)?",04Apr2020,2

The program in which he is in is supposed to help him be independent but we end up babysitting the dude.

644,"I work from home normally and the only places I really go are: the barn where my horses are (closed), grocery store (doing shipt), dog park (closed) and my SO’s house (haven’t seen him in weeks).

Issue is SO and I’m trying to sort if I’m overreacting or not. 

My SO works for a skilled nursing/elder care/retirement facility traveling between multiple locations where they are taking serious precautions. He is very good about adhering to these but his risk of exposure is still relatively high since many of the residents are still leaving to visit family and run errands. 

He has a 7YO kiddo who goes back and forth between mom and dad 50/50  2,2,3 schedule and to gma’s during the day since school is canceled for the year. Mom’s partner is in law enforcement and is working so he is at higher risk of exposure too.

I have dealt with 12-18 mo deployments so to me, a few weeks isn’t a big deal as far as separation from loved ones if that’s what we need to do.

I’m just wondering if I’m overreacting. My SO is being pretty reasonable about my decision not to see him but he feels like perhaps I’m overreacting. We had planned to shelter together originally—when I thought he would be laid off and kiddo would be staying with us for the duration. But since neither of those things are in play, it seems risky.

We are in MI if that matters. So we are being hit pretty hard in certain parts of the state. It’s not as bad where we are as it is in Detroit, but it’s certainly here. 

Thoughts?

My brother and his girlfriend came here too and unlike me, they're able to work from their computers, so I'm sure that's a factor too.

Anyway, my parents keep pressuring me to find work; suggesting things like Instacart for grocery delivery, or working for Amazon delivery, or even just assisting grocery stores with stocking/bagging. But on the other hand they keep mentioning how important it is for us to take this seriously and avoid catching this virus the best we can.

So basically I don't know what to do, I feel like most work right now involves exposing yourself to the public so other people don't have to, but at the same time if I catch this thing in doing so I just infect another 4 people are home and become part of the problem.

But I would like to call what happened a love at first sight. We’re both kind of addicted to each other. Really clingy, and our love is really strong. 

I need to précise too that I’m a really emotional person that is controlled by his actual emotion. I’m not « selfish or self centered » enough to be happy on my own. I always need people around me. And she was balancing me a lot because we re really different, she’s always the kind of happy person, smiling.. as I’m more pejorative. So with her, I feel complete. I feel like she’s not an extra but more a part of me.

My problem here is that I miss her to death. Like literally. I often find myself crying in the shower, pulling my hairs (at a reasonable level though ;)) and feeling really really bad. Like unmotivated for everything. My heart feels compressed.. I can tell that she misses me too, she needs me, but due to her mindset (I think) she’s still living good and I’m happy for it. But sometimes I feel like she doesn’t understand why I am that sad, I feel alone.. and if we split up for future studies I’m scared of dying inside for months. 
Im nostalgic about how good the past was and afraid of the future. 

So if one of you has already lived something like it ? Know how to overcome feelings ? How to deal with such a situation ? How to help a whiny little guy haha ?

647,I (F 16) am quarantined and everything was going fine I was getting all my work done and being responsible around the house etc. My mom however made a schedule for me planning everything I do by the hour and it’s driving me crazy! I’m not five and I hate being controlled by her. I sleep when I need to sleep and work when I feel productive. I didn’t give her any reason to try to control me but she’s doing it anyways and threatens to take my phone and laptop if I don’t follow. It’s the stupidest schedule that interferes with my online classes but she says she doesn’t care. I told her how I feel but she isn’t doing anything to change it and give me space. I’m going insane!!!!! Help,04Apr2020,3
648,"I’ve realized I’m the toxic person all along. I’m an insecure and selfish person actually. 
I have been with my partner (not really dating not really fwb either) for a year now and I’ve blown up most of the time we hung out over my own insecurities like he’d say things that don’t sit well with me and I’d consider it like a personal attack. (You can pm me for the details bc he’s on here too and it would be too obvious) 

He’s honestly a nice dude and he doesn’t deserve this. Yet I’d snap at him and even pick fights just to get his attention. Sometimes I even try to give him the silent treatment so that he’d talk to me more. Basically all of this stems from my insecurities of not feeling loved considering we haven’t declared it official yet we’re ‘exclusive’.

I’m self-aware of being manipulative but for some reason it’s so hard for me to catch myself doing it or when I actually do, I cringe and it’s so uncomfortable for me to even think about so I try to completely ignore it or justify as if I did nothing wrong. 

I need advice how to get this sorted out. And not just the ‘don’t be mean’ advice bc that’s kinda obvious.

Thanks for reading! And sorry it’s a bit messy bc I’m going through a whirlwind of emotions right now.

TLDR; I’m a toxic person towards my partner and I need help stopping it.",04Apr2020,2

She asked what I would do if she found another guy better than me and I say if she thinks he would make her happier then she should go for it. However, when she asked me the same thing I just said I would ask this potential partner if she would like to join us(My Gf is bi and we are ok with polygamy. It almost happened before). But then my Gf asked what if this girl says she isn't into polygamy.

And I was speechless. I cant help but wonder what I ought to do if that were to actually happen. If I found someone whose interests align with mine better and so on. My Gf is great but we are very different in many ways that many are surprised we are together. But at the same time is it really right to just dump her because someone else who somehow likes me might be a better fit?

651,"TL;DR mom is lonely and bored, probably depressed, just lives with family friend of ours. Cant leave and socialize with others because of the virus going around. She works in the medical field as a nurse under a specialist. She's had interest in crosstitching but idk how much she is anymore. Doesn't really play videogames, do art, not much of a reader, play an instrument, has to use hotspot for internet bc of where she lives.

So my mom is really lonely and she cried twice on the way back home to drop me off yesterday because she feels like no one wants to be around her. If you want the explanation for this, keep reading, if not, go to the next paragraph. The male family friend of ours that she stays with didnt want me there because of the risk of the virus and refused to talk to her more about it (which is understandable). My dad (who I stay with) and her are separated and dont want to be around each other so she won't stay here. And my brother (who stays with my dad and I) is always either working or with his girlfriend which has been a normal thing for a while now. So thats why she feels like no one wants to be around but she doesn't see its just the circumstances that everyones in.

She doesn't have many friends because she's not a 'people' person, I can think of maybe 3 friends (that I know of) she could talk to, however one has a daughter that just had a baby so she's out for now.

Her job is in the medical field as a nurse under a specialist, but their hours are being cut so she now has even more time to herself.

So, I've been trying to think of stuff for her to do that shes not thinking about. I remember she used to do crosstitching but of course had kids (including me) and never got back into it. Doesn't really play videogames, do art, play an instrument, not much of a reader and she has to use hotspot for internet because of where she lives.

Does anyone have suggestions or could ask probing questions that could give me an idea?",04Apr2020,1

659,"So today I (M24) woke up and had to set up my parents (M65 and F60) new XFi pods to establish a mesh network for our home. Me being the 'smart' tech guy I am known to be, my parents set me up to do this job for them. As I am doing this I keep getting more and more frustrated because the pods wont establish a connection with the gateway at the modem no matter what I do after googling to try and resolve this problem, meanwhile my mother is on a zoom call with her girlfriends from college who live all across the country and shes being somewhat loud and I ask her to put headphones on so I can concentrate better on what i'm doing (I have adhd and take medication) she does and is still rather loud as i'm frantically trying to get these XFi pods to connect. 

She then asks me to come say hi and I say ""i'm busy"" and her friends keep asking what i'm doing to the point where she asks again and I just snapped as in raised my voice because this set up is really frustrating me and I don't want to fail my parents. After her zoom call she said I almost made her cry infront of her friends because I raised my voice and she said I made her feel like a failure as a mom to talk to her in the way I did. I told her I was sorry and shouldn't have yelled/raised my voice and tried to explain my perspective and then hear hers, I explained that when I'm doing something that requires me to focus like this I can't be bothered just like how she can't be bothered when on a conference call for work. 

She said from her perspective I have done this before (which is true)  but still didn't seem like she understood what I was saying or trying to relate my feelings.

662,"20(F)- To start, I've always been a very shy kid, an ambitious student, one that followed all the rules. I had a good high school experience and I had an amazing group of friends. Most of my friends had their first kiss and so on at 15/16 and I was the last one in my friend group to have my first kiss at 17.  At the time that was with my first boyfriend. BUT even for my first kiss, it took me 2 hours to kiss him because I was soooo nervous (which is normal as it was my first kiss) But then every time we would hang out I would be so scared to kiss him. I couldn't do it and after 2 months and him being patient I finally got comfortable and wasn't afraid.  SO I thought to myself ok, thank god, you don't have this kissing problem anymore. Then as I got more comfortable we did other things and so on. But then things ended (he was older and went off to uni). After that, I was so heartbroken for about a year and a half and did not have a hooking up phase, I just focused on myself and my goals. I also am not someone who is into friends with benefits or hooking up with random men from the club, or tinder and shit. All my friends do it and that's fine, I am not judging, do what makes you happy. Anyways, after being heartbroken for so long, I would go out once in a while and have some drinks and you know I had NO PROBLEM kissing or dancing (it's the drinks). But now as a 20-year-old I've been on a few dates and they all go well, (I portray someone who is super confident, you know, I take care of my appearance, I eat healthily, I workout and look like someone confident BUT then we get back to the car and he leans in and I CAN'T do it like I can't kiss him. I don't know if it's because I'm nervous or what the fuck is wrong with me. I am sick of this, I just want to be a normal 20-year-old. It has happened on several occasions and it's made me afraid to even go out with guys anymore. What makes it worse is that I give an image of someone who is very confident, experienced, well-put together and decisive. So during the date part, I am very confident, playful blah blah BUT THEN shit goes downhill. I swear I am the only person with this problem. I don't know I I'm just someone who needs to get comfortable with someone, or if it's my anxiety or what it is. But even when it happens it confuses the shit out of the guys, I have heard ""You need to be more confident, you're a beautiful girl""  ""is it me? are you not attracted to me?"" ""maybe you just need to get more comfortable to me"" They've all been nice to me, but in their heads, they think I'm a whack job.  A quote that I relate to is ""fear is the number one killer"" and right now my fear is fucking me up. I guess I'm hoping someone has some sort of advice to give me or someone has been through something similar. At the end of the day, I know I am the only one who can really fix this.",04Apr2020,1

664,"Hello! I’m a 32 y/o female married to a 43 y/o male. We’ve lived together for 7 years, been together for almost 10. 

Lately his work schedule has changed because of the COVID 19 pandemic - unfortunately, his company laid off over 90% of their workers, leaving him and a small crew to take care of the remaining work. He’s in charge, so he’s there for the majority of the hours the business is open. He and I are both very thankful he still has his job, and worry daily if he could be the next to get laid off — we just take it day by day. 

That being said, he’s had to work sometimes 7 days a week, for 13 or 14 hour shifts. He writes the schedule, and is a self-admitted workaholic and control freak. He wants to be there most of the operating hours to make sure everything runs smoothly and to his standards. 

These extreme hours have caused a change in him. 
My behavior hasn’t changed (that I can tell) as I was already unemployed, and had a set routine for his workdays and his off-days. Since the 7 workdays a week began it’s been very hard for us emotionally; but my schedule continues along regardless, just all of the days are workdays, which is very lonely but beside the point. 

*The main issue I’m looking for help with is his attitude when he’s not at work.*

I listen to him vent about his day for the daily 2 hours I spend with him (the rest of the time he’s sleeping or eating or on his phone). Either he vents, or we argue over something very frivolous- such as where something was misplaced, or the positions we’re in on the couch. I’m aware this is probably projected anger and exhaustion from his job. He can be very frightening and loud when he’s angry; I usually end up in tears. 

I’ve tried very gently to bring it up- “*Please try not to take your work stresses out on me. I know it’s very hard right now, and you’re very overworked and concerned about your job, but I think we would have a better quality of life if you discussed your issues with me civilly rather than bursting out at me about other problems that aren’t related. These angry outbursts seem to be a result of your mood from working so much, but please correct me if I’m wrong.*”

He gets very upset when I make this comment. He’ll say things like “I had a great day at work!” or “No it isn’t work, work is good.” 

***************
**TL;DR** —

Again, I’ve watched the pattern, and truly believe it’s his work schedule (he even had to skip vacation because of the staffing issues) —but maybe I am jumping to conclusions, and there is another problem. However, when I ask what the issue could be he simply says “nothing”. 

I’m at an impasse. I want him to be able to relax and enjoy his time away from his job, but also he defends his job.  Also, since he writes the schedule, he’s the one who makes himself work so frequently. Is he lashing out because he’s home and would rather be at work? What should I be asking or saying to him to make him feel better about the situation, which I’m kind of thinking comes from his fear of being laid off?

**I should also note: we have a Skype meeting with a couples’ therapist on Monday. Should I bring this issue up or will it cause him embarrassment?**

665,"Seeking some advice (obviously). 
I finished my graduate program in November. I have been working very part time since then which has allowed me to mostly stay at home with my 6 month old. 

I started applying for residency programs and a couple of jobs and got a wonderful offer to complete a residency program (competitive and not that common but immensely helpful in my field) 2000 miles away from my hometown. I have always lived in my current are and my husband and I have always wanted to take a chance and move somewhere completely different. 

Well now we have a baby and moving away from family and friends is so much more bittersweet.  My dad isnt in the best of health and doesn't have anyone else except for my sister and I. I offered to have him come with us but he is very stuck in his ways but also depressed. I am so nervous that the next time I come home it'll be because he is very sick or worse. My husbands family and all of our friends are also nearby. This is likely going to be their only grandchild. 

I have an interview for a residency that would be in my hometown area and while I think itd be similar, it wouldn't be as good as this offer. 

So my question is: leave for the unknown/good offer or stay around family and friends and still get good experience but not take on the adventure?

671,"Quick background: we've known each other for like 6 years and for the last 3 have been hanging out very often. She's honestly my best friend, except over time I've developed strong feelings for her and I'm 99% sure it's only one-way. 

The reason why I want to tell her that at all is because I'm scared we're going to part our ways soon and can feel the clock ticking - we're going to be in college next year. Neither of us have decided yet but she's planning (loosely speaking) to move with a friend to another city. And I just really want to get it off my chest while I still can.

So why don't I? Because I'm scared that it would make her very uncomfortable. That it would feel awkward texting her later for both me and her and she's the closest person I've ever had. It'd be a huge risk to me, despite not sounding like it. I'm also a bit afraid she will think I was only her friend because I was hoping to hook up with her, and that thinking combined with the literal distance would probably kill the friendship. And I want all but that. I just want her to know how much she means to me and that she feels good about it, not weirded out.

673,"I’m 23 years old, and I guess I’ve been an over thinker for my entire life. I get ridiculously anxious over literally everything, and it’s always on my mind. I got out of a relationship a while ago, and I was trying hard for a long time to do what was best for me, but I had a very difficult time with moving forward alongside depression and this anxiety. We had stayed we both wanted to make sure we stayed in each other’s lives. We were both really the first person we’ve each loved. After a while I saw that it was probably for the best (we became EXTREMELY co-dependent on each other) but it felt really bad to still have her in my life as I was trying to move on. 

See, her roommate is my roommates girlfriend, and a side from that we have basically the same friend group, and I’m very very close with all 5 of her roommates. Basically it was impossible to not end up hearing what she or they were doing. This is where my anxiety comes in. 

I would always come up with these scenarios about like what she’s doing or who she’s with or whatever. And it’s literally all I’d think about. These imaginary scenarios that do literally nothing other than drive me crazy and make me insecure. And I still can’t stop it. 

Things got very bad for me back in January, and I decided that I needed to get out of this situation if I ever wanted to truly move in and be happy. I quit my job, left all of my friends, and cake back home. I talked with her just before leaving and explained what I’d been going through over the last months. She was very sad, but she has always been very supportive, even after our breakup, and I know she cares and is glad I’m doing what I need to do to be happy. She isn’t the issue. I know it’s all me. 

I will admit, just being out of my house and away from my roommate and his girlfriend, and we’ll just everything that is so tied to my ex, has helped. But I still can’t stop thinking about what she’s doing. 

I’ve tried to limit contact with my roommate and other friends who are very close with her, but he was probably my best friend, and he checks in with me from time to time because I know he cares. And it makes me feel so bad that I’m pushing away the people who care about me because I’m so stuck, but interacting with them just fuels this anxiety and overthinking. 

For example, I got added to a group chat with some of our closer friends from back there. And they all want to do a zoom call and have like a beer olympics over zoom together. And it sounds SO fun. But my roommate is also in it, and he said something like “I’m pretty hungover this morning, can we at least wait until tonight”. Just making a joke. 

But in my head, literally all I can think about now is how he must they must have had a party last night cuz it was his gfs birthday a few days ago and that means that my ex obviously was there partying with them. 

I know just before I left that she was casually seeing someone, which of course she has every right to. I mean what the hell I was doing the same thing after a few months went by. And my friends all assure me that she absolutely wants nothing to do with a relationship with anyone, since that’s kinda why we broke up and that’s the point she’s at in her life. But idk. I know that how I truly feel deep down is that I just hope she’s happy. 

I literally feel like a crazy person trapped inside my head coming up with these worst case scenarios when literally I have no idea what is happening. But my brain just assumes them to be true, and I feel so trapped and it’s keeping me from just enjoying my life and being happy with myself.

At that time I met her ( the one who took over) she was told me that she is on time person who doesn’t want to make a late payment and prefers to pay before due date and even told me that she and the dealership can change the car title and loan to her name after they got a car plate. 

Yes it  not happens that way. I can’t change anything. So she has to pay under my contact.
But it’s frustrating me every month because she always paying late and even told me she will pay today or that day but not what she says. Always excuses and late payment. This is giving me an anxiety.
And now i had a lot of grey hair on my head and so depressed about this and made me cry every month because of this situation.

I know I’m a (stupid)girl who is so blank in this situation that I don’t even know what to do.
Please advise me what should I do? 
thank you in advance.",04Apr2020,1

677,"He keeps saying things like “well more people have died from OTC medication. This is nothing but a distraction from the military and nothing more than a flu.” I tried saying how maybe that’s true but OTC medicine deaths have had years to rack up a mortality rate, while this strain of the coronavirus  is new, growing fast, and hasn’t had as many years for comparison. 

He says, “Notice how all the celebrities are getting it? Clearly it’s biological warfare and was used on some celebrities on purpose.” I said how everyone’s been getting it- more people than celebrities, who aren’t exempt from catching viruses. And tried rebutting how it’s probably *not* biological warfare as they found the origin already. 

He just has piles and piles of his “facts” that aren’t true, while he calls everything else about it ‘fake news’. It’s beyond irritating and he’s not taking it seriously. 

He’s saying people who are social distancing and wearing masks ‘are just sheep being led to slaughter, letting people tell them what they should be doing when it’s not true.’ Anytime my mom or I bring up something new we hear about, he aggressively goes “well where’d you hear that? What site? What reporter? Anything for them to back it up?” and when that info is given to him he gets all pissed off and goes on a rant about the virus again and ‘misinformation’. 

Stuck at home with him and my mom and I just want to scream at him about it, but I’m keeping my head. It’s beyond irritating discussing the news with my mom, just to have him give a patronizing laugh, and go “you’ll see. Everyone will see. It’s all gonna come out soon enough.” 

Can you guys give me some good examples of rebuttals and facts to throw back for when he tries convincing us it’s fake or a conspiracy? Can’t believe I even have to ask this",04Apr2020,2
678,"He (22M) cheated on me (21f). Apparently right after we lost our baby he started talking and flirting with another girl on Facebook posts she tagged him in. 

I found these a few months later and questioned him? Why are you flirting with her and why is she flirting back? 

“We’re just friends”

Okay... I believed him. I voiced my concern and he squashed it down. 

Three days later I make a post about him, saying “My sweet baby ❤️❤️” and it has pictures of him and I together. We’d been together for 2 years on and off (off no more than a day or 2 at a time and only 3 times the entire relationship) 

Next morning I get an angry text from him saying I fucked him over. I asked why what’s going on? 

He said I ruined everything. I was confused. 

I get a text from his mother (who I’ve never had a good relationship with) asking if we were dating. I said yes..???  She then texted me saying he said we weren’t and he was done with me.

I screenshot and sent it to him, his response? In all caps: THANK GOD, FINALLY IM DONE WITH YOU. We’RE DONE. I CANT TAKE YOUR STUPID SHIT ANYMORE.

I cried. What in the world? Just the night before he told me I’m the only one in his life and I’m beautiful then asked for a “personal video” to which he masturbated over. And I thought I made him happy..

I get a call from his mother minutes later and we talk ALL morning. She sends me texts from him, and pictures he’s sent her.

He went on other dates with other women. Right after we lost our baby. He went to bars drinking with friends. He got drunk with some girl and tried to sleep with her but his mother called and he told her “you ruined the night” 

She told me he would play games on his switch with other women. And that he would talk on the phone with them.

He would say he was taking his mother to Chemo but in reality? He was with other girls.


I confronted him. He said it was all a lie but she sent all the proof. 

I cried my heart out. What else was I supposed to do?

When I finally had time to talk to him, he said “I did wrong. I’m sorry. But I don’t want to be with you anymore. You make me miserable”

So now I’m at the point where, I feel dead inside. 

I don’t know what to do. 

We are quarantined, I don’t have friends I dropped them all for his sake over the past 2 years. 

I can’t go out to distract myself and I can’t hang out with friends. 

I’m lost. 

Please send some advice and guidance and encouragement.

So I took a test, and it was online on moodle. We access the quiz at a certain time, and do the problems on paper and submit them. We were also on zoom with our cameras pointed at us. I had a few tabs open, one of which was a file from Moodle I was using to study before the test. Throughout the test, I didn't switch to it, because I didn't see it and forgot about it.   

My professor sent out an email saying that while he was grading, he saw multiple cases of academic dishonesty and asked for the culprits to come forward before Monday. 

I know Moodle logs which files you access, but if I had it opened like hours before the test, will it show that I still had the tab open?

687,"Okay, before I get to the specifics, here is some exposition:

I am an eighteen year old Indian, and here in India, to get to our colleges, we have something called the JEE (like the SAT for American colleges). The JEE, to be very honest, is excruciatingly hard, in all of the wrong ways. We need to rote memorize the colors of compounds, a hundred different organic reagents and their uses, a hundred formulas that you could perhaps derive during the exam, but with two minutes tops per question, it's nigh impossible to do so. 

I did most of that, and scored a 98.92 percentile on my first try (we get two tries each year), which I was mildly proud of, before I learned that there isn't a *single* good college I could get into with that percentile (the good ones start upwards of 99.60 percentile). 

Now, I am burned out. I have tried *hard* for the last two years-- I have thrown away any semblance of social life (except reddit, where I don't really think I have ever posted anything), and have kept largely to myself. Right now, I am at my breaking point: some part of me tells me there's no point in slogging further. We get sixteen different sets of question papers, and we are graded on a translucent system that promises to deliver fair results but often fails to do so. 

But the thing is, I *want* to get into these colleges. I *want* to score good. I lack, sorely, the motivation. I am pretty sure I could do better than my last try, since I messed up my math paper in January, which was my strongest subject at the time. 

Of course, then there is the even tougher JEE Advanced, which I also want to clear, but the future seems murky, and I need your advice. Direly.

**I do not want advice that tells me to stop preparing.** I only want advice on how to get over my frustrations and continue to prepare for an exam that offers me the chance to get into the college I dream of.",04Apr2020,1

Apparently we had all met before and one of them (we can call him Joey because I don’t actually know his real name) was apparently me guy best friend. The whole time we were flirting and hugging and I decided to kiss him because he was cute and it would be my first kiss. So before I leaned in, he leaned in and kissed me first. We both kissed again and held hands and hugged the rest of the dream. It was a really nice dream but there is one thing that is bothering me. I have no clue who he is but I feel like I’ve met him before. He just looks familiar and I know that the human brain can’t create new people that you haven’t seen before.

Straight brown hair, brown eyes (I’m pretty sure), “stubble” beard, not scrawny but not too muscular, and his face was seductive but also sweet looking (that is the only way I can describe it.

698,"Really looking for advice from another mother here.. my mom and I used to have an amazing relationship. My dad was always emotionally distant and I always expected drug use and my mom always pushed me in that idea and the idea he was a POS. My dad did have a drug problem. He got sober when I was 16 but we were never all that close because he is just a selfish person in general but he made a little bit of an effort as best he knows how. My senior year of highschool my dad officially told me about his drug problem and apologized and said he is so ashamed ect. 

He also told me he was moving out and he and my mom were going to try and separate for a bit because my mom had spent the last 10+ years having an affair w/2 different men. The affair started before my dads drug issues. My dad showed me texts and pictures from years back that basically proved to me my mom was lying to me for years about some pretty serious things that I should’ve been told. My dad tried really hard but ultimately they divorced and it was a loonnng and dirty one. They both pulled me in and my escape was moving out of state to college and basically starting a new life there and staying out and working late as often as I can when home. Now bc if COVID my school is closed and my job is shut down so I have to stay home and she’s dating the man she cheated on my dad with and brings him over despite me asking her not to bc it makes me uncomfortable + puts me in a bad place w my dad bc he wants me to confront the dude and I just don’t want to be involved..as ive been saying for 2 years now.. she’s incredibly mean to me now in a really passive aggressive kind of way ever since our relationship was trashed by this. I just feel like if I ever had kids I could never do that to them. 

They needed to divorce I’ll admit but watching her string him along for so long and hearing my dad cry in the shower was so incredibly damaging and heartbreaking to me and I almost feel like she feels if she can be mad at me first I can’t be mad at her so she try’s to start fights with me and it’s all around a really toxic situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Roommate asked me to move out in 30 days so her friend can move in. I am in debt and on a leave of absence from work for the month. Looking to change careers, but obviously that is difficult at this time. I have an autoimmune disorder and am afraid to get sick, even as an invincible 25yo male.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this post short and to the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate says her friend broke up with her boyfriend and needs a place to stay. Her friend is currently at her parent's house. She says she will give me 30 days to move out.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate is not following the rules of self-isolation and is having people over, despite me asking her not to, so I am not totally comfortable living here anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in Washington state and believe there is a ban on evictions for 30 days since March 18, but I am not sure the rules of it yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on leave from my job, as I have an autoimmune disorder and so I am trying to self-isolate during this time. However, I am in debt and really should be working if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been applying to programming jobs, as I am a Computer Science student, but I don't have a lot of experience. I know I can do the work if I can get my foot in the door. I actually have a tentative offer, but they said I can only start in May at the earliest, and not until their workers are no longer work-from-home.

&amp;#x200B;

I am certified as an EMT, but have never worked as one.  I could try to get a job at a hospital as an ER tech, but I don't know if now is a good or a bad time to do that. Also, this obviously makes getting infected a lot easier.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a lot of friends in the state, and I barely have money to move my stuff if I had to.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents live in another state and moving my things there isn't really feasible. I can store my things and move it with them, but I don't want to risk getting them sick while they are in self-isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

I technically work in California, so I was looking into getting unemployment, but I am not sure if I can for a COVID related leave that is not from being sick.

&amp;#x200B;

**My main concerns are:**

&amp;#x200B;

Having to find a new place to live with everything being so crazy right now. I am not sure anyone would let me move in with the the virus going around.

&amp;#x200B;

Having money to move until I find a programming/other job, or go back to work.

My health. I am very healthy. I eat a very clean diet, and I exercise, but with an autoimmune disorder, I am not sure how things would play out if I got sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate everyone's thought and advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

716,"I have a close friend who has severe anxiety problems. I'll refer to her as M. So M has had anxiety the entire time I've known her. We didn't always get along, and in fact I disliked her for many years until we had some good conversations clearing up some misunderstandings from our youth. (16-21 year old's aren't great at communicating.) As adults we get along fine and are very close. But her anxiety often creates issues, like having our friend group cancel plans, have a bad time at an outing, due to her having mental breakdowns. This isn't just sometimes. It happens about 1/4 functions. I know its an illness. I know she can't control it. However, knowing that doesn't stop me from feeling frustrated and I'm getting pretty fed up about it.

I run a DND campaign for our friend group and we were supposed to play today. As an essential worker, I am still working weekdays and its been extremely stressful due to COVID-19. (I am thankful for still working, but it is incredibly stressful.) M's roommate called me last night and told me that M was feeling anxious about playing DND (This has happened multiple times) and asked if we could play next week. I have plans next week so now our long hiatus is even longer, because she doesn't want us to play without her. I was really looking forward to it since I finally had the energy to work on DND at all. A long time ago we had an issue with a player and she had a breakdown, and I had a several-hours long discussion about how she can always talk to me if she's having any issues at DND, or if she needs help with anything. I thought that she would come to me the next time she had an issue but she still asks other people to bring up issues she has to me for her. This is frustrating because I feel like she doesn't trust me, is afraid of me, or thinks I'm a bad DM who wont listen to her.

The issue is that whenever I try to bring up things that she does that bother me, like avoiding me, having to cancel everyone's plans because of her anxiety (Again, not her fault, but still), that she won't communicate with me, if she hurt my feelings somehow, or anything remotely critical of her behavior, she has a breakdown and ends up crying for 2-6 hours. I end up comforting her and apologizing most of the time, and the issue persists. How can I talk to her in a way that wont end up with her exploding? 

The asshole in me just wants to disband the current group, abandon the campaign, and start fresh with a different party. But that would be mean, and I should at least try to resolve this.

TLDR: Anxious friend cries every time I bring up a problem I have with her. How can I talk to her without causing her to have a breakdown?",04Apr2020,1

722,"Does he even care about me?

So, me(19F) and my bf (22 M) have been together for two years. Whenever we meet again, he doesnt show me that he is happy to see me. At all. He might be a little sad to see me leave but that might just be because he’ll be alone. The first year or so in the relationship he would be very affectionate when I came home from vacation, but other than that, not much after we’d been together a few months. That was a total 180 because we were all over eachother in the beginning and I felt so lucky to have found a guy who wanted to cuddle and kiss me. Now it really only happens if he wants to have sex. He has moments, enough to keep me wishing for more, where he seems like he really wants me and loves me. And if I seem off he asks me if I’m okay. 

I have both hinted at and talked about things I want to do or wanted or needed. And then when he decides to give me that, he’ll complain the entire time and remind me that he’s only doing it because I want to. And if I say that we aren’t doing anything when we are together, he’ll blame me. Because he always tells me: tell me if you want to do something. But when I have a suggestion he isn’t happy with it, and if we do it anyway he’ll complain as I explained. 

For some reason it is only my responsibility to make sure we do things together and to come up with good ideas.

I just dont feel like he cares about me anymore. He took me for a walk because I love walking. But he kept complaining. He made me breakfast in bed. But I dont like eating in the morning, what he made was really only for himself (he had it himself too) because he knows I dont like my eggs that way and that I dont like the taste of that wrap. But he loves that stuff. I always start my day with coffee. But he doesnt care enough to actually pay attention and try to think «hmmm what would surprise her and make her really happy?» meanwhile my SISTER for a litteral entire week the week after, woke me up with a cup of coffee. 

I just dont feel like he can BOTHER to do things for me. So I have stopped doing sweet caring things for him because it feels so unfair. I have so much love to give and he doesnt really seem to care wether or not I do those things for him.

I keep thinking maybe he doesnt love me anymore, just likes having someone there. Maybe if the right person came along, he would do anything for her.

It just makes me so sad and confused that I cant say, with honesty, that he’d do anything for me. I feel like if you truly love someone you will want to do anything to make them happy. And I truly feel/felt that way about him and I DID that for him, I’ve been there for him through so much shit.

But I feel like we are loosing our connection and it scares me and I dont know what to do.

If I forget to do the laundry one day he’ll say to me, “ I just don’t know how you can live in this filth and I promise you if you don’t get your act together I can make your life a lot harder” and threats like that. This part isn’t as bad but he doesn’t have any trust in me at all whenever I wanna go ride my bike or go for a run he always suspects that I’m going to see someone or try to kiss someone when really all I wanna do is get out of my house. And with phones were not allowed to bring them upstairs because we’re gonna try to text people apparently. One other thing he does is if we sleep in too late he’ll yell at us and ask what we were doing and still think we’re talking to people and sometimes with my sibling they’ll get in arguments and like yell a lot so it’s just sometimes bad sometimes good.

I know many use renting as income and how easy is it to accept 1K cash in exchange for tenants who make 5x the rent and have good history of renting? Is that selfish and greedy on my end?

I'm fine, but it's really annoying and scary, every amount of stress or guilt that I experience ends up with flashbacks of me self harming, my heartbeat gets really fast, my throat feels dry and clot and I have a slight headache.

733,"I have had feelings for this girl for about 3 years now and about a year ago she told me that she values me as her best friend. This made me very happy but of course I really wanted to be in a relationship with her. And before we became best friends I admitted my feelings to her but got rejected every time because she said she couldn't be in a relationship without having romantic feelings for me. So we've stayed at being just friends. And it's been great, we talk for hours and hours each day about literally everything. We can talk about our most personal experiences and feelings with each other and we both trust each other. But I've always wanted more than that. I've always wanted to be in a relationship with her.

So recently, when I asked her out again, she told me that she wasn't romantically attracted to me and couldn't start a relationship with me unless she was. But here's what confuses me, she told me that she is physically attracted to me and that she's also emotionally attached to me, because we are best friends, but she isn't in love with me. She's also told me before that she wants to fall for me but can't for some reason but that it might happen in the future sometime. I am willing to wait, because I love her and she is so worth it, but I'm not sure what I should do. Should I just be patient and be just her best friend until she develops feelings for me?

I (f19) pretty recently started  sort of seeing someone (m20) long distance.

Problem (1)

Tonight he told me about some of the abuse he went through and how it affected him. He had mentioned a little bit as well the last time I saw him in person. 

He got physically abused by his parents. The last instance of this happening was 3 years ago. He doesn’t blame his parents and doesn’t seem to mind one bit which kind of leaves me worried that he might me suppressing it especially since he pretty much doesn’t know better.

I find myself struggling with it (cause I’m basically ready to throw hands with his mother although it is obviously not my place) while he can basically make jokes out of it. 

I’m unsure in how to comfort him best, if at all and how to generally deal with this.

(2)

 I’ve gone through a few things myself aswell. Some parental abuse/neglect and one instance of semi rape (haven’t told anyone in my life about the rape)

Now I feel comfortable enough with him to talk about all of it, i actually want to talk to him about it because he’s a very gentle person and i feel like it’s something he should know about me especially since he has shared his experiences and triggers with me.

I didn’t tell him tonight cause I didn’t want to make him feel like I was playing trauma olympics or trying to downplay his abuse.

I also don’t know how to bring up any of my baggage in a conversation naturally.

(3) he is in the hospital right now. He is convinced he has kissing disease (would be infected by me) however the doctors are doing a LOT of tests on him in the cancer department which leaves me very worried (because hospitals are swamped right now bc of corona so for them to do all of those tests, even though there are a lot of signs that it’s the kissing disease , does not seem like a good sign to me) he has been in the hospital since Wednesday and has to stay till at least Monday.

Why does this happen? Sometimes I'll listen, but sometimes it's like, while I might know that I need to do something, I just have a very negative feeling once I'm doing it that forces me to stop, like a ""stop this, this action's not worth the energy"".

She totally shut herself off and would ignore things I said to her, she said like two sentences to me in the last four hours.

Now shes packing up everything that she had in the room we've been living in, including her multiple drawers filled with her stuff and is suddenly leaving and refusing to say anything. She went and sat in her car for 20 minutes and came back and said that it isn't me but that it's that we haven't been able to do anything, due to the quarantine, and its making her depressed and driving her crazy, which is of course understandable, we're all dealing with this messed up situation and none of know what to do or how to react, but then also saying that she doesn't know how to talk to anyone about her feelings, or whats actually really bothering her, because I mean, we're poor college students, we didn't really ever have money to do anything, and now we don't have money or the means.

Whenever someone tries to help me it legit goes in one ear and out the other I never fully take into account what someone is saying to me and that is the biggest problem I’ve been facing for some 20 odd years of my life. I’m facing turning 21 in may and right now it’s kinda hard to stay hopeful for the future I’m still living at home I did graduate from high school in 2017 I can barely keep a job I’ve worked 3 jobs which were majorly spaced out from one another in the period of time that I’ve been out of school and that’s pretty pathetic if you ask me. I don’t have a car nor do I drive because I get too much anxiety I’ve taken the test 3 or 4 times twice in Pennsylvania my old state where I lived for 8 years and twice in Florida which I’ve lived for 3 years moved here back in 2016.  

I know most of that is kind of useless information but I beg of you please bare with me I know I kind of rant and my sentences either don’t make sense or trail off into nothing but this is all just stuff that’s been in the back of my brain for the longest time and it’s just coming out all at once. I had something of a girlfriend recently but I screwed it up royally my brother matched with her on tinder and only wanted to have sex with her and not form a real relationship I mean the dudes 25 still lives at home as well as me and still manages to have dated more girls than I can count. Did I mention that we also live in an overweight household/family? the only one who isn’t overweight is my adopted sister.  


Anyways back to the story this girl was the sweetest girl ever she did nothing but care for me and wanted the best for me she lives 45 minutes away from me and knowing I don’t drive she made the trip for me regardless and we would just spend time alone in my room we would cuddle but would also try to get sexual with one another and she was big as well and I guess you can put two and two together and figure out that overweight people having sex has it’s complications I don’t have the biggest penis to begin with not that it mattered to her anyways and me being a virgin for the longest time and her being very sexually active was a lot more experienced than me and I felt so insecure that I didn’t measure up so deep down I think I looked for the tiniest flaw and exploited it so I could push her away because in my own fucked up mind I felt too pathetic and worthless and felt that she’d be better off without me. 


She does have pcos which I learned can cause infertility and irregular periods and can cause rapid hair growth on many areas of the body so she did have dark hair on her upper lip and hair on her chin not much but it was noticeable and hair on her chest and long strands of hair coming out of her areoles. Don’t get mad at me I am well aware everyone grows hair it’s natural but I’ve only seen clean shaven waxed women in porn and that’s what I’ve grown to love and my first time seeing a girl naked live in person and she has hair in unexpected places you can guess how it affected me. I figured rather than beat around the bush and ignore it i opened up to her about it and calmly told her about how I felt about it and she was hurt obviously there’s no real nice way to tell someone you were turned off by their body hair. And then we had a talk one night about how we might of rushed into things and we hadn’t spent a whole lot of time being friends which was true I had met her in early February and things escalated between us after our first date and I felt like I was forcing feelings that weren’t there because having being alone for so long and to have a real girl that’s super into me I didn’t know how to handle it I fooled myself into thinking she was the one and I was head over heels for her I mean she had already met my family and things were going well but I couldn’t keep up with her and she was pretty intimidating. 

What a wussy thing to say right? Well that’s part of the reason why I’m coming on here for advice I just don’t get it it seems getting women comes so easily for other guys but when it comes to me I’m absolutely fucking retarded and my brother backtracking to him he’s about 500 pounds give or take has tattoos and an Amish beard which has a bit of red in it and has the worst hygiene I know he doesn’t always use Deodorant or brush his teeth and he eats up everything in the house and leaves food everywhere in his room not to mention he has kinda fucked up teeth they’re pretty crooked and weird looking not going to lie but he’s managed to date some pretty attractive girls despite them almost being the same size as him. I’m not trying to talk shut about my brother I’m just as much of a mess but at least I value a woman and respect her as an individual and not just as a sexual object there for my personal pleasure. I’m almost 400 pounds I don’t know if I’ve hit it yet haven’t weighed myself, jobless, can’t drive, depressed and I’ve never felt more alone and useless in my entire lives. I often get short with my parents as well and I don’t mean to I just have such a shitty world view and perspective and here I am on reddit seeing posts about some guy who met a girl on bumble and they had a date over a Netflix party and watched breaking bad together and another guy is dating a girl through Skype and it just makes me feel worse. I actually planned to get my shit together this year but with the coronavirus pandemic at an all time high it kinda seems pointless to stay optimistic.",04Apr2020,0

750,"I plan for tomorrow to be my last day at work for a while. I need to request self isolation simply because it’s too dangerous. Multiple members of my family, including both of those I live with, are highly vulnerable to COVID19. My brother has Diabetes, and my mother is 57 with health issues and is not at good health generally. If I bring home the virus, I would be the only one of us who could make it through, and I’m not going to put my family at risk. Although I work in a supermarket which is currently still considered essential, the company I work for has made no efforts to protect its workers. We have not been provided masks or gloves, there are no distancing markers, and we are constantly being left in close proximity to people who appear sick. These are dangerous conditions to work in. 

My problem is, I have a lot of trouble requesting things because firstly, I was never introduced to the management team, so I don’t know who to speak to, and most of the management are self isolating already. One of the only management team left is a woman who was suspended for making minors work 80 hours per week. You can probably see why I am unsettled about making my case.

My question now is, is my case enough? Vulnerable family members (of which I cannot afford to move away from, and do not have anywhere else to go), and not being given any protection in the workplace? 

I am fully prepared not to get paid, I have been saving up money for a while now because i have always been paranoid of an emergency such as this. I have enough money to help pay bills and buy groceries for at least 4 or 5 months, and I’m also prepared to be fired for this, but I could do with some help making enough of an argument that I won’t be forced to stay working. I’d rather be fired and safe, than working and at risk.",04Apr2020,1

752,"We have been together over 1.5 years, and it’s been good but also rocky due to his tendency to drink too much and act foolishly as a result (drunk driving being the worst). He stopped that behavior, but not the drinking. I broke up with him in February after he called me several names (dumb bitch, piece of shit, slut, etc.) because I had called him out on his over-drinking and he had lied about it. A month later we got back together because he was very apologetic and had not had a drink since. Or so he says.

But this is his birthday week...I smelled alcohol on his breath this morning. When I asked him if he had drank last night, he said no. Then, he changed it and said, “I had one last drink.” Then, somehow, I found out he had drank a whole 6 pack to himself. That’s all he’s admitted to so far. This explains why he ignored my text. 

My boyfriend says I’m unbelievable because of how I reacted to finding out he drank last night. I explained to him that first of all, he had pledged sobriety, which fell through. Then he lied about how much he had drank, which he has always done. He says that when he had pledged his sobriety, we weren’t technically together. I’m at my wit’s end. He makes me feel like a nutcase over how I react.

Ok so, whenever my parents (my dad in particular) orders me to do stupid stuff, particularly concerning my phone and breach of privacy. For example, like my dad checking my history on my phone and me having to forcibly explaining what’s on my history. I just do as he says, I didn’t think there would be a way of just telling him no without him screaming at me, and telling to do it “Because I am your father.”

Until about late February when I had pretty bad suicidal thoughts. Although I’m fine now, I’m THIS close to screaming at my dad that if he doesn’t lay off with the overprotectiveness, I might as well just tell him this “I’d choose to die because I can’t deal with you for many more years to come.” I want my dad to see me as a adult, at least concerning my privacy on the internet.

756,"My boyfriend (M22) currently lives with his mom, dad, and younger sister. 

His mom is so absolutely controlling, him and his dad has no say in the house, and his sister is growing up to be just like the mom. 
It comes to the point where there are cameras in some areas of the house. The mom checks the cameras to make sure my boyfriend is home. There have been times where he left and got a call from her screaming where is he and why is he not home. 
Sometimes when him and I are together, she calls him screaming to come back and walk the dog (so all of a sudden. We could be miles and miles away and he could get this call) 
My boyfriend is a swimmer. There have been times where she called his coach to see what and how he is doing. She had a tracker on him as well but he found a way to take it off a few months ago. 
She has threatened him that she will kick him out of the house over things such as: not walking the dog when she wants him to walk the dog, doing something he likes when he’s free, etc.
If he wants to relax a little or FaceTime someone, he gets judged and has work put on him. He is not allowed to lay down during the day if he’s tired, but she is. 
He isn’t even allowed to wear what he wants to wear without being judged. He has this sweatshirt he likes to wear on lazy days. He threw it into the laundry basket and realized he couldn’t find it for weeks. His mom left it in the laundry room and refused to wash it (she does not let anyone touch the laundry machine so even if my boyfriend wanted to wash it himself, he would get yelled at) 
It got to the point where he was worried about ordering a certain shampoo for himself because his mom will comment on it and judge him for it. 
The list goes on and on...

When he mentions moving out eventually to his mom, she laughs at him as if he isn’t capable of it and will come running back. 

I feel really bad but at the same time, I feel like my boyfriend just needs to get his stuff together and realize he is his own person. How do I help him out here? I cannot go talk to her about it because I have never met her, although it’s been a over a year I’ve been dating her son. She doesn’t accept me for some reason (very judge-mental personality from what my boyfriend told me).

We were slapped around a lot, hit with different objects such as a bamboo stick or a belt, sometimes to the point of where I would be bleeding afterwards, through jeans.

We sometimes got hit twice a day. I feel so manipulated but I genuinely just thought that all Korean kids get hit like that. We'd be punished later if we wore shorts or anything you could see bruises through as well. I didn't even realize until I was telling my boyfriend about it, who was also Korean, and he looked at me with a horrified look on his face, and said ""that's just abuse.""

762,"Okay, basically I have this 'friend' who wronged me many times but we share the same mutual friend group. I'm afraid they'll side with her if I confront her about the times she hurt me. She seemed like an amazing, down to earth girl but damn, I don't know what to think of her anymore. Here is a list of all the major stuff she did to me in the span of 6 months.)

1. I found a group art science project competition and I wanted to involve my school. Every day, I had to deal with bullshit because I was the group leader. I did my research every night for several hours straight and I already don't sleep, so I was 5 times more sleep deprived. I had to do all this paperwork and I also had to deal with people trying to manipulate their way into the project. I was also the best fucking artist there so it was me doing all the work. The people working on the video are dumbasses, but the best we had. I had to also go through the video and fix everything that they did. I was so stressed that when we worked, I usually took my best friend and cried in the bathroom. Also, the two times she showed up, I left feeling pissed. The first time, she made the group acknowledge her as their leader. Like honey, your ego can't get bigger? The second time, she painted the poster without our permission and set three days of work back. By the way, she only stayed for 20 minutes each time. So then, fucking SARA who was non-existent when we were doing 2 months of work, came in and took MY credit. When we doing the video showing the project, she took my role of the video which was pretty huge, and was rightfully MINE. The teacher in charge let it happen. Also, my best friend was supposed to the introduction but because Sara took my role, I had to take her's. Now that I think of this more, I'm super pissed. Cheat me, fine, but my best friend didn't deserve that because she and another best friend helped me go through all of this. 
2. She always puts me down. It's subtle things but this is the best example I have. I don't like spending my money because my family is financially stable, though my dad works really hard to provide for us. So, I gave myself the limit of $10 for school every week, which would mean $2 every school day. I never like going over the limit and I gotten used to eating delicious junk food. In stores, I usually buy chocolate because I'm addicted or other food under $2. Sara noticed and assumed I was broke, so she decides to give me judgmental and condescending looks. One time, she opened her purse and I saw she had about $40 in fives and ones. Then she proceeded to ask me for two dollars to pay for her $3 worth of chips. When she noticed my expression, she immediately said it was fine and paid for it herself. When we walked, she was really distant like she was mad...? We're like young teens so she doesn't have to pay for bills and grocery (I met her family and they're well off.) Sara can pay the price of $3 so why would she ask me for money, when she knows that I don't like spending money for myself? I thought less of it because sometimes her mom makes her buy some stuff and her mom pays her back at home. Though, since Sara and I walk home together, I would usually come with her when she bought the stuff. It's hard to explain, but I would most definitely know if Sara's mom asked her to get something. So, basically, she had the money to pay for her food but she asked me to pay for it, though got really mad when I didn't. She always gets mad when I don't listen or follow her. 
3. This happened recently so I am extra emotional. Half of my friend group goes on the bus with me and we own the front side of the bus while the boys own the back. We were waiting for the bus and Sara decides she wanted chips and that I should come with her to get them. I said exactly this, ""We shouldn't go because we can miss the bus and I have no ride to school."" She said it was fine and she pressured me to come with her. I agreed and went to go get her chips. We came back and the bus wasn't there, much to our dismay. We walked half way to the other stop but we both knew the bus was beyond that. Sara made some calls and got a ride with her best friend. Then, the best friend and her dad came. Sara said bye and went into the car, while I had to go home. I was super pissed because I thought she would let me come along, but she just left me. My dad was at work, my mom came back from work at 4 AM and doesn't know how to get to my school, my sister has college in four hours and needs her sleep, and my brother already left for school. Sara knew that and just left me? How could you drag your friend into your mess and leave them in it? If I was her, I would've convinced my friend to let her come along. I know I sound immature but I regarded her as a close friend at the moment, and she just left me like that. How could she just *leave* me? Sara got her food and a ride to school, while I had to go home. 

I'm sorry for the long rant and there are probably grammar errors. With COVID-19 going around and that all this drama is making my insomniac ass run with four hours of sleep. I need an outsider's opinion on this. Call me out if I'm in the wrong, please. I don't want to confront her and hurt her if I'm being delusional.  I honestly don't know what's going on with her. I'm pissed at her but I also don't know if I'm in the right or wrong.

(Also, I'm buying gifts for my friends for when we get back to school which might be in 5-6 months. Just a nice gift because we didn't see each other for months. Everyone's gonna know what's up if I don't get her something.  If she really is a toxic fake friend, what should I get her?)",04Apr2020,1
763,"To better explain. I (20F) am sitting home right now doing alot of thinking for my life after school (currently in college for nursing (second year). The scariest thing to me is that I know I want to move out immediately after college, or possibly in my senior year. More than likely, I'm going to move to a different city, or even another state, and be away from my family ( my comfort).....and I want to know your experience, if any, with doing the same thing...

What do you wish you had known? What did you do that helped you prepare for this? How much money did you have saved up, or did you just not wait and went out on a limb and it worked out? How did you go about finding a place or city that was best for you? How did you cope with being away from family? What did you buy in preperation for this step in life? If that makes sense.....

Side note/background: If anyone is concerned with me being away from family, I might add that though they're my family, they're not my biological family. Not to sound insensitive, I care about them, but I'm not attached to them like a normal person would be I guess. They look out for me as if I were their child, and I love them to death, I just don't see myself settling where I am. Also, I started building credit when I was 18, and I've kept it in good standing and plan to.

766,"So I've been friends with her since we've started middle school. We've been through a lot and I've helped her many times. She's a great person at heart, but she can be quite abuse, controlling, and rude. Though she did have problems of her own, she did not know any limits. It was because of this that I've questioned about cutting her off.

During the summer before my junior year, I decided to cut her off after being unable to handle the negativity she brings. It had increasingly grown and I didn't know if I could help her anymore as it was affecting me. She didn't get the help she needed when we tried to and she wanted to. I felt really bad leaving her like that, but our friendship has grown toxic over the years. She knew what she was doing but didn't care. I helped her the best I could by providing comfort and advice.

Like I said, she was controlling as well. My entire friendship with her before cutting her off consisted of her trying to do what she didn't like. If I didn't listen to her she'd blame me and get angry. I would always apologize or make it up with her. So when I did cut her off, it did not go well. She talked behind my back online on an account I didn't know of. She tried to place the blame of our friendship on me. She tried to make me come back.

I stood firm and said no.

So throughout the entire year we were distant, however not as distant. This was because we had a project we've been working for an entire year together as a group, we had the same friend group, and same classes. I'm the type of person who's nice to anyone, friend or enemy. I didn't want her to misunderstand my kindness for another friendship. I still talked to her or hung around her though because of our friend group, classes, and project.

However recently, she hit me up to ask what our current relation is. If we're friends or not. If I wanted to be friends with her again. I didn't know. She thinks we are and I told her I'd tell her when I thought it through.

I don't know if I should give her another chance, but I have done that too many times and it can be quite tiring. I don't know if I want to be involved with her again. I know how much our past friendship has hurt me and possibly her, but I don't know if it'll be worth it. The reason is she has changed a bit for the begger, but I still saw the same qualities that she had before returning.

What should I do about my current situation?

tl;dr - I cut off a close toxic friend of mine months back and she asked me what our relationship is. She thinks we're friends again, but I'm unsure knowing that the amount of chances I've given her before had gone to nothing. She has changed for the better in a way, but I still see the same person before inside of her. What should I do?",04Apr2020,2

I consider myself a 4/5 star gift giver. Believe me when I say I don’t have many skills, but that is one of them. My friend on the other hand? As generous as she is, it’s causing a bit of a trouble. 

Up until I was around 11, I was CRAZY about fairies. When kids were like ‘what do you prefer, dragons or unicorns?’ it would always be ‘Neither, fairies!!’. I sort of became synonymous with fairies throughout my childhood, but I’m not obsessed with them anymore as I’ve grown out of it. 

I’ve been gifted 20 different types of fairy memorabilia and I need to put a stop to it. It’s not my cup of tea at all.

Currently, they’re all in a box under my bed. I want to keep them (that’s the least I can do), but I am 3000% against displaying them. To be frank, they’re a little out of touch with my tastes. My living space is really important to me, so I avoid knickknacks like these fairy statues. Whenever she comes over, I always feel so guilty they’re not on display. She’s even asked about them before, and I had to BS my way through an answer because I was scared of hurting her feelings. 

I know this will come across as ungrateful and awful, which is exactly why I’m asking for help. I need to ask her to maybe reconsider the fairy stuff in the most tactful way possible. I really should’ve stopped this a long time ago, but every single time I receive a gift I think ‘Maybe she recognises I’ve grown out of this now!’",04Apr2020,2

Around a month ago I went to visit my brother studying abroad in Spain from Italy. This was before the Coronavirus lockdown occurred in Italy. Right now I am blocked here at my brother's house, and the next Monday there will be the last airplane to get back to Italy organized by the embassy. I really want to get back home (obv I'll stay in self isolation for 15 days before actually geting back home) but my brother and his girlfriend of course think it's a bad idea. I think that it's a bad idea too, since the only train to Madrid (where I have to get the plane to Rome) departures at 8:00 AM and my flight is scheduled for 11:00, plus I will land at 1:00 AM and I'll have to get another plane at 9:00 AM. I'm really afraid to get the virus, even if I have a mask and I'll use all the precautions to prevent it, and deep down I know it's a bad idea, but I should not be here in Spain, and living with my brother and his girlfriend can be really stressful since they fight a lot and I can't stand anymore hearing them fight. What would you do if you were at my place?

772,"I'm a British born bangali female and I've been atheist for about 1.5 years now. I'm also asexual which is also a big no no in my family. Everytime my parents talk about religion I either shrug it off or tune out. My family has some strange belief during these times ( e.g eat 5-7 dates and you won't get covid19 ) and it's getting harder for me to keep my mouth shut. Ramadan is coming in a few days and I have no idea what to do. I know I should pretend I'm still Muslim until I can move out but it's taking a toll on me. I think I can get through the next few years until I turn 18 but I have no idea how to tell them when the time comes. I don't know if I should tell them. My parents are getting old and have many health problems and I'm the oldest and expected to provide for my family ( my mother 46, my father 52, my 2 little sisters 10 and 6, and my autistic little brother 4 ). Girls should also not live outside the house until marriage or university. ( if I go for university, I'm expected to come home every weekend and call everyday. ) I've also got a strange mental condition that hasn't been diagnosed yet due to the outbreak. Everytime I feel stressed, I have large uncontrollable movements that shake my body ( we think it might be anxiety but the movements don't line up with anxiety and I usually don't feel anxious ). It limits what I do quite a bit. I could go to school before the quarantine/lockdown. I know if I tell my parents I will be disowned by my entire family an news will be spread all around my town. I don't know what to do, if I tell my family I'll be disowned and never see anyone again ( apart from one of my cousins who already knows ) but if I don't I'll live with the guilt. If I do tell them when should I tell them? If I run away and leave a note what would I need to take? ( I know that one might sound dumb and childish.) I don't know if I'd be able to go to university due to my condition. What do I do with my life? I'm so confused. Any advice would be appreciated.

776,"I recently got broke up with (the second week of March), and his reason: I was too nice. I was very confused when he told me this and thought 'Too nice? How can somebody be too nice?'‪. I later found out that when he said too nice, he meant that I was too much of a people pleaser, and he got bored. After some thinking, I did come to realise that I am in fact a people pleaser - a BIG one. He wasn't great in our relationship; he cancelled plans often, sometimes didn't show up to plans, gave no explanation and just didn't text me for a few days, and he kept switching between wanting a relationship and only wanting sex. These things upset me, and I got mad about it, however when I told him I was mad about it, I quickly took it back and told him that it was fine and I had forgiven him, only because I didn't want to cause conflict, make him mad or lose him from my life. I did this a lot, and I guess he got fed up of it.

Now, this is all that I can think about. It's really bringing me down and I'm starting to think of other times and other relationships where I have been a doormat and let people get away with things that have upset me, simply because I didn't want to cause conflict or lose them.

How can I change this? Why am I such a big people pleaser for? Is it possible to stop being a people pleaser?",04Apr2020,2
777,"Hey guys. I don't know how weird this is going to sound but this is a very serious issue for me and I need help.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been very smart. I was always top of my class and got several scholarships and privileges due to that. The thing is, I've never worked for any of that. I always managed to do these things with minimum effort. It might sound like a good thing, but as I've grown up it has become apparent that it isn't.

My entire life, I haven't really worked much for something so now I can't do anything. I can't study, I can't work, I can't even do the things I want to do. Or rather I will procrastinate doing them for as long as I possibly can. Why? I don't know. The only thing that I know is that as soon as I perceive something as a task, I get blocked and my energy is drained. I have a writing piece due in a week? I physically won't be able to do it until the deadline is extremely close. I promised a friend to do an illustration for them? I will leave it until they ask what happened to it. These are things that I like to do, things that I enjoy, but I can't do them and I don't understand why. It even happens when someone tells me I have to watch a movie or a show or read a book. No matter how much I would enjoy it, I will put off watching it as much as I can.

At first, I thought I was just lazy, then I believed I was holding myself to a very unfair standard. Now I'm afraid there's something seriously wrong with me.

My parents say they are the same way, but they don't think it's something to worry about as much as I do. To me, it's extremely debilitating.

I can't afford to go to a therapist and I don't know how long I can go on like this. I'm stressed all the time and I can't handle it.

TL;DR: I feel unable to do things until the last minute and it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety.

778,"(I posted this somewhere else but I need advice)

A few weeks ago, my best friend and I began dating. We’ve always been very affectionate and would cuddle, so one day we talked about dating each other, and he agreed. Things were great. He told his immediate family and had me over, we were affectionate, and eventually we kissed.

That’s when things went wrong. He kissed me twice while saying goodbye to me in my car. The next day, he asked me to come over the next day and I said maybe. I jokingly asked for a kiss and he told me he didn’t like kissing me. I was confused, because he did it twice. He went on to tell me that he had no real feelings for me and admitted to leading me on because he didn’t want to hurt me.

Before we dated, he told me that he wanted me to be his first kiss because I meant so much to him. We’ve now been fighting for days over text messages because I can’t stand the thought of just being his friend again. I genuinely fell in love with him and I don’t know what to do. He’s only giving me the options of just being friends or not speaking anymore.

Because of all this and quarantine, my depression is lurking and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the motivation to do anything. For the most part, my friends have stopped reaching out to me (despite knowing what I’m going through) because I won’t reach out first. So, basically, I was only talking to one friend until she sent a pretty insensitive (at least to me) message giving me extremely blunt advice when I wasn’t asking for it because I was hurting. So... now I don’t really have anyone because I’m still arguing with my ex and best friend.

My parents still think I’m dating him, too, and I don’t have an emotional bond with them so I always struggle with telling them about my personal life... so I don’t. They think I’m just sad because I can’t see my boyfriend due to Covid-19.

My best friend still wants to speak to me, as well, but I don’t know what to do. We’ve been “acting” like we’re dating/being extremely affectionate for so long that I feel like it somehow pushed out anything else with him, if that makes sense? Like all our relationship really became was just this almost-dating and leading on thing and we dated and he seemed so, so happy and would just hold my hand and play with my hair and put his arms around my waist or kiss my forehead and now... it’s gone.

I don’t know how to feel. I have no one. Someone please give me some advice.",04Apr2020,2
779,"So I had two tickets to a concert that happened about six months ago and the tickets weren't super cheap. I paid $400 for two GA tickets, but was selling them for $150 just so I could get someone to take them off my hands. I put them up online for sale and a girl messaged me saying that she wanted to buy them but didn't have the money for them just yet. She gave me a whole sob story about her dad dying and a close friend committing suicide and then apparently she got scammed out of money trying to buy tickets to the same concert and I told her that she could just pay me later (we agreed on a week later in the messages) when she got paid and had the money because I felt bad for her. 

I know that was stupid. Believe me. 

A week went by and I messaged her and she gave me the whole ""I'm so sorry! I've been so busy lately!"" thing and I sent her my information again and waited. And waited. And waited. I'm still waiting now, 6 months later. 

Normally, I would just let this go and accept defeat, but this girl seems to have no shortage of cash flow in her life. According to her social media, she goes to a new concert just about every weekend and it seems like she has a VIP lanyard in every single one. I sent her a reminder a few days ago about the money for the tickets she still hadn't paid me for, but once again, I have been met with silence. 

I found her parents on social media as well. (I wasn't stalking, the information is there and anybody that scrolls through her page can see it.)

782,"I am really angry and I am 100% sure I  made a lot of mistakes. English is not my first language and I am incredibly sad about this whole situation. 

My best friend is in her first relationship. Well I think it’s her first relationship. She has been seeing this guy for months now and doesn’t call him her boyfriend, but they cuddle and do almost everything a couple would do. But she is still a virgin ( which is fine but there is something odd to it .. that I will explain further as this story goes on).

I love her as a friend, she is funny and a very easy going person. She doesn’t have a lot of friends since she would even describe herself as quite shy. But when she gets comfortable with someone, she is literally the coolest person on earth.

Everything started in September when this guy hit her up in her dms. They had known  each other from work but now he has a different job and  he wanted to meet up with her. 
She isn’t quite the Texter ..but she texts him back in 1-2 seconds to the point that I could literally take all my clothes off and she wouldn’t even notice .. 
She always denied having feelings for him but couldn’t obsess over the fact that he likes her. 
It is the end of November and I literally had to press her about this guy. She didn’t want to admit her feelings. I was quite annoyed and I said „girl this is normal just own it“ which she did eventually. 
This guy is 30 and has a really weird past and she is 23. I just wanna say this in advance because his age and the way he behaves seems odd. 

So let me continue .. it is December and she flakes on me multiple times. 
Or even worse we would hang out and the second he asks for going for dinner or lunch, she totally forgets about me and meets up with him. 
I have started to see her even less but I didn’t say anything, because at that point I was really happy for her.
However she started to tell me some really weird stuff about this guy . The guy she started „dating“ came to my country to study but didn’t have enough credit points to keep studying here.. ( we have strict laws if you don’t reach a certain amount ects you are out of the country) he somewhat managed to stay here. My brother is a lawyer and told me that there is something really odd going on, because there is literally no way on earth you can stay here with 2 ects in one semester. Also she doesn’t why he chose this country .. to be honest she doesn’t know a lot of things about him. 
Or .. the fact that this guy ( his family actually) was an extremely rich person and got poor. She couldn’t really explain me how that happend .. and I guess this guy just didn’t say anything .. 
I kept  asking questions about him that she just coudn‘t answer 
Or the fact that he has been in certain criminal groups and now he is this really cute amazing guy who doesn’t do anything bad. He doesn’t drink he doesn’t smoke .. he is so perfect blahblah 

But in December I also noticed that this guy has literally no friends. ( no offense .. ) 
She never tells me stuff about his work or his friends, because he has no friends. 
It is still December and she did another weird thing, she decided to go on trip with his parents around Europe.  They have been seeing each other for what ? 3 months ..wtf 
I asked her „is he your boyfriend“. She still says no but contuinues seeing him. And remember she has feelings for him. 
It is January and she complains about being overwhelmed with work and university but still hangs out with him everyday.  I mean I get it you love someone, but seeing someone 24/7 can be draining, even if it’s your partner.. or whatever he is. I haven’t seen her once in January. 
It is February we don’t have university .. we both have a lot of time. What do you think she does? She keeps seeing him and only talks about him. 
And February was my breaking point. I remember all the weird things she has told me about him .. she doesn’t even say he is her boyfriend .. 
and then it clicked .. something is really off about this guy, well I think something is off. I can’t prove it :( 
I have started to become more distant and she didn’t even make an effort to see me. 
In March she noticed how I m.i.A I have been lately. 
I wanted to hell her everything I noticed but from my Expierence I know for a fact this is going to result in a really huge fight. Plus she is really cranky once you express your dissatisfaction. I just can’t deal with drama. I am in quarantine as most people are and being at home made me quite depressed. 
I don’t know maybe I am the weird one, maybe I am overreacting .. but I just can’t help but to feel really weird about this 30 year old man. 


Oh and one thing I forgot. She never once intended to introduce me to this guy .. and this guy doesn’t seem to be interested in her friends, which is so weird to me ..

785,"So this has been a process to say the least. Here it goes:

My wife and I recently purchased a house in IL. Before we made an offer we checked to see if high speed internet was available in our area as both of us work from home, stream movies/t.v. etc, and Comcast showed it available at our address. The only one available with high-speed internet at the address. 

We have since closed on that house and are getting ready to move into it and are setting up services. When we called Comcast to establish internet service they said it was available in our area but there would be an additional fee for installation. They had to send a survey team out to let us know the exact cost. It struck us as odd seeing as the house we purchased is 30 years old but we know they never had Comcast at the residence so we figured all part of the process. 

Fast forward 3 weeks (I have called multiple times to get the survey results. Stellar customer service we all know) and after my 7th attempt as to find what the results of the survey were they inform me it is going to be $7078 to run 454 ft of cable to my house from the box. I asked if we could split costs with our neighbors seeing as they don’t have Comcast either and they said no, they would have to pay separately to have services at their addresses as well

This is insane to us! If there is anyone out there that has dealt with this please let me know how to proceed. We are contemplating biting the bullet and paying it as we NEED high speed internet for both our job functions. Thanks in advance!

Currently I’m living in a really nice area in which I had lived before and wanted to come live here again, which my bf agreed and he really liked it here and stuff. Because of reasons, he is back where we met which is really not the nicest of places and basically I see no future there for me or even him as individuals honestly. 

I do love him to death but I have realized that he’s not the one for me for multiple reasons. He wants me to move back to the bad area and live with him, but I can’t. Part of me really doesn’t want to lose him though, even though I know it really is for the best that we break up. The relationship wasn’t perfect by any means and lately it’s been more bad than good but I can’t bring myself to do it. He has no idea, which makes it worse. We talk every day and I tell him that I love him which is the truth but he has no idea that I’m planning on breaking up with him and I don’t want him to be hurt, which I know he will. 

I know that once we break up he won’t want to stay friends either, he’s not like that. I don’t know what to do. 

I know I need to do it. I know it’s what’s best for me, and for him too. He needs someone that’s willing to make the same sacrifices for him which I can’t do. I know that he’ll be better off without me anyways.

So, as probably everybody here, the isolation and more time we experience because of covid-19 is in many ways a challenge and of course a totally new experience for me. I (as a student who will graduate this year and therefore with a huge workload) often find myself in a mood where I feel like I accomplished not enough for the day, should have done more/ more important things. I often read texts online about how that's OK, how one shouldn't feel bad about it, and that helped most of the times.
Alas, it loses it meaning more and more (to me) and after repeating it too often feels like some kind of lie and excuse. During these days I've communicated very much with a good friend and after some conversations I see that I am not only not alone with that negativity, but that they also are effected by it more (emotionally) and I'm really upset about all of this.
I don't know how you're feeling during times of the quarantine, I can't know exactly how you are getting through it and I really hope you all are doing at least OK at the moment.

She is also very certain that my siblings and I will die if we contract it.

I try to show them statistics, about how as long as we stay home while hospitals are overloaded we will be fine.

Let me clarify: none of us leave the house, contact anyone, and we all wash hands and take all necessary precautions. 

One of my brothers is living with his college roommates, and she lied and told him she was very sick and he had to come home (she had a cold). He flew home to see her, but now that she’s not actually sick he plans on going back. She thinks this is the last time she will ever see him if he goes. 

She’s also been telling lies about how we’ll get arrested if we leave the house and hospitals won’t take us if we contract it due to our insurance, which she makes up just to scare and control us.

I've had the issue my whole life, when I find something I'm interested in I pursue it passionately for weeks maybe months but as soon as I start getting good at it I get bored and have no interest in doing it anymore.

It's the same process every time: start a job, excel quickly, build up high expectations, lose interest, stagnate and then quit for something else.  

Now I'm in my mid 20's at yet another job in a new field, no friends except my wife, no hobbies, and I just feel like I've wasted all my time and talent on nothing. I'm making less money than I was at 19, I'm in debt, I just got promoted and I'm starting to lose interest in this job too. 

I can't stand the feeling that I've squandered my life. When I was younger I thought I would do great things and now I'm a nobody. I'm sure I'm not the only one with a story like this so my question is: How do the rest of you find the will to keep going? I'm struggling right now and don't know what to do.",04Apr2020,3
800,"My grandparents are President and Secretary to the local senior citizens association in our community. Every week they would have meetings at the park center but the city has closed it down until further notice due to the pandemic. The meetings are still happening however...at our house. Keep in mind that 8 people at most are invited to the house to discuss whatever and I feel like this needs to stop. My cousins and I have spoken to them about our concerns and we feel like they’re justified however my grandparents disagree and say that the meetings are essential. There’s already 7 people living in the house and no one has been leaving because of the pandemic so having 15 people all in the same place is in my opinion irresponsible and just dangerous. I don’t know what to do, having 8 elderly, possibly immunocompromised, and potential carriers is alarming.

801,"Ever since I got my first pimple, my acne has been hard to control. 

I went and saw a family friend who taught me how to wash my face and sold my Mom a three step product. After always washing my face, and using the product for months, it felt like the product was making my acne worse or simply not treating it. 

Also, for the longest time I had dry skin, and it got to the point where I would have someone just touch my nose and peel off the dead skin and proceed to say ""you got some dead skin here"".

It was humiliating. I finally found a product that worked well and it was fine.

But once I entered college, I ended up rooming with this girl with nearly perfect skin. I asked her what she used. I caught her off guard and she asked me if I used two cleansers. I told her no, and bought two cleaners and went off and on. It totally ruined my skin and I felt like I was set up. It was soul-crushing.

Since then, I've tried switching back to just one cleanser, but that wasn't helping. And where I was living at the time, we had windy weather 24/7, so I think that just made my skin even more damaged.

Basically, I've been through a lot with my skin. I finally saw a dermatologist, but I felt like she wasn't a good one because she took one look at my skin and blurted out everything I would need to do in a matter of seconds. I was so shy I didn't have the courage to ask her to repeat what she said, but she gave me a prescription and I used it for about 2 months, but it made my skin so red. I finally just stopped taking it.  I'm wondering if I had a reaction to it. I would have told her, but she was located in my home town, and at the time I was at college several hours away. I didn't want to call her because I felt uncomfortable around her.

A few months ago, my Mom got this product through Mary Kay called CleanProof. I tried it. I wanted to be able to trust my Mom, but after a couple weeks, I was soul crushed again. The main wash I was given had a hole in it. I don't remember it having a hole when it was given to me, but I know she had this sitting around for awhile and who knows what kind of bacteria got in there. Or even mold? And to top it off, it made my skin severely dry. Like it started peeling off all over. I thought that maybe this was my top layer shedding, but then it was just constantly dry and soon I could see lines on my forehead, and wrinkles in my face. I stopped after that.

It got so dry I started to use an intense healing lotion, because they only gave me a small amount of moisturizer. Finally I switched back to what I was originally using, St. Ives pink lemon and mandarin orange scrub. However it only says to use it 3-4 times a week. What was I supposed to use in the meantime then? And then I realized it has fragrance in it, which can cause acne, so I might just stop taking it all together and find a more natural cleanser. I think the cleanser that worked for me best was this up and up off-brand of proactive. 

This became a long back story, but if anyone has advice from where to go from here, that would be appreciated.",04Apr2020,1

804,"Yesterday, my coworker, ""A"" got a call from their sister in law to say that she had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid 19.  ""A"" and their sister in law had been in contact with each other at a house party about a week (?) ago. 

""A"" went to our local health unit and they determined that they were low risk, and therefore did not test them. This is common practice because they have a limited number of tests, and usually will not test people unless they have traveled. From my understanding, the sister in law is in quarantine but I am unsure if she has been tested. 

""A"" didn't believe in all of the ""scare"" around the virus and refused to wear a mask or wash their hands.   This has alarmed my coworkers. 

My boss told us today that ""A"" would be returning to work as usual on Monday, and when I confronted him about it he told me not to listen to rumors.  This decision to let ""A"" back to work was also supported by head office. 

I am not sure on the time frame since ""A"" and their sister in law met, it might have been a week or a week and a half ago, but I find it alarming that my boss wouldn't have made her wait the mandatory 2 weeks before returning to work, even just as a precaution.

I am not worried, personally that I have contracted the virus, but I am terrified with how my boss is dealing with this.  Our workers are not being supplied masks or gloves, we are not being trained on how to protect ourselves. Everything we know is from word of mouth between co workers.

My boss told a coworker that ""gloves are for sissies"" and soon after that, my coworker went off on  leave due to the virus, certainly because he was intimidated.

I (18F) have asthma, and over the past few months my symptoms have been getting worse, but due to Covid I am unable to get reassessed by a respiratory specialist. I also share a household with my two parents, one who is immunocompromised and the other who has COPD.

My parents do not want me to go back to work, and I am heavily considering going on sick leave and trying to get benefits to wait this out until it is over.

I need some advice and encouragement to help me make my final decision, because I really like this job and my coworkers but I don't think it is worth putting myself and my family at risk if my boss really does not believe in the virus.

She used to be from my country but moved to the United kingdom when she was 12. Suddenly she came during February of 2020 to visit her family here and she surprised me, didnt know she was coming. Her cousin was a good friend of mine from school and the three of us hung out as much as we could in the two weeks she was here. Then she left, once she went back she told me she was falling in love with me. I did have feelings for her during 2019, when I confessed she told me she didnt want to loose me as a friend and I found closure and I genuinely was happy being her friend. After she told me she was falling in love with me, she told me she didnt want to confess her feelings right now, but she couldnt help it since she missed me so much, and wanted to come in 2021 to tell me in person. We didnt start a relationship because we both had to process alot of emotions and long distance would have been hard. We were almost going to when we had an argument about what would happen in 3 years from now, if we ended up marrying other people and couldnt be friends anymore because our spouses might not like us being friends. She was mad at me because if that happened she would still want to be friends with me because of how much she valued our friendship. Things escalated, I told her I didnt want that to happen and in the off chance it happened I would still want to be friends. She told me i wasnt trying enough to keep our friendship if we weren't together. 
I gave her some space and time for her to cool down and think, then out of the blue she sends me a video saying that if I was planning on ending the friendship in three years let's just end it now. And she stopped talking to me.... blocked me on everything... 
She left me with a lot of questions. She did the exact same thing my ex did to me, she knew very well how much it hurt me when my ex did it and yet she did it. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to think. I feel lost.

however the only thing is that my favorite genre is horror and psychological stories.
i would also really enjoy writing and drawing a manga of my story. but i’m just worried that a 14 year old guy shouldn’t be writing / drawing things like that.
i would include murder in the story , so in the manga i would need the create scenes of that.
but i don’t want to worry my parents , and i don’t want to write a story about some basic school life as that would make me bored and unmotivated about the thing.

812,"Hello World,

I'm gonna need your advice. 

So I'm like a 4/10 with 5 being average,  maybe 3.5 depending on your taste. Point is dating doesn't come easy to me and friendship is even harder. 

I was thinking what really matters in life long term and thats probably 1) your wife and family and 2) your career situation. 

But the problem is where will I be able to find that wife and have better odds at doing so?

**Option A: Edinburgh** (where I am currently) it seems tricky. Work-life balance is better and my family is here but finding women who want to date me nevermind marry me isn't easy. If I stay here at least my family is here and hopefully my work/life balance would be better but I risk not finding someone or settling in a big way. 

**Pros: Risky with finding a wife Cons: Near family/better work/life balance**

**Option B: London** (where I've just moved from) London was great initially. There's lots of internationals there who I seem to do better with and I'm generally more attracted to. When I lived there dating wasn't easy but I got by. I was able to get some dates and even a gf. However, the work/life balance is tougher (hence I left). No family but it's near home (Edinburgh). I'd have a better chance of finding somewhere here and more choice but work/life balance is important and ultimately it might be too much.

**Pros: Would likely find a decent wife/more my type Cons: Work/life balance isn't so easy in my field.** 

**Option C: Singapore** (longshot)  I worked there many years ago, Asia in general seems easier to meet women as a foreign guy. I think I'd have more choice there as I went there on holiday before and seemed to get more interest. Work would be hard. My field doesn't pay well there, so I'd likely have to take a long term look at my career, maybe even change fields to make it work.

**Pros: I'd find my ideal wife/international more my type Cons: Career would take a hit/big gamble/far from home.**

Would really appreciate any advice. First post. Many thanks.",04Apr2020,1

We’ve been together almost 4 years now, and the alcohol and air duster wasn’t an issue until about a year ago. Moving to another state away from where we grew up took a toll on him, I know that, I’ve insisted that he didn’t have to come with me if he didn’t want to. He says he still wants to be here. He wants to move to a bigger town where there’s more job opportunities, but until then he just continues going to interviews and applying to jobs and with almost no luck. I’ve revised his resume for him, helped him with applications, everything. 

He’s a great worker when he has a job, we’ve had almost every job together. But when he’s not trying to get a job, he’s drinking or abusing air duster. I just caught him with it (I could hear it from the bathroom, and he denied it the other day when I confronted him).

Some days he’ll scream at me that he doesn’t need help, other days he’s crying that he wants help. Idk anything about rehab and programs like that. If they cost money, and if so how much? Obviously with me being the only one working we don’t have the luxury of paying for something expensive to help him. 

I love him very much, and I even told him I’m not going through this again. I’m trying to be there for him but the last time I did he was only sitting at home and getting high or drunk or both. 

So what should I do? We recently tried having him spend a month with his parents so he could get clean from alcohol but he came back with the air duster habit again.

Since the quarantine started, I've mostly been stuck to my house, and it's getting quite lonely. I am not very extroverted and don't need people around me constantly, but having that option taken away is kind of hitting me harder than I expected. I had recently moved, so I didn't manage to make a lot of friends and the ones that I do have live far away and we're not that close to be talking on a regular basis. In fact, I have recently begun to feel like not talking to anyone at all, even my friends from back home or my family, which I do feel is not a good sign but I just don't feel like they'll understand what I'm going through. I used to volunteer before all this started and it made me happy to make someone's day and effectively practice gratefulness, but now that gone, I find myself often staying up all night just overthinking. I also feel that my eating habits have been affected, I do try to eat healthily, but recently I've been barely eating one proper meal a day like all I ate yesterday was blueberries and some potato chips and that's it and I didn't even feel hungry.

Also, I recently broke up with my ex-boyfriend, and up until the breakup he had been super distant and off-putting and had been talking to other girls and that kind of hit me hard. It made me feel like I didn't have any support system and that feeling only seemed to be getting worse as the pandemic started. Lastly, I haven't been able to get motivated enough to study, even though I push myself to get my work done, I do believe I am struggling to finish the assessments on time and have missed on one of my major assignment and am worried if I'll be able to pass that course.

So you have to find something that we like to do."" I don't blame them for not sharing my interests, but it kind of upsets me that they won't even try when I've been trying for them for years. So, Redditors, how do I change my interests?",04Apr2020,1
827,Hello everyone. I'm a 23 year old guy. I go to college and work. For almost all of my life I have been lonely. I never had a girlfriend and the desire for one is so high. Most of the time girls keep it short with me. I've approached plenty of women but either get rejected or don't/stop replying to my text. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.,04Apr2020,1
828,"So, this is quite a long story. I don't want to reveal my and my ""best friends"" age because we are quite young and people might judge that. First, let me tell you a bit about myself to explain my situation, this is some information that is important for later on. I am a young student who is serious, works and focuses on activities a lot, a bit more mature for his age, struggles with gender dysphoria and I came  out to my friends a few months ago. All of my friends accepted me, and so did the best friend, which for now we will call S. So, S is really immature, thinks everything is a joke, does other idiotic things and has many problems. We've known each other for  quite a while as I mentioned, so we both grew up together sort of, but she never came to my house or went out with me to hang out because her family is weird. When we were younger, it was fun to goof around, and I was honestly stupid too at the time. Now though, I am a very serious person who focuses on very complicated things and sees the world way differently. I am not such a positive person and I have basically gave up on life and I just try to enjoy all that I can to get the most out of the maybe one or two decades I might have left since I don't think it is worth living any further.
S is a cheerful person on the other hand since she doesn't understand what's going on in the world and sees everything like a 5 year old child would, where everything is all good and there isn't any evil the world. She thinks that LGBT is something to joke about, and keeps misgendering me, keeps making jokes that offend me and is just honestly pretty disrespectful in general. She doesn't understand what it means to me even if I explained it to her loads of times. She is the type of person who cannot listen to someone for more than 10 seconds and will intentionally role their eyes or start running away from you in order to see that you are annoyed.
The real dilemma here is that I honestly don't want to hang out with her anymore. We might play videogames once in a while together through WiFi, but she doesn't even call me and its like I'm playing with a stranger since we have 0 interaction. She will never grow up mentally and it makes me really uncomfortable having to deal with her all the time. Although she used to be my best friend, I feel distant from her. She doesn't respect anything. I don't know what to do, since I don't want to hurt her. I'm sure that whatever I do, I will end up hanging out with her in the end. She also believes that if we don't hang out in school, we aren't friends anymore. Her parents don't let her make phone calls, she isn't allowed to get out of the house ever and although our friendship had stayed strong throughout the years, it seems as if she is just purely disrespectful. Not only does she attack me on a deep psychological level, but she also disrespects my work such as the things I write for her and my friends to read at recess and the digital art I make for her.
What should I do? Should I just cut her off? I don't think I can honestly just forget about her, she has made herself quite a place in my life which she doesn't honestly deserve. Not to mention, I am sure she will talk bad about me behind my other friend's backs if I cut her off, even though everything she knows, she has learned from me throughout the years and I am starting to believe that she has no actual mental development.
I might sound like a bad person, please tell me if I am wrong, or if I am just bad in general.
She has made me go through a lot of things while she never gets actually sad because of me. She doesn't have any serious problem, she is just immature and likes to control people. There is a lot going on at her house, but that doesn't excuse her behaviour towards me. Because of her, I started to develop depression which now is severe because of other reasons. She is just a weight I carry, or maybe a back full of rocks which keeps filling up each time she hurts me. 
Am I selfish? I always think of her too before any choice I make which might affect her negatively, but she doesn't give a shit about my feelings, my well being or how the shit she does affects me.
Please don't suggest talking to her, it doesn't work, plus she doesn't understand anything I say, or maybe I should say pretends she doesn't and uses irony in order to show her anger against me when I try to speak to her about sensitive topics. 
Sure, she has improved a bit over the past year but it still isn't as great. There is also a lot to more to it, if you need further information please tell me to edit. 
English is not my native language so I am sorry if something is unclear. 
I hope you guys can help.",04Apr2020,3
829,"Hello,
So I found out yesterday my sister has a boyfriend and she's being lying and hiding it from our family for quite a bit. We're a religious family and she's in fricking grade 8.  If I tell my parents the whole family will get messed up and I already tried hinting at it to her but she alwaysss denies and lies.

I’m a senior in high school and lately I’ve been really stressed about my future. Next year I’m taking a gap year and I’m trying to figure out what I want to do then, but I’m mostly struggling with my future thereafter. I’m thinking a lot about studying abroad because I want to live life to the fullest, but something is holding me back. Idk if it’s fear or if I subconsciously think that I’m better of in my home country. Either way, I’m really confused and would really appreciate some advice rn...",04Apr2020,1
832,"I know I am far from the first person to struggle getting over someone, don't get me wrong. It's been about 7 months since I broke up with my ex. I had been depressed for about a year prior and wasn't enjoying anything. I felt sort of out of love, something wasn't quite the same, but isn't that natural after the ""honeymoon"" period? Especially considering I was so depressed and didn't like another major aspect of my life.( We were together for about 3 and 3/4 years in total)

I knew at the time that I was just blaming the relationship for all my misery, but I couldn't stop myself doing it, and so I broke things off, even though she was honestly a perfect partner - endlessly kind, understanding of my MH issues, dealing with her own issues magnificently, funny, charming, we loved all the same things and had such a similar sense of humour. It sounds weird but literally if I could build a perfect human she would be it. I feel so so stupid for letting go of the love of my life, and the worst thing is I knew it was stupid at the time, I knew I'd regret it, but I still did it! Doubly stupid. I even wonder whether half the reason I was unhappy was that I knew I was going to dump her and already regretted it, if that makes any sense.

Everything I enjoy reminds me of her in someway, because she would have loved it, or because it's a trait she has or a joke she would make. So even things that make me happy constantly remind me of her. I honestly can't see a future where I'm in a happy place. Most other things in my life are okay now, I have friends etc, but I still honestly can't picture a content future for myself. How does one move forward having ruined a happy, healthy relationship with the love of a lifetime? Knowing it's entirely my fault? I can see how you'd move on from being dumped, or from leaving someone toxic or bad for you, or even if distance / life circumstances got in the way. But I do not know how to deal with the guilt and regret.

She did everything you could to save us, and it wasn't enough. It's all on me. I've always been honest about that externally, but I am now finally facing up to it internally and I am completely broken. Where can I go from here?

Even if I do meet someone new (feels impossible based on how many other people have *'liked'* me that way), I am terrified I will constantly compare them to her, and they will inevitably fall short in my perception. I know no one is perfect but honestly she was the closest I've ever met.

In a pique of feeling sorry for myself I did some classic online stalking and can see she's happy and in love and thriving. In a way that does comfort me: I was clearly going to be miserable either way but at least one of us is happy now, so there's that?",04Apr2020,1

837,"When I \[M21\] was 5 or so, my mum \[now F52\] and dad \[now F52\] separated due to constant arguing. My mum married my stepdad \[M56\], and had another son \[now M12\].

From then, I'd go between parents on an equal-time basis. Growing up, I always felt most at ease around my dad. Conversely, I found my mum and stepdad's parenting style often overbearing, overly critical, and difficult. So I'd savour the time with my dad and often dread the time I'd have with mum.

Mum and step are very harsh in their tone, and are offhandedly critical and rude in ways they can plausibly get away with in the moment because they have the parental power. I have a feeling they secretly resent the privileges my brother and I have; they both grew up working class and with a fair bit of difficulty in their lives.

Last year or so, I decided I'd had enough of staying with them, and went to live full-time with my dad while studying.

However, due to a coronavirus lockdown in my city, and my dad having symptoms, I've wound up currently living with them. Even though my dad's now better, It's looking likely that I can't move due to the specific rules of the lockdown, so I'm here indefinitely.

But this is bringing to light a worry I've had at the back of my mind for a while now. My half-brother, who I have a good relationship with, is still very young, and has mild aspergers. Now, in close quarters with the family on lockdown, I see him getting just as frustrated with them as I did when I was his age. But he has no nice dad to run to if things get bad. And I can already see the effect they're beginning to have on him; he constantly feels the need to say sorry, gets angry and frustrated at them before being told he has to stifle those emotions, and cries on his own. 

There are complications to this. Often things are good and peaceful in the house; or peaceful enough anyway. Due to the parental contrast I've been able to fall back on with my dad, as well as being older, I've learned to be assertive enough to manage minor disagreements with my mum and step, and don't feel the need to apologise constantly. I'm often able to have fun with them, even, and have great conversations. But my half-brother has no parental contrast like I did, and is still young and not as articulate as the adults. They often seem to hold him to an adult standard, and I'm worried that with their constant subtle put-downs, they'll turn him into a self-blaming, reticent, overly apologetic person. And I know the way the world works. That, in combination with aspergers, makes him vulnerable.

I've been resisting the urge to speak up and criticise them up until now, because in many ways, the family dynamic works. They do appear to want the best for my half-brother and love him. They just can't seem to help letting out their childhood rage onto their own child.

I almost can't bear it anymore. My mum has always been aloof and stubborn, my stepdad short-tempered and enabling. I want to be there for my half-brother, and be the kind man my dad was for me.

How do I broach this subject? Do I criticise mum and step? Do I tell my brother he can come and stay with my dad and me if things get bad?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*tl;dr\*\* despite things sometimes being good, mum and stepdad have a very critical and stubborn parenting style, which I worry will hurt my half-brother in the long run. i can escape from it, he can't. what do I do?",04Apr2020,1

839,"First post here so really don't know how to address everyone but we'll need some advice.

I bought a house last June (North Central Indiana), late fall we started noticing water would show up at a fence pole and puddle there for days. During winter since it was not really that cold and it rained a lot we saw that area completely flooded and the water started to make it back to the basement so the sump pump would work around the clock.

I had several contractors take a look at the problem with quotes ranging from 2k to 6k, since now we are not leaving the house and weather started to get better I tried to find the broken sump pump line and see if is an easy fix.

Well we just found out that while installing the fence they broke the pipe so the easy fix is a little bit more complicated since the post cement is where the pipe should be.

The fence was installed about 8 years ago when the house was built, on top of the broken pipe the fence sunk because of all the water washing the soil for all these years.

Should I reach out to the fence company since it's their fault?
Is this something that could be claimed by insurance?

840,"My mom lets call her Mary, has some issues to do with her anger and possibly mental health. She is the kind of person to pick out the little things about pretty much anyone, and point them out to them, with an added bonus of uncolicited language and inapropriate or unrelated terms. Whenever we do something 'wrong' she confronts us and tells everyone about it, trying to show that she's not the problem, but we are. She sometimes physically hurts us, I'm used to it so I'm not sure exactly what is too much physical abuse anymore. Recently I've had some trouble with her just from taking too long to do things like the dishwasher or even clapping too loud for the NHS on Thursday. I also had some trouble when I told her my sister (11) was being bullied. She reacted horribly when she found out it was on tiktok, after telling us not to get it. She started screaming curse words and other uncolicited language as if she was a piece of trash. She was calling her 'Slut' and 'Slag' and many other horrible names because she was doing renegades and other dances on tiktok. I intend on standing up for her and sorting things out seeing as I started this, and not only for her but for me aswell. Her shouting at me is the norm, but she crossed the line talking down to my sister. Hope this isn't normal and I'm not just complaining about how 'terrible' my quality of life is as a 'moody teenager'. Thanks.

Same set up minus the family/disabled bathroom in the front. The problem was the assistant managers still used the front bathrooms after they were cleaned, as well as the incoming morning shift, the departments managers were also on the opinon: ""If managament can use those bathrooms, so can the rest of us!""

849,"Hi!

To make a long story short (well, it ended up pretty medium, sorry)--I ended up moving across the country to support my SO when he switched jobs. We moved 25 hours from my old home to my new one. I'm a former foster child, and therefore have very little in the way of a support structure.

After we moved, things became ugly. He has hurt me physically, but more often behaves in a manipulative and gaslight-y way. I don't know how to convey the seriousness of how ugly things got--I frequently sleep on my bathroom floor.

I have saved up money to move back home, slowly. I had a job for a while, which he ended up asking me to quit to 'support him better'--and I did. I was not prepared enough to move out at the time. This means I have no more savings coming in now.

This quarantine has been awful. He is here constantly. I am physically ill. I rarely eat. I am medically underweight now. I feel like every moment is exhausting--I need to wear a mask. I meekly accepts when he constantly calls me stupid and belittles me. Not only do I not argue--he expects me to agree with it. Frankly, I can see his behavior slowly becoming more erratic. The smallest things set him off, and I spend every moment in anxiety. I used to have photos of when he physically attacked me and left me with bruises but lost my phone a few weeks ago in an accident. I was unable to recover almost all of my photos with the Samsung backup. I sent them to a friend who is a police officer at the time. I reached out to them and (just my luck, of course) he says he got a new phone a month ago and does not have them. I have one photo of bruises on my face after he slapped me repeatedly until I had difficulty seeing, but I lost the ones of my neck after he choked me.

I have a friend back home who is not working due to coronavirus and is willing to use her SUV to come out here and slap a small uhaul trailer on it to carry my things, if I pay for expenses. I'm desperate to be out.

My concern is--I have another friend who says that interstate travel is banned. He is telling me that only essential people can be out and about. I don't know what to do. I am completely and utterly exhausted. I find myself having suicidal ideations more and more often now. I cannot live like this anymore. I just want to wake up and feel safe.

To be clearer, if this is helpful--I live in California right now, and I'm trying to get back to Wisconsin. My friend and I plan on taking turns driving and sleeping in the vehicle for the drive when necessary.

853,"Hey everyone, I’m (22M) just seeking advice.  Throw away account for obvious reasons.  

About 7 months ago I had very drunken, unprotected sex with a girl.  I remember some of it, but not all of it.  To my understanding, she was also in a similar state of mind, although probably less drunk as she seemed to remember more details.  At the time, I didn’t think anything of it—obviously, I was very intoxicated.  There were even specific times even where she was initiating it (had her hand on my penis putting it inside her).  The following day we talked about it and she said everything was fine and that we had made a mistake.  She even apologized to me and assured me that I was an incredibly nice person and that everything was okay.  

However even now, I still get a large deal of anxiety when I think about it.  I now understand that being inebriated does not allow for consent to be possible and I can’t help but convince myself that I’m a rapist.  I can’t help but worry that I’m going to be accused of rape for this occurrence.  And at the same time, I also feel somewhat violated by the entire experience because to my understanding, I was the drunker party.  I have a tough time even initiating conversations with girls now especially in social settings (well when social distancing wasn’t a thing) because in the back of my head I’m a no good alcoholic monster (even though I also don’t drink much anymore).  I reached out to her for more closure about 4 months ago and she again said that we were good, although I recently noticed that she removed me from all social media (she also may have just deleted her social media altogether, I’m not sure) and this of course also gives me anxiety.  I just wish I wasn’t anxious about this all the time.  I just want to learn from this and move on.  I’m sure it’ll be recommended to seek help but I’m not sure if that’ll solve anything.  I truly want to be a better person that contributes to a transformative and better society.  But again, in the back of my head, I’m no good and the anxiety is literally eating me alive.

For the last few days, I've struggled to move on, mainly because the realization of how much I had lost had sunk in. This friend I had...was the only human contact I've had in my life outside of work and the mother I live with. They gave me reason to want to wake up in the mornings, as I'd always look forward to talking to them every day when I'd wake up.

Now? I struggle to get the hell out of bed. I don't care when I go to sleep. I've been going on Tinder and failing to establish any long-term conversations, I've been playing dating sims to fill the void in my heart, I've been distracting myself in every way possible, yet it all just boils down to me refreshing their Twitter to see if they've decided to unblock me or not. Or waiting for any sign that they'd be willing to give me a second chance.

Granted, I still have a way of talking to them. But I'm scared of ever doing so because I'm afraid they'll close this ""backdoor"" by blocking me there too. I've pondered whether I should use it or not as a last ""hurrah"" or whatever the fuck people say anymore. I'm wondering whether I should apologize for my actions. I don't know.",04Apr2020,1

You know how people with eating disorders usually have body dysmorphia? I have some type of issue like that, that makes me feel like I’m, I don't know, 60.

Maybe this happens partly because I’ve always been mature for my age and heard a lot of “I thought you were older!” and “Wow, didn’t know you were so young!”. Maybe it got to me.

I’m turning 25 later this year, and I feel like I haven’t done shit. I haven’t finished college, and the way things are going I’ll probably finish it at fucking 28. I work in the art and entertainment industries, so there’s a lot of pressure to “make it” as soon as possible.

I looked for help online, and people keep mentioning all these famous people that changed their lives in their 40s and 50s and how it’s “never too late”.

862,"My brother broke my heart today.



Today we were getting ready to go to Walmart to pick up some tissue and some food. 

I'm 27. My brother is 16. We are very close and my mom has some bad money soendint habits. I buy him clothes, food, I brought him a cellphone and he has a line on my contact. I do alot for him because my parents were very poor. When I was his age, I used to be that ""broke friend"" I never had money for after school, couldn't really go out with friends because they never had money. I wanted my brother to grow up and have positive experiences and enjoy bringt a teenager which is why I do so much for him. And obviously because I love him with everything in me. For months we have been talking about going down south to visit our grandpa who recently had a stroke in October. But the Corona pandemic happened. Today he asked me if I'm gonna buy the tickets and I told him that due to everything going on I will not be purchasing tickets to take a plane there. He got upset. Stormed in my mom's room asking if he could take the bus to south Carolina by himself and my mom explained why he couldn't go right now. He was upset. And then as I was walking to the door to leave, be pushed pass me.



We get in the elevator and I'm saying ""look I understand that you're upset. And I get that you will be angry, but please don't push me. Especially if you're coming with me somewhere"" he wanted to come with me because he asked me I could get him a phone holder for his bike btw. So now, I'm going downstairs to my car and he's saying ""open the door. Before I unlocked my car I told him that he is not going to get in my MY car and come with me so I can buy him something when he has a very rude disrespectful attitude. He's still ignoring me so I told himy that he needs to stay home cause I didn't appreciate the attitude. So I get in the car (when you press the unlock button on the remote it only opens the driver side of the door.) So now I close the door.



He jumped on the hood of my car and h refused to get off. So I called out older sister and told her what was going on. She said he can't control his anger and he's not gonna react to things the way I do. I'm a very laid back calm person. She said he's a teenager and he's gonna get mad sometimes. I told her I understand but you can't expect someone to do something for you and have a disrespectful attitude with them. I told her to call him. So now she called him and told him shell take him to get a phone holder later and to just go back on the house. 



He stood up on the roof of my car, jumped on it, then jumped off of it. As he's walking across the street, he turned around in my direction, he spit on the ground, then he stuck both his middle fingers up at me then turned around and went back upstairs. I called my mother and told her what happened. She was just upset and had and an attitude when I was tell her what happened. She just said ok. So now I'm driving to Walmart but my whole mood was blown so I just went back home. So now, I get back in the house and I tell my brother to give me his phone (I brought the phone and the bill is in my name. 


My mom was there. She told him to come in her room and she asked me to come too. Now I come I come I the room and she said to my brother ""look, you can't be disrespectful towards Jasmine given all that she does for you"" so now, he says "" fine take the phone"" and threw it in the floor. My mother was right there, she didn't say a word. So now, I'm leaving and he threw my jackets at me,then he started trying to push me out the doorway. I tell him to stop and she's getting more agressive. I try to restrain him and I push him so he could get off of the collar of my shirt. We did t fight or anything, just tussled a bit. My mom was standing right there watching us. She didn't do or say anything. Nothing. 



So I have his phone. And I terminated the line. Because I understand people get angry, but I will not tolerate bring disrespected by anyone when they are asking me to do something for them ( in this case asking to come with me to the store to buy a phone holder) my mom said nothing. Not one word. I'm hurt because he was so disrespectful to me. And I do everything for him. He's never reacted towards me in an angry way before today. It broke me down so bad. And it hurt me even more because I do so much for him. And I understand he's a teen, but that still hurt me alot. 



He's never done this to my mom, dad, or other sister. So it just breaks my heart that he would do something do hurtful. And my mom did nothing to interject, tell him he's bring very out of line. I feel like she doesnt love me. His phone, the bill, the clothes, buying food for him...I have no idea why he did that. But I'm still hurt. I blocked my mom's number. Once I left she tried calling me about an hour later but I don't really want to talk to her right now. I really don't know what to do (I live with my mom btw) I'm in a hotel now. I just need some space away from my family. 



Am I being childish for being hurt by his actions? I'm not sure but msn, I'm really sensitive and that really tore me in half. Our dad doesn't live with us. I haven't called him and told him what happened. I'm not sure where to go from here. I tried talking to him calmly and respectfully explaining why I was taking his phone...I know I keep saying it but I can't believe he did this. And I still can't believe that my mom did nothing about it. When my sister would go off on him for having a disrespectful attitude, my mom always intervenes. But why not with me? I feel alone and not cared for by my mom and brother....



I really really feel so hurt...",04Apr2020,1

864,"TLDR: Should I have an arranged marriage with someone who I don't want to and then let her know that all she has to do is put up a front to our parents and we are to live separate lives? Or am I ruining someone's life?

I was born and raised in the United States, my parents are Pakistani Muslims. I love my parents and their culture. I was a devout Muslim until 18ish until I became a closet atheist. I've always known that I'd have to have an arranged marriage or lose the love of my family. My parents are very modern from their standards, I can have a ""love marriage"" as long as they are Muslim. Since I wouldn't choose to marry a Muslim, an arranged marriage is my only option because I can't marry someone who I want because my family will discover I'm not Muslim.  My family is very modern therefore I know they won't ""disown"" me if I rejected their culture or religion but I know they won't love me; I'd be pretty much be cut off from my extended family (including my parent) except my siblings.

I just enlisted in the U.S. military, so I decided to visit my extended family in Pakistan before shipping off to boot camp. When I got back, one of my dad's best friends called him up and said he really liked me and wants me to marry his daughter. My parents came to me with the proposal and I said no, but they insisted its a really good proposal and I should say yes. Also, the proposal is coming from a great family who we are close and it would mess up family relations if I said no. I acquiesced on the condition that I'd get to talk to the girl a couple of times before the final decision, which is apparently a big deal.

I'd thought about this allot, and I'd deiced that when the time came I'd marry whoever I'm pretty much forced to, the only thing I'd make sure is to talk to the girl and confirm that she's not doing it against her will.

My family is not rich to American standards American but to Pakistani standards, we are loaded.  My dad has bought each of his kids a nice house in Pakistan and set up a considerable trust fund, which I don't need. So this girl will be getting a U.S. citizenship, which is coveted to her family.

After marriage, I have two choices:

A: I let her know that I'll get a visa to come to the states and let her live off of the money from my trust fund as long as she wants. I'll help her get established here, find a job, pay for her education if she wants, she just lives her life however she wants, get remarried (secretly). Since I'll be in the military it would in our culture if she moves back to Pakistan and takes ownership of my house and lives with her parents. Lots of my cousins (male and female) live apart from their spouses who are overseas.

While I live my life, continue my career and education, get to live to my own lifestyle and hopefully find love.

B: I don't let her in on the plan, I proceed as expected of me. Get married, have her come to America, live apart since military, and just keep an excessive distance from her, I get to keep up the Muslim front to my parents. I live a hidden life, get remarried, if the opportunity presents itself, just be an ""absent"" husband.

I could be destroying this girls life because all she just wanted a traditional husband who was a provider and cared about her, but instead, she is now stuck with someone who wants nothing to do with her.

or

I could be freeing this girl who also had to marry someone she didn't know but got lucky and now do literally whatever she wants without and pressure from her parents.",04Apr2020,2

866,"Ok so for background my mom bought the apartment we live in and at first I didn't notice anything except for water damage in my room specifically in the corner by the window. Then some years passed and one of our two bathrooms would get mold, and gradually it got worse in that bathroom. Then she brought her stupid son to live with us and we didn't wanna share the bathroom with him bc he's filthy lol. Long story short, he got kicked out and to no ones suprise he wasn't cleaning the mold that formed from his long ass showers so the whole ceiling was caked with it and idk anything about mold but that one specifically looks black but I'm not sure. The smell hits you when you walk in the bathroom btw.


 Anyways my mom cleaned it bc I was refusing to clean it but she couldn't remove it completely. Now the reason i refused to clean it was one bc i was totally against her bringing her son in (long story) and two because everytime i attempted to clean it i got sick. Even with a mask, goggles and gloves I would feel it in my lungs, it makes me cough like im gonna puke and I can taste it too somehow 🤢...It makes me nauseous and I smell/taste it for like almost two days after getting near it when attempting to clean it. I hope I don't sound dramatic but idk how she stood there cleaning it without feeling sick.


 So today I was fixing my mattress and found mold in the same corner where the ceiling has water damage but the mold is near the floor and window..Btw the ceiling is crackly and the wall/ window going down is cracked and I just noticed its cracking at the bottom too. It rained recently. I whined to my mom bc i felt like crying and she said the people who were suppose to fix the roof never came to fix it(tbh the people don't do the extra services we get charged for here like cleaning the outside and it pisses me off) and other than that she doesn't seem to care because there's nothing she can do about it, she just told me to clean it to prevent it from growing, which I know won't stop it.

As in, she’s basically always looking for verbal fights. It stressed me out so much and I started crying most of the time. 

Once we fought three times in one day. 

Recently, I got in a fight with her while I was watching my brother play resident evil. It was about my friend, her girlfriend, who was being bullied on Omegle. I tried to cheer her up by saying funny stuff because I’m not the best at cheering people up.

She told her girlfriend, supposedly my best friend, and she freaked out at me. She said I didn’t care that she was being bullied and that I shouldn’t have changed the subject and I’m sensitive to cursing, which I’ve told her, and she used the f word which made it even worse to me. She said I didn’t support her, I don’t even know what she was talking about, and my sister was next to me on the couch so I covered myself with a blanket and started crying.

My sister messaged her because she cares about me, and told her I was crying. She said “oh well” and that made me feel worse.

I’ve talked to her about being nicer because I always try to be nice to her, there’s very few times where I was rude to her. She always tells everyone else that it’s my fault whenever we fight.

873,"

Hi, this is my first time posting. I’m looking for some really needed advice. I’m trying my best to better myself as a person overall. I’m not looking for pity, since I got what I deserved, just trying to make things better. This has probably been one of, If not the worst/hardest year of my life. Not expecting anyone to read this. But If you do, any advice would be appreciated. 

(Incoming huge wall of text)

So basically, around a year ago. I became a huge asshole. I wasn’t always one, but I became one and I ruined my life.

So to give context as to why. In 9th and 10th, I used to hangout with a small group of friends, whom I’ve been best friends with since 7th grade, we got along great and had fun hanging out with one another. One day, me and one of my friends who we’ll call Dan, were heading over to the usual hangout spot to meet the others. As we make our way to the spot, I see one of the new students sitting alone since he didn’t know anyone. So me and Dan, decided to invite the guy, who will be named Pete, to hangout with us and the others. Pete was hesitant at first, but then agreed to go with us. Ever since that day, Pete would become part of the group and all of us would get along for the time being. As time went on, things started to change due to Pete. Pete started to get comfortable with us and began acting like a dick. He would make fun of everyone of us and would sometimes make us feel bad, but back then we just thought of it as “just jokes” and didn’t take it personally. Pete and another friend of ours who we will call Nate. Pete and Nate, got along great and instantly hit it off. They instantly became best friends, and due Nate hanging out with Pete so much. Pete began to rub off on Nate, and slowly Nate would start to act like an asshole and eventually I would too. Nate and me, were also best friends naturally due to Nate and Pete hanging a lot together, I’d be there along with them. 


Anyways, fast forward a few months , we would all hangout with each other but the group would usually split into smaller groups. Me,Nate and Pete would usually hang with each other. Things were great for a while, but then things took a shift. Pete was suddenly making fun of me all the time and so would Nate, since he also thought what Pete was saying/doing was funny. It was alright at first, I would usually brush it off and laugh. But it got worst and worst and worst and worst over time. That shit eventually started to get to me and it hurt. I’d feel like shit every time they would do that, and it began to demoralize me. This would go on through the entire year of 9th grade, I didn’t complain or say a word about it though. I just let it happen, I didn’t think they would take me seriously If I brought it up. 

When school ended at the time, things ended pretty well, everyone was in good terms with each other. Summer was great. But, during the summer I was still hurt about what happened in 9th grade. I replayed everything they ever said to me everyday. By doing that, I eventually stopped caring about what they thought about it and realized no one really cared about me. It helped me gain confidence and developed a pretty thick skin. Summer came to an end and school started.  I began 10th Grade, things were different, I was different. I wasn’t the same pushover I was a few months ago. I didn’t take the people attempting to look down on/make fun of me seriously, I would laugh or cringe at them and begin to make fun of ‘roast’ them for trying to make fun of me. I’d also mock them sometimes and roast and I didn’t let others walk over me. Everything was going great, or so I thought. Over time, I developed an ego and became an arrogant prick due to being more confident and not letting anyone or anything phase me. I began doing the same thing that Pete and Nate would do to me in 9th grade, and to everyone  else in the group including Pete and Nate. I figured everyone could handle it, especially Pete and Nate, cause If you give it, you should be able to take it. Plus I thought it was ‘just jokes’ and no one would take anything personally. 

I ended up being dead wrong, my friends began resenting me over time and would hangout with me less and less. They’d sometimes would go days-weeks without talking to me due to me acting like such a dickhead towards them.  Which I thought was only temporary and things would go back to normal once they’ve gotten over the whole thing. Which they did at least for a little while, things weren’t completely the same though. They decided to give me one more chance, and I took that chance for granted. Me, Pete and Nate had a final altercation with each other. Me and Pete, we would frequently hang up on Nate most of the time. Nate finally had enough and had an outburst of anger. He began to let everything out, how we were hurting him and how much of dickheads we were/become and that we’ve changed. He didn’t consider us real friends anymore due to the poor way of how we treated him.  He stopped taking to Me and Pete, we figure he’d be fine and would get over it. He didn’t, we didn’t talk for at least a week with him. We tried to apologize but he wasn’t having any of it. 

Spring Break was coming up, so we’d figured he would cool off and everything would be fine once we were back. This is where everything took a turn for me, while I was enjoying my spring break. Every one of my friends turned on me and cut me off for good. Nate told every one of my friends to stop being friends with me, which they did since I was such a huge dickhead to them. Even Pete, who would make fun of Nate more often than I would cut me off and began being friends with him. I didn’t know this happen at the time, since this was done behind my back. Once school started, I went to the spot which me and my friends used to hangout all the time. Went to say hi to them, and join in the conversation. But Nate and the others pretended as If I didn’t exist/ignored me. I realized what was going on and so I took a hint and let them alone. I began to start hanging out by myself and didn’t talk to anyone else aside to some people in some of my classes. I passed the time watching Netflix or YouTube videos . During this time I was hoping things would change, but they never did. I was left alone. I was alone for the remainder 2 months of my sophomore year and we didn’t once speak to each other, I saw them hanging and laughing with each other almost everyday. It was painful , but I tried my best to endure it. 


So then, school finally came into an end, and summer began. I took this time to focus on myself to better myself/reflect  as a person and realize what I’ve done and avoid from having it repeat itself. Things were going pretty well, I flew out of state to spend the summer with family members and it was a fun distraction at the time. Once I came home, which was at the near end of summer, I began to think how things were gonna be this year and how different things were now, since I was now alone. And so, school began and It was the first day of school. I really really really didn’t wanna go, but I had to endure, so I went. It was hard. Seeing everyone happy to see each other again. I was alone, I didn’t have anyone. I felt bitter being back. It was as If I was estranged. So, the following week I decided to skip school for  a couple days since I didn’t feel like going (did this a couple more times throughout the year). Once, I was back officially, I decided to give this a chance. I tried to move on from the past and leave what happened behind. I attempted to make new friends, but that was rather hard since most of the people in my grade hate/resent me (not for the same reasons as to why my friends hate me) and I have no idea why. The first semester was pretty hard to get through, I was completely and utterly alone. I’ve never felt more alone in my life than I have through this year of high school. This had a huge impact on me, I felt numb all the time, I didn’t care about anything,anyone or myself. I didn’t have the will to go living with a conscious mind. My grades were slipping and I had absolute zero energy to do anything besides stay bed all day and sleep. I had absolutely no one to talk or hangout with me besides one bandmate I had in band class, which  was a senior, but we didn’t really hangout all that much till the second semester. 

In around late December things did get a bit better, I was starting to talk to my bandmate more often and old friend of mine, whom rekindled a friendship with me. Life began to seem a little bit brighter.  I’ve began to get a grip and stopped being depressed. I started looking forward to the future. Christmas break came around, it was pretty good. Came back to school to start the second semester. I came back to try and better myself. Be a better person and try to fix the mistakes I’ve made. I decided to make slight positive changes in my life and apologize to the old group of friends I’ve had. They were pretty surprised and were glad that I apologized. But we didn’t become friends again, which was unfortunate but I didn’t expect we would anyways, since it would be unrealistic. I still spend a lot of my time alone, but I’ve gotten slightly better at handling it. Though the loneliness, does get to me and bits of depression are still lurking inside. It’s better than before. My grades are better now too, since I spend most of my free time studying. As for making friends I don’t think I’ll be able to make any at all. But I didn’t expect to make any, due to mostly everyone resenting/hating me. I’ve been trying to survive one day at a time. Not gonna lie, it’s hard real hard, sometimes it’s harder than most days. But I do my best to get through it. 

I’ve been thinking about changing schools once my junior year ends. To get a fresh start, and to leave everything behind. But If I do, I think things would be overall be the same as before due to the fact that I don’t know anyone. I have no idea what to do, I’m a stupid 17 y/o, who doesn’t  know shit about life or anything. I’m completely clueless on what my next move should be. I have no one to ask this to irl. So, I’m turning to random strangers in the internet who hopefully can provide some insight or wisdom on what I should do next. Currently writing this during quarantine, been thinking of this for a long time and I’m using reddit as an outlet to let this all the buildup that’s being going inside my head out. 

tl;dr I fucked up my life, by being a dickhead and ruining my friendships. Most of the people in my grade either hate me or resent me. Tried to fix things, but they haven’t got much better over all. I’m completely and utterly alone, I have no one. Currently contemplating  to change schools after junior year for a new start.

I'm a girl, 15, and I've had a crush on a certain boy (let's call him A) since three years ago. Last year I got the opportunity to get closer to him and I found out we had an incredible amount of things in common, many more than I initially thought, and I fell even deeper for him.
Well, some time ago I united all of my courage and decided I was gonna ask him out, but the whole coronavirus thing appeared and I didn't get the chance. 
I was going to tell my closest friend (B) about it, but then I found out through a mutual friend of ours that B used to like A. B told me that she no longer liked him, but her behavior makes it clear that she still does but is too shy to admit.
My plan was to meet him after the quarantine and tell him there, but now I don't know what to do. Until this year I was always alone, but B approached me and I became very good friends with her. She introduced me to her friend group, but I'm not that close to any of them yet. Only her. We have many things in common and she's a friend I can always talk to. And I'm afraid if I ask A out she will distance herself from me and I'll lose the only true friendship I have. 
She'll surely feel terrible regardless of whether he says yes or no, and I really don't want that to happen.

I really need advice on what to do because I'm lost. Im no longer sure if I want to tell him because I feel like I might lose both of them in the end.",04Apr2020,1

879,"I was trying to record a few narrations of creepy stories, btw I'm thinking about creating a Youtube Channel reading stories, any thoughts on that? So I opened my voice memos app that's native from iOS, the last recording was the recording of a guy saying ""Te amo"" (that's I Love You in portuguese, I'm brazillian) while i giggled in the background of the recording, it is aproximately 9 seconds long. I have no recollection of whose voice it is, judging for the address of the recording (the app saves the recordings by ""location (number of the memo)"") I suppose it's someone from my school, or at least, someone that was at my school. It's none of my classmates 'cause I know their voices well, we've been together since freshman year and now I'm a senior. I posted the recording on my social media to see if any of my friends know the voice, but so far, nobody responded. I am really curious, what can I do?

880,"All things aside(I'm currently in therapy but hope to beat my issue soon), I find myself dwelling too much on the past and worrying about the future and caring too much about silly things that are unlikely to matter for more than a few minutes. I'm not a very mindful person and I lack self discipline and honestly, self control. I say things I don't mean and quickly want to go back on what I said which is obviously something that can't be done. I often can't control my thoughts and they control me rather than me controlling them.

My worst characteristic is my stubborness, where even if I could be wrong. I often can't see that I am wrong and end up defending my statement or opinion the grave even if I do agree with the other person. 

I have troubles with relationships that I can only assume are to do with trust or loneliness where I get too attached to someone and hate having to go a day without them, I'm often overbearing and don't notice until afterwards. 

I have absolutely no idea on a career path or job I'd like and haven't ever really known. (I live in the UK and have no idea where I want to live and if I want to remain here) 

I don't see the world in a very good way, it honestly seems to me as though its falling apart and I want to change my perception of it.

881,"I’ve always wanted to have friends that look like me. Four or five friends that are basic girls just like me.

I’ve always dreamed of going to Starbucks, go clothes shopping, and walking around the mall looking like rich bitches with friends.

The reason I’ve always wanted this is because I’ve been bullied for years for being basic. And I feel like I won’t be bullied if I’m with people who look and act like me (in a way, so to speak). I feel that way because they will be able to relate to me and I them. I’ve never related to any of my friends who aren’t like me because of cultural and aesthetic differences.

883,"I’m (15F) and live w/ my older sister (18F), dad and mom. 
Since I can remember my parents haven’t shown any affection towards each other. Like none at all and even act like they hate each other. I remember a few years back (I must’ve been about 9) looking through my moms texts with my dad since I knew they were having problems. Yes this was very invasive but I was quite young. 
Anyway, I found texts between them and basically what I gathered is that my dad had cheated on my mom multiple times and they were only together “for the kids”.

Skip to mid 2019, I’m suffering from an eating disorder and depression. This year was absolutely fucking terrible for me. It didn’t help that I started failing in class.

My mom around the same time started drinking on weekends. It started with a glass or two of strictly wine on a Saturday night. It progressed into a bottle or two of wine - started on Friday night and lasting until Sunday morning (a complete binge). As of right now it’s a bottle wine and liquor every single weekend without fail. She starts on the sofa on a Friday and stays on the sofa until Sunday or even Monday morning. I think her and my dad don’t want to share a bed.

A few months ago (beginning of 2020) I got more worried about her drinking habits as they had gotten worse and decided to check her messages again. I found she had a shit ton of messages (starting from about  September 2019) to and from a man that wasn’t my father. They’d send each other messages declaring their love every day. This man doesn’t live in the country so I know it cannot be that serious but it seriously broke me. I feel into a depressive episode and barely went to school and stopped showering and stuff. 

Another thing is that my sister lives away at college so we rarely see each other. She is one of the most terrible people I know, ridiculously mean. She constantly mocks my suicide attempt, calls me ugly and calls me an idiot because she goes to an Ivy League school. I like to ignore her a lot but we share a room and are now quarantined together so it’s pretty hard. 

At this point I am completely stuck in a toxic household and am loosing my mind every day. Any advice?

Not working, not doing anything productive, not having a schedule.. Just sleeping, and playing video games doing absolutely nothing important at all.
It’s honestly killing my mental health. I cannot wait for all this crap to be over. 

Sure it was fun for the first two or three days (I used to work 5-6 days straight) but I absolutely cannot just keep doing this. I love working. I love being productive and active.. It helps me cope and keep my mind busy.

*Edit: for a little bit of information, I'm 19, and am asexual and nonbinary, born Female, and am romantically attracted to females.* I've known my sexuality for a few years and am comfortable with it, but recently I think I may have feelings for a guy. 

In my friendship group, there are two males. One I'll call A, and one I'll call B. A and B have been friends for around two or three years, and I've been friends with them for one or two years. Either way they knew each other for a year or so before they met me. 

A is a gay male and has a crush on B, a bisexual male. A's crush has been present for a while as far as I know. B doesn't know. A once asked B out, but B said no and the two continued on as friends. B has confessed to having a crush on me, but he doesn't expect anything of it due to my interest in girls. He said he just needed to get it off his chest since it had been weighing him down a while, as he didn't know what I would think. I told B that I didn't think any differently of him and that he was still my friend. I told him that I wasn't in the right mindset to try a relationship and it would be unfair on him, so I said I was willing to try another male relationship, but that it would be a few months before that. He readily agreed, saying he understood and that he didn't want me to force anything. 

I never really paid attention to my own feelings but ever since he confessed I'm more aware that my heart speeds up when we talk, or that when he compliments me I get flustered and red faced. He's the first person I message in the morning and the last person I message at night. There are little things that remind me of him and I can't stop thinking about it. 

The issue is, is that I don't know where A stands. A has recently been talking to a guy he really likes. A refers to him a ""possible boyfriend"" and has mentioned he wants to ask him out. Before this guy, A said that he wouldn't want me dating B, which I understood completely. But when we talked about that, A hadn't met his ""possible boyfriend"" and I hadn't been aware about my feelings for B. 

I want to talk to A again and ask his feelings. Both about B, and me asking B out. I don't know how to go about this, and I don't want to hurt A or B. If I ask B out, I might hurt A, but if I reject B I'll be hurting B and myself. I want to be selfish and ask him out and try a relationship again, but A is important to me, and I don't want to loose either of them.

895,"Hey there folks. I’ll try and keep this short and to the point. Some backstory first: 

I was supposed to run my very first marathon at the beginning of May in a big race in my area. For obvious reasons around the pandemic, that event was cancelled. That race was going to be raising money for a charity, which I thought was really cool. I know raising money for a cause through races is not a new concept, but I enjoyed knowing my efforts were for something above my own personal goals.

The event was cancelled more than halfway through my training for it, and instead of losing all of my progress, I’ve decided I will just run my own marathon through my town (neighborhoods, park trails, etc.) to at least reach that personal goal I have been training so hard for.

My question is, would it be rubbing people the wrong way if I tried to raise money for a pandemic related charity with my personal run? I just feel like it would be cool to try and drum up a few bucks for a good cause, but I also really don’t want to seem tone deaf. The economy is in shambles and I don’t want to seem out of touch asking for money in what is already a very uncertain time for a lot of people financially. 

Am I over-thinking this? Or is this one of those times where it’s better to just lay low and celebrate a personal accomplishment in private?

I lived with my boyfriends family, I am pregnant, and the COVID-19 is in the city we live in. They constantly all go outside and have family outings and Im am concerned for myself and my unborn.
I moved in with my mother finally with my boyfriend so we can totally self isolate because I was getting concerned for my health, I have a low immune system. 

When I moved in with my mother, we promised her we would stay home unless for necessities, she has a autoimmune disease and could literally just die any day, she has faced deaths door countless times of her life. When she has a cold, she can get into a coma if she doesn’t keep herself healthy. It is the first day of moving in, and my boyfriend went to visit his family as it has been a year since their grandma has passed away so I was like “okay but be careful and sanitize always” now, he wants to stay the night and he’s been visiting his family around and my mother said if he doesn’t take this seriously she will kick him out.
Ive warned him, this virus could kill my mother and being pregnant is a scary time right now. 
My mom also said, I wont be able to see him at all until this virus goes away,  if he gets kicked out, which could be months, meaning him missing the rest of my pregnancy and ultrasounds and first things.
He said he wants to visit and he keeps getting mad at me for making him self isolate.

906," Just a note, many things in this may not make sense to you while reading this (eg why have I never just called the police/ moved out earlier). I know it doesn’t make sense, but being abused at this level for this amount of time really messes with people’s brains. Also the physical abuse is a lot less now, I keep a chair under my door handle and a knife on my bedside table/ in my pocket in case I need to use it. 

For a little context, I met a guy a little over a month ago and we’ve been going on dates every 5 days or so since then. He’s consistently made it very clear that he likes me a lot. He comes from an upper-class, well off family of doctors and successful people, he’s not snooty or anything but he’s admitted to not going through much trauma (his family and extended family are very good people and have treated him well). This ofc is great for me if I can marry into a family of good and kind people, but I don’t know when to tell him, or how to tell him how bad mine is.

&amp;#x200B;

My family (mother, father, brother) are all, and have always been very nasty and violent towards me, so much so that I can’t even leave my room without mockery, harassment, and threats of violence (I still do leave my room though to shower and get food, but I can’t stay outside my room for long). They are all (undiagnosed) very mentally ill and twisted, they have convinced themselves since my birth that I was somehow the ‘bad guy’ (no I am not over exaggerating my mum once complained (in all seriousness) that I have always picked fights, ever since I was a baby!!!!! BABY!!!!). 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve pretty much endured every kind of abuse possible from these people, some of it is even funny how messed up and random it is (like my mother forcefully holding me down and letting my brother pee on me when I was like 9 because I called him a ‘weiner’). Most of the abuse I’ve endured from them is so extreme and crazy that no one would actually believe it, as you reading this now are probably questioning the severity of it. From 15 and under, my family (obviously) had abused and gaslit me so much that they made me believe that if I called the police, I’d go to jail too because I threatened to break their things, or hit back, or it was my fault my dad beat me bloody because I called my mum a b\*tch. They have also slandered and lied about me to my extended family since forever (yes my aunts and stuff have picked up on it and have guessed my family is abusive). Because of this constant poo-talking, I’ve had no relationship with any outside members of my family, which means I have had no one to go to. 

Obviously, I need to get out of this situation, I’m in my final year of university, once I graduate next year I’ll move out, get a job, and cut them out completely, maybe legally if I can. 

But my question is this; How do I tell someone who clearly cares for me so much that my family is this bad, and that I’m consistently in danger but won’t leave because one more year of abuse is nothing to a lifetime of it? 

How do I tell him that I never want him to meet them?
