1,"I’ve been slowly realizing that I might be in an abusive relationship. I’ve been with my fiancé for 10 years and his behavior is the type I grew up with with my dad mistreating my mom, so I guess I just normalized it. I feel sorry that I’ve wasted over 1/3 of my life on him, but the way he’s treating me is making me severely depressed. I even tried to end my life this summer. How can I leave? How can I explain this to my family and friends who have never seen this bad side of him? How can I move on?",20Feb2020,1
2,"I am 27, and I have been working dead end jobs since I started working. The only desired places of employment in my town, are the mills that everyone seems to work at. So, basically my only hope to better my situation is to pursue a line of work that is more broad, with more opportunities. Ideally something that will survive the changing times with automation becoming more common. I am leaning towards a career in computer science, or information technology since the demand for this type of work seems to be increasing. But I am having doubts about it due to my lack of formal education. I earned my GED in the state of California, and only achieved around 70% of the required credits to graduate.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I guess my questions are;

What extra schooling/time would be required of me given my lack of high school credits?

When perusing a Bachelor's in a given field, am I required to take all of the general studies classes as well?

I have weak math skills when the equation is formulated for me, but when I am the one creating it, my understanding of the process is far better. With the aid of a calculator, I have no issue. If you are someone  who has had this issue, how did it impact your experience with math in college? How did you overcome this?

If you have a career in one of the fields I am interested in, what was your experience? Did college provide you with the necessary tools for the job you currently hold? Or did you have to learn the whole process on the job?

If you waited till you were half dead to turn your life around, how did you manage it? If you pursued a higher education, did you find the process to be difficult/demoralizing? 

If you did not go to college, but took classes to learn a trade, what is that trade? And what has your experience been like?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any of these questions apply to you, and you have answers, please PM me any responses. Or just any advice in general pertaining to financial improvement given my lack of skills and experience. 

Just a guy here who has been married for a while now and want to set a proper foundation to raise kids and start a family, but lack the direction and confidence to do so. Thanks for reading.",20Feb2020,1

5,"My bestfriend have suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety. Lately she been thinking she's not pretty or good enough for people, and that she just wanted to be ""beautiful and happy."" We are 13 to put that out there. I tell her that beauty is subjective, and that's she beautiful just the way she is. But she claims that I'm lying. She started having these thoughts about her self because of her crush. Last year, her and her crush started having romantic feelings, and getting really close. But never officially went out. He is similar to the clique ""nerd"" he's not famous, nor talkative, and straightforward. This school year, he starts to ignore her, not saying why or nothing. She feels like she's not good enough or pretty enough for everyone. That's when she started to SH. Lately she been asking me how can she change herself so she can be beautiful so everyone can stop giving her werid 'looks'. I try to tell her that there's always going to be someone judging you, not matter how 'beautiful' you are. But she doesn't care about that. She asks people to rate her 1 out of 10. Today, she gave me a note at school and it said. ""People has been ignoring me for no reason, and dont want to make eye contact with me, giving me looks, staring at me... people called me ugly, what can I do to improve my looks"" I'm not sure what to say. Her looks is definitely above your average 13 year old. What can I do to make her realize her worth? How can I help her?",20Feb2020,1

I have been writing my life story the past year. My life includes many challenges and this book is how I overcame them. By looking deep into the unknown, I discovered a reality that I think is pure. It’s a state of mind more than anything but I feel free from fear, judgement, and anything negative. My memoir will dive deep into the dark corners of my life and how I now live with a different perspective on life with love in my heart. I share intimate details and try to relate to many people with struggles of pain and suffering whether it’s mentally or physically. The book is a path of transformation and I want to share this path with the world so that everyone will know there is hope and we all can heal.

Would you be interested in reading a book like this?

Thank you in advance for any input!
Much Love!",20Feb2020,1
7,I don’t like them (romantically.) But they appear in my dreams and I can’t stop thinking about them no matter how hard I try. Being around them just stresses me out now to the point that I can’t make eye contact with them without feeling super anxious.

 I started studying design on the local one last year, while working to get some money to move, but in the middle of the year I changed my mind and gave up from my dream of studying diplomacy (the why is useless).

Now on February (2020) I start feeling a strong will to start Med School and our local University has it, but now I'm feeling really afraid to do it (since I can't see blood) and feeling bad for wanting it, because I have other dreams like starting my own company and YouTube channel

im 16 at the moment, and my mom is incredibly psychologically abusive. she swears, calls you names, ignores you for LONG periods of time, the list goes on. my self esteem and self worth is literally non existent and i didnt realise this even counted as abuse until i read an article about it today.

my younger siblings are 10 and 12. my mom used to only be mean to me, but now im starting to see her act in the same way towards them. my youngest sibling confessed to me that he feels really bad about himself, even though my mom never really swears at him. just hearing her talk that way to me has diminished his confidence. i never realized that by hurting me she could be hurting them too.

my sister (12) has had suicidal thought and has only told me, i dont know what to do. my parents are both together and i dont want to tear the family apart but i cant let my siblings go through the same things i went through

also, sometimes my mom is really nice. she laughs and smiles and acts normal. and then all of a sudden the littlest thing sets her off and she gets upset and becomes cruel. she never really has seen the seriousness of her actions, once she made me cry in public and somehow managed to turn herself into the victim.

I tend to start yelling and things tend to get pretty out of hand. I do not want to go into detail, but I do want to know if anyone has ever had anger problems and what you did to control them?

I want to stop yelling and I want to not be so angry. I want to learn how to calm down better or not get so angry in the first place.

Right now I have a few methods I can try, if you do any of these, then please let me know how it worked for you: writing down my feelings before discussing them, try to do breathing exercises, when I start yelling then pause for a second, meditation, ask myself questions if it's worth it etc. 

Doing these methods also seem hard when you are in person arguing.

I (22F) have a ten year old brother who has autism. He can talk and understand things relatively normally, but not in the way most people do.

43,"
Not really sure what the issue is but for just about my entire adult life so far I (32M) haven’t been able to have a really consistent relationship with guys I meet. I’ve met many acquaintances and associates from work, college, church etc. Some I still talk to to this day. But that’s just it. All we ever do is talk. Catch up. No meet ups at the bar. No ball games, birthday party celebrations, Pickup basketball, video games etc.

I’ve always been the person that brings people together in my own family. In other words I’m always extending myself. Reaching out. Calling to check on distant relatives and the same holds true for the few “relationships” I have with guys I know. I resolved years ago that I wouldn’t do it any longer. Every relationship needs reciprocity in order to work well and I haven’t gotten that. 

I recently moved to a new city and thought I honestly had some budding friendships brewing. One guy was really into music and creating music just like me. We can collaborated on a song and talked about doing more music together.  Not long after that we were texting about some songs he had done. That was the last I’ve heard from him. As I’ve said I’m always the one reaching out so I’ve been waiting to see if he’d initiate a new convo. He didn’t. 

The other guy I had already known for about a year and we actually met up and went out with his other homies one night. He even has a friend that lives in the same complex I do! I thought surely we’ll be kicking it all the time. NOPE!

I have a guy who I’ve known for years. We met on the job and became, what I would consider, friends. Really cool, sharing advice (mostly him giving me advice) talking about our wives, the job etc. We talk about once a month. But whenever I suggested we hang out, double date etc. it was always like “rain check speak” (Man, we gonna get together bro.” “You gotta move up here so we can hang!”) It seem like I was required to be local(he lives in a town about an hr from where I used to live) which was always perplexing to me because  I commuted to work there everyday lol. I also came there often for date nights and events with my wife and her sister and husband.

I don’t know what it is. I tell my wife all the time to cherish her friends because they practically worship the ground she walks on. Always calling, texting coming out of state to visit etc.

It just seems like whenever there’s potential for a real great friendship it’s nose dives into the ground.",20Feb2020,1

49,"Well the title pretty much says it all- 

I’ve (22M) been going out with a girl (22F) for a few weeks, and I’ll be honest it’s been great. She’s incredibly pretty, nice, kind, and we overall just have a great chemistry. I could definitely see myself in a dating relationship with her in the near future. I’m intentionally taking things a little slow, as I’ve only known her for about 2.5 weeks. 

That being said, a few days ago she told me something kinda shocking: she used to have a sugar daddy. An older guy, in his 60s. At first she said they were just going to dinner, but that turned into sex. She told me she slept with him twice and realized the situation was weird, and stopped. 

I try my best to not judge, and just enjoy someone in the present, and so when she told me I was super chill about it, and told her I understand, especially as she was in a financial bind at the time. 


However, I just learned a few days ago that she’s going on a trip with this dude to San Francisco this upcoming weekend. She reassured to me that there’s nothing between them anymore, and that he also knows about me. But I’ll be honest, the whole thing still feels very very weird, and it makes me uncomfortable that she’s going on this trip. 

I don’t want to overstep any boundaries as I’m not her official boyfriend yet, but we’ve talked how we want to be exclusive, and be in a committed relationship soon. So what do I do? Do I tell her how I feel about it? Would that be out of line?

I feel like a huge dumbass for not being concerned about this earlier

50,"My productivity in all aspects of my life: social, education, professional, etc, has been deteriorating over the last few months. I’m struggling with a lot of unknown emotions that are brewing in me and causing me a lot of stress. 

I cannot do things anymore. Simple things. I haven’t been able to do homework, to go to lessons, I haven’t been able to watch my favourite show or good movies I want to watch. I haven’t been able to paint and draw like I’ve always loved, I’m struggling with reading books, I can’t seem to change my sheets or tidy my room. Sometimes I can’t even be bothered to charge my phone so I let it die in my hands despite the charger being plugged in and ready merely an arms lengths away.

What is wrong? I can’t find the energy to do anything, but my chest is overwhelmed with stress and some heavy emotions that I can’t distinguish. I’ve given up all my hobbies, I’ve ridden of all my friends, I’ve sacrificed my eating habits and the diet that I was supposed to be on, I haven’t been to the gym in months but I’m still paying for it. It feels like I’m waiting for everything to end, every little task and chore that I’m forced to do (at work, or school, or due to a very angry parent) and feel no satisfaction upon completion. I’ve been making daily to-do lists and haven’t been even looking at them, and then once I do I break down because I haven’t done anything and know I won’t. 

I have exams coming up. I was supposed to send in an video audition to my dream university a week ago and I still haven’t even filmed it. I want to burst with anxiety every time I think about it. I find it hard to celebrate big successes, and even harder to celebrate smaller, more pathetic ones even though I know it could help me. I’m constantly distracted, and yet always too bored. 

I’ve been to counselling for eight weeks and it took me six to admit the trauma of having alcoholic parents, something which you’d think I’d mention in the first appointment, but I didn’t. It didn’t help.

I’m ruining my own life, I’m watching it happen. I don’t see a point, I don’t feel any rewarding feeling, I’m constantly cursed with a whirlwind of emotion in the centre of my chest. I was once so good, so active, so healthy, so productive, so smart. I feel a tenth of that now, if at all. 

Three of my teachers have noticed a change in me, had meetings between themselves, then with me, and then with my mum and all strongly recommended a psychologist of sorts. I haven’t even looked at any. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for, maybe a diagnosis that I can blame being lazy on, even though I know it’s just me. Am I looking for advice? Relatability? A connection with someone? Someone to vent to? Maybe psychologist recommendations (East Midlands, UK, btw)? I don’t know why I’m putting this here.  I apologise for taking up space.",20Feb2020,1
51,"My husband and I have been married for 34 years, and for the last 10, he has been addicted to IMVU. Porn has always been an issue since we met, and it continued into the game with a lot of sexual content.

He has played this game in front of our young daughter as well as looking at porn in front of her. He writes very sexually explicit conversations to other women on the game and I have asked him for years to stop and explained how much this has broken me and hurt me and he always swears that he will stop. But he always goes back on. 

He has anger outbursts when approached with the situation, he constantly lies about it to the point where I am so paranoid. I’ve worked to hard to be the perfect wife, but I feel like I’ve been replaced by this game. 

Any advice?",20Feb2020,1
52,"I'm writing this at half 12, so I might not be able to reply until I wake up again in the morning, but I seriously dont know what to do anymore.

For a little background, I failed college about 2 weeks ago, so I decided to try and get an apprenticeship in what I want to do, and I've recieved an interview for the morning in the local area, my dad tried to help me by asking questions, however, I'm stressed about it, so I didnt want to talk about it, he assumed I was just being lazy and to 'get my thumb out my ass', and how I'm not normal, my mum and dad started to argue, and that's when I lost it.

I hate it when people shout and argue, it causes me to cry and run from the situation, (which has caused me to attempt to climb out a window and run out the house a couple of times) to which my dad then tried to get closer to me, but when I'm upset I want to be left alone, which I said many times, I screamed and tried to get as much distance away from him, he then eventually left me alone to go argue about me to my mum, saying he was 'scared of me', 'she doesn't act normal' as well as referring me as 'sick' (one of my sisters is sick, but the throwing up kind, so he said 'we've got one whose sick, one who might me sick and that one who IS sick).

My mum then came into my room to calm me down because everytime my dad tried talking to my the crying got worse, but I kept shaking uncontrollably while she was with me, and when she left I was alone for a while so I could calm down; didnt last long because me dad was playing the victim card when he spoke to me, asking if he failed as a father, would I care if he died tomorrow as well as if I loved him, I nearly said something along the lines of 'if you love me like you say you do, you would actually listen to me'.

After my interview tomorrow, I'm going to have to talk about potential counselling with my mum, and then I've got a date thing, but I might ask if I can cancel because all I want to do is calm myself down properly.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and sorry if I worded anything wrong or I dont make sense, or anything of the sort.",20Feb2020,1
54,"i worked in the hospitality industry most of my life and got pretty far up.
If i would like to, i could just have a job, get decent money, settle and feed all the kids I don't want to have (now).

i studied and graduated in languages. I did that keeping in mind i need a fall back plan. I taught refugees and immigrants mostly and went into the NGO thing. 
I could go further and do the full NGO job, earn decent money, settle and feed all the kids i don't want to have (now).

at some point in my mid 20ies i got told i should make an exhibition. I always made paintings and did draw stuff but i never considered it as a profession because i come from a pretty poor workers family.

my family never supported me when it came to art. they suggested technical and economy schools, which i did and graduated. Art is not in our family, so i am the first to go this way. They always suggested professions so i have monthly money and can settle with a wife and kids.

while i was studying i met artists, curators and the head of the art college of the town i was in.
we became friends and i invited them over. I have all my stuff in my apartment so they saw it. they said, all of them: make an exhibition, you can do it.

they can't help much until i don't do the regular way: get cash, pay the fees and paint. that's like 20k up-front. painting takes time, so you need an apartment too and food, so it adds up to 40k.
i don't have that. i spent it all on traveling, which keeps me sane.

in an accident the house i inherited burnt to the grounds. i was insured luckily. i can rebuild it with dept and i want my mum to have a place to live in. she pays rent now and is in her late 50ies. it's my mum, so u know why.
btw most paintings i did got burned that night.

if i rebuild the house, the insurance money will be gone. as I don't want to depend on people i am down to zero. 
i work. but getting 40k and still live is like 5 years working straight.

if i would do that, i would be like almost 40 just having my first exhibition.
I know that it would be kind of ok age wise, but i wouldn't be able to support nor myself nor anybody.

i can can go back to teach and hospitality but it just isn't what i want to do. at the same time i am torn what to do next.

i could use some of the insurance money to built uo the art career, but no secure success there and it might be lost.
or i just go and work for the 40k and be 5 years older.

it isn't so much about Money. i can deal with that. i can be quietly working and do paint on the side.
but what if i risk it? should i?",20Feb2020,1

59,"I am on mobile and this is a throwaway because, although I am aware I shouldn't, I feel an extreme amount of shame about my urinary incontinence. I apologize if this is long, but I want this to be completely in context to get the appropriate advice.
I was in a serious car accident in the summer of 2019 that has caused a myriad of health problems. I have been out of work since due to injuries. I also live with my partner (26M), his brother(23M), and his parents (65F &amp; 67M). We pay rent and live in a separate attached ""apartment"". We do not have a bathroom, sink/running water, or kitchen attached to the space we rent, so we have to go into the main house for those things, as well as use their washer and dryer. Now due to the injuries I sustained in my car accident, I have had to have 2 surgeries at this point just trying to get back to functioning. When I woke up from my first surgery, I woke up with urinary incontinence. I am told this is incredibly rare but it happens and I am still working on finding a reason/solution. As you can imagine, it is very hard to be in your early 20's and all of a sudden you pee yourself to some extent everyday. It took it a few times of completely soaking myself before I broke down and started purchasing products to make sure I wasn't in that position again, especially in public. If you don't know, incontinence products are incredibly expensive, and due to me not being able to work since the summer, this is not an expense my partner and I can manage. So I started looking into a cheaper alternative. I came across adult cloth diapers and saw that investing in those were about equivalent of getting a whole case of disposables. Easy decision, right? So I purchased those hoping to keep my pants dry and not hemorrhage money as badly as we were. So I would wait until after my in laws went to bed to avoid the shame and embarrassment I felt about even having to own such products, and I would wash them then (or my partner when I am incapable of doing stairs). It works for a couple weeks and I finally start to feel like I have this stuff under control. Then one time I left the bag that holds the wet things upstairs in the laundry room while the reusables were washing, and my MIL got up in the middle of the cycle. I didn't think she noticed anything until the next day when my MIL says something to the affect of ""If your cat pees on something, you throw it away, NOT put it in the washing machine."" This confused me personally as A) I had never noticed a lingering scent in the washing machine and B) I am not financially in a position where if our cat HAD peed on something (which she has never done) I could just throw it out instead of trying to salvage it. But that is beside the point. Even if I had not been washing the reusable products, I was having to wash my clothes when I did wet myself, so it would have been necessary either way for urine to end up in there. When she said this, I had absolutely no idea what to do. Either I don't wash the reusables and wet my clothes, or I wash the reusable and don't wet my clothes. We absolutely can not afford disposables as we barely know where our food is coming from at this point. So I continued washing them after they went to bed, but started to stick my entire head in the washer to check for any sign of a scent. Every time it had no sign of a scent. There were a couple times I ran a vinegar cycle just to be sure. We went a couple months without any other word about it, up until today. I recently had my second surgery and am wheelchair bound. Due to this I am incapable of going upstairs and washing things myself, so my partner went up last night to wash it. I have not been able to afford a wet bag, so I had been using a heavy duty plastic bag for that purpose. He had not been fully aware of this, so he threw the bag away in the laundry trash can after dumping the products into the washer. Now today she has sent us a text saying ""Please do not wash clothes in this washer that the cat peed on. I have to do a double sanitary wash to get the smell out and that doesn't always work."" This has left me a wreck because I truly have no idea what to do. I don't know if it is truly causing a smell in the washer, or if it was the bag that was present both times she said something to us. I feel backed into a corner and feel as though the only option now is to tell her about my urinary incontinence. I don't want to use her machine in a way that makes her uncomfortable, but I also have no other way to wash things. The problem is, I don't trust my MIL at all. She has already gossiped to their whole family about previous things she was aware of about me (or made up or twisted about me) and I have no doubt she would do so with this. She is not a kind or compassionate person by any means, and no one who knows her, including her husband, would ever say she is. But I don't think there is any other way. I literally can't stop wetting myself, so I can't stop having to wash things that have urine on them. And if I were to live as she wants, I would have to throw out basically all of my clothing because I will continue to wet it. She and her husband come from money and neither seem to comprehend what being poor means or that we can't just replace anything anytime and this has been a problem already in the past. She has thrown things of ours away because it was broken or damaged in some way without a word to us or replacing the thing she is taking. So trying to explain that I purely can't afford any other option will not mean anything to her. I feel as though I have no choice but to tell her what's going on and every time I think about it I start crying because it scares me so much. I have struggled to even tell all my health professionals about the incontinence, let alone telling someone I know will judge me and use it against me. If anyone has any advice, I am desperate.

TLDR: I have sudden onset incontinence after a severe car accident, cannot afford anything but a reusable cloth adult diaper due to being out of work since accident, and now MIL is saying absolutely no urine in the washing machine thinking it's our cat's pee and not knowing my situation, even though I have ensured there was no smell.",20Feb2020,1
62,Does anyone have advice on how to ask a girl out. She’s one of my close friends and I don’t want to ruin the friendship keep that in mind.,20Feb2020,1
63,"So. Im 19M, She’s 17. I’m in college, she’s still in high school. I already have no freedom to run my own life, I’m living at home because they’re lending me a car to drive to school and residence at my college sucks. They sort of say i can make my own decisions but i really cant become of how they are plus my current situation.

I met this girl a week ago. She seems ridiculously respectful and nice, and we’re happy to be together. My parents just finished giving me a huge lecture and audibly sighing walking around the house and speaking in a stressed out tone when i told them the age difference.

They say she can ruin my life with an accusation of rape because I’m two years older and she isn’t 18. The age of consent here in canada allows me to date and have sexual relations with a 15 or 16 year old as long as they do consent. 

My parents basically said we should only be friends, and take it so slow it’s basically not a real relationship. They said she will likely use me for my car, use me to brag to her friends, use the age gap to accuse me of things and get away with it.

I really really need help because this girl isn’t insane, and she’s actually really mature. My parents don’t care and think it’s like the worst thing to happen yet. Wtf do i do because i have no freedom, no way to move out, am in school full time, and they’re super on my ass.",20Feb2020,1
64,"A friend of mine struggles with severe depression and anxiety. Long story short, they won't do anything about it and are coming to me often with problems. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind at all, I have a lot of the same issues and I want to help them work through it. Yesterday they told me they wanted to die, but they clarified they didn't mean literally. This friend has had serious suicidal thoughts before, however, and not long ago I took them to a hospital. In the end they didn't check in to the mental health facility. This really messed with me. My own anxiety and depression skyrocketed, couldn't sleep right, nightmares for months. I have a lot of trauma surrounding the concept of suicide, a family member of mine died that way and several family members/ friends have fought with attempts and thoughts. I'm trying very hard to get my own shit together and this is getting to be too much. I think I need to talk about setting up some boundaries with this person for my own safety/health but I have zero idea how to do it. I hate the thought of potentially making them feel like I don't care for them, but I can't spend every waking moment wondering if they're safe (which, granted, is a personal problem- but it's hard when someone is coming to you having breakdowns and/ or worrying they're going to hurt themselves so often).

Asking them to try different methods of dealing with these issues is useless, they have no coping skills/ stress relieving activities, won't see a therapist, will not try medicine with any regularity. I've tried for years, none of that is happening. I feel like I'm becoming their therapist and I know I cannot help this person in the way they need. So, how do I explain this in a kind way? My friends have always viewed me as a person they can come to with anything, which is true, but I can only do so much. It might be kind of a shock when I tell them I need to take a step back.

67,"I'll preface this by saying a few things. First, I'm using a throwaway account because I know a few people on reddit, and don't want this coming to their attention (numerous reasons but we'll skip over that). I also don't know exactly what kind of advice I'm looking for in response to this post, but anything and everything will be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if it gets pretty long too.

So, to start off. Not to sound cocky or anything, but I'm normally the one giving advice, so it feels a bit odd asking for it, especially the internet and about things of this kind of nature. I therefore apologise if my question isn't so clear. Proceeding though, here's some background for you - I think it probably will help. Back in June/July of last year, I made friends with someone over Instagram. It was a case of just being a friendly person, helping someone out. Which led to us getting talking, making a connection and therefore becoming friends. Things progressed - as they do. At one point, I then realised that we'd spoken to eachother pretty much every day for a solid 4 months or so. She also admitted to me at one point that she had a crush on me. But we couldn't do anything about that, mainly because she's in CST of the US, and I'm UK based. She had just ended a pretty toxic relationship before this, which I had been helping her through. One of my friends stupidly tried to get involved too, by telling her I was into her, right around the time of the breakup. None of this affected our friendship whatsoever though. We continued talking as normal for a decent while after these events. We also both said we were eachother's best friends at some point. So I guess you could say we Friend Zoned eachother (if you believe it exists, I wouldn't say it does entirely). I should also mention that I'm a very helping and loving person. And whenever possible, I like to praise people and tell them how much they mean to me and how much I appreciate them etc. It's just what I do. She'd never objected to any of this either. We've also been supportive of eachother throughout the entirety of our friendship.

Now. A few months ago, I start noticing things dropping off. Our conversations slowly start dropping down to majority of the week, then half the week etc. Life moves on. I get it. But we're still really good friends. I was fine/happy with how things stood between us. Move to about 2 months or so ago now, and I feel like something is up. I'm getting lackluster responses, if I even do get a reply. The ratio was maybe 5 messages on my part trying to initiate conversation, to her 1 reply. So I ask her for no BS, full honesty, is there something wrong? We have a conversation about things. Basic jist she comes out with, is that; I'm too much for her; I'm too cringey and give her too much praise (I can get that on some level); she'd become kinda scared of me (in helping her through her toxic relationship, I made a few harmless jokes of having her ex ""sorted out"") and she believed I had a dark side to me so didn't want to come to me with her frustrations about me in fear I'd do something; I talked too much and our conversation types weren't very compatible because she preferred multiple short brief conversations as opposed to long lasting ones etc. None of these had seemed like issues to me or that they were causing issues with her whatsoever during our friendship. But she also said that she didn't want to come to me with these issues, because I was her best friend and she loved me and felt that if she came directly at me with these frustrations, I'd get angry at her and would flip out - potentially ruining our friendship. This coming from her fear of a non-existent dark side she believed I had/have. She then says ""and I have a bf now too"". I get that she's been focusing more on her relationship, than our friendship. Which, btw, I'm completely fine with and I'm happy for her - I've never particularly wanted anything beyond our friendship so there's no point saying I'm just being desperate and thirsty. Even so however, I was kinda hurt as we were supposed to be best friends, but she was only just then telling me about all of this. Leaving everything to build up to this point, and after she'd been with this guy about 2 or 3 weeks. It hurt as I felt we could talk to eachother about anything and everything, I'd known nothing of this guy's existence, and I had to find out all of it like this. Anyways. We talk things over, and we agree to give eachother a bit room to calm down and work things out etc. I said I'd let her be the one to send the first message when she was ready to pick things up. That came and things were ok for a bit. Since then though, she broke up with that guy, and our conversations have drastically decreased in quantity and quality. I get maybe two very brief conversations out of her a week, and I can be waiting on a reply for days on end. She still says I'm (one of) her best friend(s), but yet I barely get anything from her? She posted a number of things recently about a crush she has, and how she's trying to ghost him so that her feelings don't build too much (I think she mentioned a distance issue), but it's pretty hard to do. ""I don't know how to ghost someone?"". ""How do I ghost my crush!?"". Meanwhile I'm left thinking ""Just do the same as you're doing to me, 'cause you've pretty much been ignoring me for 6 days at a time, then just offering as little conversation as possible when we do talk"". I've also had a few really low points recently, and when I tried talking to her, I've gotten nothing. I'm still waiting for her to even read that I tried talking to her through my last one. Despite all those times we were there for eachother through in the past, it feels like she's had enough of being there for me.

So I really don't know what to do guys. I really treasure our friendship. She is one of my best friends. But lately I feel like it's been almost entirely one sided. If I try and bring up conversation, I'm mostly met by silence. And if I was to try things like I used to, and just keep messaging in hopes she reads something, I may get a reply; but it'd also be exactly the thing that she said she doesn't like. On the other hand, if I literally do nothing and don't message, I feel I can pretty much guarantee that she won't be the one to initiate any conversation. I know she's got a bunch of other friends and she once said it's kinda hard trying to balance everyone. But I feel like I've just been swept almost completely aside from everyone else. I feel like I'm Woody in the scene in Toy Story 2 where Andy says ""Oh. I forgot. You're broken. I don't wanna play with you anymore..."" and drops him. Like I said before, I get that life moves on. I get that people grow apart. But in this particular incidence I'm just confused and a bit frustrated at how I can supposedly remain her best friend, and her conversation is like there's nothing wrong, yet I feel I'm a side character that is overlooked until/unless it conveniences her, or she's finished with the main characters. I don't want our friendship to end, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't either because she's said multiple times about not letting anything come between us and that she'd never give up on us. However, I don't know if I can cope with things going on as is. It's like a cartoon where they wave a carrot on a stick infront of a donkey and it chases after it. Then it gets worn out and gives up, but then the carrot's waved infront again and we're off chasing again. The donkey being me and the carrot being our friendship.

So yeah. I really don't know what to do. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. And before you say anything along these lines, again, no I'm not just thirsty af for a relationship. I don't want anything like that with her. And I'm not desperate for anything. If I was, I'd be ""crying"" to her, begging for things to change. I just want to try and work out the best way of moving forwards. Whether that be by moving on, or working out how to ""fix"" how things stand. I apologise for the length of this and thank those who read through it all",20Feb2020,1

73,"     Long story short, my Dad wants to leave again. This time, he seems dead-set on it.

     If you want the long story, my dad has been wanting to leave on and off for months. It all started one night when my mom just disappeared while I and my brother were at a football game, stranding us there for an hour before our Dad arrived. Apparently, she had wandered off in her drunkenness with sone guy. I won't get into that. 
     The primary thing I want to rant about is tonight. She went off to the bar, which she does constantly, despite our please for her to stop and got so drunk, she passed out. My Dad happened to be driving home from work early to spend time with us (he works 12 hour days and doesn't often get to) but instead came home only to be immediately be called by my Mom's cousin who told him what happened. He took her home and they got in a big argument. My Mom said she wants a divorce. He said he's now certain he'll move out.
    That isn't the most worrying part. He said we're going to sell both of our houses and he doesn't know what's next. I really want to interfere, but how can I convince him out of his plans if he hasn't thought them out. I can't use the ""it's just a temporary impulse. You'll come to your senses"" argument.

She's actually kind of evil, though the only way I can describe her doesn't make it seem that bad. She's one of those people who would say ""Okay, sweetie,"" but in the way that would make you want to run for the hills. She always is smiling, but in the way that shows ""Hello, welcome to hell."" I can kind of use wolfish for that sometimes, but I need an adjective or something that describes the fake niceness.

My dream job is to be a lore/world-building writer in whatever prospect. I love philosophy, fantasy, music, film, comedy, and practically anything that has to do with life and human connection on a broader scale, and I've been praised by my writing professors for my creativity and writing skills.

i was at a friends party about 3 weeks ago. I got fairly drunk but not to the point where i didn’t know what i was doing. My boyfriend who i have been with for just over a year and a half was there for a small amount of time but left after not long. Me, my friend (girl) and other friend (boy) were all lay in the spare bed of my friends house. People were coming in and out of the room/bed it wasn’t just us the the whole time. Both the girl and boy were kindof hugging/cuddling me (at the same time). I see this boy as a brother to me i have never been attracted to him or thought of him as anything but a friend, he is best friends with all my girl friends and doesn’t see me as anything more than one of his good friends. We all ended up staying up chatting until around 5:30am when my friend (girl) fell asleep and it was just me and him now cuddling as she has turned over we stayed like this for around 15 minutes until he fell asleep then i moved and was sort of spooning my friend (girl) just because the bed was so cramped. I said to my boyfriend a few days later that they both were laying on me and i felt i needed to tell him because he wasn’t a girl to which he was slightly annoyed but fine with me after around two days. But i can’t stop feeling guilty because at a point it wasn’t all three of us cuddling. The friend (girl) never left the bed while it was just me and him but i can’t forgive myself as i feel like i’ve done something awful.

90,"To start with, I'm 16, almost 17 and have lived with my mother since I was born. To provide some backstory, my mother has been emotionally and verbally abusive since I was around 10 after my brother moved out and I became the punching bag. To be honest I didn't even realize she was abusive until recently after certain things came to light, something I'm not going to get into. Recently she has become even more volatile and has started explicitly stating how much she hates me, where as before she just threw subtle barbs at me. I've been wanting to move out since I was 14 in all honesty, but I can't actually survive on my own at the moment purely because I can't drive yet and I don't have a job. I have a guaranteed job next year involving a school program luckily, but the pay isn't great and it's only about 5 hours a week. I'm hoping to get a job for the weekends and weekdays on the afternoons hopefully, but most people don't want to hire a teenager.

However, my mother has been threatening me with kicked me out for several months now and has officially stated just recently that I am no longer welcome anywhere near her after I turn 18. So. I need advice on how to start preparing for moving out. My brother promised me a place to stay if (When) my mother kicked me out, but he's going to be pretty much renting out her house for the next couple of years and my mother explicitly stated she doesn't want me to be in that house ever again. I don't my brother to be forcibly kicked out of the house that he's been excited to stay in for awhile now and just... I love him and want the best for him. Worst case scenario I have to stay with a friend for awhile, which I don't want to do since I feel like I would be intruding. Another problem that crops us is the fact that I want to bring my cat along. I refuse to leave him alone with my mother. I know damn well that she would only hurt him and he doesn't deserve it.

My main concern at the moment is what items I would be taking since I know my mother is going to want most of them, if not all of it, along with how to move them. If I do stay with my brother, I will need to go out of state. I have a year and 3 months to prepare for the inevitable. What's the best course of action?",20Feb2020,1

97,"So heres the long story short;

I started talking to this guy last semester pretty soon after a break up I went through and I went into it knowing I really only wanted a friends with benefits type situation. I got that with him but things would sometimes get weird and there were times where it seemed like he was catching feelings and then he'd go cold for a little while but then always eventually come back.

This guy has ghosted me a good few times and so ultimately, the last time I hooked up with him I asked him what was up and we had a pretty honest conversation. He said that he liked me but he didn't really want a relationship right now and that he also stopped talking to me a few times because he thought I didn't like him (which I will admit I did do a little flip flopping too.)

Ultimately, I asked him if all he wanted to do was hook up and he said, ""I don't really just want to hookup but I don't really want a relationship either.""

However, heres the kicker. I've kind of gotten to the point where I would be fine with just hooking up for now again and doing the whole friends with benefits type thing. Over the past few months i've had some bad experiences with guys and i'm honestly tired of trying for somethings serious right now. It's not that I explicitly don't want a relationship but I also am not really on the prowl to find one currently. I like this guy and honestly just like hooking up with him so is this bad for me to do?

I am also thinking about taking this year off to really focus on finding myself and become more independent. My friends would all like to rent a house and I think it would be a good learning experience. If I were to take a year off, I would spend the time working full time while volunteering in fields I am interested in in order to see if I actually enjoy it before committing to a program. I also would plan to travel because I have never left North America and would like to gain some life experience.
My biggest dilemma is that I dont want to fall behind and delay my career by a year because with the way the programs are designed,  I can get a job right out of school (which would be fantastic to establish myself so young). But at the same time, I'm also young enough to slow the pace down a bit and not rush. I'm just not sure what the best option would be. 
Some friends are saying take a year off to explore and learn about yourself and save money. Some are saying grind out the last year and start your career.

101," My 6 year old daughter is in Kindergarten. She does absolutely AMAZING  in school. Shes actually ahead of all the students, is on top of  reading, has earned multiple awards for being so far ahead with school  work etc. She behaves like a perfect angel. Shes been this way since day  1. BUT as soon as school is out she turns in to devil himself. I don't  mean to sound horrible but holy shit. She fights with her dad and I, she  yells at us, doesn't listen, wont do anything we ask. She screams at us  if she doesn't get her way even if its a SUPER small thing.. she just  goes crazy! She pushes us, throws things on the floor, smacks us etc. WE  have tried multiple ways to punish her and she just doesn't stop.

103,"A bit of backstory: I am currently in my fourth year and set to graduate in June. Growing up my family used to be really poor (we are better off now) so I guess I've always had anxiety about being ""safe"" as far as having a roof over my head/being financially okay. My major is Psychology, which I understand is very impacted but it is something I am honestly very passionate about (tried doing other things like business/economics but I just was not happy). I have about a year and a half experience working at an elementary school and working with children who had learning/behavioral disabilities. I then started working at my school's Registrar's office where I've been for about 3 years now. 

I just submitted my graduation application today, and I think it just hit me with the reality that my life is going to change a lot. As of right now it seems I'm going to be moving back with my parents, and will be doing training in hopes of getting full-time at a counseling/crisis call center. To anyone else this seems fine, however living with my parents was very toxic for me (they constantly fight and bicker) and it was one of the main reasons why I left to go to college. They're only about an hour or two away, but being away from them I feel was essential to my mental health. Financial aid has been a big help for my tuition/living expenses, so once I graduate I can't really afford to live on my own right away. I only have about $1,000 saved up, and it seems like going back is my only option. (I am in the LA area so rent is super expensive). In addition, I don't have my driver's license yet. It's something I'm really ashamed of, but driving has always given me extreme anxiety. I hope to have my license by the time I graduate, I am currently still practicing and somewhat getting the hang of it. I know this is essential. 

I'm pretty much terrified of what is to come. I feel lost, scared, and ashamed for moving back with my parents, I feel like I should have my shit together, you know? I know I am lucky to have plan career wise as far as the training I have set up, but I am still really scared. Basically, these are the questions that keep me up at night: What if I hate it? What if I end up doing horribly? What if I end up hating it, doing horribly, and end up not finding anything else other than a minimum wage job? What if I regret going back with my parents? Will my student loan debt be too overwhelming? What if I end up just failing? How the hell am I going to do it? 

I don't necessarily want answers to all those questions lol, but any advice, maybe a personal account of what you did after college would be extremely helpful. Even just some encouraging words would really help. I just feel really alone, as most of my friends come from well-off families who have everything planned for them, and I just feel kinda useless at the moment. Thank you !!!!",20Feb2020,1

Well, we were skipping church last sunday and making out in the back of her car and she tells me that she doesn't want to go any further. Which is fine, no means no. I wasnt pressuring her or anything at all but asked if she was alright. She said its best i didnt know. Today, she told me. Idk if it was out of guilt or what. 




What she said happened with the guy: 




She is 18. He is 28. Im 17. She told me she think theres no issue with big age gaps. This is obviously coming from her mom.( Her mom is 42 just got married to a 26 yo guy in the army). Since i live near base, theres a lot of young army guys around. Her new step dads friend, after our breakup, (28M), took her out and according to her tried to have sex multiple times. To which she replied with oral and other types of sex but never the full deal. She said this happened for about a month, and that the reason she didnt want to go any further in the car was because she didnt like how he did it. Keep in mind she is a virgin. Never done anything sexual before, except for make out a few times here and there. I trust she wont cheat on me, and i know she doesnt lie. But it pisses me off that her mother encouraged my gf to date her 28 yo army friend. It also pisses me off that she even did in the first place. She doesn't know im mad, i mad the excuse that im cooking and have work to do. Am i in the wrong to be angry? Is big age gaps like that really socially ok? How should i go about fixing it?




Another thing to note:




More of a confession i didnt realize till i typed everything else out. I dont like being with her. Shes great and ill always love and respect her, but now that i realize, she is moving to texas soon. Im moving to NYC soon. She is more of a country girl, im more the metal head punk. Theres nothing that we really both like together, theres not a whole lot that we really talk about too. I think im wasting my time. I honestly dont know where to go from here and it honestly makes me really scared.",20Feb2020,1

The person hiring for the role who would interview him left work early the day of the interview (so the first one didn't happen). The guy wasn't there the next 2 days, then the 3rd day my friend was informed that they hired someone externally to fill the role so they could ""fill it quickly."" 

Obviously the lack of communication, leaving before the interview, etc. is frustrating but what's a reasonable way for him to proceed. 

I imagine he should speak with his own manager about the situation, express that he had interest in the roll and that he's disappointed in the way it turned out, and see if there are any similar opportunities for him in the future (and also ask if there was a reason they didn't interview him). 
Does anyone have any other advice, next steps, apart from just: those guys are jerks, just quit. 

Sounds to me like they maybe had been interviewing externally before offering him and interview and just found what could be a good candidate, it might not have been negative intentions.",20Feb2020,1

However, the wedding is at 11am, at which I am a Groomsman, and accommodation was booked for that night at the hotel way back in July 2019. The wedding has been booked for over a year and I’ve only been working at the bar since September 2019, but I’m totally at a loss for how to approach asking my line manager. I’m worried that he could reject it, and I’m also to worried about calling in sick instead as I’m on 12 month probation.

To add to my worries, I’ve also been informed by my university that my prom/formal is on March 26, which I’m also contractually obliged to work for a Northern Ireland Football fixture.

129,"Not enough details....but I still hold out hope...because...Love. I think I'm losing my mind. Long story short... I work full time. Have four kids... Two are his. I own my own home and pay all expenses without him. He has his own place..and living expenses. Besides half of daycare... He contributes almost nothing to his kids lives....except an occasional gallon of milk, or loaf of bread.
We fight with the meanest of words possible 95percent of our communication..He participates (and often starts the conflict) and blames it ALL on me.... As if he's the sole victim. He's brutal.... Calls me every possible insult he can think of....my reactions are no better. 
Besides our weekly marriage therapy... Where our therapist had warned him he's losing me and said, ""what ate you going to do to prevent that?""...to him....He won't communicate face to face and makes me text or email as our primary source of communication. He has opened Tinder and other dating accounts in the past year. He has eluded to being bisexual ..and suggested there is someone else (then retracted that info).

He seems to hate all women in general... But he objectifies those with big asses - one of his kinks..and versions of porn he collects. He also has talked about desiring to give oral to a man... So theres that....he may be gay...  Fully.... Who knows 

He had to move out over a year ago bc of the effect on the kids seeing the abuse he was doling out..neglect, emotional abuse, absent from almost everything..thus he didnt financially contribute to his kids at all..... Says he can't afford it..cuz of his apartment... yet he buys Starbucks, often twice a day, buys a pack of smokes every day, and frequently buys his lunch from a vending machine at work Recently he has purchased 700$ speakers and a receiver... In the past year a new $1000 TV, Two new guitars..about 1300$, several fancy pocket knives, a vive pro, a new tiny yet sporty Ford Focus - even though he has two kids in car seats..and together we have four...and we'd never all.fit into that tiny little car.   He has pushed me so hard I was hurt and called the police, smushed my eight year olds head in anger - twice bc ""She's difficult"" ....and much more.  He's addicted to his phone, porn, suboxone, and adderall. He has seemingly made every possible move to show me how he wants this to end without actually cutting me loose. With the most recent including:

Abandoning me to take care of four kids alone for most of 2020. 

Not showing up at my house to take the 2 little ones to daycare cuz he overslept ...causing me to be late for work.  (This is his only responsibikty to his kids besides paying every other daycare payment.)

Refusing to commit to a two week ahead schedule so I can go to my own appointments without a 2 and 3 year old.

Not paying daycare on time.

Refusing to talk in person...only texting.

Lying about putting his hands on my kid.

Denying his frivolous purchases...and telling me he cant afford to buy milk when I ask him to bring some over.

Leaving me to cope with my pain while not helping at all with our kids.

While I type this it is so clear what a loser deadbeat he is.

How the hell do I get on with my life with all these kids, all this pain,  and all the while being held hostage by this jerk?

 I'm so heartbroken. I can't believe how much i have let this man use and abuse me.

My heart is so broken. What do I do?  How do I get through this all this pain and work, parent, and survive....  alone.  While losing someone I love and I thought loved me!!??

I understand that he has a busy life, however, it would be ridiculous to put this in my resume that I was a dental intern for him but never really gained any experience.

He says he needs me and expects me to come to work more often just because he wants me to finish whatever he is too lazy to do himself.

132,"I've recently come to terms as being bisexual, and have found dating girls to quite difficult. I started college in September, and quickly made friends with a girl. We get on really well and spent a lot of time together last semester. I only ever saw her as a friend and never thought any more of it until she liked me on tinder. I chose to ignore this as maybe being friendly, however, when I spoke to mutual friends over the holidays I got told she liked me. When coming back to college, everything was normal, but on a night out we were both pretty drunk and she spent all night being endearing expressing how much she thinks of me, and one thing leads to another and we kissed. The next day she said sorry she was really drunk, i didn't want her to think I wasn't interested so i said we should do something again soon, which she ignored. Everything got weird after we kissed she acts strange, I've seen her in group gatherings and she seems more distant, but then when she invited me out with her roommates on a night out on valentines day, and when i asked if i could bring my roommates she ignored me and when I saw her out she acted really off. I've seen her numerous times since then but she's very hit and miss with how she acts. I'm really struggling to understand it, our mutual friends (her roommates) always use to make comments about us being together but has stopped since we kissed. I feel like there's something going on which I'm not being told about. She's my friend above everything but I don't know how to approach it.

137,"Backstory: I’m 26M and I recently returned to school to get my master’s though first I have to get some undergrad courses out of the way. One of my current classes is very difficult and you’re encouraged to study with others. A classmate 20F actually started being really friendly to me, something I’m not used to, and we’ve been studying together for the past few weeks.

Yes, I do have a crush on her. Yes, she does have a boyfriend. No, I am not planning any sort of overcomplicated break them up shenanigans. She seems happy and while it makes a bit sad, she’s a friend and it’s nice to see her enjoying herself.

So we’ve been at this for a while. We’re friendly and get along. Last week on Friday, after a long study session and dealing with the aftermath of our exam, I gave her a little thank you present because she had been so massively helpful to me. It was nothing big, a two dollar pack of mints of the type she’s always snacking on that I picked up on impulse at the gas station. She was worried when I said I got something for her, but immediately lightened up and took them when she saw that was all it was. She took them, we joked a bit, then went out separate ways.

Flash forward to today. She’s seemed a bit on edge this week, at least when I saw her. She had an exam and is generally a hard working person, so I didn’t think much about it. Then came time to study. We didn’t go to our usual spot, but to a different place. A place near her friends. And while we studied, she would regularly talk to one of her friends. Other than being kind of rude and triggering a bit of old anxiety, it made me wonder. I then realized that a single guy giving any sort of snack to a girl on Valentine’s Day would probably come off as weird. Great timing, me. And then I started to worry. What if this wasn’t because of wanting to be with her friend? What if I had begun making her uncomfortable? Had I been making her feel unsafe around me? Is this a way to try to put distance between us? I know the stereotypes of creepy nerds who don’t take rejection well, so could she be thinking I’m like that?

I guess I really don’t know how to feel right now and I’m worried I did something wrong. Would it be okay to ask her if I crossed a line or am making her uncomfortable? Or might that introduce discomfort into a situation I’m misreading?",20Feb2020,1

140,"Ok so here this one goes.
I’m really struggling at the moment, I’m struggling with an eating disorder and severe depression. These two things have been affecting me severely for the past six months and I’m showing no signs of getting better. 
I’ve had to quit my job this week because I can no longer deal with the pressures of it alongside my university work. I’ve also deleted all of my social media to alleviate the pressure I feel from people knowing about my ED (it’s very noticeable since I lost a lot of weight in a small time frame). This just adds a bit of context to show that I really do feel like I am overwhelmed and in over my head. I am trying to do everything I can to help myself, I’m attending regular counselling sessions and in discussions about starting antidepressants. 

What I’m really here to ask for advice on is about whether I should make a trip to see my best friend? 

I gave the context about because I have cancelled on this friend before because of my mental health, it took a lot for him to accept my cancellation last time because in his view, it’s best for me to go and see him. However, in the end he accepted that it was best for my mental state for me to be given some time to recuperate. We rescheduled me to go and see him in a few months, around when both of our birthdays are and I was ok with these plans until now.

Due to my current state, as described above. I’m feeling very overwhelmed and the thought of travelling four hours to see my friend in itself is very stressful as I suffer from social anxiety. Add to this the fact that my friend hasn’t seen me since I lost all the weight and my ed thoughts spiral out of control. I’m petrified to see him because I think he’ll say something that will upset me or trigger my ed. I also have very bad eating habits that I can’t just click a finger and solve, I fast for weeks at a time and I don’t think travelling and seeing him whilst this is still going on his a good idea.

I feel like I’m making this more complex than it is. But, I’ve already cancelled on him so many times and I value my friendship with him more than anything in the world. I love him like he’s my family, which is important to me because I’m estranged from mine. I know if I say this to him, he’ll probably have a hard time accepting it again and it could potentially tear the friendship up. But I honestly don’t think I can deal with seeing him right now mentally. 

So, do I push through and go and see him or do I cancel?",20Feb2020,1

143,"A few months ago, I found out that the reason why the building managers of my apartment were replaced was because they had gone into the apartment of a recently deceased resident and stole some items. They were never kicked out of the building despite this. I don't know any details beyond that, or if they were charged or not.

Now, my neighbours who are in the process of moving had their apartment broken into by a member of the cleaning staff while they were away. The woman who did this has access to a set of master keys as well as all of the security cameras, at any time they please. Now, this was VERY recent, but it's safe to say that she won't be kicked out either considering the building managers weren't. I don't know what disciplinary actions will be taken, as it'll likely be kept quiet. I don't even know if my neighbours will get their stuff back that was stolen. I literally walked in as she was on the phone dealing with this.

I know the security cameras in the building don't reach far enough to see down the hallways to each apartment door, so I'd like to set up at least one of my own. I don't have a lot of clutter to hide it in though. And I don't exactly have the budget for something that's like 500$. But I'd rather spend 500$ on a camera, than lose my 2k PC. I can order it online if I need to. Local stores also have things like baby cams and security camera sets but they're not very subtle nor practical for this. I was also thinking of something that can't just be picked up and stolen too. Or something that uploads any footage to a sort of cloud in case someone takes it.

Are there any other precautions I can take? Literally ANY advice here would be appreciated!

145,"I am a 18 year old high school student who will be graduating this year. Until recently, I realized that I am not as independent as my peers. They already have their phone, bank card, and credit card; some of them already know how to cook and drive. Some of them even have a privilege to go out freely without their parent's permission. Compared to me I have almost nothing, I neither own phone (only device I own is a large tablet) nor having my own bank card and credit card (my mom still supervises my bank account and restricts my savings). If I need to buy something, I need to ask my mom to buy it, she will if she approves. I still need to ask my mom if I want to go out although if I am allowed out I must stay within a limited range.

However I really want to be independent, I can't imagine how my life would be different if I am independent. I want to communicate and remain in touch with my current friends and make new friends. This are the times I require a portable smartphone because I have speech problems and I primarily use pencil and paper to communicate (I'm a deaf student in a mainstream high school). I never had an opportunity to shop without holding my mom's hand.

I plan to discuss with my mom about my independence issue but I am scared to do that because I doubt if she will be interested enough to discuss it. I once tried to discuss my mom about owning a smartphone. I told her why I require a smartphone (parental communication, other teens already have it and etc...). She said the tablet is enough. I'm uncertain how she would respond if I asked her about owning my own bank card and credit card. She thinks that I'm not ready yet and I still need parental control on financial matters even though I am old enough to know how to manage my own money efficiently.

So how can I give my mom a convincing reason to fulfill my needs so I can become a more independent person. Any other advice is appreciated, thank you in advance.",20Feb2020,1
146,"TLDR: I’m new at my job and the person who was in this role previously micromanages me. I’m uncomfortable with the way he confronts me on minor mistakes. Who should I talk to and how should I go about the conversation? I need advice!

I recently started a new role as an office coordinator. The tasks are fairly straight forward - answering the phones, calendar scheduling for 3 execs, ordering groceries for the office, etc. My execs are easy going for the most part. The CEO is very specific with a lot of things, but nothing too crazy. I’ve seen worse. I appreciate that he’s straight forward and no fluff. 

The previous OC is now an office manager. He has been here for about 2 years and is very hyper-sensitive with our CEO’s scheduling/emails, etc. I get where he’s coming from and I also know he means well. He is now tasked with recruiting and culture/people operations. However, I feel as though the “shadowing” part of my training never ended - he is still doing my tasks and micromanages me on everything. He needs to be included in all my Slack conversations even though the matter has nothing to do with him.

In addition to that, he does not handle minor mistakes well. I don’t feel comfortable being confronted in front of my colleagues. I don’t mind constructive criticism but I feel that a lot of the things he wants me to change are objective. He says things like “you shouldn’t have done that,” “he (CEO) doesn’t like that,” “you should do this instead.” I have already let him know that I prefer to be pulled aside for things like these, but in most cases, he just spews emotions. 

I’ve only been here for a month and I don’t know if this is just part of the transition process. Sometimes I feel like I’m just overreacting, but I also can’t imagine working with someone longterm who is so overbearing. I want to stay because the job is less demanding job (at least I thought it was) and it’s perfect for someone who is in currently school. 

Should I confront him about this? Should I talk to my execs? One of the execs is my official manager on paper, but he’s removed from the day-to-day.

147,"It's an exaggeration to say I'm going to kill them, I would never bring myself to do that.

I'm 17 and living in a shared custody agreement since my parents are divorced. It's been a couple years since the divorce and I've done fine with it. My two younger brothers have sort of adjusted to the divorce itself, but my younger brother has had problems with my dad (Sometimes I can't really blame him). This post only slightly involves that though. I had a decent relationship with my youngest brother for the longest time and for the same amount of time been at an okay place with the middle one (He has a habit of being a bit of a dick). This slowly changed though. Slowly the middle got to be more of an asshole and make more remarks. He started to be an outwardly mean, and REALLY hypocritical person who doesn't give a fuck about others. I thought my brother was a dick before, but now he was a teenager, which compounded that aspect. My younger brother was initially hit with this too. They would constantly get into fights to the point my parents gave up on getting them to do dishes without any yelling. But then something changed in the younger one too. He slowly became more like the middle one, making shitty remarks and taking on the opinion that ""The rules don't apply to me"". (quick side note since I feel like you think I'm over exaggerating, I've gotten into the stupidest kinds of arguments with both now. In one of the arguments the middle said ""Y'know I'm still gonna fight you even if I know I'm wrong because *you shouldn't win*""). Slowly the anger that they usually threw at each other was directed at me. I could handle it at first, it was stupid things my brothers said to me which I could handle. Things built up though, and they found all of the ways they could get directly under my skin. I didn't stand a chance. They constantly throw everything I had done wrong that day in my face, for the rest of the week. They constantly interrupt me telling them something or letting them know something important with ""did I ask?"". If I ever tell any kind of joke, it doesn't matter good or bad, they would find some way of demeaning me for it. Honestly that's only a small number of the things they do and have done repeatedly for a long time now. Combine that with the fact that there's two of them firing these things at me non stop and encouraging the other and I have no verbal way to fight back. I've had to take all of this all the time, and it's been building and building inside me. I can't fight them verbally but I'm the oldest brother and I can't do anything physically to them because that get me in deep shit. I can't walk away because we live under the same god damn roof and they always find some reason to be in my room like that they just wandered or that the pet's in the room and they just wanted to pet them. I think it's finally built up enough that I just can't deal with it. I've started to get more physical in getting them to stop, I think I'm finally snapping enough to start doing that but I feel horrible. I don't want it getting physical to the point where I actually start hurting them. I would talk to my parents about this but my mom is usually under a lot of stress and difficulties that leave her exhausted when she's home and unable to deal with much and my dad just is never very helpful in these sort of situations. Even when I do express these sort of things to my parents a bit and they confront my brothers it's only temporary, they always go right back to doing the same shit to me. I would let out all this in something like therapy but there are complications to that. The therapist I have is one that my whole family goes to, my parents made sure this happened because they wanted to make sure that they divorce hadn't had adverse affects on us as well as having the ability to cooperate with each other in a productive manner. Most of the therapist appointments have been family therapy, so I wouldn't be really able to say much without making it a big thing with my brothers and me more at each other's throats than ever. Even if it was a one on one appointment though, I can never say what's really on my mind. I can't trust people like therapists, even when I have the most pressing matter that I need to talk to them about with my mental health I just can't. If that didn't happen then I would probably be in a better situation right now or at least would have an outlet for frustration. I have nothing I can really turn to. It was extremely hard to write this even though I'm just an anonymous profile to anyone reading. I just want some kind of advice. I hate the whole situation and the only way that I've been able to let out some of the frustration I feel is physically back at my brothers which isn't right. I just need some kind of advice.",20Feb2020,1

I get invested in people that don’t matter (literally people who are not healthy for me and contribute nothing positive to my life and I let myself get caught up and hurt), I care too much about unimportant things or respond inefficiently to situations with emotional reactions, and I would like to seriously minimize or eliminate these tendencies.

157,"We only dated once but instantly clicked since the first time we started to message each other online. We were supposed to have a date for tomorrow and she messages me calling it off saying things are moving too fast. She then proceeds to say she wants to focus on school and not date anyone for awhile because her old breakup is still too fresh. Big duh with that one, she couldn’t stop talking about the guy even though everything she said sounded like Carrie Underwood song. Anyhow, in the nearly two weeks we texted, over 1500 texts between us, and easily over 20 hours all together phone conversations I felt we were really connecting. Who communicates this much I’d they don’t want anything? She even asked me intimate questions, she wanted me I know it. Then yesterday she starts talking about her intimate relations class, she’s a psych student, and starts pointing out all my flaws and I just knew it’s ending. This ain’t even the first time she has pointed out my flaws but this is the first time she was so serious about it. I knew what was coming, I was prepared for it. So here I am this morning blubbering like an idiot because the woman who I knew was going to stop wanting to date me says we can’t date anymore. I know being led on and then rejected is hard but when why does it hurt so much even though I saw it coming?

Anyhow, she still likes me and wants to be friends and wants to hangout socially. Hangout socially might not happen for a while, I’m not sure how I feel about seeing the woman who led me for nearly 2 weeks before rejecting me. But at least I didn’t lose the friendship, I do really like her and I would have hated to lose that and losing that probably would have killed me.

Okay so i asked them a week before it was due if they could just help me film after school and that's all nothing hard, they agreed but then they would keep dismissing it whenever i asked when we were going to film, i brushed it off because im the type of person who gets nervous asking for things or asking for help, so this week i asked them since it's due tommorow if they could help me film (at the start of the week) they both said no stating they're busy, i brushed it off and i feel upset they don't have time to at least help me with the video since i have emails proving they promised to help.

One day before class started, Alex and I were talking and the topic of religion came up. He starts to criticize Christians and how Atheists are more reasonable than Christians. I’m a Christian, so this made things very awkward.

The problem is is that she lives in another city where I can't directly make sure if she's taking it or not. My sister living with her (although busy with university like I am) has been telling me that my mom told her she hasn't been taking her high blood pressure medication for a week long, and that immediately shook me up as I know how serious the consequences can be if you take it irregularly or not at all. My grandfather (mother's father) also passed away from stroke in the Philippines since he would only take half of his necessary dosage to save more for later... This scared me even more. My mom tells me she's a very natural person and doesn't believe in medication (she's even still slightly convinced that vaccines cause autism! I would have never expected this), and that all she needs is vitamins, kangen water and her supplements. I've tried to teach her the underlying mechanisms of the medication as I did my own research, but she doesn't want to hear it. I've sent her link after link of the consequences that may happen and what to do to fix it, but I don't think she even reads them (I've even tried reading them aloud in call). It has become very emotionally stressing as I am truly concerned for her health and fear she may have a stroke (knock on wood), to the point where I would cry to her through video call to show her how serious I am. I'm aware this doesn't make the situation any better, but I don't know what else to do. She promised me she would start taking it regularly, but to be frank I do not believe her as she said this to my sister many times.

165,"Hi, I really would love some advice. So, I’m 25 years old and I have never had a long-lasting friendship. I just want to say before I start...I have an amazing boyfriend who truly does treat me the best I have ever been treated before. I can really see it lasting a very long time. I’m working full time and I’m in school full time. I try to make time for my photography hobby, seeing my boyfriend, and going to the gym when I have free time. 

So...I want to start with, when I was younger up until high school, I had such a big group of friends. But as life goes on...we drifted apart. I stayed home for my first two years of college and I met so many people honestly. But, I was not the greatest person from 18-22. I went through my first ‘heartbreak’ at 19 from this guy I was with for two years who cheated on me. And from there I just became a completely different person. I loved partying, my friends and I would get drunk every weekend...and just thinking back on it, it was fun. But also embarrassing. We were definitely the overly loud obnoxious girls at the bar. But, that’s what being young is in some sense. And then after 22, I honestly was over it. I was over spending the little money I made in one weekend getting drunk. I was tired of embarrassing myself and meeting shitty guys out (duh), I was tired of throwing up and being hungover. I just felt like I grew up. 

With that being said, I was no longer ‘fun’ to my ‘going out friends’ so they drifted away from me quickly. And I was fine with that. But I swear, I’m not saying I’m perfect, but I just feel like I’m cursed with meeting all the wrong people. I was mostly single for those years and was fine. But every friend I met...we’d be super super close for about a year and something would happen that would just end it all. One of my friends hooked up with the one and only guy I was dating at the time...done deal. I also just felt like so many of my friends would use me for when they had nothing better to do. Others I felt were still so stuck in going out and getting drunk and doing other reckless things and that’s just so old to me now. 

I really don’t enjoy going to bars except for every once in a while or some outdoor places in the summer. I’d much rather go out to dinner or for a few drinks. I’d also rather cook dinner and have a wine night at home. And honestly, I’m truly just too tired after the week to want to do anything ‘crazy’...so now I just don’t feel like I mesh with anyone I used to know. 

The saddest thing is my one and only best friend who I had for years, honestly completely changed. She was hanging out with this girl who gets drunk constantly...during the week, alone at her house, whenever and my friend who once was just as over that as I was...sunk back into that. Which didn’t bother me all that much. But my friend also got this job about a year ago at this extremely expensive restaurant where these insanely rich people go and after that, she totally changed. Everything was about money, expensive clothes, expensive food/drinks &amp; as a full time worker and college student...I don’t have the money like she does for things. And slowly she stopped talking to me and started hanging out with people that are on her ‘level’. Plus, once I got into my relationship, she just started hanging out with single girls. Even though I still always made it a point to try to hang out with her. I guess relationship Angelina isn’t as fun as single Angelina. 

I’m not saying I’m perfect. However, I can honestly say I’m an extremely good and loyal friend. I would do anything for my friends and would be there for them. I would never do anything shady because I know how that feels to have that done to me. Truthfully, I don’t mind being by myself. I have an amazing boyfriend who I absolutely love to hang out with and I do consider him my best friend. I love going out exploring and taking photos. I love going to the gym on my free time. But it does make me wonder why some people my age still seem to have so many friends meanwhile I can never keep any.

I guess I’m just reaching out to see if anyone else has ever been through anything similar? I don’t really want to feel alone like I do. Also....sorry for this overly long post!",20Feb2020,1

I am exhausted with what I once spent my time doing (watching movies and Youtube videos.)  I have a lot of extracurricular activities nowadays, but I'm having trouble finding balance.  Even though I've always claimed that I wanted more responsibility, I hate the fact that I have a week off from school, and that I must spend it studying for the upcoming quizzes and tests I have.  I feel immature for wanting a boy to like me back so badly.  I find him physically attractive and he is kind to me, but we have opposing interests and if we dated, the relationship would most likely not last more than a day.  We have different goals in life.

I currently support the 3 of us with a full time job that pays $40,000 a year. But after insurance, taxes, and union dues, I’m bringing home $27,000 a year. After each paycheck (biweekly) we are left with $50-$120 for the next two weeks after paying our bills. The job I have had good benefits (pension, sick time, vacation, great insurance), but working here is putting me in a deep hole of debt. 

I was given a job offer at a local warehouse that pays $70,000 a year, weekly checks with little benefits. 1 week vacation after a year and so on, okay health insurance, great hours for the pay, but the work is hard. Accepting this job offer would put my family above and beyond this debt hell we are in. 

Basically, my problem is that I am being told leaving my current job is stupid due to the benefits. However, the benefits don’t pay the bills. I need the money rather than the benefits. And the job offer I would accept would put ALOT more in my pocket, but isn’t as secure of an environment being a non-union production warehouse. 

What are your thoughts? Do I take the better paying job and do the more labor intensive work while I’m young? Or keep my current job and pick up another 6 hour shift part time else where to help scrape by?",20Feb2020,1

184,"Well, here we go. So this all stems from me being a lesbian. My parents hate it, I lost my relationship with my mom over it. Now allowed to say “girlfriend” to her it’s always my “gay friend”. I generally am at my girlfriends house 5ish days a week. Her mom always makes me and her dinner and has it ready on the table every time. I’m allowed to shower whenever I want no questions asked and other little things among that. For background, I’m a junior in college, studying computer engineering. I’ve commuted the first three years to save money, and thus far have about 17k in loans. For my senior year, I’ll probably have another 6k in loans if I commute. I feel horrible always being at my girlfriends house, but she is not allowed at my house where I live with my parents. I truly do not like being at my girlfriends house 5 days a week, I just feel like a bother. Not much I can do or clean because it’s out of the norm and I don’t know everything and how they do everything. So here is where I ask for some advice. I could next year, take more loans out and live on campus (8-13k depending on where on campus I live) and be able to be with my girlfriend whenever I want and not be bothering anyone and be in our own space. Or save the 8-13k and just deal with it at home another year. I feel as though it puts a lot of tension on our relationship because of how I feel when I’m at her house and how she feels because she can’t ever come to mine. I’m not sure how smart it is to take out more loans to live on campus, but I know I would be much happier (not to mention that gets rid of a 40 minute commute to school and an hour home every day).

190," 

I've recently come to terms as being bisexual, and have found dating girls to quite difficult. I started college in September, and quickly made friends with a girl. We get on really well and spent a lot of time together last semester. I only ever saw her as a friend and never thought any more of it until she liked me on tinder. I chose to ignore this as maybe being friendly, however, when I spoke to mutual friends over the holidays I got told she liked me. When coming back to college, everything was normal, but on a night out we were both pretty drunk and she spent all night being endearing expressing how much she thinks of me, and one thing leads to another and we kissed. The next day she said sorry she was really drunk, i didn't want her to think I wasn't interested so i said we should do something again soon, which she ignored. Everything got weird after we kissed she acts strange, I've seen her in group gatherings and she seems more distant, but then when she invited me out with her roommates on a night out on valentines day, and when i asked if i could bring my roommates she ignored me and when I saw her out she acted really off. I've seen her numerous times since then but she's very hit and miss with how she acts. I'm really struggling to understand it, our mutual friends (her roommates) always use to make comments about us being together but has stopped since we kissed. I feel like there's something going on which I'm not being told about. She's my friend above everything but I don't know how to approach it. I suspect maybe she's only just coming to terms with same sex relationship too. We haven't spoken for a while now, but I've been told she's struggling at the moment. I really want to help but I don't know whether to message her as she might want some space and i don't want to invade on her if she dosen't want to speak. But I also feel like messaging her to meet as I can't bare ignoring it.

Speaking to her openly would be the best solution but I have really bad anxiety so struggle with dealing with these situations and don't know know if just leaving it would be better. I'm not out to my friends and family at home yet so I don't really have anyone to talk to, any help would be great",20Feb2020,1

That same day I saw her on social media at an expensive hotel having dinner with some other friends. I’m not upset with her about the money but I’m upset about the fact that she went over my head and asked my mom who she doesn’t know quite well for money rather than asking me. She has a history of feeding people sob stories and getting them to feel sorry for her so they can loan her money and she wouldn’t pay them back. 

I know her habits and I would regularly refuse to lend her money for those reasons. My mom on the other hand didn’t know about her money habits and naively loaned her the money. I stopped speaking to her after this and recently she contacted me wanting to make amends. I told her that I wouldn’t consider fixing any part of our friendship until she apologizes and pay my mom back.

204,"I've been looking into adopting a cat recently from a shelter, but unfortunately, the one I have fallen absolutely in love with has ringworm. The shelter is a no-kill shelter thank goodness, but I have heard that many shelters that *do* euthanize, will euthanize for this reason. That kind of breaks my heart considering it's just a fungus. I genuinely want to give this cat a good home, but I need to make sure I'm capable before I make the leap. The last thing I would want is for the cat to have recurrent infections because I'm incapable of eliminating the spores. 

I've dealt with minor ringworm (caught from a friend's cat with a similar issue lol) on myself and it didn't seem a big deal, but then again, I caught it with just 2 or 3 little spots. This was my only past experience with it. Lately, I've been reading online that in order to fully rid the environment EVERYTHING has to be vacuumed repeatedly and bleached to high heavens. This is scaring me. I can't bleach because I have unfinished hardwood floors. I also have a lot of cloth furniture that I can certainly vacuum, but I'm worried that's not enough.

Does anyone have experience with this? Is this too much of a task for me, or are other people making a bigger deal out of it than it really is? Do you know of any bleach alternatives that would still kill the spores? ANY advice is greatly appreciated.

206,"this is a throwaway account. I don't know where else to turn. I've read some of the most profound and some of the most asinine advice I could ever discover right here on Reddit. Now I'm the one reaching out and I hope it's met with profundity.

A little background: my family has been going through a difficult time for the past year involving an out-of-control son/stepson.

My wife has a son from before we were involved. I adopted the son as my own, gave him my family name, and despite having no prior experience, tried my best to be as close to a father as he could need. I was far from perfect, I look back and cringe on many things I said and many things I did. But I tried to be his father. I tried to be a good one. I don't know how else I can say that.

He has dealt with issues for most of his life but none that gave a glimpse into the person he would become. In short, he put us through Hell.

He tried to say we physically abused him. That didn't work.

He tried to say we starved him. That didn't work.

Then he accused me of sexual misconduct in an attempt to have our young children taken away. Thankfully he was foolish enough to tell us ahead of time that he would be lying in order to have our children taken and my wife had the foresight to preemptively call DCF and tell them. I was investigated and the allegations were dismissed.

I could have been labeled a sex offender. I could have had my name soiled forever and, worst case scenario, have had to fight to keep my children. This was not an angsty teenager who was lashing out at his parents, this was a calculated move in order to ruin my life specifically. I was far from perfect, but what could I have done to warrant such hateful spite?

For a multitude of other reasons, my wife ended up filing a restraining order and a CRA (Child Requiring Assistance) basically throwing the white flag as he needed help neither of us were capable of giving. This requires court sessions in order to be enacted.

My wife told me she wanted my presence in court.

I didn't go. I was paralyzed by fear over what had been said about me. I couldn't face the person who wanted to take me down in such a vile manner. I was too much of a coward. I have been going through a bout of depression, anxiety, and an overall feeling of dirty helplessness. I feel disgusting, I don't care that the allegations are false, the fact that the boy I adopted as my own son would try to have my children taken away by calling me a pervert, has left me reeling. I don't know what to feel. I never thought of myself as someone who was ""triggered"" but I enjoy crime documentaries and now whenever I hear anything about sexual abuse I have to turn it off. I feel like a light in my heart went out. I feel like I let myself be vulnerable with my stepson and he betrayed me in the worst way imaginable. It's made me wall up and not want to be vulnerable with anyone, including my wife. I don't even want to talk about it with anyone, it just feels gross and I want to move past it, but I'm not able to. My friends have been a great asset but there's only so much I can ask of them.

How do I communicate this with her? I am a terrible communicator to begin with, it's a thorn in our relationship, and now she's flat-out disgusted with me and doesn't see me as supportive. She has been dealing with this aloof doofus for 10 years and she's sick and fucking tired of how I am. I will do anything for her. ANYTHING. I'm just not smart enough or perceptive enough to do it without being told it needs to be done, and in this case, I wasn't even strong enough for her. I know I should have been there. I know I'm supposed to be the big strong man who can stand up to anything, emotionally impervious, knight that sweeps her off her feet, but I'm not. I ran. and I hid.

216,"Sorry for any grammatical errors and formatting, no excuse, I just suck at it. 

So for some context, I don't live with my mom, parents divorced shortly after I was born, but visit her every other weekend. My mom is a compulsive liar, a cheater, and emotionally manipulative. I like to believe she's not as bad as everyone says, but there lies my problem.
 
When I was young, I was desperate for a mother figure, just someone who I could call mom, someone who could be the half my dad couldn't be. My dad is amazing, but he gave tough love, no BS, and cold hard truth(unless he was lying to save face for someone else,which he did for my mom), and sometimes you just want to feel like a prince. I was a mommas boy with no momma.While my dad did remarry, she ended up being a Karen in disguise, so not really helping with positive imagery of what a mother is supposed to be. So when my mom finally decided to start showing her face after almost 15 years of ignoring my existence, I was over joyed. To summarize my situation: My mom (being the selfish person she is) realized that since all I wanted was to see her, the mere motion of her showing up was enough for me. She gave the bare minimum, and I praised her for doing anything at all. 

She's that mom who tries to be friends with her kids to win them over, it didn't work, but I'd still give her praise for the little effort she put in. She ""understands"" me better than my dad, but it's because she acts and behaves like a teenager. I've talked with my dad and learned a lot of the crap she pulled and I want to confront her, try to hear her side, but don't know how. I don't deal well with confrontation, and if I do this unprepared, it's probably gonna end with both of us crying and screaming at each other. I can't just ask my dad to do it for me, and I feel it's too personal to do over text, this is between me and her and I'm terrified. She never brings up the divorce or any of the crap she did and pretends everything is okay, and im tired of her trying to hide from her past from me just to avoid looking bad. This post is long enough and this is just the abridged version of the whole story. I just don't know how to do this, any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading.

 P.S I know I can't blame all of my problems on her, but most the issues I have, stem from the fear of abandonment that she left ingrained in my mind. Also, I know people can change with time but she's had 17 years and I'm tired of waiting for her to take accountability for her actions.",20Feb2020,1
217,"Hello everyone. I’m new to reddit. I feel like I can vent, and not be judged. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for 10 years now. Within the 10 years we’ve had 1 successful pregnancy out of 4. The very first pregnancy was a success. We waited 3 years, My second pregnancy I miscarried at 9 weeks. We waited again 2 years, I had a fetal demise at 23 weeks with my son. The doctors didn’t seem to care or to find out why this happened. We waited 4 years to try again. 2019 I became pregnant, had a fetal demise at 24 weeks with my baby girl. This time the doctors wanted to find out why this keeps happening along with us wanting to know too. We did genetic testing and pathology tests and autopsy, it was recommended but at that time I didn’t know it wasn’t covered by my health insurance. I’ve recently received the big bill in the mail and tried to “fight” it. That was unsuccessful. I’ve been suffering from depression and severe anxiety due to these losses. I created a GoFundMe to help alleviate some stress and help with the medical bills. Since I created a GoFundMe my family has been acting weird. They didn’t share it and when I asked them why they didn’t answer. I’m feeling alone, judged and alienated from my family. I’ve always supported them in their time of need. Am I in the wrong to feel this way? Why is there such a stigma about miscarriages and losses. Health insurance covers successful pregnancies and births but not losses? Without these tests I wouldn’t have gotten the results I needed, along with medicine from the diagnosis. We will never be able to have a child again. Thanks for reading.",20Feb2020,1

219,"So we've had an extreme amount of rain here in GA this year.  Bought a new house last April.  Found out that clearly foundation can't handle flash flooding.  It's a combination of landscaping that doesnt drain very well and oversaturation of soil.
After having our basement flood 3 times, and I'm talking like 100+ gallons of water seeping out from all of the baseboards, we got an estimate on installing some waterproofing to the home.  It's going to be around 20k.
Obviously we weren't expecting to run into this financial hardship.  He spent his savings on the downpayment, and I don't make enough money to really financially help.
We are trying to go through the processes of seeing if theres any financial help to gain from real estate agent, previous owner, and the inspector that we hired, but aren't counting on it.  None of it was disclosed in the sale to my knowledge but I could be wrong.
I can pick up extra hours but I make so little money that it will hardly put a dent on this loan.  I offered to put the loan under my name but he and I aren't married and all of my coworkers advised against taking the debt in case of things not working out between us. We have been together-ish for six years now, but our relationship has had a lot of huge unresolved fights.
I am handy and have very minor landscaping experience, though I have a lot of experience using tractors.  I am going to use what little budget I have and ask the neighbors to borrow their tractor and till the backyard to dry it out and mix in quicklime.  I will install French drains and a dry well.  I was also planning to get a few dump trucks of sand/gravel/dirt to increase the grade around the house and hopefully create better drainage.  But I know realistically if we get it with multiple flash floods like we are right now my landscaping will not be enough.  I'm worried about mold and ruining the entire basement through continual dampness.

I've watched my s.o. be a zombie for 3 days now and I feel helpless, as he's struggling to even handle the news.  If the neighbors won't let me borrow their tractor in exchange for work then I'm SOL and wouldn't be able to do much with the yard.  We are also predicted to have another 4 days of rain next week nonstop, and the basement will flood again.  (We are literally spending sleepless nights awake shop vaccing water out).

I don't know how else I can really offer to help.  He doesn't want to talk about it because he says there isnt anything to talk about until he makes a decision.
             I wish I could just magically sell my bathwater so we'd have all the money and then some to repair our house but im not a secret internet sensation that rakes in the dough.  The landscaping is still probably going to cost me a couple grand with what I have planned for supplies, and that's realistically all i can afford without taking out a loan. 
What can I do here?  How do I help?",20Feb2020,1
220,So reddit so I had a last minute interview today since I really needed the job in all. It's a food place.  I ended up applying as management since I had the experience. My interviewer aka the area manager was acting more nervous than me . The interview went fine he said I got the job but guys he was sitting sideways and looking at the wall the whole time. It was so weird. I just want a job but It made me feel like the lack of eye contact was going to compromise my chance for the position. What do you guys think?,20Feb2020,1
221,"I have been dating my boyfriend for three years and his parents have never invited me over or have tried to get to know me. My boyfriend always come to my parents. He's invited to holidays, weddings, dinners. My mom buys him christmas gifts and he's treated like part of the family. This however is not reciprocated to me. 

I feel disrespected and unwanted by this. I feel like the mother should want to meet me or my boyfriend should want to bring me around. It feels very one sided. His cousin is getting married this year and I'm 100% sure he did not receive a plus one. 

Should I talk to him about this or just give this time? I don't want to complain and have him speak to his parents just because I said something. I want them to genuinely want to meet me... How am I supposed to continue our relationship seriously if clearly it's not viewed seriously?",20Feb2020,1
222," I was born female, however for the past 2 months I've been feeling like I'm not female. I hate my boobs and I'm getting a binder to help with that. I got my hair cut short 5 months ago, before i was questioning and I specifically wanted a guys hair cut. Was this a hint? Idk how I feel. I've been thinking I'm non binary or trans guy. I've thought of the name Lucas or Luca after much thought. I really like the name. But sometimes I doubt if I'm trans or not. Like I wonder if this could be a phase. I mean I've always had low self esteem and hated my body. Idk I'm just confused. I don't know what pronouns I would want but I'm fine with he/him and they/them. Should I tell my friends and teachers about my new name? 


 I'm 15 so I keep getting told im too young but I feel like most trans people know when they're young and I don't remember much of my childhood, but in 6th grade I was super girly but I liked (and still do) some stereotypical guy things and I hated (and still do) some stereotypical girl things, this also makes me feel like im too old at the same time. I know I've only been questioning for 2 months so this doesn't really mean much but its so confusing. I feel like its been too short of a time to know.",20Feb2020,1
223,"A few months ago, I moved into my grandparent’s house my grandmother is driving me absolutely insane. I had complications with her in the past that I’m not over, so now it’s like my reactions to everything she does are exaggerated. The most annoying thing she does is that she never stops talking to me, regardless of how clear I make it that I’m either busy or I’m not in the mood. It doesn’t matter if I’m doing homework, reading, or trying to watch TV. No matter how busy or disinterested I am, she does not stop talking to me.

She’s not someone I particularly enjoy being around in general, especially because she still talks to me the same way she did when I was ten. She talks down to me and lectures me like I’m a child who needs to be taught a lesson, and it feels like she’s just all over me. This makes it difficult for me to speak to her under other circumstances, even if it’s just a casual conversation.

Recently I’ve tried to make it more and more clear when I don’t want to speak to her, and I’ll respond with one word answers just to get her to give me some space. Today, for example, I got into a big argument with my parents. If I mention these arguments to anyone, even just as a way to vent, they flip out on me, so I never mention them. Instead, I made it clear I didn’t want to talk about my day, and gave her a simple answer when she asked about it. She decided to teach me a lesson and, when I asked her a question later on, she decided to ignore me and then lecture me about being rude to her. I told her that I’ve gotten to this point because she never respects when I don’t want to talk to her, and she completely denied it.

I realize that I sound like a spoiled brat right now, but the things that happened between us before were horrible and she continues to justify them now. It was things that a stranger should never do to another person, let alone family, so dealing with minor issues like this between us is so much more difficult. I still have a lot of resentment towards her and it’s at the point where I simply dislike her as a person, but I still have to live with her. This experience as a whole is so frustrating and irritating and I don’t know how to handle it.",20Feb2020,1
225,"My dad brought something up after I complained about sharing a bed with my brother in a hotel. He said even when I was a little kid, I always hated being close to someone. 

Small stuff like handshakes or hugs are fine, but when it comes to cuddling with a girl or sharing a bed with someone, I get super uncomfortable. I dont know why. It's always causing my relationships to flop, or ruining a night's sleep.

226,"I have been a somewhat extreme procrastinator all my life, pushing deadlines to the limit and all that stuff, but it has never been as bad as now. For example: I have some important exams in the next two weeks, but I just can't bring myself to studying for them. Even if I finally go get my stuff and start studying, my mind wanders off in a matter of seconds everytime. TV is off, phone is off, PC is off, I just sit there basicly daydreaming for hours. And even while writing this post I'm losing focus constantly.

I used the word ""procrastinating"", because I don't know how else you could call that. It feels like I'm the hardheaded child not wanting to do things and their chanceless parent at the same time...

227,"So I graduated college recently and when I was doing my initial job search, I couldn’t find a job I was qualified for.  I went to a top 10 school but didn’t have the technical skills.

I met a lot of people and one company in NYC really piqued my interest. I had a high up connection who introduced me to the head of a specific department that I might be interested in. The manager I met was very encouraging and gave me some tips and said to keep the effort up and stay in touch.

I ended up taking a different job which was a rotational- type program that feeds into a direct role. I have learned a lot but this isn’t what I want to do for much longer. I graduate from the program this year. I think I’ve gained some skills but again, I’m still fresh and learning and scared I’m still not qualified to move somewhere else. 

I was browsing LinkedIn and saw a posting for the EXACT job title I was learning about at the same company I informally toured with. I have the same “higher up” connection and also could find the contact info of the manager I specifically met.

I’m not exactly thirsty for a job because I’m about to be “promoted” but I know I can’t stay where I am for much longer. I’ve been unhappy. And this posted job speaks to my soul more. I feel like I have a bit of an “in” but I find it really difficult to reach out in a genuine way about these things without seeming like I’m begging to be hired.

230,"Almost 17 and last summer I worked a job at a bottle depot (very small Alberta town btw). The day I went to apply was in late April/Early May. Boss man never asked to see a resume and to this day I still don’t know his name. He never introduced himself to me ever, and of course I felt it was too rude to ask even though it was his fault for not introducing himself. The other day my buddy and I got chatting about workers insurance and I realize I never got that when I started working. Not only that but a few times he told me to pay myself. How? Take money from the register, but write down how much I took. I’m not a d-bag so I calculated my hours on a paper (left it by the register for him to see) and the total I took only the amount I earned (note this was before I learned this was illegal). Another week he told me I could take thousands from him to pay for a new car, upfront may I add (which I turned down in a hurry). Once or twice he got me to fill out my pay check because he left before closing and to write down the amount I took. I don’t know if any of this is legal but it sure is sketchy. I’m starting to doubt that I was actually marked down as an employee and was paid under the table this whole time. 

On to the working conditions.
Bottle depots in the city are different than ones in rural areas. People wait 1-2 maybe even three years to bring in trailer loads of bottles and cans. He usually would leave after the first few hours of opening and that would just leave me. The only person there to sort literal trailer-fulls of cans is a 16 year old with a pinched back nerve from a car crash. A few days I worked over 5 hours (which in my province means I’m entitled to a 30min break) which I never got. The only time I get a break is when people don’t come in, so I usually don’t have time to run and get food if I didn’t pack a lunch (can’t run home bc I’m 15min out of town). On weekends I’d get to rest max 10-15min total if it’s a busy day. Sure I get small breaks to sit down but no guaranteed break and time to myself. A few times I’ve broken down from the pure stress of people coming in with truckloads that I’d have to handle alone. 

On my last day (sept 1st I believe??) I told him that I ideally wouldn’t be working there during the school year but if he needed any help to contact me. Looking into the red flags I first ignored bc it was my first job I don’t plan on returning.

Other...strange things
He lectured me (atheist) about the benefits of believing in god several times after making it clear I never went to church a day in my life.i answered calls that I thought were customers, but were actually just services calling about unpaid this and that (Telus, a big city bank to name two). After telling him about the one bank calling he said that they’re calling because they WANT him to take out a loan from the bank?? Do banks do that?? He basically was telling me that rich people are the literal scum of the earth. He’s from Sri Lanka and grew up during the height of some war thing over there and frequently told me about war trauma. Once he told me about how he was involved in a fatal drunk driving crash and how he witnessed the tragic death of his friends (yes he included what brutal injuries they had) and telling this to a kid who roughly a month prior could of potentially passed in a crash, along with my sister, was so very uncomfortable. He did know about my crash, not because I wanted to tell him, because my relative was comforting me at work about it and he wanted to know why. I hesitated, quite clear I didn’t want to say, but did. OH AND HERES THE KICKER. My very first day a man (who most likely knows my grandparents) asked who I was. Before I could answer, boss man said I was his niece/nephew. Now he is a darker man, I’m pasty white. I have no idea why he said it, it really weirded me out. The customer did not believe it based on the strange look he gave😂 but boss man did claim I was his relative some other time too, which is just entirely false. Last time I checked I’m very white according to DNA tests. 

Can someone tell me what legal violations there might be in this whole ordeal. My family still thinks this is the perfect job for me but I’m trying to convince them otherwise with all these weird red flags. Maybe he’s just an odd fellow? Maybe I’m in the wrong.

234,"So, I live in a duplex home. I live with my single mother who has been sick in bed for a few months, with a rare disease (long story) I need to go to school, work and work my hardest for her every day. My neighbors who don’t work, don’t do anything except drink dozens of bottles of beer every single day, trash the yard and party all night, blasting bass boosted songs throughout the night right next to my wall. I’ve tried pillows, ear plugs, even the big old red noise-cancelling ear muffs that you wear at a gun range. In fact, I’ve used all three at the same time and somehow the noise goes right through, sometimes knocking things off of my own wall. It’s disturbing. 

Now, I’ve called the police a couple dozen times throughout the past few months. They knock on their door, tell them to be quiet, and they get quiet for an hour then resume the partying. The police don’t do anything about it. 

I’m tired of my tax money going towards these loud fuckers so they can drink, party and contribute nothing to society or the neighborhood.

235,"I am in total shock and I can’t really feel anything.

I started seeing this guy and I was really, really, really into him. We had gone on three dates and he seemed so honest, genuine, and everything I was looking for. We had a date set for Saturday and I was going to stay over at his house. He tells me today that he recently found out he had contracted herpes. I had given him oral twice unprotected, and not yet had sex. When I asked when he found out he admitted that he knew between the two times, and still let me go down on him without knowing. 

I don’t know what to feel. This is so disappointing and scary. I just got tested last week but not for herpes and now I have to figure out where I can go tomorrow. Do urgent cares test for this kind of thing? How long will it take me to get the results? I have read that it is rare to contract it orally but of course I’m petrified. I feel like I need to ask him follow up questions but I don’t know what those are. 

I have a pimple that’s formed just below my nose, but not close to my lip. Is it possible that it could be an outbreak?

I’m assuming I should never engage with this dude again? Is it bad that I’m so sad because I really liked him? I just can’t believe it. He cried and said he panicked and was a coward. I don’t know what to do from here and I’m just panicking.

237,"I'm sorry in advance for how long this will probably be, but I need a vent a little. Anyone who reads all of this and provides advice is a fucking Saint and I immediately love you. Anyway, I have friends but they all live spread out around my state. I moved to my current town about 5 years ago and made my first actual friend here just last summer. I have social anxiety so it's really hard for me to make friends and really connect with people, so when I find someone I really connect with, I kinda can get insecure about my friendship with them because it's so rare that I find someone like that.


This particular friend is someone who I'd easily see myself being best friends with or really close friends at the very least. We have so much in common (way more than I have in common with any of my current friends from back home). We have very similar personalities and my favorite things are also her favorite things and vice versa. Because of all that, I really connected with her fast. We can hang out and spend hours talking about our mutual interests and it feels like no time. The problem though is that she's so flaky. I can text her and talk to her for a bit. Sometimes she'll talk extensively, other times, she'll just bail out mid-conversation. She'll engage and initiate conversations though. Actually, she's usually the one to initiate the conversation (once or twice a week usually) so it's not like she doesn't want to talk, just feels like I have to catch her at the right time and as soon as she gets bored, she dips out. Fine, I don't particularly like texting either. She considers me her friend. She's mentioned before how I'm ""such a great friend"" and that she's ""thankful to have me as a friend"" so she doesn't hate me or anything. That being said, it's almost impossible to hang out with her. We've hung out only twice in the past 5 months.  Maybe a total of 4 times since last summer (we used to worked at the same job together, though so it feels like more than that) She never hits me up asking to hang out, I'm the one who always initiates and has to make the plans, and that only seems to have a success rate of like 20%. When she can't hang out, she never tries to reschedule or seems bummed that she won't be able to. It's just like ""I can't because (whatever reason)"".


So clearly, I'm the one putting in all of the effort and I'm kinda tired of it tbh. I see her as a potential best friend and she just sees me as a backup friend it seems, and it sucks. Like, she always seems to like me. We hung out last about a month ago and she was like ""let's try not to go that long again without catching up"" and then she just ends up being flaky again. I was on vacation from work last week and told her I'd be free all week if she wanted to get together and do something last week"" and she was like ""yeah that sounds awesome, I'll let you know when I'm free!"" and she never got back to me about that.


So that's where I'm at. How do you handle that? Our show we both love comes on Friday and I know she's gonna text me something about it afterwards as she typically does, so I have a few scenarios.


Scenario A: I just cut ties and ignore her and forget about her and move on. Seems drastic and unnecessary and I'd have a really hard time doing that.


Scenario B: When she texts me, just act aloof and uninterested in talking to her to see if she cares enough to ask what's wrong. Then confront her about it.


Scenario C: Same as B, but don't confront her and hope she takes a hint since last time we talked, she declined an invite to hang out on one of the days I was off last week, and hopefully tries to make a better effort and asks to hang out.


Both of those seem to immature and petulant honestly, but Idk.


Scenario D: Just accept my role as a backup friend and play it cool. Stop asking her to hang out with me and never expect to hang out again unless she takes initiative to make plans herself.


This seems most reasonable, but I never trust myself with this kind of thing because if I knew what I was doing, I wouldn't be in this position in the first place.


Sorry for the long post, but I needed to vent and get some honest advice because I'm lost.


Tl;dr: Friend clearly isn't as interested in being as close of friends as I am with her. Never takes initiative to hang out and never tries to reschedule when I invite her to hang out and she can't, but makes effort to talk to me at least fairly often, just not as much as I want. How should I handle this situation?

249,"Here's why I kinda need to figure this out, I can't just wait: I have dependent personality disorder. My boyfriend is the person I depend on the most and him randomly leaving me would fuck me over severely (like, i'm not exaggerating - this is an actual mental health condition, not just loving my boyfriend a lot.) so I need to prepare.

Back to the point.

I don't think he loves me anymore. He's having a rough time in life and he keeps saying how much he needs me in his life right now but he also keeps bringing up how he would still want me in his life if we broke up. Which.. Is kinda weird to think about if you're not planning on breaking up with someone?

He also just like. He never seems to genuinely want to talk to me anymore. We're long distance and have a trip coming up but every time we discuss it he doesn't seem very excited, honestly he almost sounds like he doesn't want to go. We can't get a refund on the plane tickets so it would suck if we had to cancel it but I also don't want him to feel trapped with me.

Speaking of being trapped. Today he said we were both stuck with each other. Not in a loving, joking way. He sounded upset about it.

I don't think he loves me anymore but I can't tell how much of this could be just because he's having a hard time. What do you guys think?",20Feb2020,1

252,"So my father cheated on my mother, and I've always said that I will never cheat on someone, and if I dint love the person i was with, I would end it, so i wouldn't be lying to my SO. However, I'm in college now, and I've had a  girlfriend for a year  and a half, and she's also my first girlfriend, and my first sexually. I love her, but I'm also very curious. Seeing that my gf is very vanilla, and is a super sub, while I'm a switch, I never get to be sub,  and I feel like I'm missing out on something.

Now I found out that he lost effectively all of his friends, his girlfriend dumped his ass (and was in an extremely toxic relationship with her), has family issues, and did some pretty fucked up/illegal shit that left him rather traumatized.

A couple of days ago he talked to me and told me that he needed my advice and wanted to be my friend again. However, he only spoke to me when he had exhausted all his other options, and although he acknowledges that he left me to rot but didn't seemed to care how much it affected me.

He's in his early twenties, around 5' 7"" with black medium length hair, and super introverted. I get good vibes from him for some reason. I think it's because I've seen him eyeing me when I leave the room, but who knows? At the very least he's a fellow engineering student so there's some basic interests in common.

**going to her prom:**

pros: 

* her mom likes me a lot 
* her friend group is more fun
* the venue is downtown
* she has an orchestra performance that day so i can watch her play on the same day

cons:

* her dad is questionable about me and her
* food sucks there
* i have to drive there in a suit

**going to my prom:**

pros:

* she will already be in my town for a competition
* both of my parents will arguably handle it better if they were to find out
* food is better
* more activities to do before and after the dance

cons: 

* people suck here
* venue is much more boring
* a dress is harder to transport long distance
* no mode of transportation for her back home

&amp;#x200B;

the parent situation: although we both are comfortable with each other, we would like to wait a little longer before our families know of us, just to avoid conflict by slowly introducing and integrating ourselves into each others' lives and families. however, going as a prom date could be a dead giveaway and could cause specific problems with her dad. posing as a ""friend"" is an option, but somewhat questionable, though.

One of my main concerns is that I need hours and she wastes so many hours on the clock 

My boss is too nice but I told him I had some concerns to talk about with him tomorrow and was easily able to write a three page paper on her bullshit 

Me and the other main coworker in the office both share the same concerns and are constantly frustrated by her lack of professionalism and consideration for us .

Except for one.

I’ve been friends with him for most of high school and I consider him to be one of my closest friends. He’s not LDS, just Christian. However, out of all of my friend groups, he is the only one to make negative comments about the trip. I know that it is going to be hard out there but he always telling me that it’s gonna break me because of the social anxiety I’ve had in the past. It’s never anything uplifting.

I talked to him about it and he said that he’d rather be a realist then an optimist, but he doesn’t even know much about my faith and is the one telling me that it’s gonna be hell. He says he hates to be the “negative nancy” in this case since everyone single other person has been nothing but supportive, but his comments are getting me discouraged. He knows this has been one of my passions and desires for a while so why isn’t he being supportive about it... aren’t friends supposed to build each other up no matter what?

265,"My manager who is a hard working, generally enthusiastic and genuine person is getting promoted to be a director, a position that he is being rewarded with in a succession plan as the current director is retiring. I feel he genuinely deserves the promotion though it has raised a few eyebrows among his peers.

A co-worker of mine who is absolutely disliked by everyone else in the team, a bootlicker, power hungry and one who is somehow in good standing with our leadership despite his backstabbing nature, has set things in motion to become the new Manager of the team by announcing his intention to apply to be the new Manager.

The problem is my current Manager, despite having had several opportunities to realize my co-worker's true nature has always failed to. It is generally known that they are friends outside work; while that is no business of mine and I believe the Manager does a good job of separating work from his personal life.

While I am the closest in the team who can give the co-worker at-least a run for his money if I apply for the Manager's position, I do not believe I am ready for the job. I, however, will in a split second decide to apply for the position if it means the co-worker does not end up becoming my team's new Manager. None of us want to tattle about the co-worker to the Manager and appear like a brat. How do I go about making my Manager understand the non-genuine nature of the co-worker? Should I apply for the position? Is there a different approach I and my team can take to keep this lackey from becoming our Manager?

A disclaimer that I had done a good deal of retrospection to see if I am biased against this particular co-worker, I believe I am fair in my assessment of the co-worker and the situation and everyone in the team are of the same or similar opinion.

288,"I [19F] and my boyfriend [20M] have been dating over two years (we’ve known each other a lot longer) and we feel it’s time to get an apartment together. 

Due to family situations in my own household, my boyfriend suggested I live with him. Long story short it’s been over a year now that we’ve lived together and we love every moment of it other than the toxic atmosphere we are surrounded by from his side of the family. But that’s a story for another day....

For a short while we were living on our own while his mom was trying to sell his previous home. We were both working during the day and would come home at dinner time to each other. Once the house was bought and we were forced to leave, we applied for an apartment and got denied due to lack of credit. 

Fast forward a year we are still living with his parents and we are feeling miserable and trapped. We don’t feel like we can speak freely or walk anywhere without someone being behind the corner listening. We BOTH want out but don’t know if financially we are ready to support our selves or if we are just scared to make the commitment of depending on each other financially. 

I am currently in dental assisting school and in 3 weeks I get my certification to start working in the field (in my area its around $16-18/hr). My boyfriend makes a decent amount of money as an entrepreneur/forex trader. The price range we feel we should aim for is around $1,300 for a 2br 2ba. Both of us have gotten credit cards since last applying for an apartment and we have done a good job keeping up with payments and will sometimes pay early. We also have a friend who wants to room with us and help pay rent. He is in the same boat we are with credit and financial stability. We all have saved up some money as well (enough for 6 mo rent). 

In three weeks I want to move out and live with my boyfriend and finally have a place where I can call home and feel safe but I don’t know if both of us are financially ready or if our credit will hold us back. If we can’t afford rent, or other bills, we won’t have a parent figure who can help out.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, we’re just trying to figure out how to take the first step at starting life on our own. Thanks!",20Feb2020,1

so, like, i really suck at reading cues. but... if she wanted me to only contact her about work stuff, wouldn't just calling the shop be fine? why the extra  of like ""call my personal number"" unless...? but i dont want to do that and be the creepy weirdo, but this doesnt ever happen to me. like seriously, im about as clueless as it gets (kid you not, i had someone actually legit flash me in a bookstore once and she still had to follow it up with something like ""i think youre cute, lets go out sometime heres my number""). so, was that like a ""hey call me"" or a ""you tipped well, i want to make sure you come back to me""?",20Feb2020,1

292,"Okay, so here’s the slight issue: my (20F) friend (22F) CONSTANTLY wants to talk/FT. Which I know probably doesn’t seem like an issue, because who doesn’t want to talk to their best friend all the time? Well, in all honesty—me. I just have limits for how much energy I can give out to others all the time. And when I say constantly, I mean she will text me every day, and there never comes a stopping point unless I stop replying (which I hate to do bc it feels like a jerk move). She’ll literally text me all day if I don’t stop responding. I think she just reaches out to me mainly when she’s bored (which is often). And the thing is, I don’t want to constantly be on my phone. I’m trying to limit how much I’m on it in favor of getting involved in my hobbies/homework bc social media/tech can be time consuming and draining, you know? But last time I left her on read after a few texts (I was spending time writing), I came back later to a ton more texts, as if it would get my attention. Then she asked if “I was good??”, and when I finally said yes, I just am trying to take some time off from electronics/need some space, she kind of guilted me by saying she just got insecure because her old friends used to ignore her on purpose to be mean. So I had to let her know that it of course wasn’t personal and I would never do that to her, and I just needed some space away from constantly interacting/my phone. She also will try to spontaneously FaceTime me every single day (I’m not exaggerating, I get a call daily). I really don’t like to FT, especially not every day, so half the time I’ve just been ignoring the call and coming up with an excuse over text. Obviously, this issue could probably be solved if I just talked to her about it, but based on her past experiences/anxiety she might just assume I don’t want to be her friend/secretly dislike her. This of course isn’t the case, it’s just that constant interaction becomes exhausting (especially through technology). Any advice on how to maybe approach her about this and cutting back a little in a way that won’t hurt her feelings?",20Feb2020,1
293,"I have diagnosed depression and been having a really long episode it’s affecting my life and relationships heavily. I feel like I can’t count on my friends to talk about my problems and the moment I do they don’t say anything other than “that sucks.” When I feel myself I’m not typically a negative person but when I need to talk they don’t want to listen and deflect me by calling me negative. 

I don’t have the energy in my life right now to get out there and make friends. I don’t know what to do at this point in my life. I already scheduled a therapist appointment and it’s due soon but I still need at least a few people I can count on in my everyday life. I feel incredibly alone.

294,"I'm a 17-year-old female and I've been Bisexual for just about my whole life. Of course, I didn't know what it meant to be bisexual until I got into middle school, but I know I've always liked men and women. Over the past few years, I've only dated men. I've had good, bad, and terrible experiences, and for the past few months, I'm starting to feel as if I no longer like men.  Although the idea of not liking men isn't necessarily bad, I'm just concerned that I no longer do, seeing as how  I've been told sexuality is something you're born with. 

I feel as if I should be concerned about this because I'm worried there's something wrong with me (meaning I had bad experiences and now I've developed some issue with men) and because of it, I no longer want to be with a man. I really don't want this to be the case because I'd hate to change my whole sexuality because of some bad experiences. It's weird because every time I have the opportunity to be with a man, the idea has only made me anxious but I just can't imagine not wanting to be with a man again seeing as how I've happily been with them before.

Should I worry about this and try to fix this issue (by maybe taking therapy or something)? Or is it normal to have a sexuality change after years of being bisexual?",20Feb2020,1
295,"I don't know where to ask this, I tried on r/AskReddit but a moderator removed my question because it was too personal.

This is pretty recent, it's been happening for a week, but it highly concerns me. I never payed attention to it, but my dad has been keeping track of it, so today he brought it to light to my family.

When he picked me up from school the police officer followed us from my school, my dad noticed it and I kept my eye on him. My dad got gas and we thought he would stop following us, NOPE. There is a park a mile or 2 down from my neighborhood and the officer waited there and followed us til we pulled into our neighborhood. 

I took photos of the car and will proceed to do so until he stops or until it gets worse. If it gets worse, I'll start videoing the experience. There are three police officers that monitor the school when kids are being released, but there are still more. 

Around my area there are 6 police cars that monitor one road, I don't think there is any crime in my area, but there are a lot of old people and just starting families, and before we move, my dad searches for pedophiles or any other criminals that may live in the area, so I trust him that he did that research. I'm saying those things because this area doesn't seem threatening to me, and it's crazy that only 3 police officers monitor a school zone in the morning and afternoon, while 6 monitor a road morning and afternoon; and that road doesn't have many crashes happen. 

They've only been here ever since 2 months after we moved in the area. This concerns me because I've heard this girl in one of my classes talk to her friend, that a police man told her that ""he'll buy lingerie for her"". 

As far as i know my dad doesn't speed, and he drives a sports car. I don't know why an officer will be following my dad so close to his car that if he goes a little bit faster he could rear end my dad's car.

To clear up some stuff, I don't know much about the world of police officers, and why they may monitor one area more than the other. I'm stating my opinion and what's happening, I'm very weirded out that he follows my dad to my neighborhood especially after picking me up, there has been human trafficking in my area, there has been some officers found to be helping out the human trafficking, so I wouldn't be surprised if a police officer was apart of the trafficking.",20Feb2020,1

Something stupid I come up into a class that she and I are both in. It isn’t really important, other than that’s where we begin. One of my other friends, let’s call her EF(ex friend) said that a few of the people in that class had been complaining and blaming me for something minor that I didn’t even do. I told EF that she could tell BC that it wasn’t my fault and I was sick of the BS. I then told her nevermind don’t say anything, because I had been upset already when EF has first told me. The reason why I believed that it was BC that was complaining I’d because stress shears complaining in that class, and was always the ringleader of the drama. That’s why I didn’t want the information going back to her. Well, later in the day we’re all leaving the class together and BC says that we need to talk. I think, ok, we can talk. She proceeds to start screaming at the top of her lungs that I had been touching her inappropriately (I hadn’t) and harassing her (again no) and she had been having night terrors about me that I had raped her. She also proceeded to scream that I’ve cheated on my gf multiple times (which isn’t true I only did once in the story of honesty on here, it was over a year abs a half ago, and BC was involved in no way). I call her on her bs and she keeps raising her voice. Keep in mind we’re in a fairly big Highschool and we’re walking to class. She said that she’s never involved in drama, and she didn’t spread it, and then I watched her from the branching of the floor I had to go to keep complaining and telling anyone that would listen how awful I am. And kept doing it on the bus. What should I do? This really pisses me off and I want to come to her tomorrow but I’m unsure of what to say or how to approach it.

Today, I did not start with my group in the product room. I started with the facility/janitorial woman. This was a big surprise to me, as I did not expect to spend the morning this way. I was told that she needed the help, and they know that this is not the job I am here to learn, but with my past experience I would be a great help. I took a tour, cleaned the bathrooms, floors, sanitized, and such related duties with her. Her new assistant is starting this position soon, so why me?

308,"tl;dr: i fucked up my rib and couldn’t work but i couldn’t tell my supposedly emotionally abusive mother that out of fear so i told her i was still working and i don’t want her to find out and get hurt that i lied to her 

18m, been living on my own for a year, and have a rough family life i was running from. i have ptsd from a separate ongoing situation in my childhood which just makes all this even harder to deal with. 

anyways my mom has always been someone i struggle with. people around me call her emotionally abusive towards me and always have but i struggle to accept that because it’s still my mom. she’s very strict and controlling of everything i do, my money, my school, my work, it used to be down to what other kids at school i was allowed to be friends with and how i was even allowed to feel emotionally about things. i love her very dearly but we’ve always struggled and i’ve always found she hurt me often. 

i’m transgender and up until literally today (i got top surgery yay!!!) i had to wear a binder. i seriously fucked up my rib from over binding and using ace bandages as a kid (i know, i’m not smart, i was 13) when i got a real binder i wore it too often without meaning to and i ended up really fucking up that rib. it hurts all the time, so badly i couldn’t wear a binder anymore, and if i did wear it just to go to work i’d be shaking and getting dizzy and crying because the pain was so bad. i had to quit my job, i couldn’t go on anymore. but i was so scared of my mom’s reaction and her behaviour towards me about it that i just never told her that i wasn’t working anymore. it’s super stupid, it’s one of the dumbest things i’ve ever done i swear. but i knew she would scream at me and call me lazy and useless and tell me i would never be anything in life and i was so scared so i hid it. 

now she wants to declare me as a dependant on her tax returns (even though i’m not but yknow) and so she’ll need my income for the year. she’ll know it’s too low. 

money isn’t the issue, she hasn’t been paying for me i’ve been paying for myself so it shouldn’t be anyone’s business but mine where i get my money and what my yearly income is but since she’s insisting on declaring it i’m going to need to give it to her accountant at least if not her herself and i don’t want to hurt her feelings that i lied. ideally i was planning on recovering from top surgery and then getting another conventional job and just never mentioning this whole thing ever again but if she insists on seeing all my income statements that will all blow up in my face and i’m so scared of hurting her feelings. i’ve never meant to hurt her and i’ve been wracked with guilt since this started but i’m so scared of her i have nightmares about her and i was scared and didn’t know what to do and felt backed into a corner.  

sorry this is the messiest post i’m just freaking out when i should be happy and recovering from surgery because i don’t to hurt her and i don’t want her to hurt me back for this. any advice would be appreciate even i the advice is that i should go fuck myself because honestly at this point i just hate myself so much for this",20Feb2020,1
309,"
I am a female who constantly had fomo (fear of missing out) all my life because I’ve had very strict parents. I’ve always seen my friends or others at school going out and having a good time. When I moved out, 2 years ago, I finally was free and I went out to parties and  drank and had a good time with friends and everything was great. that was 1 month after I left home. Then I met my boyfriend. He had his fair share of going out cause his parents were never too strict. He had a really great childhood actually, compared to me who was constantly cooped up in a house because of my parents. anyways, we started dating and I still partied but it was way less then that 1 month after I left home. We have a great relationship occasionally fighting her and there but that’s normal. Fast forward to 6 months ago I did something that made him kind of question my loyalty. It was a very sticky situation because I lost all my friends and sort of caused a huge bump in our relationship because of it. he is now the only person I have. I constantly feel the FOMO because I see so many ppl with great friends partying and enjoying life. I’m now moving into a new student house and I will be making new friends and that means I’ll probably be going out to party but he hates that for me. he always expressed how he doesn’t want me to go out because he’s scared of what guys will say or do to me. I’ve never not let him go out and drink with his friends. Like literally the other day he went out to a bar with his friends and I didn’t oppose to it whatsoever, I just let him go but I was wallowing in sadness because he had a great time and I wish he did that for me.

I just want to enjoy my life and I love him so much but all I want is good friendships and some fun nights out and I 101% know that I’m not ever going to do anything to break his trust ever again but what do I do? 

My older sister always told me how she regrets not living her life to the fullest and I know so many people that regret not going out and doing fun stuff. It just makes me so sad, I already have an unfulfilling life and I don’t want it to keep being this way. 

He says he will try to fix his anxiety problems in order to let me go out but I’m not sure how much he means this. And even if he does am I a bad girlfriend for wanting to do this regardless of how much anxiety it would give him? We both are working so hard to keep this relationship going. I’m really afraid of loosing him and I want the best of both worlds.

Update: here’s the thing that happened 6 months ago to make him question my loyalty: 

alright I didn’t want to type it because it’s a very long story but essentially what happened was I broke up with him. A day later we get back because he expressed how devastated he was and I said I would spend time with him he took as me getting back with him, I even asked for some space to which he didn’t give me and I had no room to figure out what I wanted for myself but I am a person pleaser and I to him what he wanted. The next day I went to a party with some friends who thought I was still broken up with him. I didn’t tell my friends I got back with him bc they said they didn’t want me to ruin their drunk by telling them my problems. So I go to this party I get insanely drunk and high and next thing I know this guy is kissing me and I pull away bc I know it’s not what I want. But my boyfriend (Dave) found out about it and thinks I cheated. My friends think they can’t trust me because I didn’t tell them I got back with Dave.",20Feb2020,1

314,"Hey, I don't really use Reddit all that often so forgive me if I'm not using proper formatting or something.

I'm 19 and from Hamilton, Ontario (Canada) originally, and when I turned 18, I moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. I lived in the province before with my father, who's 65, but moved back home to Ontario after I wasn't accepted by his girlfriend for coming out as trans. (I was 15 at the time) Up until that point, I was with my father for my entire life because my mother wasn't exactly motherly/a good parent for a variety of reasons. I naively went to live with her in Hamilton which didn't end up being a safe place for me to be quite quickly  so I ended up going into the foster  care system and lived with an excellent family until I turned 18, at which point I had to move out on my own. The agency I was with does a lot for it's former youth, and it saves money for youth while in care &amp; gives it to them when turning 18 (mine was about $3k), as well as giving a monthly stipend of $950 CAD till I turn 21 which pretty well covers my rent. When I turned 18, I had a lot of guilt about leaving my dad's and being that he's getting older I wanted to be closer to him so I moved to Halifax on my own. 

Now that I've gotten backstory out of the way, here's the thing: I've been here a year and it's horrible. I work a shitty job for shittier money than I would have gotten back home, I know absolutely nobody in the city, dad is way out in the country and I see him seldomly because he doesn't like coming into the city. All of my friends, my grandfather, grandmother, and stepmother who raised me are all back home in Hamilton. My closest friend has been out to see me four times and I've visited home once since I moved last year, and while we've managed to talk every day I worry how our friendship will fare the longer I stay here.  I've struggled with depression for a few years and don't really talk to anyone about it other than my doctor so I feel like I probably seem like a flake and a slob to people which doesn't help my outlook on myself or life. I'm living a really lonely life here and it's not doing me any good mentally. All I ever do is work, sleep, and repeat. I have nobody to hang out with and despite having lived here for a year I don't really know the city. 

My friend back home has a basement her family is looking to rent out which is more than half the rent I pay here and moving back would pay itself off in a few months as a result. But on the other hand, (hopefully many, many years from now) when my father passes he'll be leaving me his cottage and I intend to live there.

So my question I've been struggling with is, do I stay here because I'm going to eventually come back anyways, or do I move back home at least for a few years? I'm really lonely here but at least I see my father more than I would if I was back home, but I'm going to come back here one day so on that hand why deal with the hassle. On the other hand, I'd have a better paying job, I would also see my grandfather who I'm very close with WAY more often should I move back home, as well as the rest of my family, and I'd actually have friends to spend time with should I move back home.

What do I go with?

315,"So recently my school is making all students (except seniors) fill out forms with what they want to do for their next year classes. We have this pathway thing where you can pick something that you want to make a career out of like medical etc. Well my problem is that I find nothing interesting at school and in life in general. I don't have a hobby or something that keeps me happy or look towards to in the future. So this leads me to now, as I was filling out my papers, my dad saw and asked which pathway I was taking and I told him I didn't find anything interesting at all, so i dont want to take one and he gets mad and starts telling me things like 'what are you going to do in life then?' And those types of questions start giving me anxiety and almost borderline existential crisis because i dont know what to do in my life. I do so many things like play sports, socialize, write , do art, but nothing is interesting to me. And it's really frustrating me because as of right now my family sees me as a deadbeat (despite me being 15) already because I don't know what to do in life. I know I'm too young, but I just can't find anything that appeals to me, makes me passionate about it, work hard for it, and achieving it, which makes me frustrated",20Feb2020,1

317,"Just to clarify I love this girl when my entire being and would drop the world for her just in case I sound like an asshole in this post. She’s my baby. I’m just putting my thoughts somewhere. 


I understand they get morning sickness during pregnancy. My girlfriend acts like it’s been just crippling though for almost the past entire month, to the point where I’m going to sleep after her, waking up before her. Going to work then coming back to find her still in bed sometimes. Every second of the day is her acting like she’s just in unbearable pain. I don’t know what to do but I can’t handle this. I’m not quitting and I’m not leaving I just need advice. The house is a wreck even though I do all I can, I’m just usually exhausted after work. That used to be her job. I have to take care of her and the house every day after I work and my job is a lot of physical work.. I haven’t had sex in over a month, and about 2-3 weeks from that one between the time before that when we were having it every other night. She won’t take care of me. Only herself when she’s “able.” 

Is morning sickness supposed to be this bad? Or could she just be partly faking so I’ll take more care of her? How do I even handle this? How long does this phase last?",20Feb2020,1
318,"Recently a lot of stuff has happened in the past month between school, my mom, and friends. 
First, I've noticed I don't really have any close friends to talk to about anything and I just feel in the way all the time. I notice how little people will talk to me and I'll just feel isolated all the time.
Second, school. I've realized that I have become unmotivated to do anything and my art teacher called me out on it at one point. (He's a good teacher andtherapist) 
Lastly my mom. My mom recently found out I had sex with my now ex boyfriend and has now called me a liar multiple times and alluded to calling me a slut as well. She thinks I was willing to throw my whole track career away because of the thought of ""what if I would've gotten pregnant."" She also wants me to go to a farther away college so I stay away from this other guy I have been talking to. She had me take the passwords off of my phone and laptop just so she can look through my phone to see if I have contacted him. I have cried almost every night for the past 2 weeks and I've recently started to notice how easily I get angry at school. I feel so alone and I think I have started to get small anxiety attacks at night when I'm alone in my room. I want to see a therapist and possible get actually diagnosed with depression if I have it but I can't tell my mom and I don't know what to do.

Tonight she texted me that they had broken up because he thought I was flirting with her. (I may have unintentionally.

320,"# Please read this short note first:

I understand this became quite a long post.  If you want a TL:DR, just read the bold text.  However, I would like to think that the rest of it is very helpful to understand the context of my issue.

\- - - - -

Like the title says, **everyone seems to believe that working together is better than working alone, but I find it unproductive.**  In case there's something I'm not seeing or understanding, I'd love to be convinced otherwise, though, as there are of course some downsides to working alone, which cooperation can supposedly alleviate.  But first, I'd love to explain the way I see things and why, as that may give you a jumping-off point where you can more-accurately address some of my ideas, which may perhaps be misconceptions.

I should reiterate, **I'm asking this because I believe there's a reasonable chance that I'm really missing out on something useful.**  I just don't see it yet, and I'm hoping you can change that.

\- - - - - - - - - -

\- - - - - - - - - -

**Let's say I have 70% skill in a given area and I partner with someone who has 50% skill in that area.**  The hope is that we would be able to combine our skills to achieve beyond either one of our limits of ability.  **The ideal is that we're greater than the sum of our parts, so, MORE than 120% effectiveness.**  I wouldn't expect this, of course, but it's a nice idea.  Not sure if it ever happens, but it's a cool idea.

**Maybe we're at 120% or perhaps a bit below.**  We combine our strengths and cover each other's weaknesses, but there's still some overlap, so we don't reach or surpass 120%.  **One would hope, at least, that we perform somewhat above 70%** as then at least there's some benefit to grouping up.

**But here's the issue that I encounter over and over and over.  50% effectiveness.**  In grouping up, often it's not the combined skill levels or even the greater of the two, or the average.  **It always seems to be the lesser of the two, if even that.**  Things they don't understand need to be explained, and things they do understand, they hold themselves to a lower standard of quality on, so I still wish I could do that, too.  Also, they are rarely, if ever, proactive.

\- - - - -

In another example, I have an interest in creating languages.  I'm currently working on one now.  Let's say I posted that language to r/conlangs (the subreddit for constructed languages).

**Let's say someone messaged me about working together on a new language.**  I'd be flattered, but also very hesitant.  Hopefully if I search their posts there and they've done some good stuff, it might go okay, but still.  **Conlanging is something I \*enjoy\*.  If I partner with this person, I'd only get to do half the work and I'd only be able to take half the credit.  Neither of those are good outcomes.**  I could learn from him/her, maybe, but there's no shortage of resources on the internet.  That's not particularly valuable to me, given the abundance of learning opportunities out there.

\- - - - - - - - - -

\- - - - - - - - - -

Here's a summary of the issues I have with group work:

**- If I have a weakness, someone else will cover it, which means that the thing I need to learn most, I won't learn.**  If they don't cover it, in my experience it's because they either aren't doing any work, or are doing the work I enjoy and would rather be doing instead.  First option is bad, second option is also bad because I'm not able to do what I enjoy, and am forced to learn something on my own without any help.  The only difference between that and solo work is the disappointment I have in my group-mate.

**- If I have a strength, one or more of these will be true:**

**- - - I won't be able to use it.**

**- - - I \*WILL\* be able to use it, but I'll stay in that lane and not learn anything new.**

**- - - My attention to detail and standard of quality will be much higher than that of others.**

**- - - I will do everything** ***else*** **and hope I can quality-control the work someone else does in my specialty, or teach them how to do it.**  Neither have been successful, in my experience.

**- If I enjoy something, I don't want to do less of it**

**- If I delegate work to someone else, I will be disappointed.**  If I have even some skill in it, I most likely could've done it better.

**- I hate having to share credit with people who haven't done their fair share,** which happens the vast majority of the time.

**- I usually spend more time babysitting than working.**  People need to be motivated (the majority of the time, motivated to DO something, regardless of quality), they need to be helped which 50% of the time just means googling their problem and clicking the first search result.

**- I don't want to be seen as a drill-sergeant or a nitpick, or as someone who is never pleased,** so it's pretty hard to hold others to my standards.

**- Someone who makes an honest but still relatively mediocre effort is bulletproof in my eyes, to my detriment.**  If someone's actually trying, I'm definitely not going to shoot down their efforts.  However, that basically gives them plot armor, such that I \*have\* to use the work they've done if they've really tried on it.  As a result, the quality of the whole drops.

**- Often group partners just aren't as passionate about the activity, or about attention to detail.**

\- - - - - - - - - -

\- - - - - - - - - -

Some relevant things about me:

**- I'm not really a leader type.**  People are often sitting around waiting for someone to take lead, and while I have a high standard of quality, I'm not built for leadership, at least not as I currently am.  If you go by that ""alphas, betas, etc."" model, I'm a Sigma by most definitions.

**- I consider myself a very intelligent person, and I hate saying that**, because I hate it when other people say things like that.  I never say this, and I only mention it because I think it's relevant to this question, and because this is a throwaway account.  **The truth is, this** ***is*** **a problem commonly associated with this characteristic.**  The reality is that I don't feel like I can rely on people to do a good job, just in general.  I can't *ever* just do my part and let someone else do theirs and simply use what they've done.  I always have to fix their stuff, to the point where it would've been better if I'd just done it myself to begin with.

\- I'm a guy.  It's probably not that relevant, but I figured I'd mention it in case you find it useful.

\- I live in the USA.  Also along the same lines -- not sure if it's relevant, but different cultures do handle things differently so it may be something useful to know, I guess.

**- I actually score quite low on Big-5 / OCEAN tests when it comes to agreeableness.**  However, I very rarely let it come out, because I don't think it's usually for the best.  Almost no one considers me a disagreeable person, but it's still in my nature.  **Point being, it's not that I can't stand up for myself in a group setting,** I'm just of the opinion that it's rarely a wise idea for the future of that project and of ones to come.

**- I'm currently an undergrad in university at a large, mediocre state school.**  In my defense, this is 90% because I understand my major's topic better than my teachers and because I'm just there for the piece of paper.  Therefore, the ROI on the \*added value\* of the provided education is very low.  The other 10% is because I wanted to be near my then-girlfriend and now-wife because that was important to me.  Also it should be noted that I'm honestly not entirely an *expert* on my topic, my teachers just don't have experience and as a result are teaching out of books and second-hand information.  They do their best, but they just don't have the experience.  The important part is, **I do understand that the average intelligence at a place like this is** ***going*** **to be low, and my fellow students** ***aren't*** **going to be as motivated or (for my major-related material) as experienced.  However, the experiences I reference go well beyond school activities and projects.**

**- It's not my social skills.**  While I feel awful and dirty spouting this stuff on the interwebs, you're also probably not just going to take that statement at face value (and neither would I).  People enjoy my company.  I married the first person I dated after three and a half years of being friends and then dating (this is at, like, 22, mind you).  I have great relationships with my parents (and hers), etc.  I have great relationships with my teachers, despite their lack of experience on the subjects I care most about.  As I mentioned, people *don't* actually find me disagreeable, in the slightest.  I mention these things because **if I were reading this, a lack of social skills is the first potential issue I would consider.**

**- I \*want\* to trust people.**  I love the idea of being in a group which is \*more\* effective than I would be alone.  However, what happens instead is that I find myself fantasizing about leaving the group and doing the same thing on my own with twice the success, just to prove a point.  I'm just frustrated by the constant disappointment.  I knew this was a downside of going to a school like this, but I was hoping to find \*someone\*.

**- It's getting to the point where I can't do everything myself.**  My ambitions are becoming bigger, my projects are becoming more complex -- I can't fly solo forever.  I can do every part of my projects myself, but there just isn't enough time.  If I had three of me, or... ten of me, I'd be golden.  Unfortunately, the scope is just widening to an unreasonable degree.

**- I really do want to find a solution.**  This has been on my mind for a long time, but it's been getting worse.  I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't really important to me.

\- - - - - - - - - -

\- - - - - - - - - -

Concluding thoughts:

This was \*a lot\* longer than I thought it would be.  **If you skipped to the bottom to find a TL:DR, as I mentioned at the top, just read the bolds and you should get a good idea of my main points.**  In any case, thank you so much for taking the time to read.  If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.  **Again, my main question is, am I thinking about this the wrong way?  Am I missing something?  Have you had this issue and found a solution?**

321,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend and I discussed this some and I don’t want to hurt his feelings that I’m not happy with the way the convo ended.

My boyfriend that I’ll be moving in with TOMORROW has a dog. She’s 3 years old and she is sweet and all but I can barely stand her.
She’s not entirely misbehaved, but she does not listen to anything. I don’t like sleeping with animals (dogs or cats) because I move around a lot in bed and it’s hard for me to get comfortable with something pressed up against me/blocking my leg space. He said that’s fine and we got her a dog bed and she’s been for the most part using it. She gets on the bed occasionally and I’m not sure how to make her understand that’s not okay anymore. He allowed her to do it until I came into the picture so I can imagine it’s hard for her to understand why it’s changing or that it’s permanent.
Another issue is her jumping on me. She gets insanely excited when I come over because she likes me. She jumps all over me until I’m in the house for about 5 minutes and has peed on me a few times. I explained to my boyfriend that I’m really not cool with that and that I don’t like animals jumping on me. I know she’s just excited and all but I think she should be trained better than that and it isn’t the best behavior. I told him about training her not to by going back outside for minute intervals and coming back in until she no longer jumps every time she does it to show her not to and explained how guests would need to do so as well but he said that would never work because his sister and brother in law absolutely love in when she jumps on them because they think it’s “funny” and “cute.”

None of these things are gonna be a problem in our relationship if we can’t fix them, but I would like to like his dog more. She really loves me and I’m never mean to her because I understand she’s just a dog and she doesn’t know better but I desperately want to teach her better since no one else has.

Anyone have good advice?",20Feb2020,1

I started hanging out with this girl from my school not expecting anything to rly come from it but she’s come to be one of my closest friends. We were friends for abt a month or two before each of us started questioning if we had feelings for each other and eventually she asked if I felt the same. We’ve been a thing for abt four months since then. I’ve gone to her with severe panic attacks and just being able to vent abt shit going on with my parents and I can’t imagine not having her here. I’ve never been able to go to anyone else with that stuff. I’m a sophomore and she’s a senior so she’s leaving in a few months after graduation. I know I should just try to appreciate the time we have left but it’s so hard sometimes. Even during the best times there’s always this part of me saying it doesn’t matter because it’ll all be over soon. I just can’t stop thinking abt it. I’ve never rly connected with someone like I have with her on an emotional level. I don’t know how I’m going to deal with things when she leaves and I know I’m going to be depressed when she does. I still have good friends that I can talk to but it’s not the same. I feel safe when I’m with her. I’m rly worried abt how much worse I’ll get when she leaves.,20Feb2020,1
324,"There is a girl in my friend group that I was informed was either going to ask me out or confess her feelings to me soon. Unfortunately I don't feel that same way about her nor do I think I ever will. I want to let her down easily though because I am one of her first crushes and I would be the only crush she's actually approached if she goes through with it. I think with her brother and sister-in-law being in my friend group as well I'll use that as my escuse.

You're a really good friend, but I don't think we should date or seek anything further.""  Would that be a soft enough letdown? Or do you guys have better recommendations?

It's not that I don't enjoy learning, it's that I hate learning useless bullshit. 

I never wanted to go to college. I only enrolled because it was ""expected"" from me. My relatives, and friends, said If I don't go I will work a terrible job (which I don't believe).

A lot of people have said that I will enjoy it more once I learn the stuff I want to learn but, as i already said, I don't think I can make it to that point. Currently, I have taken 0 classes that I enjoy because my associates requires all bullshit classes (gen-ed). I dropped my math class in the max of 1 week because It made me want to kill myself. I planned on taking it as a summer class, but, at this point, I might just drop out. 

However, I DO have a plan if I drop out. The only reason I wanted a CS degree was for the coding, which I figure I can learn on my own. If I do drop out, I was planning on spending my free time practicing programming and (hopefully) getting enough experience for a programming-related job.

328,"Backstory: In high school, I was friends with one of the biggest power couples. You’d think they would get married tomorrow. I was mostly friends with the girl (not the person of interest) and we always chose each other to work on math problems during our Algebra II class time. 

During one of the exercises, she says, “I’ve seen Frozen at least 3 times, it’s sooo good. You have to see it with me.” 

It took a couple times to convince me, because it had only been two weeks since this movie came out and I didn’t get the hype. It just looked like a cheesy cartoon I would end up watching as my couple friends’ third wheel. 

Boy, was I wrong on both accounts. Not only did I love Frozen, but the girl set me up with her best friend. The evening was officially a double date. Her best friend’s name (let’s call her Jean), was... just stunning. Sparkling eyes, kindred spirit, and a mutual interest in poetry! We hit it off so well. 

Fast forward back to me and my algebra friend, and she asks me if I like Jean. I didn’t how to respond for a number of reasons: A.) I wasn’t sure if I did like her completely, B.) she was heading off to college before I was and I didn’t like the idea of dating while we were on different paths. I told my couple friend after they both asked: I wasn’t interested. I even asked why the concept kept coming up when they kept asking. I feel so stupid for jumping the gun on my decision, for being afraid of what they might think or say to Jean based on what I said. 

I even invited Jean to my house one day for my birthday party, and the resistance was still there. I didn’t know if I should go for it. 

A couple of years later, I’m in college and I see Jean post a selfie on Instagram. Knowing her taste in poetry (also applies to her music taste), I commented with Guns n Roses lyrics: “She’s got eyes of the bluest skies.” She responded well to the comment and I, well, told her how I felt. She thought I was sweet and had a cool personality, and she wasn’t dating anyone... but she was seeing someone. 

I was disappointed and thought, “Why did I wait so long? Why was I so stubborn?” 

She never admitted to liking me back in ‘that way’, nor did my friends say so in the past, so maybe I never did have a chance. I can’t not deny the magic of the evening at the movies though, so I’m wondering if this kind of story could ever have a happy ending if I took action? I haven’t spoken to her in a year, but she posted a picture of herself with a formally dressed guy (idk who he is) and a sunset. 

What would I even say to her now, if anything, without sounding desperate? It’s been some time since I confessed, and I’m a much more confident person to try and reintroduce myself, but I don’t know if it’s the right thing to do. 

I’ll so appreciate any advice on the subject so I can gauge if my chances with her are done for good. I need to move on from this nagging feeling that I fucked up something that could’ve been good.",20Feb2020,1
329,"So, I (24m) work at an ACE Hardware. I've only been working there for about 5 weeks. I was the newest hire until they hired a new guy. Let's call him Adam. Adam is only 16 and this is his first job. Another key point is that this store is located in Georgia and has a gun store attached to it and is also run by other ACE employees. Adam has only been working there for about a week and a half. So, he's still adjusting and learning the the store, etc. To me, he seems kind of spoiled by his parents (likes to complain a lot, gets frustrated by doing minor labor). 

Today, however, was different. He had spent the better part of 2 hours in the gun shop just looking at guns and talking with the other employee running that shop. He was still on the clock and and was just chilling back there. Not only that, but I had noticed that he was looking at pistols and pointing them at different points in the store and dry firing them WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE ROOM. Now why wasn't the other ACE employee stopping him? Telling him no? I have no idea. 

My manager came over to ask how me and an another employee were doing and asked where Adam was. We told her that he had spent the last 90 mins - 2 hours in the gun room and added he was dry firing pistols with customers present. She said that wasn't good (lol) and that he shouldn't be spending too much time there on the clock without working because why would they have hired him? So, she goes over there and talks to him. I dont hear the conversation and help some customers while they're talking. Later while the manager is away, Adam comes to me and tells me that he is about to quit. I ask why. He says it's because our ""manager is so fucking annoying"". I just say ok and continue with my duties. 

After that, our manager made sure Adam has stuff to do the rest of the day and he pouted for the rest of the day.

The last time it happened I was given silent treatment and dirty looks for days before I just asked if everything was ok and he went off on me about how he has to do everything, I’m not helping, etc. I carry the biggest burdens and work the longest hours so I was really angry when I realized the silent treatment and outburst was directed at me. 

Here we are again in a tough week that’s given me OT and loss of sleep, and someone new asked me about a project he was working on. I’d been copied but not involved. I let them know they could follow up with him for an update which made him mad and he sent a generic yet specific email went out to the whole team (passive aggressively directed at me) saying that rather than referring someone to contact him for an update to just handle it ourselves.

It’s mentally taxing and exhausting to deal with these feuds. If I don’t be the bigger person and address it, he will be petty and absolutely spiteful.  If I do address it, I have to sit thru him blowing up at me and blaming me for all his problems and I have to defend myself for nothing and remind him I’m not the enemy. 

The core of it is he doesn’t handle change or uncertainty well and instead of asking for help he just brews a storm inside about whose fault it is and then explodes. How do I keep things amiable between us at work?  It feels like a catch 22.",20Feb2020,1
335,"My two closest friends (girl and guy) started seeing each other about a month ago. I am always there for them and don't expect much in return. I've been the shoulder to cry on, person to talk to, and opened up my house to them whenever they didn't want to be home or alone.

The past weeks I kept asking about them and they either avoided the question or told me that it was just in my mind. But I know them well enough to notice shifts in patterns about their attitude towards and each other. My mind likes to overthink and make connections based on what has happened and because of this I would lose sleep and just be in a depressing mood. They were hanging out without me, which is something that usually never happens. We literally do everything as a group. So that made me feel like that they didn't want me around anymore. I've always told them what was on my mind but they kept saying that it was just a last minute thing and that I was just overthinking it. 

Before I found out I had watched a movie with another friend and the girl. The girl told us that she was going to see another friend after the movie, but I didn't think anything of it. After the movie I went home and stayed in bed for about an hour before I started overthinking again. I drove to the guy's house because I couldn't sleep, needed someone to talk to and something to take the edge off. I drove past his house to park and noticed her car there also. My heart sank because I couldn't believe that they had been lying to me this entire time and made me feel crazy. I drove off and pulled over because I was tearing up and couldn't see well. I called the guy and asked if we could talk now and he told me that I would have to wait because he was on the toilet. I turn around and when I get there her car is gone and he gets into my car. He asks me ""what's wrong"" and I just confronted him about it. There were just multiple long pauses with an ""I'm sorry"" every now and then. I asked him ""why?"" and he just said that he didn't want to tell me because he noticed I was sad lately and didn't want to make me more sad. I got so upset with that answer that I told him to go. I texted the girl asking if she was awake and if we could talk. She immediately responded with ""yeah"" and ""im sorry."" When she gets into my car she just puts her hoodie over her face and keeps apologizing. She then talks about how I/We mean so much to her because we were there for her when her dog died and how she wouldn't know what to do if she lost us as friends. I was a little calmer about it because the drive gave me a little time to think and just asked her ""why lie to me? after everything I've been through (The girl I was with was a while ago was seeing other guys behind my back and lied to me about them after confronting her about it for a couple weeks) and everything I've done for you."" We talked for a little longer and I ended up going home and finally getting some piece of mind and knocked out immediately. 

I had so many sad and angry feelings the next day, but ended up deciding to forgive them because I was tired of holding on to those feelings. My mom asked me why I had been out late the past couple of nights and I told them about what happened and I broke down while trying to explain it to them. She told me that she couldn't believe what they did to me after everything I've done for them and told me that I should just take a break from them.

Its been about a week since I've stopped talking to them and I don't really know what to do. I'm not really angry or sad anymore. I've been getting out of the house, started going to the gym and kept myself busy at home.

339,"*This a massively complicated story so I apologize in advance if it comes off as confusing at times*

For the purpose of making the story more simple I'll give the girls fake names. The girl that likes me is named Aura. The girl that I like is named Jessica.

A little bit of background... I work with both of these girls so needless to say I have gotten to know them pretty well. Aura started working with me first and is the sister in law of one of the managers that is really good friends with me. After about a month Aura got Jessica to start working with us. I immediately thought this girl was so beautiful. Everytime I saw Jessica I perked up and got excited to see her. It wasn't long until I found out she had a boyfriend.

Fast forward a couple of months... I have gotten really close to the both of them. It has been a running joke between my friend coworkers that me and Aura should get in a relationship. I don't find Aura attractive so I have been denying everything. I still value her as a good friend though. 

Now with Jessica everyone has noticed that me and her always flirt. It is to the point where people are asking each other if we are dating. I always go out of my way to talk to her and pick on her.she returns the picking and even initiates it just as much. She also talks happily about her boyfriend occasionally. I am not a homewrecker so I just feed what she wants me to say and try to be respectful of her relationship.

Jessica found out Aura actually likes me recently and is encouraging her to say something to me about it or ask me on a date. I am going to have to respectfully decline on the basis of keeping the friendship with her brother and sister in law even though that's not the full truth.

I just don't know what to do. I really like Jessica. I also don't wanna date Aura. I guess I could just keep them both as friends, but what would you guys do?",20Feb2020,1
340,"I have this stupid personality that I get annoyed by the smallest thing easily. Yes, I realize it is stupid, but when that happens I can't think of any better and convince myself that I have the right to be upset.  
  
Today I visit a friend from in a city, she promised me that she was gonna pick me up at the station to walk together to her workplace. Later on, she said it's better if I walk to her workplace by myself because she was still teaching, and picking me up and walking back to her place again will be waste of time and not efficient.  
  
She didn't send direction because the location a massive university area, it is too big and navigate with directions will be too complicated, so she sent a maps location instead. Now, in my country internet connection is trash I already told her, I can't get real time location update and ended up wasting 30 minutes trying to find her place by asking people around. Haven't met her yet or her location, I got upset and went back to the station and go home instead.  
  
There was also time when my friend promised me to take a bus together to help her to pick &amp; buy a notebook. The bus was at 13.12, I didn't have any plan that day and was only leaving the house to go helping her buying notebook. I was at the station already at 13.05 waiting for her, then 13.12 the bus was there, my friend was not there yet. The the bus left, my friend arrived 2 minutes later, running, said sorry, she asked to take the next bus. I said no right in front of her, I went home.

341,"This is in CA: 
I bought a used car from someone about 2 months ago and had it parked at my house. The first day I park it on the street it gets towed and impounded for expired tags/registration. 

I hadn’t brought the title to the DMV to transfer it yet or anything. 
It is currently impounded and all I have is the title from the person I got it from. 
It can’t be registered because of unpaid tolls. 

So how can I get some type of proof of ownership from the DMV without registering the car? 
Can I transfer just the title into my name? And will they give me some document that can show proof that the car is mine before the actual title arrives in the mail?

Anybody that knows how these things work out here I’d really appreciate the help. 

TLDR
I bought a used car which got impounded. 
I never transferred the title to my name. 
The car can’t be registered because of unpaid tolls. 
How can I transfer the title, or get proof of ownership without registering the car?

342,"Hey there, new poster on this thread (and relatively new posting on reddit in general).

I just wanted to ask if I'm spoiled and kind of delusional based off the stuff my parents say about me or if what they say isn't exactly all truth. 

On a previous post on a different thread, I'd talked about how my conservative Catholic parents found my birth control (Im 20F) and how they cried about how they give me everything and this is how I repay them, slapped me across the face, etc. I have a boyfriend of 6 months and was sexually active even before him (but they don't know that). We didn't talk for almost two days because I just didn't really want to see them. 

When they finally did talk to me, they demanded an apology, so I said ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" and ""I'm sorry I hurt you."" But they wanted me to specifically apologize for doing it. Talked about how I hurt them more than it hurt me, and when I tried to say how i just have different values and that I am not defined but this one thing that i did (ie: have sex, use bc), I got slapped across the face again. They went off and kept telling me how much they sacrificed for me. 

If you want a shorter read, skip to the part where I say ""Anyways, back to the point.""

I was telling them how they have crazy expectations of me (good GPA, certain public image, can't be out too late and have to report to them everything) and they said bullshit, I was the one who chose my education path (I want to be a doctor), when in reality my mom's been encouraging hard, well paying jobs (lawyer, dentist, pharmacist) on me and my 13yo brother for as long as i can remember. I feel so constrained around my mom because she gets pissed off at the slightest joke that she may perceive is offensive. anytime you call her out for being offensive herself? ""I'm so sorry. That's how I think and you can't change that."" 

I tried to explain how I just wanted to be able to choose to do what I want to do (ie; go out whenever with who i want to without anxiety, date who i want to, have a private sex life) because I am an adult, and was told that I'm still too young to understand. I get the impression that they get that I have different values then they do but they just refuse to accept it because i have to have theirs, continuing to argue with me saying they know what's best. They say stuff like how everything they look at me all they can think of is what i've done and how i'm a waste now, as if i won't be able to become what i want to be because i've had sex. 

Anyways, after a while of arguing and getting yelled at I gave in and apologized just so it was over. Was told I'll be kicked out of the house if I continue having sex. I am incredibly exhausted at this point and just agree to everything that is being told to me. Before I went to my own room, my dad said ""okay do you have any more demands? Any more to ask from us?"" and I just couldn't take it anymore. At this point, I'm convinced i'm the bad guy for making them hurt so fucking much, and that i'm entitled and spoiled, which is why i'm here. 

Anyways, back to the point.

I was told that I was given everything. If i was raised in the Philippines (where we're from), I wouldn't have had all this. My dad also said I'd be dead now after doing this if I was there. I was told that I was already given the freedom to go out and do whatever I want (to an extent, true). They provide for me, and allowed me to go away for university, where I'm living with my aunt. Told me how they've never pushed anything on me. Told me how my friends are bad influences and aren't on the right wavelength. I'm a smart girl with a good GPA, working hard to juggle extracurriculars, a job and school so I can get into med school, and I am a great older sister to my brother. We always argue about freedom and going out, and I always end up feeling like maybe they're right maybe they're spoiled. My friends think they're just controlling but I don't know. 

I guess I just wanted an external opinion on it, and also, how do I change it? How do I stand my ground during arguments with them? I always lose all my great points upon speaking to them and I can't tell them how I feel without crying. If I am just a brat, how do I make it up to them? How do I stop being so rebellious?",20Feb2020,1

My maternity leave ends in April so I have to go back to work and finish this school year. My dilemma is about the next school year. I've started considering taking the 2020-2021 school year off - which means quitting for a year. I'm so torn up about what to do. Here's my problem.

Reasons to stay home:
I WANT to so badly
My husband is supportive of it 
I can get a job teaching online for extra money
We can dip into our savings
Won't have to pay for daycare
I don't want to send my baby to daycare so young
I can nurture and teach my child every day
I'm getting burnt out at work and this could be a way to make a change when I go back (new school or district maybe?)
We have family around who would probably help with money if it came down to it
It's a fairly easy career to take a break from and get back into
She's only a baby once
It took years and a painful miscarriage to have this baby and I want to enjoy motherhood

Reasons NOT to stay home:
MONEY. My husband's paycheck will barely cover the bills
We will lose health insurance for myself and the baby
I like the team I'm on at work
I feel guilty not working, like I'm not contributing
I currently make more money than my husband
I could qualify for $5000 student loan forgiveness if I do one more year
If I teach online to kids in China I will have to work at 4 am
I may miss working and get stir crazy

I know I'm going about things the wrong way and I know that I can be better but i simply don't?

I used to go to the gym every day and read / paint, now all I do is come home from work and sleep or lounge around.

I don't even take my vitamins anymore. 

I shower twice a week. 

Obsess over cleaning my ears and underneath my nails daily. 

I've even begun having thoughts that I know are outlandish and can be harming to my pysche (eg : 'God / the universe / any higher power if there is one has put me through so much trauma / sadness bc they are sending me a message to give up this life and transfer my soul into a different vessel / life)

I've tried talking to my partner about things but it isn't helping there's only so many times you can bring up your r*pe before it just jumbles into a repetitive game.

I've been off of antidepressants for a year now could this be affecting me? I don't want to be on drugs, I don't want to go back to group / 1on1 therapy.

I want to be happy. I don't want to feel this way anymore.

No sleepovers, I’m not usually allowed at friends houses, she bans me from seeing half of my close friends because she finds small faults with them. I’ve been banned from seeing one whole side of the family because she claims one of them looks like a child molester, and doesn’t even have any reason to believe it. Now I have no relationship with my family. I live in a very nice, wealthy neighborhood with very low crime. There’s mainly older people living here, and it’s really slow paced.

356,"Alright. I'll try to make this quick. I am a 25 years old guy with a rather unusual sexuality. I am into chubby guys around my age who have very thick lower body (SFW example: [https://pasteboard.co/IR3Cbr1.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/IR3Cbr1.jpg) the guy in the middle). 

  
So I found a guy who lives in my city on instagram around 5 years ago who I fell for almost instantly. I've never interacted with him or seen him in person, but I really want to know if there's a chance for me to have something with him. Though we have never interacted online, there is a possibility he is already aware of my existence because of my occasional checking of his instagram stories, which isn't usual for a man to do to another man especially if you don't know each other. So last week this guy posted a screencap with his league of legends account and I immediately saw this as a chance to contact him.

Simple, I create a throwaway account on league, talk to him and see what happens. Problem is, I don't know how to talk to him, what to possibly say and if I should actually do it. I just don't want to go ahead in life thinking I didn't try, but this is also a very morbid circumstance in which to meet someone.

I don't know about his sexuality, which is what complicates me the most. As far as I'm concerned, he's never had a girlfriend (now 24), he has many female friends with whom he jokes in rather inappropriate ways, or would seem inappropriate if he were straight and has a bit of a tendency to overshare on the internet about what he's doing.

And this dog came to us and I instantly knew it was her. It was my dog. I checked the old pictures (bc she was a puppy back then) but the only thing that changed was that her coat was a little lighter. I cried and was so happy and I took her home. But the problem is that my other 2 dogs didn't accept her. Those 2 dogs are her mother and brother. The brother accepted her but only because he wanted to hump her, but her mother attacked her. So I took her back to the place where we found her. She was well fed and clean and looked like someone was taking care of her so I assumed she just escaped from someone's garder bc there are houses there. And if she was a stray dog I would have seen her in those 2 years bc I go there often.

365,"I’d like to remain anonymous but my mom and my dad are separated and they live in two different states I lived with my dad my whole life and when I was 13 or 14 I had consensual sex with my best friend he was 18 or 19 at the time and a couple days after that I moved to the state my mom was at and met her. 
   When I moved to a different state I got into a relationship for 6 months it was my first serious relationship. When I moved back to my dads we tried to make it work and we ended up breaking up. I was very upset and sad. I was 15 at the time I ended up hanging with the same friend trying to cheer myself up. He tried to make out with me and I said no I wasn’t ready for any of that he said okay and later on that day we went to his house to watch a movie. I was very tired and ended up falling asleep while watching the movie and I woke up to him touching me I asked him to stop multiple times (I should add I was also in a dress) he kept touching me and ended taking off my underwear. I started to freeze up because a year before that I was drugged and raped and the ptsd was of everything made me freeze. After he was done and I realized what just happened I started to cry and asked him to take me home he did.
   I was a total reck and didn’t tell anyone he kept texting me asking me to hang and I never responded to him until one day he asked why I wasn’t texting him I told because I asked him to stop multiple times and he didn’t he replied with I know I’m sorry it won’t happen again I screenshoted the messages and went to my dad about it. I was crying and I was scared he was gonna judge me. My dad and stepmom were really supportive and we went to the police I’m 16 now almost 17 and the case is still going on. The guy tried to contact me multiple times once he found out he had a warrant out for his arrest. He got locked up in November of 2019 but got out in December for Christmas finding that out destroyed me. His friends have been sending me threatening texts and even some people have told I’m dumb for going to the police because we had sex before. The people working on my case told me even though we had sex before I was a minor and he was an adult and he new my age. The hole situation put me in such a dark place and I ended up moving out of my parents and a lot of my life style has changed I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just scared did I do the right thing?

371,"Hi,

I'm a Master Of Philosophy, Med Biotech student. For the past year I have been working on a research project I came up with, and designed with my girlfriend at the time. She was the one who helped me get into this degree, who helped me overcome my fear and anxiety during my interviews with supervisors, and who gave me inspiration.

Before her, I never felt I was capable of doing research, I thought I wasn't smart enough, determined enough or good enough in my field to succeed. But she made me believe in myself.

Well, she recently left me. And I feel like when she left, she took all the reasons I was doing this with her. 

Every part of my project and my thesis reminds me of her, and instead of the desire to make her proud and do well, all I have now is pain when I try to write.

How can I find motivation, and overcome this problem? How do I force myself to work on my thesis without the core reason I was doing it?",20Feb2020,1
372,"So I met this guy when I was 12 and he was 15 on a Minecraft server. He is from North America, I am from Australia I am a shy person in real life and he is very outgoing so I felt comfortable speaking to him. I was so happy to feel accepted by someone as in real life I was and still am struggling with making friends, I would each lunch in the bathroom stall, never have anyone to talk to and all that other stereotypical loser shit. I am now 14 and he is 17 and we still talk daily, it has always been just a friends. 

Everything about our relationship is fine except for how I am obsessed over him. Since we met and he revealed more information about himself, as well as stalking him online I know know is full address, extended family, have access to his friends private instagrams via fake accounts, have baby photos of him that he didn't give to me, know where is father, mother and step mother work, some of his passwords, the address of his job, the daycare, kindergarten, elementary, middle and high school he attended/is attending and lots of over stuff. I fantasise about having a relationship with him 24/7, his birthday is my passcode on my phone and I consider him my only real friend. 

As he treats me like one of the guys, he tells me about girls he likes/is talking to online, his crushes, him asking girls out etc. I act like I'm excited for him and convince him to go for it but while i'm typing those encouraging messages I'm crying. I am so jealous of them. It literally feels like i'm encouraging my partner to go cheat on me. When he tells me about these other girls I stalk them and end up probably knowing more about them then he does, I am not proud of this but on multiple occasions I've bullied these girls anonymously online, which I regret because they're probably lovely people, I just envy them so bad and need to at least try to bring them down to my level. He hasn't had a girlfriend since we first met.

If he takes more than a couple minutes to reply to me when I see he's online hasn't told me he's doing anything i'll get really upset and angry. When he says goodnight to me but I see he's still online 20 minutes later, talking to someone who isn't me I feel so hurt and worthless.

This is basically a cry for help lol, this is affecting my life outside my phone and laptop, I've lost friends due to not being interested and always on my phone, skipped school to play games with him and my grades have gone from As and Bs to Cs and Ds. I know this behaviour is unhealthy that's why I'm asking for your advice. My ideal situation is to lose my feelings for him and stay good friends but I don't know if that's even possible. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read all of this  &lt;3 I hope I can get some help.",20Feb2020,1

anyways, her response was: ""i don't know i'm pretty busy right now""...

 and i said something like ""oh okay! maybe during spring break, summer or something"", and she said ""okay"", and then stood there for a few seconds before I said ""well see ya!""

380,"I have this friend. I talked about how uneasy I felt abt them sometime last year but back then I didn't know why I felt so afraid of them until recently when I started to get input from others. *Skip the bracket parts since these next paragraphs are just details of this relationship.*

[**Before I talk about them, I want to also include that out of boredom, we messed around with Tumblr's theme codes and was building a theme together.

So, about this ""friend"", let's call them Sam: They tend to stir up drama wherever they go by gossiping about others, butting into current drama to ""get the whole story"", crossing boundaries by suddenly dropping inappropriate or triggering things in chats without warning (they had once commented about ED when we were talking about desserts) and no matter how much I wanted to stay positive, Sam would always find reasons to stay negative. And the emotional unloading.... There was a lot of it. So, like a coward, I went silent, ghosted them for a long, long time.

And for that long time I thought I was blowing it out of proportion: ""Sam had very bad childhood trauma compared to me, I should give them some slack. Sam might not know boundaries and I'm not doing my part to help them. Sam might be telling the truth about the people they talked bad about, even when I respected those people. Sam's highly opinionated, I'm just being sensitive. Sam might be right, maybe I'm being naive. It's not Sam's fault I feel anxious even when thinking about them, it's mine. Sam's never said or did anything directly hurtful to me, I'm just overthinking things.""

This isn't to say I'm fragile being without faults. Boundary setting is an issue I need to work on, I overthink about the smallest things and rather than working on issues like a functional adult, I avoid the problem and hope it'll go away. Thus, me ghosting this friend in this situation. But, after talking with others, it wasn't until now that I realized that maybe this friendship of ours isn't the healthiest of friendships and that I can handle the situation better if we ever talked again.**]

vvvvvv *Skip to this part* vvvvvvv

Yesterday, I was in a discord chat, they saw me talking and said hi to me in the public chat. I didn't want to flat out ignore them so I acknowledged them and tried to keep it to a general ""Hi, nice to see you again. Yeah, I'm doing good."" But now they want me to go back to coding themes again and posting it on the discord for people to use. *I don't want to.*

But I know if I refuse they'll most likely 1) demand to know why and then say my reasonings are just excuses so that I can avoid them (which is true, don't get me wrong but they've done this to my best friend and several others), 2) talk bad about me to someone who is willing to listen and 3) guilt trip me about ghosting them. And no matter how I look at it, I do feel guilty, I feel like I should've stuck around instead of running off. But I also feel like normal friendships shouldn't be so scary and so focused on ""keeping the peace"".

Can I get advice on how to say no (and setting boundaries) while avoiding a potential fallout?

If a fallout can't be avoided, what do I do?",20Feb2020,1

383,"Here we go again. The porn issues. While some may believe it is normal, others may think it’s not. Personally for me, my fiancé watching porn makes me feel super insecure. I feel like I’m not good enough. I feel like I don’t meet the standards. Like i don’t have the boobs, the butt, the body. Thinking of another female giving him that sensation of pleasure is quite challenging for me to accept. My fiancé and I have been together for 4 years now. Engaged for 2. He’s honestly the best person I’ve ever met. My best friend in fact. However, this porn thing has gotten way out of control. He knows how I feel about it. And he admits that porn gets the best of him sometimes and tries to not get tempted by it. But he always gives in. About 1 year ago I expressed how I wish he wouldn’t depend on porn. I told him how I felt about it. I asked him if he could give it up knowing how much it hurt me. Without hesitation he said yes. He’ll do anything to make me happy he said. Well for that whole year I asked him here and there if he ever felt like watching porn? Or if he had watched it? I told him to be honest. He got defensive and said porn was way gone from his life and even made fun of the guys who watched it. Well, about a month ago I finally caught the lie. We were watching a video on his phone when all of a sudden the video closed out. I grabbed the phone and to my surprise he got really defensive about me grabbing his phone. I knew something was wrong. He started shaking and stuttering. After asking him if he had anything to say for the 100th time, he finally gave in. He admitted watching porn for the past few months. He lied. He manipulated me into thinking he actually gave it up. Sex was great the first month I thought he gave it up. Soon after our sex life started deteriorating. It finally clicked as to why we weren’t as sexually active. I would always ask him if we could be intimate. Majority of the times he didn’t want to do anything with me. I suggested we try something new? I asked if there was anything I can do to better our sex life? I did everything a girl could possibly do to try and make their significant other feel wanted and vise versa. Soon after I found out he was watching porn he went to confession in efforts of committing to never watch it again. I still couldn’t believe he managed to lie to me throughout the past few months. I didn’t believe anything he said to me from that point forward. In fact I still don’t trust him. I feel like everything he says is a lie. Well it doesn’t stop there guys. After him realizing that porn was really affecting our relationship, he finally knew it was time to let it go. I still didn’t trust a word from him. He was okay with that because he knew how much he hurt me and I can tell he felt very bad about it. Anyways, on Valentine’s Day, I decided to check his phone (probably not the smartest idea) and to my surprise, I find yet again, another pornhub website on his browsing history from that same morning! Seriously!? On Valentine’s?? (Sorry, I’m ranting now lol) Well, I was livid. I told him he could come to me whenever he felt tempted. I asked him to be open and honest with me. I made sure he felt comfortable coming to me about these things but clearly the message didn’t go through to him. At this point it’s not so much the porn, but the dishonesty and the lies are killing me. He knows that. I’ve told him so many times that I am here to support him when he’s feeling the temptation. I don’t know what else to do? He’s admitted to watching porn in the school restroom. School restroom!! Is this guy addicted to the stuff? I don’t know. Someone, anyone, please advise me on the best thing to do here. This guy is my best friend. I’ve been nothing but supportive. He knows how I feel about all of it. I am still planning to spend the rest of my life with this guy but man, he is not making this easy for me. The trust issues, the lies, dishonesty, I’m sick of it. I’m sick of the thought of other girls giving him the pleasure I don’t give him. He’s told me things I should improve on (sex wise) I’ve done it and yet he still seeks porn even after telling me how much better I’m doing. Please help! :(",20Feb2020,1

393,"Context: I am a 17 (M) years old and Asian in my senior year of high school. I also have a twin. I have very traditional parents. Throughout high school, I have always done what I have been told. I have never been to a party, always chosen to stay away from drugs, and studied my life away. I am very successful in high school, and I have also been very successful in outside activities. 

Situation: I am in my last semester of high school, and I just started talking to this girl. I didn't talk to her with plans of dating. She asked me to go to prom with her. When I asked my parents if I could go, I got emotional because they always want me to compromise fun I have never had. 

Over time we started to develop feelings for each other. We started dating, but I didn't tell my parents. And somehow it started to spread between our friend groups that we are dating. 

I decided it would be best to tell my twin about a couple of hours ago because it would be best heard from me instead of other people. I talked to her about it and she says she needs time to think about it. She didn't suspect anything, but I just told her. I am scared she is going to tell my parents. 

My point of view: My parents always want me to compromise. They always ask a close family friend in college about things and they seem to think I should always compromise. They think it will ruin their image and their relationships, so in order to prevent that, I should always listen to them. Before this even happened, every time I choose to just hang out with someone (particularly a girl) although it is NOT a date, they start to make assumptions and question my twin on what is really going on. I hate it. I am beyond frustrated with the fact that they want to save their own face but disregard how I feel. You know, I get it. They don't want me too distracted, but I have never done badly in school; I am at the top of my class. I don't understand if this is a trust issue, but before this, I didn't hide anything.

My grades have been suffering, and I have recently fallen into depression. I am currently enrolled in college, and I have two roommates that I don't particularly like, but they're almost never in the room because they're almost always at their girlfriends' places. This means I come home to an empty dorm with no one to talk to. This is when I start to think about my past, and I start to feel worthless due to past toxic relationships with my friends from high school and from college last year.

Every day I cry and think about killing myself, but I am very grateful for the close group of friends I have this year, especially because they are decent people. Although they are my close friends, I only just met them in October, and I would just feel like such a burden if I told them that I was struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.

He ended up finishing inside of me, and honestly, I didn't think much about it as we've done that a few times beforehand (stupid of me though). However, two weeks after this happened, I have been experiencing some cramping and my boobs have swelled up quite a bit. They're also a bit more sensitive as well. I know that these are symptoms that occur before your next period (which I should be getting in less than two weeks), and it's not really out of the ordinary for me, but I'm honestly just so paranoid. I also have been getting a bit more discharge than normal, where it has more of a lotion consistency and is extremely white.

399,"So I’ve posted on here earlier asking for advice on meeting up with my Internet best friend, but I need some personal opinions on whether or not he actually feels the same way as I do. We’ve been Internet bfs for 3 years and there are times where he’s dropped “hints” but I’m not sure what he means. Help plz? I made a list of the things he’s done for me. I would rlly appreciate if u guys can tell me if this is just how normal best friends act or there’s some underlying feelings for me too.

1. We talk 8-20 hours every single day
2. Morning and GN texts 
3. He’s pulled over while driving just to answer my texts
4. WILLING to download all of my fav shows and actually downloaded BARBIE movies to watch with me just bc they were my childhood movies
5. Purposefully stays up late at night to talk to me (has drank coffee/taken medicine too sometimes)
6. We have nicknames for each other
7. He can reference convos and quote me on things I’ve said months or YEARS ago
8. He remembers the birthday I told him 4 years ago
9. Mentioned once “Our first date has to be a dim sum restaurant” when I said I never tried egg tarts
10. “Jokes” about how his heart rate goes up when I say something sweet 
11. He has me as a favorited contact and told me he saved the color Gold especially for me (he has an android so idk how it works)

However despite all of this I still don’t know where I stand :( there was a time when I asked him something and he replied saying “(my name) u know I love u...” and I just assumed that he means it in a best friend way. Plus he’s never had a crush before so maybe he’s just being extremely comfortable with me....",20Feb2020,1
400,"To start I am 26 and I have ADHD. While I dont want to blame mental illness for all my problems it is definitely a hindrance to working a normal 8 hour job. I have never been able to hold a job for longer than a month usually due to my wandering attention, restlessness and severe depression that comes with working and feeling trapped.
You can't go through life without money, I know that well because I've been barely scraping by on income assistance for 6 years and my life is pretty shitty.
On top of the mental illness I also have a foot problem that prevents me from standing and walking for long periods of time. So all those standing for 8 hours for minimum wage jobs are out the window. 
So that's where I'm stuck, I want to be able to make money to improve my quality of life but I can't mentally or physically handle working a regular job.
What can I do?

I've got ADHD and a foot problem that prevents me from working a regular 8 hour job, how do I get around or over this and make money?",20Feb2020,1

I also work full-time, 40 hours a week at a low to medium stress level work environment where I get paid a bit over minimum wage and my hours of work are between 11:30am and 7:30pm. I'm torn because on the one hand, I like my coworkers, for the most part, I will have extended health care benefits in 6 weeks time, I enjoy having the independence that comes with having a job, and I hate quitting. On the other hand, the workplace is a little dysfunctional and there is a lot of back talking which I dislike. And with my work hours, it's difficult for me personally to get up early to study when I don't have an exam or assignment due soon and when I arrive home at night it's usually around 8pm and that's when I can eat dinner. After dinner I would love to relax and hang out with my partner, but I feel compelled to use what's left of my day to study. Then I end up feeling stressed about not having enough time to study or lacking motivation because I'm tired and also guilty for not giving my partner enough attention. I live at home at the moment and my parents would like me to quit my job and they dont mind supporting me so I can focus on studying right now because if I can get into the major I am interested in (computer science) I will be making considerably more money than I do now.

i feel into deep depression at a young age, i know sort of dramatic for such a little issue. we stopped being friends and we both moved on. later at the age of 14-17 i tried my best to develop close relationships and friendships and never had success with it, i had the occasional good friends but no one i let my guards down for. 

i treated everyone well, even for those i respected and was close with i’d go extra miles for them just to be a good friend. nothing ever seemed good enough though, they’d end up choosing me last when it came anything. i have an ongoing issue with my social skills, when i get comfortable with people i eventually start feeling like i’m not good enough and i realize that they treat me like a last option.

i don’t know how to fix this, fix myself, i just had a complete shut down on everyone because i was invited late to a planned meet up with a bunch of friends. a lot of people planning to go are close friends of mine yet no one bothered to invite me or mention it to me. someone i didn’t even expect to invite me, ended up inviting me. i just feel sick of this feeling, i dont know how to stop caring.",20Feb2020,1
411,"Just to be clear I have never been accused before

Some context:
In my mind I am an absolute pervert. Like god damn. Of course glancing at girls asses and breasts, (I know lots of people that do that though so that's not the problem) the real issue is what my mind goes through, my friends are mostly girls, I'm basically the token gay guy that gets to go to girls sleepovers, but I'm a straight dude. I've never acted on anything, but some of my friends are really attractive, and some of then I'd love to fuck or cuddle with. I'm a loyal dude compared to my peers, my shortest relationship was a year and a half. I'm in a relationship right now and I love her so much, I have romantic feelings for her,  I still want to stay with her forever, but I occasionally get sexual thoughts about my friends, me and my friends are pretty tight so I've talked to some of them about it, and they get the same thoughts sometimes. This stuff is probably because we are all horny teenagers.

However. There is the dude in my theater tech class, let's call him PINEAPPLE, a lot of girls have issues with him, accusing him of sexual assault. Which to be fair I've seen some suspicious stuff, however, nothing incriminating. Me and him are sometimes similar, not in that way, but we have similar personalities otherwise,  (I still avoid him like the plague because he is a dick) I hate how sometime I'll be thinking of saying something and somehow the same thought I was thinking gets said by him. It makes me feel disgusting.

Whenever I'm around girls that arent the homies I am careful about everything i do, i avoid accidentally touching them, when I'm in the halls i make sure i dont accidentally brush my hand on their leg or stomach. 

A lot of times people dont actually know they are sexually assaulting someone, a lot of times its misunderstanding of how comfortable someone is. (Although it is still very possible for the perpetrator to be aware of what the other person thinks!)
Because the person doing it rarely knows, I'm worried I might accidentally make someone feel uncomfortable.
For example when my gf was in 7th grade she sexually assaulted a girl, she had absolutely no idea that the other girl didnt like it, there was alcohol involved, my gf didnt know this girl hated it, and eventually my gf learned that the girl didnt like it, and she felt terrible and instantly apologized.

I'm so scared because usually dudes dont get off easy for these kind of things, and I am really scared of getting it on my record. Every time I see PINEAPPLE I get scared some girl is gonna call the police on me",20Feb2020,1

413,"I like my engineering job a lot and I like when I get lost in it and find flow. However, lately I've been feeling lonely and desiring something romantic rather than platonic. I've had a few relationships, but I haven't met anyone in person I like in a long time. I started online dating and the whole thing bums me out, but I know someone who met a nice SO from it, so I know it can work out with patience. 


I go to the gym a lot after work, and I've been doing some intense workouts, but the endorphins aren't helping lately. I went on 2 hikes last weekend with some friends, and I still had this weight I couldn't escape from. I feel lingering guilt about semi-toxic friendships I ended, and to this day I still have mixed feelings of resentment towards them. I'm grateful for the friends I currently have though.


I think a mixture of guilt of soured friendships/relationships, and the inability to meet a SO organically in-person just gives me this feeling of dread, like all my effort means nothing. By effort, I mean I've considerably improved my life compared to when I dated before (in college), which was a confusing time when I didn't really know my path yet.

Her and I ended up hanging with one of my homeboys, and some pics got posted. His GF saw this, and *apparently* from what I hear,  people were telling her ""oh, he's cheating"", ""yup, I seen them flirting"", ""hunterdahammah set them up"", etc., and she kinda freaked out and started accusing me and him of doing those things, and people were accusing me of being at total fault for this for some reason.

She has since calmed down and been approachable, so I showed her from my phone who that was and that she was actually with me, not him. She said he cleared that up already, and apologized for being all petty, so I was relieved.

However, other people are continuing to harass my friend and I about this. I got a phone call from some guys ranting at me calling me a motherfucker and whatnot, and after I hung up I swear they \*69'd me and I had to turn my phone off. He says people shoot him looks and shit. WTF?",20Feb2020,1

Dave and I are both part of this friend group with like 5 other people and it’s not like I only know Dave, I know and seemingly get along everybody in the group.

But when we’re not in school, say on break, everybody in the group acts like a total dick to me. It’s not explicit or anything, but it’s more what they’re not doing, not what they do. They leave me on read when I try to start up a convo, they leave me on read in the group chat, it’s all super minor stuff. But they never treat me like how I would expect real friends to treat me, like how my other good friends treat me.

Dave in particular does shit sometimes that I don’t understand. Just a couple days ago I asked if he wanted to hang out and he said no because he was busy, but then just a few hours later I get pics from a few guys in the group of them all hanging out at Dave’s house. This isn’t a one time thing either, it’s kinda common. I always have to invite THEM to do things, they never invite me.

I know the logical thing is obviously to distance myself from them or stop talking to them entirely, but they make up like half of my close friends and I really feel like I click with them sometimes, but then obviously other times everything is shitty and they act like I don’t exist.

426,"I was very suspicious about the company from the moment of the interview. They all seemed to be almost too welcoming.

The background of this company is that it is a building surveying company, which expanded to photography which gained alot of attention. They only had one photographer to deal with orders so they have hired one guy and then an apprentice, me.

The main reason I took the job was because it was the first photography apprenticeship I had found in a decent area of my home in an entire year. It is an hour and 20 minutes by bus every day.

I still haven't got a course to go with it. He has hired me and THEN decided to find a course, and all he has even offered me so far is an online course, which I declined because anybody could do an online course which meant the qualification was worhh next to nothing. He told me his was unenthusiastic and my attitude needed sorting. I still don't have a course linked to this job. 

I have then had an incident where the manager wanted some amendments for an image set and she dealt with it by making my coworker go and make notes on it for about 15-20 minutes when it easily could've been sorted in 5 minutes. When I handed the amendments back to an admin apprentice I did a sort of small frustrated exhale. This got reported and I've just had to sit through a meeting where the owner basically told me that I'm not allowed to be irritated by the manager and I'm in no position to even question her methods. I told him I understand this, and that I don't want to be in ""a position of power"" with her, but I said that it worries me that I cannot say anything at all about how our (brand new) photography department gets treated.

And now we haven’t talked in almost 3 weeks and I feel like it would be creepy if I did but I think I have 3 options either I just try and forget it and move on, invite her to hang out with me and my friends or just jump right into it and ask her out but I’m really scared to do it because I’ve never been in any situation like this.",20Feb2020,1
441,"I have no idea what I can do to improve my life. But what I do know is that no one is coming to save me. No one will help me. No one except me. 
This life is 100% my responsibility. 
But like I said I don’t know what to do or where to start. 

I’ve gotten so much worst lately that I even have the desire to kill people who are in Better positions than me. People who have a social life, who have confidence, success, hobbies, talents etc. 

I have Almost nothing and no opportunities in life. All I do is literally stay home all fucking day everyday. I have so much more anger and hatred built up in me that I feel like lashing out at anyone who is rude and disrespects me.  

Every time I ask for advice on Reddit people tell me to just “get help” and see a therapist or psychologist. 
But i have. Many many fucking times and it’s never worked. I even see a new psychologist yesterday and they told me it’ll take a few weeks to get me the right therapy and help. Which is bull Shit. 

So here i am again... all on my own...

I can’t step outside because I always fear I’ll be attacked. Being attacked is the root cause of my anxiety. I sometimes feel like bringing a knife with me when I go outside because I want to be able to defend myself If someone wants to fight me. I’ve seen so many people who are willing to fight with complete strangers for such petty reasons. 

As for my hate and anger, no one ever takes me seriously. And no one ever will until I actually kill someone because everyday my desire grows even more. I fucking hate people, especially other teenagers who have what I can’t. Things like hobbies, friends, confidence etc. 

What can I do?",20Feb2020,1
442,"So in my friend group I am the only one who can drive. So I am always picking multiple people up and at the end of the day dropping them off when we hang out. Not only that I am the initiator. I usually have get togethers at my house and no one ever invited me over to their house. I am the one who usually says we should go to this place on whatever day. I even picked up my friends at a party I didn't go to and dropped 3 of them off. I work hard in my friendships and I dont receive it back. An certain event happened which made me stop texting these two people back in my friend group. One specifically with this one girl named ana. So I basically ask her if she wants to go to this movie because it's a movie I know we both wanted to see and then she goes I already asked this person. She tells me she didnt invite me becuase the perosn she invited had just responded back to her. After that so didn't reply. I was irritated because despite how much work I put in I cant even get invited any where. And after not texting her over the month I received 0 texts from her to even check up on me despite the fact I literally stopped posting on sc too and Instagram. I then asked my other friend in the group to ask her why she hasn't spoke to me and this was the first girls words.     “i feel like shes mad at me for not inviting her to go the movies w/ kaelyn but she literally never invites justin and kae to hang out w us anymore and they've obviously noticed that... i dont hate or dislike her or anything im just confused as to why shes been doing this? last time i know she talked to any of us was earlier this month when she vented to justin ab it for some reason and idk what he said to her cause kaelyn told me that happened and all she told me was that it happened” So bascially one of my other friends told me that he wasn't invited to the movie either so then I expressed how I felt and then he went and told the girl who was invited and not me and then told the girl I was upset with. ""Kae"" the girl who we invited, is usually busy and when my friend  ana asks if we want to invite them we are legit in the car about to go to the destination. If she wants to go wouldn't it make sense to ask them the day before since peopke get busy? I am not close with kae and I usually invite her to my semi large get togethers at my house. My friend who contacted ana even said that kae is busy all the time and my guy friend who I expressed this to lives 30 mins away downtown at college. So of course I am not about to drive all the way down there so we can hang out. She doesnt seem to understand how much double it is to drive people around constantly especially when you aren't getting gas money. If I invite them to things why can't they invite me? My friend who I asked to ask ana this tolf me she might think I dont like them so she didnt invite me, but does it hurt to ask? And dont you trhink asking at last minute if someone can go somewhere to do something is inconsiderate not

I got a really high mark I would say perfect mark on my test. 

My teacher (mr. alex) got a thing that scans the multiple choice and it turns out I got a perfect score.

He assumed I was cheating as he says If I had his test and shared it to people.

I noticed a few people cheating in class since they finished really early like super quick, I was like the last 5 left in class and stayed in for 2 hours. His remark startled me but I know I didnt cheat but I felt like he thinks I did. Then he proceeds to say he was joking.

What do you guys and girls think I should do? Im nervous to meet him again even though I know I shouldn’t be. My friend told me one guy was sent to the principal office.

444,"Super long post, TLDR is down at the bottom. 

I was raised in a very conservative town in religious family, the kind that sits around at family gatherings and discusses how the country is going downhill, you know the type. They never really talked about LGBT stuff too much until gay marriage was legalized. I remember when I learned that it was legalized I was so happy and I couldn't understand why, it was just this profound joy that lasted that entire day. That night though we went to my aunt's for dinner like we did most weekends and they complained about it all night. 

One of my (distant) cousins came out on Facebook after he heard the news and he was the talk of the night. They would talk about how they couldn't believe somebody like THAT was in their family, my mother butt in saying that he was a part of their side of the family and that her family was still ""untainted.""

I felt so much shame at that and I couldn't understand why, I wasn't gay, but despite that the shame burned and hasn't stopped since then.

I used to be extremely affectionate with my friends, but after that I kept my distance so that people wouldn't get the wrong idea. One night I had a dream that I kissed my best friend, I woke up crying because I knew we couldn't be friends anymore because that had solidified what I had been terrified of for awhile, I really liked her.

I was dirty, I felt guilty even looking at girls, every compliment I gave felt disingenuous, and I hated myself for it. I isolated myself from all of my friends at this point because I thought it would look suspicious if I just pushed away my female friends.

I dated practically any guy that was interested in me to prove to myself that I could and when we eventually broke up I told myself he just wasn't the one, there was nothing wrong with me, and that I'd just try again.

I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not gay, and I just cant do it anymore. I've looked back on my bast relationships and I was never happy, I never enjoyed the sex despite how hard I tried to tell myself that I did, I don't even really find guys that attractive now that I think about it. 

Im 20 now and I've been dating a guy for the past 3 years. He's a great friend, he's caring, he's funny, hes safe...but I know I dont love him in the way he loves me and I dont know what to do. I'm scared, if I broke up with him I'd lose my whole support system because I pushed all my friends away and the only ones I have now were his friends first and my family would most likely disown me if they found out why I left him. Plus we have an apartment together til December I cant just abandon him, we have to share a bed for fucks sake, and I know I cant afford rent in this city all on my own. 

I keep having this awful thought that even if I did leave him, I'd be too ashamed of myself to pursue a woman anyways so I need to stay where its safe, comfortable, and not lonely. I know that's awful and not fair to him but I cant help but think.

I'm just really lost right now.

450,"Two years ago, I (23F) tried dating a guy (31) in Cali, I live in Texas. It didn’t workout but he did fly me out and took me everywhere nearby. I had on Instagram a picture album with about five pics of me and the last one of him carrying me. The post said something like “i came. I saw. I loved.”

My boyfriend (24M) and i just recently became official. We started talking at the very beginning of the year. I post him all over social media. 

He asked about the post. I removed it without question and said how it flew by me because the first visible picture was of me. I apologized and affirmed that he didn’t control me but I felt that the picture didn’t belong in my life. 

My boyfriends response was, “I don’t have pictures with old flames.” I beg to differ. I look at his Facebook (which I suck at using) and he had at least 20 pictures with his ex, some of the things he told her he tells me now. I’m kind of hurt. 

I know we all have pasts. I know those pictures were put before he met me but, it does bother me that he still has them. When i mentioned then he said, “well yeah those are from my ex but i didn’t think anything of them” and changed the topic. 

He’s an amazing boyfriend, he treats me better than anyone has ever had. If anything. I had just prepared him a framed picture of our first valentine and a card just to find a post of him and his ex saying he doesn’t celebrate Valentine’s because he celebrated his love with her everyday. 

It’s hard not to compare. I know flowers, even different are still beautiful but I’m very hurt. 

I don’t want to be a hypocrite and ask him to remove the pictures. I just spent all this time telling him that we are equals and he said he was okay with me keeping that one pic. Thing is I immediately didn’t. He had had to know she was on his page.

And honestly, it's okay but not okay at the same time. I want a relationship with her, but I value the friendship a lot. But here's the thing: I've never felt such a strong, positive emotion towards  anyone before; not even with my ex girlfriend. I don't know if it's true love or not. I'll admit, if I ever hurt this girl or ever did anything bad to her, I'd end up being depressed and would regret it instantly. I also just want her to be happy no matter what happens. And I'm not obsessed with this girl either. I don't think about her 24/7. I have a life and in life there are things I need to focus on (such as family, friends, education, work, etc). It's such a confusing situation for me because I've never felt this way with anyone before and I feel like if I didn't meet this girl, my life would've been a lot more difficult and different.

452,"My gf of a year now asked that we go on a month long break, until her summer vacation begins and she comes back to our hometown. She's 2 hours away at a different uni, so it's hard already. I think her main reason for doing so is that she's just not enjoying my company as much anymore. She's also definitely not the type of person to see other guys during this break. We already talked about that being very bad. She also wants the freedom that comes with being single. Being able to party and such without worrying about cheating. 

I'm planning on talking to her again and giving her a week or so to decide what she wants to do. A month seems way to long. The relationship might as well already be over if we wait that long.

If she really wants to be independent, then I'm fine with that. A relationship only works when both people agree on it, and begging her to stay is just going to make it worse. I'm just worried that by limiting her time to a week or so I'm putting too much pressure on her(?). 

No matter what happens, it's been an amazing year. It's such a significant amount time that I don't think either of us will forget. And I'm not sure why this gives me some comfort but, at least for a while, I'll be the metric she gauges other guys on.

First, due to me not knowing anyone I got stuck in a group I'm not really happy with as the 4 other girls in it seem distant or just not people I would ever be friends with, also I tried to join with people I thought were nice but because there can only be five people in a group and because bearly anyone knows I exist I was lightly pushed out.

454,"I am in an odd predicament. I'm also on mobile and never posted on this sub so, sorry in advance.

I'm currently studying my Master's in Marketing (finish October this year), and I work full time in marketing (9-5, Mon-Fri, all that jam), with my current employer for 1.5 years. 

Trouble is, the more I study and work in marketing the more I miss my old job (English tutor 6 years), and the less I can shake the feeling that secondary teaching is the way I should go for my long term. For that, because of my previous degrees I can study a 2 year Masters in Teaching, and get a teaching job from there. 

I'm not worried about the workload, to be honest - it'll be the same as it is now and they've openly said they forget I'm studying while working so it's clearly not affecting my output.  The degree time also means I'd be mentally locking myself in from my employers standpoint to stay with them for *minimum* 3 years (since it's basically a year till I graduate this degree anyway).

What I'm worried about is the pracs. For teaching in Australia, over 2 years you do 13 weeks of full time prac (2 week and 3 week in year one, 3 week and 5 week in year 2). I will have enough leave saved up to take all but 6.3 hours of this as paid annual, but those are still huge chunks to not be at work for. I also need to maintain said full time job because bills, quitting to study is not an option.

In my head, I'm teeing up a plan for how to still keep marketing at work chugging along on prac weeks (evenings, weekends, scheduling stuff, etc), because I'm hoping that if I have a clear plan before I raise the idea to my bosses, I may avoid being immediately fired (ok maybe dramatic, but that's my worry right now). 

For context, I have very supportive bosses and a good work environment, they are by no means horrors. They are very reason-headed guys, and they openly say they want to support their younger staff to ""spread their wings"" etc.

I need advice on how to best raise the idea with my bosses of this career change and the prac I know I'll need to take off work, bearing in mind that it means them being supportive while I basically train to leave them ... Help.",20Feb2020,1

457,"TLDR at bottom 

Okay so first some background. Since I have been old enough to understand what a divorce is, my mom has made it an event every few years to let me know herself and my father we’re getting a divorce. This obviously messed me up growing up and sucked... but hey they never actually divorced so I guess I considered myself lucky. My parents got into heated arguments every now and again which I have always assumed are normal with marriage, the bouts come and go as seasons do. When they aren’t upset with each other they act like best friends and the dynamic is very cute. My mom is the one always complaining about the relationship, however my dad is complacent with a mediocre relationship and his kind of shitty communication. They both have their issues. For one my mom is very particular in her beliefs and likes things a certain way, she also doesn’t do much when we ask her to such as go out bowling/hockey or football games and she used to frequently when she was dating my dad. However my dad doesn’t communicate properly and answers a lot of my moms questions with idk and doesn’t seem to put effort into the relationship.. even after my mom tells him exactly what he can do (simple as him making a unique dinner)

So fast forward to tonight my mom informs me while my dad is at work he has expressed he no longer wants to work on the marriage. This had blind sided my mom and seems very odd. I am unsure if my mom is embellishing the story and he has said this after an argument as I was not at home for it, but seems like it came out of the blue. As of recent I have actually thought my parents have been doing well together having lots of fun and laughing.. guessing I was wrong. My mom expressed her disappointment and stress because she hasn’t worked in years and there doesn’t seem to be a great plan in place for her. 
I find it very odd of my dad to bring this up suddenly and makes me fear he’s met someone else. I hope I’m looking too far into it but here does my conspiracy theory.. the last few holidays/birthday my dad has gone out of his was to surprise my mom with nice gifts, which is newer behaviour for him as sometimes he doesn’t put much thought in - my thought is maybe he feels guilty gifting/being with someone else so he is compensating by gifting like this... because why would you show you care in a gift if you’re thinking divorce? Also the fact it has blindsided us makes it seem like there is some fuel to the fire aka someone telling him to divorce? And last I have noticed he has an overtime shift on Saturday night. He works in a factory and if they are doing shut down and such it’s during the week.. especially not weekend at night? Sounds suspicious to me.
I would also like to say I and actually closer with my dad but we have not at all talked about this as this was sprung on me tonight. I’m not biased against my dad I’m just really confused at what is going on.

P.S sorry for the length if you’ve stuck around this far. Also sorry for the grammar or mistakes I’m emotional right now and where I am it’s 3:30 in the morning so no one else is around to vent to.. so why not some strangers on the internet.. y’all are good at this stuff right?

I'm also trying to do my pre university exams which I'm gonna start the course in September and will take 2 years. I also want to volunteer for a cancer-based charity.

If it all goes to plan then I'll graduate around 31 and then I'm gonna face age discrimination in the job market so that's a problem.

Eni and I never had any obvious arguments or harassments but I've always been uneasy about Eni. It wasn't until ghosting Eni for a year and talking to others about my concerns that I've come to realize that Eni may not be the greatest person and I'm a pushover who runs at any sight of conflict. I'll also mention that Eni and I were coding a Tumblr theme before I ghosted them.

Yesterday, I was in a discord chat, Eni saw me talking and said hi to me in the public chat. I didn't want to flat out ignore them so I acknowledged them and tried to keep it to a general ""Hi, nice to see you again. Yeah, I'm doing good."" But now they want me to go back to coding themes again and posting it on the discord for people to use. *I don't want to.*

But I know if I refuse Eni will most likely 1) demand to know why and then say my reasonings are just excuses so that I can avoid them (which is true, don't get me wrong but they've done this to my best friend and several others), 2) talk bad about me to someone who is willing to listen and 3) guilt trip me about ghosting them.

474,"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20's and have been living together for almost a year now. I was employed until maybe about 6-7 months ago but due to a highly abusive job environment that impeded on my sanity, I ended up quitting. During the time I've been unemployed I tried starting a few side businesses to make money but nothing really panned out. Currently in the past few months I've been working about 8-12 hours a day to try to turn my passion into a business and I've been making some progress but it's still tough and I'm not really generating income yet.

Anyway, my girlfriend (who is a black woman) absolutely hates her job. The company culture is totally the opposite of her personality and she constantly experiences exclusion and social isolation. Not to mention there's been ignorant &amp; racist comments she had overheard from coworkers, and sometimes these were even coming from people who own the company. She hates the American corporate culture and doesn't want to be in it any longer. She doesn't want to get another job because she thinks that most companies are probably worse than hers when it comes to diversity and handling sensitive issues such as the ones she's dealt with and I can't blame her for feeling like this. Lastly she doesn't think she would get the same amount of money at another job due to her degree.

It was mutually agreed upon that I didn't need to get a job during the time period that I've been unemployed, although I have went to several interviews without getting any offers. The odds that I would make the same amount of money as I did before are pretty low considering that I only have an associate's degree and only a year of experience after graduating college. I'd also like to mention that we live in the one of the most expensive states in the US and neither of us have any financial support from our parents. Moving back in with our parents isn't an option for either of us, neither is going back to school. However regardless if I get a job or not, my girlfriend needs some way out of her job because most likely I won't be able to support her with whatever income I make. I'm trying really hard to market my business because I already have the necessary experience to make it work and it's probably the best thing going for me right now. I'm seriously hoping that it starts generating steady income soon so my girlfriend will be able to quit her job. It's just tough to expedite the process, despite how much I've been working on it.

Tl:dr my girlfriend is having mental breakdowns every day due to how much she hates her job. She can't quit because she's the only source of income and even if I got a job I wouldn't able to support us both. She doesn't want to get another job because she hates corporate America. Basically I'm just looking for creative/out of the box suggestions on how she can quit but still generate income. She tried Amazon FBA and actually was successful during the holidays, but now that they passed, she isn't getting any sales and isn't interested in continuing with it or starting on a new product.

To make you understand my situation a bit better ill give an example 

So last year my crush broke up with his bf and is single up and until this point. I started talking to her and things kind of kicked off, but whenever we start to flirt I start imagening how her ex bf fucked her and the images im my head pretty vivid so it's hard to ignore. This made me back out before anything big started to happen


I once tried really hard ignoring the images my head with another girl, but wrist started to feel weak and I felt like puking.

Each time I try to get into a relationship with someone who isn't a virgin, I start imagining their previous sex life and it makes me feel sick.

I tried being more mindfull and controlling my thoughts, but imagining things out of nowhere is something way out of my control.
It's like a bal that is one the edge and if it falls/rolls  it doesn't stop falling/rolling.

I am trying to change and I need a way to stop feeling sick everytime I see those images with anyone.


Normally I am pretty perverted, but I can easily control and sex doesn't bother me or makes me feels  sick. It's more like  feeling that the person I want to be in a relationship has been fucked and tainted.

I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post on, but I didn't know any better so here I am. 

Yesterday, I noticed that one of my old mail accounts has been hacked (must've been hacked some years ago) that I haven't used since beginning of 2012 or so. Since then, I've probably had 5 different E-Mail accounts and not exactly sure if I ever put said account as a backup account for any of them, probably not, but I can't tell 100%. I just wanted to ask if there is any possible  security threat and if there is, what can I do? I have changed my passwords on all my accounts over the years and there hasn't been any sign of anybody trying to attack me. (I'm always afraid that it could be possible that someone could hack my accounts without me receiving any E-mails from my provider to warn me, would something like that be even possible?)

488,"My housemate is over 20 stone (which is over 300lb for reference). He's trying to lose weight and has taken up a gym membership but isn't too committed. Unfortunately his diet plan consists of having microwave ready meals and only considering the calorie count when choosing - for example he will buy a ready meal that's 400 calories and call it healthy despite the fact that it's got 30% of daily sat fat and 25% of daily salt. When he does cook he doesn't have a grasp on portion sizes so he will cook and eat a whole 500g packet of mince instead of separate it into portions.
Recently he's stopped cooking and started to cook in the microwave - he made an omelette by cracking eggs in a bowl, adding milk and then putting it in the microwave. He also made a salmon and chedder toastie by microwaving the bread.

489,"So my husband and I are in our mid-20s, married 3 years. My in-laws got divorced a little over a year into our marriage. My mother-in-law went full mid-life crisis and bolted. She's done some really strange and irresponsible things since then. She is now engaged and more than likely cheated on my FIL. 

My husband's relationship with my MIL is obviously strained. It was never great but she put him in the middle of the divorce, tried to turn him against his dad, and tries to buy our love with gifts. But she is still his mom and was there in a lot of ways that his father wasn't, so we have tried to remind ourselves of this.

Well the wedding is a month away. My MIL wants my husband to walk her down the aisle. He doesn't really want to, we don't even want to go and we haven't even met the groom. 

But part of us is telling us to just do it. At least be there so we don't destroy the relationship forever. We will start having kids soon and don't want to throw our child's relationship with their grandma away before they're born. 

Well my FIL, who has so far pretended not to care, has suddenly given my husband the ultimatum that if we go to the wedding, he won't speak to us anymore. Up to this point in all the drama, he's been the more stable parent. MIL hasn't put the relationship on the line in the same way but we know the emotional damage would be permanent if we didn't go. 

My husband is trapped. His dad is his favorite parent but is obviously doing something super shitty. My MIL is crazy...and probably cheated...but overall has been a more loving parent. 

He honestly just wants to do the most peaceful thing. Personally, I am at the point that I just want my in-laws to live with their consequences. If this is how you treat my husband, then your access to us and our future kids will be limited and strained. If it were my choice, I would say fuck the wedding and fuck off to my FIL...but that isn't exactly peaceful.

490,"I’ll be twenty soon. For at least ten years I’ve spent my time occupied with the internet and procrastination. I had no friends in school, still don’t have any now, and I possess very poor social skills; which I’d like to change.

I’m about to start the last year of a university course which unfortunately I regret enrolling in.

To this day I still have a problem with procrastinating on the internet, and in honesty it’s because I don’t think I have a clear idea of what I want to accomplish in the coming year, or beyond. I go to the gym three times week, but aside from that I’m not sure what to with my time. What can I do to spend my time productively and live each day with a goal in mind?

492,"I've been having a very very weird and confusing problem lately. I can't talk to anyone about this, so  I'm here. Please if you plan to bully me don't because of this, don't. I have absolutely no self-esteem already and I suffer from severe depression already. I hate myself for this, it feels gross and wrong but I can't stop my thoughts. Basically, my problem is that I haven't been able to really be attracted to people my own age for a while now. No, I am not a pedophile, the opposite actually. I'm a 15-year-old boy and I haven't felt real feelings for someone my age in a few months now.  I first started noticing I'd get celebrity crushes and such on YouTubers and other famous people who were many years older than me, which wasn't a problem at all and is entirely harmless. However, the second this moved to real-life things became horrible. I don't know many adults in my life except, of course, teachers. The first one is in his 30s and the second in his mid-50s I think. I am disgusted by the fact I have thoughts or anything of that sort about people so much older than me, especially teachers. I will never do or say anything about this to anyone ESPECIALLY, not the teachers. I hate it so fucking much. I have extremely impulsive thoughts and whenever I'm around them I get disgusting intrusive things in my head that I can't get out and I would do literally anything to get just those thoughts to get out of my head. I feel sick. The worst part is that since they are teachers I can't focus in class at all and I get way too worried about speaking up because I get so nervous. I just want to be normal again. I used to feelings only for people my own age, but I'm not really sure what happened. As I mentioned my mental health is bloody abysmal, as well as the fact I have been heartbroken countless times(by other teens ofc). I was also in an abusive relationship with someone for a year and it has given me a large amount of anxiety when considering longterm relationships (my last 3 relationships have only been 2ish weeks long because of me being unable to function in a relationship correctly) It might be caused because of a mix of anxiety with relationships as well as fear of rejection, so my brain just automatically chooses people who I can project romantic feelings onto with no fear of either of those since I will never actually have any romantic or sexual interactions with them. Even if this is the case, however, I still have absolutely no idea how I would fix this. Even though they are both blissfully unaware, I still feel horrible whenever I'm around the teachers. I know they don't know what's going on inside my head, but they really don't deserve to be thought of like this. they are both really genuinely great people and very dedicated teachers, and I hate the fact my mind has to do this. Again, please don't make jokes or bully me because of this. I've been genuinely suffering. Please someone give me advice on what I can do. Also, I'm sorry for not going into a lot of detail but it's almost like If I don't write it down then it's not really real and I just wish that it really wasn't real. The best way to sum it up is that I have very strong romantic feelings as well as intrusive sexual thoughts, but I really don't want to go into any more detail.",20Feb2020,1
494,"I've \[F/30\] just starting watching Legacies (a spin-off of The Vampire Diaries) and have basically become obsessed with the show, one of the main couples ('ships'), the male character from the couple, and consequently a fan of the actor who portrays him.

I've connected with fellow fans on Twitter who've encouraged me to start my own fan account for the male romantic lead (and the main couple) because he's surprisingly hated for apparently being boring and I just really love the character.

I'm on the fence about creating a fan account because I feel like it's something that is mostly done by teenagers, but I also feel like I'm using the show and characters as a way of distracting myself from other things that are happening in my life, or rather not happening, when I could be putting that same energy into things that are more beneficial to me.

I've been advised by a few people that as long as it's not hurting me or anyone else, or stopping me from living my life, and is serving me in some way, then it's fine to do so, but I'm still not sure.

I don't know whether I'm just judging myself for wanting to engage in something that's quite often commonplace, similar to gaming and being fans of other shows/movies/artists, or whether it's my gut instinct telling me I need to really think about what I'm doing and whether it's really healthy for me to proceed, at least at the moment.

I do want to create an account and there's no shortage of pictures to post, as well as ideas I've got for it, but I'm not sure if it's the best thing for me to get caught up in right now, or whether I'm just listening to people who say that there's an age limit for certain things, and I feel embarrassed and ashamed at the thought of having an account, even if I also feel excited about it.

I know I'm obviously overthinking it and there's likely no harm in just making an account and if I decide I don't want it anymore, I can just leave it, but it's the not being 100% certain that I really want to invest time and energy into doing even that much, particular when I don't often update the accounts I already have and that I do have big plans for.",20Feb2020,1

498,"I'm 20, she's 21.

Me and this girl worked together as teenagers, and started talking again late November. Our first date was a little more than a month ago, we went on 4 more and I went to her house the other night. 

She was sick and I brought her Pho and we cuddled and talked for an hour or an hour and a half. We didn't do anything, but I did touch her ass which prompted her to touch my dick (off topic but... what). We were talking, and she asked me how many lovers I had, and I told her (3). She started counting (20+ at least) and I had this feeling in my chest and I stopped her and told her... I like you. 

She said that she liked me too. I was really happy to hear that, because I was afraid she'd wanted me to go away. She rolled over and told me 2 things: 1. She's not in a position in life for a monogamous relationship, and 2. she has genital herpes. 

I told her I wasn't ready for a monogamous relationship either, and told her I was so sorry for her disease, that it didn't change how I feel about her, and I don't cast judgment on her for it. We kept cuddling and she got sleepy, so she kissed me twice, gave me a hug, and I tucked her in and kissed her forehead. Before I left, I told her I wasn't propositioning anything to her, and asked if she wanted us to see each other more. She said yes, and told me she wanted me to spend the night sometime.

I don't know how to advance from here. We made plans to hang out tonight, but she stood me up (twice now). I'm getting a lot of mixed signals from her - she's intimate with me, holding hands, kissing me 2 or 3 times in a row, cuddling, and then she posts pictures of her ass on Snapchat talking about the guy that's coming over to fuck her, standing me up and not texting back - but I like her a lot and want to know how to continue, if I can at all at this point.

I don't want to be that orbiter that pressures her and puts her in a box, I want to give her space, but I want to talk to her about things. I'm not sure how to talk to her about this and where we could even go, but I need to know. When we were cuddling she referred to us as ""dating"". 

I don't want a monogamous relationship at this point either, but I would be open to an open relationship of some sort with her. I'm also not sure how to be intimate with her, given that she has an STD and, as she has told me twice now, does not suck dick. 

I like her a lot. I enjoy her company and being intimate with her and spending time with her. I just don't know what I can do here.

tl;dr: been seeing girl for a month now who is having sex with other guys. went to her house and cuddled - i told her i liked her, she told me she liked me, but has genital herpes and doesn't want a monogamous relationship, but wants to see me more often and wants me to spend the night. i like her, but i don't know how or what to do - if at all. i want to give her space, i don't want to be that obsessive guy.",20Feb2020,1

502,"So today I had a slight verbal confrontation with a co-worker over their insistence that our office needs to quit using a certain anti-bacterial product due to it containing harmful substances. While he is right, it contains such a small percentage of harmful substances that it’s literally safe to drink. I pointed that out to stop him from trying to get it removed from the office (since we’re in a prime location for a certain recent virus).
He is also sending out a lot of messages about how the above virus is incredibly deadly and we all need to be allowed to stay in our houses at every possible opportunity.


Some of the things he says make sense, and I can respect being cautious, but this goes far beyond that. It’s constant messages in a group chat designed for work, about all the latest news stories, his own personal ideas about how and why everything is happening, and everyone just ignores it pretty much.


Management is aware of his behaviour and attitude (they complain about him a fair amount, he is generally quite abrasive on other topics as well), but seem to be unwilling to actually do much about it, often times just agreeing with him to shut him up (although only on minor things).


The issue I have is that I know there is no way I can get him to stop, I can’t get management to change anything, but I still wake up daily to about 40 missed messages about the latest ‘horrifying development’ and how ‘our company is evil for X Y and Z’. How can I stop this from bothering me and how can I ignore all this stuff bombarding my inbox. Right now I’m just toying with leaving the group chat so I don’t have to bother reading all that stuff.

For some reference, I've been a heavy marijuana smoker for quite some time. I started using marijuana for, well, fun at the age of 14.

Soon that changed though. As I developed and matured, somewhere along the line, marijuana became a well managed relief for my depression and anxiety.

That changed soon though. I'd say approximately 2 1/2 years before now, I was arrested under a possession and paraphernalia charge for marijuana. Immediately after, I was placed on probation (for minors, as I was 16 at the time)

To cut to the chase, I wanted to get high, and I couldn't.

That's when a friend of mine introduced me to syth, K2, spice, whatever you want to call it. Say about a year from today, I quit the spice. I dropped it completely. My probation is over with and I'm free to smoke all the weed I want again. Yet, I find myself begging me to smoke spice ""just one more time"". My pride is crushed. I thought I had beaten it, yet, I can still see myself buying and smoking it very soon.

Everytime they go on vaccation they take brother with them and I am forced to move back for the duration of their vacation and take care of them,while also being a student.This is also puting a strain on my relationship as my boyfriend feels like he cant rely on me because everytime something happens with them I always leave. My brother and I take care of their medicine(make sure they have enough/take on time etc),drive them to the ER and all their doctor appointments,meaning I have to plan my life around their care. I dont mind driving them to the dr appointments but I hate it when they decide to leave and leave them to me as everytime they do an ER trip was required(gramps fell and cracked open his skull,fell another time and smashed his thumb,granny has heart problems and had to be hospitalized twice,),literaly every time they went on vacation something happened and I am then stuck being their nurse,this messes up my studying and my grades are suffering,which they dont understand because why cant I just study at home.. My father is a veterinarian but for some reason cant see blood and refused to change gramps dressings when his head and hand were hurt,brohter also cant stand it which meant I was doing that also. Its like they refuse to see their parents are old and sick and need constant care and that my brother and I are putting off our lives to take care of them. My mother always says something along the line of its making you more responsible,you should man up blahblah. And my aunt is also realy irresponsible in regards to them, I asked her to watch over them for one day when I had an important exam and that I wont be home all day,she was with them for one or two hours then left.. I dont know what to do anymore, told them to put them in a nursing home,hire a caretaker and they always find some kind of counter argument and say im immature and dont understand or how can they just leave them in a nursing home as if a nursing home is some kind of torture for them...I dont want them to feel abandoned and refuse to let them feel like taking care of them is an obligation but I realy cant keep going like this. I am 22 years old and my brother is 25",20Feb2020,1

512,"Sup! 21F Cookie delivery driver here. I was delivering a couple weeks ago (it was nighttime) when I got a cash order. I was spontaneously working for my friend so I didn’t have as much cash as I normally would on me. The man only had 20s and I didn’t have enough change, so I offered to pay 5$ of the 25$ order so he didn’t have to give me a 15$ tip. 

I get a text from my manager a couple days later that he had come to the store and left his number for me so he could pay me back. I messaged him with my Venmo thanking him for being so considerate. 

He ended up asking if he could instead take me out to dinner! My manager said he was cute so I said sure. (I couldn’t see him in the dark) 

Anyway I got his full name and saw his Facebook! He’s cute but he doesn’t go to college and he’s got a lot of pics of him vaping. Which is fine! No judgement at all. I just personally am not attracted to smoking and I really value higher education in a partner. That sounds super annoying but the point is I don’t see it going anywhere? He also looks a bit older (26 maybe?) Which is a little bit out of my comfort zone

513,"So last night, my girlfriend (26f) and I (22f) got into an argument because she talked to me on the phone for over an hour yesterday without even asking me how I was. She talked about herself literally the entire time; I could barely get a word in. This happens every now and then, which hurts my feelings because I always, always make a point to ask her how she’s doing every day and thoroughly talk about it, no matter how long it takes. 

Basically, my girlfriend said that if I felt this way—that she wasn’t asking about me enough—I should have said it 8 months ago when we first started dating, because we know each other so well by now. She said our dynamic upsets her and she doesn’t think we’re a good fit because I hardly talk to her or seem interested in her. I told her this was because I can’t get a word in and I wish she would let me talk more, because I’m always holding back. I always make a point to be super engaged with her. She then brought up the beautiful heartfelt letter she wrote me on Valentine’s Day and said that I shouldn’t be complaining about how she treats me because she wrote me that. I feel like that was manipulative of her to say, because there are so many things that I do for her that I could hold over her head, but I don’t.  

I brought up the fact that we are compatible in a lot of ways and laugh a lot together, and she said, “we really don’t.” That broke my heart. I know how important it is for her to be able to laugh with someone, and I’ve been very depressed after the death of my father. 

We ended the conversation on a peaceful note and said our I love yous after we agreed that while we fight often, we always change our behavior afterwards and never fight about the same thing twice.

How dare you lurk around here

Clung to your shadow

Your pillar of faith

Your falsifier of strength


You moved to the shores of hell for some fate

Now you're running back into our grace

With the devil tucked between your legs


So, why are you so surprised?

When you went all in

All you took were lies

When you went all in

All you took with you

Was a set of dying eyes

Now...

I live in an apartment with my mom and my dog since 2011. In 2011, something flew into the apartment, we didn't know what it was, but we chased it out somehow. We thought it was some kind of bird, but turned out that it was a bat. 

In the summer of 2016 , we had this unpleasant guest again, and in April in 2017 again, twice in 24 hours. We should keep in mind, that during these times, all the windows were open, BUT each of them has mosquito-nets and shutters, and the mosquito-nets were all shut. 

Last night we opened the windows around 6 PM, just to get some fresh air in, and closed them after about 10 minutes. Nothing strange, everything was alright. 
But around 3 AM, my mother woke up, and something was on her back. Guess what, it was a tiny bat, and it was smaller than the other ones. We chased it out, too, no one of the bats coming into our apartment were harmed by the way, all of them were let out of the window.

We live in a four storey building, and only one of my neighbours had an experience like these, so almost none of them had these animals in their apartments. If it matters, I live in Transylvania, in the central part of Romania, and currently, the weather is mild, like it's been spring already.
I'm kind of scared, and I have no idea what to do. I'm cleaning the apartment at the moment because I have no idea where has it been.

Since coming back I've started to see what they mean. I self harmed when I was younger and used to deny it was for attention but obviously it was a cry for help and for attention as I felt abit unwanted and left aside. My self esteem was so much better with them and has plummeted back home. I felt wanted and part of the family there and now I'm home I just feel miserable.

It's not even that my parents are bad parents. They're great buy with my sister she just takes all the time and space up. She gets all the support etc.

The family dynamic as a whole awful but individually my parents are great. They can be kind and supportive I just think the problems stem from my sister. She's rude and self and treats my parents like servants. No joke she gets dinner brought to her room. I've mentioned how this isn't right but they can't see how pandering to her isn't fair or good for them.

I try to help out round the house and contribute and just find myself feeling miserable. I noticed when with myaunt and uncle I would actually leave my room and enjoyed talking with people. But at home I lie in bed all day dreading going round the rest of the house.

I hate the family dynamic in my house, I don't want to live here anymore and would be much happier else where. Any advice.",20Feb2020,1

Hi Reddit, I’ll make this as short as I can.

After applying, I got accepted into one of youtheuropas exchange programs in Estonia. However i feel I got accepted too easily. They also pay everything for you since they are supposedly sponsored by erasmus+. In addition i hadn’t really heard of them before I saw a Facebook post about it. I got accepted the day after I sent my application which also felt suspiciously quick. Maybe I’m just over careful but rather that then getting scammed or something.

538,"Hi guys

A bit of context: I moved into a gorgeous house with my partner and his best friend (they were already living there, and we decided to live there rather than just move as a couple due to the house being beautiful, in a fab location, and his best friend is pretty lovely and easy to live with, and we are only in mid twenties and not looking to completely settle down yet). We did argue about this prior to this though, as I did initially want to move just us two, but then looking at what we could afford as a couple just wasn't the same quality. We decided to stay as it meant we had a whole floor in the house to ourselves ( bathroom, our room, spare room) and his best friend had the top floor with his room, a little room attached and an ensuite).

Everything was going swimmingly until the best mate asked if his mate could stay for a reduced rent in the spare room on our floor for a couple of months until we went travelling. Fine, sure, a bit of extra cash even if I have to sacrifice my space for a little bit.

Fast forward a couple of months and he is still there, no plans to go travelling, still paying very little rent in comparison, hasn't mentioned a thing and the best mate is refusing to talk to him about this it seems. He hasn't cleaned a thing since moving in either (now Oct-today) and does strange things like use my razors (I'm an absolute germiphobe when it comes to this sort of thing...) and always has huge dramas to rant about. I'm a teacher, so being surrounded by 1500 people all day every day at work means, I need space and want to unwind and this doesn't happen.

I spoke to my partner the other week (well... Argued...) that it's unfair that he is still there and also paying so little, especially when the people most impacted by his being there is us, due to our space being so reduced. It doesn't impact on the best friends' space at all. Partner spoke to best friend and he agreed to ask him to pay more rent. 

Unfortunately best friend recently lost his job and income and could do with the extra money, however I have gone away for a week and realised... I don't want to live in a house where I have no ability to have any space to myself, any mental break away from people, especially with a job where I'm around so many people all the time.

My partner is trying to take this all on himself and is worried he will lose me or best friend, and I feel like I've put him in an awkward situation despite saying we can tackle this together.

I've no idea what to do, how to approach this with best friend or 'temp' housemate. Any advice? Am I being unfair?",20Feb2020,1

540,"TL;DR AT BOTTOM

So, this is probably gonna end up being a very long and rambly post so I want to apologize right off the bat. But I feel like I really need help with this. 

So, my brother’s (Jason) fiancee (Melissa), whom he has a 5yo kid with (so my nephew and my mom’s grandson, Cole), is very toxic. We’ve never really liked her but she used to make my brother happy so the family dealt with her. But about three years ago, this dislike was solidified when she stole from me. She stole money, $40 in cash, and we are certain it was her because she was literally the only person home in the time it was stolen that could have done so (my best friend and I came home and I left the money in my purse. My best friend spent 100% of her time hanging out with me, and Melissa popped in for some reason (maybe to drop something off, I don’t remember, but the reason doesn’t matter). Then my best friend and I wanted to go back out, and I went into my purse to grab some money as we were only going to the corner store for soda or snacks so I wanted to bring just a bill of $20 as opposed to my whole purse and the money was all gone. It obviously couldn’t have been my best friend as she was with me the entire time, and Melissa was the only other person in the house). I know what exactly happened isn’t important but I’m explaining this first instance so that you guys can get the true picture that she is undoubtedly the one causing issues and blame is not being misplaced.

My mom said she’d buy and set up a camera to catch her if she tried to do it again. Well, my mother didn’t. So I got another $30 stolen for no reason. Then, she stole some concealer from me.

The concealer probably doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it is; she stole concealer that a) isn’t her shade and b) is a brand she’s allergic to (which are both reasons she used to say that she wasn’t the one who took it… it was a cover). She chose that out of all the makeup she could have stolen (my entire collection was strewn over the counter and she chose that specifically; I know she took it because I found it at the very top of her makeup bag later. I know I shouldn’t have snooped but I had to know). She gains nothing from this except the satisfaction of knowing she stole from me, and it caused a rift with Jason and I.

I sent her a text saying something very ambiguous, like, “hey, I can’t find my money. If you’ve seen it/know where it might be, please let me know”. She twisted this to me outright accusing her of stealing so she told Jason. He ended up physically assaulting me and I ended up in the ER for fear of a concussion or spinal damage (I have osteoporosis, and he shoved me into a short flight of stairs. My head bounced against the top landing and my spine landed on the stairs, causing lots of pain). I told everyone that she DID steal my $70 and concealer and Jason completely took her side, with everyone else saying “I believe you but we can’t do anything”. I cut contact with Jason and Melissa for a few months after this, until my mom BEGGED and guilted me into talking to them again because she “missed having her family together, especially at Christmas” (this happened right before and I refused to spend that Christmas with them). They “forgave me for lying making stuff up about Melissa”.

In the past three years she’s also stolen from my grandmother (my mom’s mom) and now she’s starting to steal from Jason as well. He says he’ll repay my $70 as now he understands, but I don’t want the $70 (from him, at least. I’ll gladly take it back from her). It’s not about that. It’s about someone who’s supposed to be family stealing from me, my elderly grandmother and my brother.

This whole time (aside from the physical assault incident) I’ve said nothing to keep the peace, and that wasn’t my sole choice. My mother BEGGED me to not say anything, because “if Melissa is challenged she’ll take Cole away from us and we’ll never see him again” (which I don’t doubt. She’s done that before when my mom pissed her off for some reason or another, but came crawling back when she needed money (you may notice she has a bad relationship with it…)). My mom and I have a very strained relationship because she bows down to Melissa and pretends nothing is wrong. So every Christmas and millions of times in between - as they live near us and visit often - I’ve been forced to smile, treat Melissa kindly, give her gifts… And I just can’t do it anymore.

Very recently, my mom told me how Melissa is now stealing from Jason. And I… completely lost it on her. Like, literally lost it. My mom was still refusing to say anything and I just went crazy. I was that stereotypical hysterical, insane woman who’s literally jumping up and down screaming, blind rage, seeing red type thing. I’m not proud of it. I’m incredibly ashamed. It felt like I was sucked out of my body and something possessed me and I went nuts. I wasn’t physical (as in, I didn’t harm her) and didn’t throw anything or anything, but I was wildly flailing my arms and yelling. It was crazy.

I told her she cares about Cole more than she cares about her own two children and her own mother. That I think it’s disgusting that she’s willing to let the three of us get stolen from (and get physically assaulted in my case… she also told me not to tell the ER what really happened (aka to LIE) and to “let it go; he’s my brother”), and let her relationship with all of us sour, just so she can keep a relationship with Cole. Don’t get me wrong, I love Cole very much, but I also value myself, Jason, and my grandmother. And I can’t keep doing this anymore. Because not saying anything just enables Melissa, and lets Melissa know that she can keep stealing from us because even if we KNOW she did, there will be no repercussions.

I ended up, later, sobbing on the phone with my boyfriend about it and I started yelling again (not at him, just like… in general. Like, “how can she do this?! Why?!” type thing). My mom came downstairs to me and told me that okay, she’d say something, because she can now see how important this is to me and if it’s important to me then it’s important to her (which confuses me because why isn’t this important to her inherently…? But I digress). 

So now here we are. We’re finally going to say something. My mom says she doesn’t REALLY want to because she sees no good in confronting Melissa, as she’ll just deny it, and “what then?”. I say, then we cut her out. Don’t allow her around us, don’t allow her at Christmases. Cut her completely out of our lives. And THAT is good. I know it may result in Cole being taken from us, but I also say that if Jason would just stand up to her too, then we could see Cole. Jason has just as much of a right to dictate who his son sees as Melissa does. I’m not sure at this point if he would ever do that, because it’s not just my mom who is too cowardly to say anything (it’s EVERYONE! I’m the only fucking one who cares it seems!), but if that’s the case then so be it and I don’t want contact with Jason either. Whoever enables her behavior and bows to her is just as bad as her. Whoever enables her stealing is just as bad as stealing themselves.

How can we say something to her? What can be done? I don’t want damage, but if it happens then it happens. How can we approach this in the best way possible? And how can I stop feeling guilty about the fallout on Cole and our relationship with him, because even though I logically know we can’t keep going on pretending nothing is wrong, I DO love him and DO want him in my life?

TL;DR: My sister-in-law is stealing from myself, my brother (her fiance) and my grandma (my mom’s mom) and has been doing so for three years. I’ve finally had enough and am going to say something and cut her out, which I haven’t done until now because my mom has pressured me not to in fear of losing a relationship with my brother and the thief’s young child. How can I approach cutting her out in a clear and least-harmful way, while also not feeling guilty about it?",20Feb2020,1
541,"I just took this test https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/autism-test/ and got a schore of 34 which equals autism. I actually relate to a lot of the questions in that test, like avoiding social interaction and being bad at it, liking to focus on certain things and having a daily schedule which can annoy me a lot if it gets interrupted. The thing is, I'm 18 years old and my parents have never really truly believed I actually have autism, and thus won't do a damn thing helping me with it. I used to be convinced by them I don't have autism, but within the past year I've become significantly more aware of it because I found information on the internet. Before then, some people have diagnosed me with autism but because my parents didn't believe it, I didn't believe it either. They're still convinced there's nothing wrong with me and if I try to convince them otherwise it just won't work and they won't listen. If I try to get help they oppose it. The thing is, I also looked up what Asian countries' view on autism is. After I heard from someone that autism is considered taboo in Japan and won't be recognised properly, I looked up if it's the same in China. Probably not as bad as Japan, but still not the same as Western countries. Actually, I never lived in Asia. My parents did, and before I was born they moved to the Netherlands.

My mother may also be at least slightly mentally unstable. She's been sent to therapy at least 2 times now and both times after she went back home nothing seemed to have changed. I may or may not have inherited the autism from her. I don't know. My dad has also adapted Chinese cultural parenting and always tried letting me do the hghest possible education, not realizing I was collapsing because of it and my autism preventing me from achieving top results at school due to me hating school because I didn't want to make social interactions, none of the subjects interested me and it just felt like a prison. Thus, I ended up failing class 3 times in a row and got sent to a school for autistic people. That school actually feels less like a prison but the taxi trips, because it's about 1 hour away from my home town, sitll take a ton of free time and sleep time and it ruins me. I still have an extremely hard time studying because of all the things in my head and my dad getting stingy with it which discourages me. Because of my autism I also have my daily routine thing for home, which does not include school work of any kind because I'd rather sit in front of my computer than waste time, and if my dad wants me to do school work at home I get extremely annoyed because it destroys my daily routine, but I can't show any of it or else he will get even more pissed.

It doesn't just have to do with the parenting. I also learned that I'm in the bottom attractiveness tier. Asian men are simily viewed ad the most unattractive to white girls. And I get more attracted to white girls than Asian girls. On the outside I'm Chinese, but on the inside I'm Dutch. 99% of the people I see outside are Dutch anyway and Chinese people are rare so I don't want to pursue a Chinese girl, I want a white girl. I also hope my parents will respect that but I have no idea and a relationship is not on the horizon right now anyway but I still worry about it. But simply because of the way I was born I have severe disadvantages. Almost all of the white girls will simply not view me as a potential partner just because of my ugly-ass Chinese face and maybe not even having a larger weiner than Dutch guys. I simply can't compete. Maybe if I had a decent personality, but the autism, bad personality traits and social awkwardness have destroyed that. Both my outside and inside are unattractive. Sometimes I feel like one of the most unlucky people in the world.

Tl;dr: My parents don't believe I have autism and won't help me with dealing with it. Thanks to them I didn't believe I had autism either until recently. They don't want me to get help from others either. Thanks to the autism I struggle severely with school and social interaction. My parents don't understand me. Being both Asian and autistic also makes me extremely unattractive for white girls.",20Feb2020,1

And when I do force myself to lay on my bed and close my eyes, it feels wrong. Like I feel uncomfortable.  Its kind of hard to explain.  I feel uneasy. I cant stop. Even if I'm tired at night its like my body is forcing itself to wait until 6am to zonk out. And I've tried to change this.

545,"Around September I suffered from extreme burn-out and it took my productivity to an all time low for the rest of 2019. In January, my new years resolution was to be more productive but now, it feels like I've bit more than I can chew once again.

\- I have 3 full days a week at uni  
\- My dissertation to do (which is so much work it feels like a full time job)  
\- Many more assignments to do in the next month  
\- I'm starting a part time job for 3 days a week   
\- I volunteer for 1 day a week

It feels like I'm doing so much and I don't have the time to be doing the things that I need to prioritise right now: like my dissertation and assignments. I also need to prioritise leisure time as I really don't want to burn out again because I know once I burn out, it's gonna take another 3 months of therapy and not doing any work to get out of it.

546,"Hello guys, hope you're all having a great day. Anyways, I need some advice on this since I don't know where else to ask (mom is useless on this topic, sister isn't replying yet). 

Anyways, I'm currently looking for work to help pay for my college tuition (I'm restarting college in a couple of months) however I'm pretty undecided if I should go for the ones closer to home (I live a few towns outside of the main city) or go to the main city. I'm going to go to an online college btw. The commute from my place to the city would take me anywhere between 1.5-2 hours ONE WAY (about 3-4 hrs total) however the city pays about 20-30% more than jobs here. Getting a place in the city is very expensive so I'll barely be able to make ends meet if I stay there, given that I have close to no experience and don't have a degree so the jobs I'll be able to get won't pay well enough to support both my tuition fees and living expenses. I don't want to be too reliant on my family either. 

I considered going to work in the city and bringing my laptop and study in a coffee shop or something after work but I live in a 3rd world country so unless I bring a car (which I have but is super expensive to use everyday) I'm probably not coming home with my laptop back lol.

549,"I realised listening to the Joe Rogan Podcast today. His guest was a mathematician, physicist and all that jazz. I was enjoying him speak immensely, he was delightful in short. Very good conversationalist, very eloquent in his explanations and generally exceedingly likeable. 

Until he revealed that he was of Jewish descent. He’s not even practicing, neither did his father. However, instinctively it shot my enjoyment and admiration for him. I’m aware he’s still as likeable, smart and still seems like that decent to good person.

550,"So, for context, it was my grandmother's birthday last Tuesday. I see my grandparents every Monday night after work for dinner. They are aware I work long days, and do not have access to my phone for the majority of the day, and are appreciative that I come and see them weekly.

This particular Monday on the drive home my grandfather mentioned that it was my grandmothers birthday the following day (I already knew this, but it was a nice reminder.) I said I'd call when I got the chance but it wasn't likely that I'd be able to call until the evening. 

Come the next day and all is going well at work, I get everything I need to do done, and start to pack up ready for the end of the day. I car share to and from work daily (Still learning to drive.) and appreciate the support that my lift provides me. My lift, isn't exactly the most punctual person, and on this particular day, we didn't actually leave work until past 7pm.

My phone had died by that point, and I was unaware of the time until I walked through the door. I started getting myself settled down for the day, and go to call my grandparents. That's where things go dark, I wake up, it's 2am. I never managed to hit the call button before passing out. I plucked up the courage finally to call them on Saturday (I'd been really busy with work, and hadn't really had the chance before this), and talk to them, they were fine over the phone and I apologised for my mistake, explained what had happened and they joked about it. Come Monday, dinner is going well and we get in the car to go home. This is where it goes downhill, my grandfather says that I am bullshitting, and that I'm becoming thoughtless like my dad, I try to contest my point but he wasn't having it.

I struggle with communication and my memory isn't perfect about certain events and things like that. I'm aware that I could have done better with this situation but can't find out how to fix the problem.

I think we’ve kind of always subconsciously accepted that we can’t live without eachother. I blame myself completely for his death. I was raped in October and since that day, he’s been a broken man. His physical and mental health deteriorated instantly, and now he’s gone.

And I am too old for anything else.

Okay. I did drop out of highschool at 16 (changing between half-a-dozen schools in the process that culminated in me dropping out), and, in retrospect I find the reason for all this being my own difficulty in understanding my own thoughts and emotions, and I have to stress on emotion because I do kinda think of myself as not a very emotional individual, and recently I've learned about myself that I am easily overwhelmed by emotions, and a severe sense of purposelessness leading to impulsive decisions.

Whenever I mention my urge to drop out of college, my ma tells me that it's because I know that there will be food on my plate even if I don't work.

I got a few hobbies that I'd like to cultivate. And maybe I could move to more ideal country. And, there, I may find a community. God. These are hopeless fancies.

I read an article a few months ago, it was about a trans man who regretted their decision in transitioning and their reasons behind it really struck a chord with me. They said that while they were happy in having transitioned, it still didn't give them what they had always wanted, which was to experience life as a male. 

This hit home for me, as my biggest wish was always to have been able to just grow up as a female, and as I wasn't able to, I occasionally feel like it would be better for me to not, and just to continue living life as I would normally, physically a male. It's a liveable situation for me which seems to be very uncommon among the trans community. I don't actually know what this means.

582,"I use to be able to hold down a job pretty well, and I’m beginning to think when I left my last one I was trying to get away from serving tables even though it was greatmoney. I think that’s where I went wrong. I just feel like I’ve kinda ruined my life. I’m a 26/M and currently work a beauty counter at work. The constant need to have my sales above 100% is stressful. I always thought I was pretty decent at upselling, but I guess my numbers are wayyyy down from when I was first hired. I went through a couple majors in school. Starting with English because I wanted to teach, then moving to nursing because I wanted decent pay. Turns out I hated nursing, but the classes I did the best in were the liberal arts and I knew I couldn’t make those into a viable career. Well due to some health issues I ended up dropping out, and at 20 making that good of money working in hospitality didn’t bother me. 
I don’t know if I’m just in a very self doubting time period in my life, or I’m just not finding my niche. It’s like as soon as I get any criticism I just shut down down, and I don’t want to be like that. Any advice?",20Feb2020,1

586,"So I'm in a group conversation with a couple of mates and lately one them has a tendency to direct attention towards me; often a backhanded comment.

Let's call him Tom for in this scenario. And I'm Harold. 

Examples include:
Friend 1: have you guys tried this before? (something related to sex) 
Tom: haven't but Harold would be an expert. (insinuating something nasty) 

Friend 1: I want to go to try out this place
Tom: go with Harold he's got the money for it. (read that with a snide tone) 

Just yesterday he literally made a quip at me three times in a row. I haven't replied in the convo since then and it kills the conversation amongst friends (they've noticed it too.) I'm upset, bothered but ultimately curious trying to process where it came from. Is it some form of insecurity? 

I consider him a good mate of mine but still unwarranted.

587,"Background: I'm a medical doctor, who has been working with video editing/directing, photography and graphic design on the side for about six years. I created numerous event posters, documents, medical illustrations and videos. 

Recently I been back at uni taking a few new courses (business administration, programming) and been on the lookout for work as I study. I signed up to a recruitment company that is supposed to match me with short term (1-4 day) jobs. They encouraged me to contact this construction business as a graphic designer even though my schedule/location didn't match theirs (and I had a bad feeling about them). When I contacted the company they told me they would work around the time frame and removed their announcement on the website. Instead they asked me to send my resume directly to them. 

I went there the following week and they wanted me to redesign a 30 page catalogue, create a commercial, photograph their items and make 5 single paged information sheets. Then they wanted to hire me as freelancer so I quoted them, 70€ per hour, with the total coming to 3000€ which would end up 1600€ after taxes (+traveling, administration costs) for me. They told me it was too much and that the recruitment company charged way less (30€/hour). That is true, but from reading their now removed job description it never stated that they wanted someone to create a commercial from scratch, redesign a whole catalogue and edit photographs. If I remember correctly they mentioned how they wanted someone to offer assistance to their graphic designer on site. 

They want me to come in again to discuss prices as they believe things can be misunderstood via email. I already went there once for the ""interview"" where they showcased a list of tasks and asked for my input. So I created 8 different layout options I had in mind. After I left they wanted me to email my design samples. I didn't do that and will not unless they pay me. 

I am not sure how to proceed. It costs me around 8€ to travel to their office. Again, I was never interested in this job as I already thought it wasn't worth my time. However the recruitment company thought they would be a good contact for me. Plus  I need to start earning money as all my savings are almost done. 

Should I charge per project instead of per hour? They showed some examples of videos they wanted for their products and they would involve at least two days planning. I guess I could suggest that I will only work on the catalogue as a graphic designer and skip the commercial and photography. Should I just tell them no and leave?  How would you deal with this company?",20Feb2020,1

594," 

've recently come to terms as being bisexual, and have found dating girls to quite difficult. I started college in September, and quickly made friends with a girl. We get on really well and spent a lot of time together last semester. I only ever saw her as a friend and never thought any more of it until she liked me on tinder. I chose to ignore this as maybe being friendly, however, when I spoke to mutual friends over the holidays I got told she liked me. When coming back to college, everything was normal, but on a night out we were both pretty drunk and she spent all night being endearing expressing how much she thinks of me, and one thing leads to another and we kissed. The next day she said sorry she was really drunk, i didn't want her to think I wasn't interested so i said we should do something again soon, which she ignored. Everything got weird after we kissed she acts strange, I've seen her in group gatherings and she seems more distant, but then when she invited me out with her roommates on a night out on valentines day, and when i asked if i could bring my roommates she ignored me and when I saw her out she acted really off. I've seen her numerous times since then but she's very hit and miss with how she acts. I'm really struggling to understand it, our mutual friends (her roommates) always use to make comments about us being together but has stopped since we kissed. I feel like there's something going on which I'm not being told about. She's my friend above everything but I don't know how to approach it. I suspect maybe she's only just coming to terms with same sex relationship too. We haven't spoken for a while now, but I've been told she's struggling at the moment. I really want to help but I don't know whether to message her as she might want some space and i don't want to invade on her if she dosen't want to speak. But I also feel like messaging her to meet as I can't bare ignoring it.

Speaking to her openly would be the best solution but I have really bad anxiety so struggle with dealing with these situations and don't know know if just leaving it would be better. I'm not out to my friends and family at home yet so I don't really have anyone to talk to, any help would be great",20Feb2020,1

I don’t want to be a factory worker who goes through the cycle of school and then ends up having the same routine for 50+ years even tho I get anxious when I have a new routine.

Today I woke up and for the first time in forever, I wanted to die. I was overwhelmed with the feeling of giving up because Im in debt right now with tuition, I have a quiz today that I did not study for because I lacked motivation. Maybe that triggered this feeling. And I’m not actually gonna kill myself because I have many fears and pain is one of them.

596,"Background: I have been living in the upstairs of a duplex apartment for 8 years, my room mate has been here for 3. My landlord is apathetic and very hands off, and my downstairs neighbor is blind. When I moved in I was told that he is mean and wants to be left alone (can confirm he’s mean). He wears headphones everywhere he goes so to speak to him you’d have to literally grab him.  


So the issue, in the past couple of months he’s been letting out these blood curdling screams. I asked my room mate if he’s noticed and he said no, which doesn’t surprise me. My room mate is clearly very depressed and spends almost all of his free time sleeping, but that’s another thing. But these screams are terrifying, I get that we’re all going through some stuff and in the comfort of your own home you should be able to let loose, but these are the sounds of what I can only describe as someone in a horror movie being tortured. I’ve even (in my paranoid over thinking brain) wondered if he himself was harming someone else. I really don't think that's the case but I've been stirring over this for too long. These screams are not normal and are starting to scare me.

604,"For as long as I remember, I’ve had extremely violent and insane meltdowns whenever anything makes me angry or upset. They plagued my school years. I was nearly expelled several times. I would hit everyone, get in fights, even hit girls and scream at my teachers and call them horrible things. I was out of control. I obviously had no friends.

I got myself under control a bit and managed to gain a social circle in my late teenage years. Then I found alcohol. Initially, alcohol made me happy and jolly. I enjoyed getting buzzed with friends and having a fun time. Now it just ruins my life and makes me miserable.

I reach a certain point when drunk where it just becomes mayhem. I get into fights, hit people, shout, scream, and at worst threaten to mill myself. I don’t know what it is but in a span of a few minutes when drunk I turn from a normal guy into a crying demon.

The list of horrible meltdowns I’ve had when drunk are endless, I genuinely have done shit that makes me total scum and is unforgivable
- 2017: Arrested 2 times for assaulting random people at bars, threatening to kill guys. I think I did it because I was jealous they were getting off with girls I liked
- 2017: Attacked a kebab shop and started hitting random people, called the owners “Isis terrorists” and got arrested for racially aggravated assault. I genuinely don’t hold racist beliefs so i don’t know why I said those things
- 2018: Decided while drunk to go on a rampage in the streets and attack the first guy I saw. Got given two black eyes, proceeded to punch a female friend for no reason, got taken to hospital because I was threatening to kill myself
- 2019: Violently and savagely attacked a bartender because he refused to serve me. Got arrested
- 2019: Punched my roommate, afterwards broke into his room and trashed it and broke his things in a drunken fury

I finally decided to stop drinking. I had a good couple weeks until last night when my roommate (who is for some reason still friends with me) convinced me it was a good idea to go for some drinks. Well, a dozen drinks later, and I for some reason punched him again over some stupid argument. I then smashed my glass on the floor, attacked the bouncers, and went on an insane rampage through the streets. I was literally walking up to random people and punching them in the head. But I think I was so drunk I was barely hurting them because they would just laugh at me and not retaliate. Somehow I didn’t get arrested or beaten up.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I genuinely feel like a monster. I feel like I’ve done things that are totally unforgivable. I’m not addicted to alcohol, I can stay off it for weeks or months and if I had no friends to invite me out to the bars, I would never drink. But when I become blackout drunk, I turn into a demon at the flick of a switch.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been hiding in bed all day not wanting to confront my problems. I apologised to my roommate and somehow he forgived me. But I still want to just run away. I have this idea that I could drop out of university, just hop on the first train out of town and run away from my problems and never see the people I’ve upset again. But that’s a stupid idea, I know. What is the sensible thing to do here? I intend to get back to stopping drinking and I told all my friends strictly not to invite me to drink anymore. But what else? Can I ever be forgiven?",20Feb2020,1
605,"So it's been about a week since she, like call her Sally, stopped talking to me. 

It was really random, she put a post up about cutting people off in her life and she NEVER posts stuff like that unless it relates to her actual life. So I messaged our mutual friend to see if she knew what was going on but she didn't either then our friend messaged Sally and Sally told her that it wasn't about her. So I was thinking its definitely about me. So we, me and Sally, work together and she acted like I didn't exist the next day at work so I ask her if she's mad at me and she says no and then i ask her if she wants to talk about it and she says no. So I basically got nowhere. 

But then the rest of the day and the next day she doesn't talk to me goes out of her way to not be near me. So I meet up with our mutual friend and tell her what's been going on and she informs me that Sally is indeed mad at me and is mad at me for something I said behind her back when she was out of the room. But I don't say mean things about her behind her back. I asked our mutual friend to ask her what I said but she won't tell her.

There was one occasion where I had to speak to a manager about something she did that could've resulted in the harm of an animal and that's the only thing I could think of that I had done. We were the one left in charge and we had to get ready for the day make foods and give medication to the dogs. I was the only one allowed to prepare and distribute the medications because I was the only one trained to do it. Which i reiterated to her about 5 times because she didn't seem to get that she couldn't do them. So she making foods and I'm busy doing something else. And she keeps bugging me about doing the medications but it's too early to do it so I tell her that. I leave the room to do something else for awhile and I come back and she says one of the dog's medication is on the table. I dont say anything to her because I assume that she just took the drawer out of all the medications but she didn't she went into the drawer took one of the dogs medications out and left the pills on the table. This is probably the worst thing she could've done because we have dogs in and out of that room a random dog could've taken it or the pills could've fell on the floor whatever could have happened and then the dog wouldn't get her medication and she could have died. 

So later when the manager came I told her what had happened and I was angry because this is something that Sally always does to me. I do something and I do it wrong because it's not how SHE wants it done. Sally will criticize and change the things I've done behind my back at work because she doesn't think they're good enough. So when I was talking to the manager I told her what happened and she was saying how it was dangerous to do that and all of that and I said something along the lines of ""yeah I don't know why she needs to take over everything and be in control of everything"" and she agreed. The people at work know how she acts because another employee came up to me beforehand and was like ""do not let Sally do the meds I know she will try but do not let her."" 

So now it's been like a week and she still wont talk to me. I'm thinking about asking her if she wants to talk but I've also been evaluating our friendship and thinking if she is really worth saving if she's going to continue to treat me like this.

612," We went to high school together. I am extremely good with computers. Whenever we had homework in computer science, she would call me to help her. She would also call me every time she had help with her computer in general. So we started to ""correspond."" After that, she started to ask me about the other items from time to time, even if she could find out from her best friend or anybody else (which I'm pretty sure of). Then I started to ask for ""help"" from her for very easy problems. So we started correspondence, which would quickly turn into correspondence about anything and everything, not just school. I was supposed to ask her out then, but I didn't take such an obvious opportunity (which didn't look obvious to me at the time). High school ended, after which we didn’t hear back. We enrolled in colleges in the same city a few months later. I decided to contact her and in the meantime we realized we both love video games. I suggested to her that we could play together, to which she agreed, and said that she also wanted to suggest it, but she thought I would not. She said she was going to download a game so she would let me know we were playing. Due to commitments, it was a month after which she finally installed the game. I asked her if we were starting to play now, and she said she needed time to get better at the game. In the meantime, she called me several times to help her with her computer.

614,"About two years ago I slept with some people that I very much regret. I should preface this by saying that I was dealing with a really severe case of diagnosed Body Dysmorphic Disorder at the time and was spinning off of the breakup of my first serious relationship. I was in a super dark place,and had no self esteem. 

The first person was just an overall horrible person. He was in a band,was a known cheater,diagnosed sex addict,and emotionally abusive. I knew  about some of these behaviors beforehand,such as his promiscuity,but not the extent of them. We slept together  like 3x. I found out later that he lied to me and actually had a girlfriend at the time. I actually befriend one of his exes at college by accident,and she showed me a lot of the abusive messages he had sent her. He’d also given her an STD and was known for impregnating girls. I felt even worse about my past decision after this.  

The second guy wasn’t nearly as bad but I do still feel some shame about it. He was a friend of mine. We got drunk one night,he confessed his feelings for me,and we slept together. I found out later that he’d actually been having an affair with a married woman (who was also a drug dealer)during our fling. He treated me really badly.

The last guy I don’t even want to get into. I wouldn’t have regretted it,until it ended it an very unclear matter of consent between the two of us. I feel like he didn’t respect my boundaries,but I am hesitant to label it as assault. 

I think it adds another dimension to this in that I wasn’t even attracted to most of these guys. I’m considered to be conventionally attractive. All of the people who found out about me sleeping with these two were appalled that I had been with them. Honestly,at the the tine I did so I was feeling so low and didn’t think I could do any better. 

Looking back,I feel so much shame that I slept with these guys. I can’t believe that I shared something that I now consider to be so intimate with them. I also feel so much shame,because if I knew that a prospective partner did the same,it would be such a turn off to me. I’ve always been very intent on settling down with someone who didn’t just sleep with anyone,and had standards in the people they slept with. Meanwhile I did this. I would be gut punched if I found out my partner had slept with the equivalent of these guys. I think I also feel some shame because I grew up around purity culture as well.

Has anyone else ever had these feelings before? How do I come to term with it?",20Feb2020,1
615," 

To put it simply, theres things in  life i want to do, but for some reason i get this overwhelming fear and  terrible feeling, i can accept failure but it feels like the moment i go  to try, i end up just sorta freezing up and not knowing what to do, i  get nervous, and each time i even think about doing it theres instantly  an excuse that makes me not want to.

Lately  ive really been wanting to get into game development, and i have a  friend who is really in the know about it, hes taught me a lot over the  last few months and i feel confident in the fact that i could make  something out of it, but the moment when it comes time to actually face  it, i end up getting that feeling again, and i dont know how to get out  of it.

Another thing is art, i  love art, its something i surround myself in and i want to make my own  art because theres so many things i wish was out there but isnt, but the  moment i decide to begin i dont know how to improve and i end up just  overall feeling like garbage the moment i try, I end up somehow  convincing myself that im not good enough for it and i dont know why  exactly these feelings happen but its something thats stopped me from  being able to do these things for around 4 years now, and i really wanna  begin both or at the very least one of these things.

And  the worst part is, i end up feeling guilt when my friend talks about  the things he makes or when my art friends show off how much theyve  improved over the years, im happy for them dont get me wrong, but i cant  help but feel like i should work to be in that position as well.

Sorry  if this is sorta badly written or anything, when i dont know my own  feelings or why they happen, i have a hard time explaining them to  someone else, i just cant understand why this happens, but i want that  feeling to go away and i want to be better, i want to do the things  teenage me could only dream of even hoping to accomplish.

This  feeling doesnt even occur when i do other skill based things either, if  i wanna get good at a game i can do it without feeling overwhelmed, if i  wanna learn to cook something new, i handle failure extremely well,  know that mistakes are apart of the process and improve, but with art  and game design, i feel so pressured i guess is the right word? Im  really not sure but it only happens with things i feel so passionate  about

TLDR : wanna do art and game  development, but the moment i get down to it, i get these confusing  feelings and end up feeling awful, its been happening consistently for 4  years and no matter how much i prepare, know or learn i still cant get  that feeling to go away",20Feb2020,1

 I guess my question really is here how do I professionally give my boss the ultimatum to either match the offer given to me by the competition or do I just apply for the other job wait till I get it with a definitive pay number and set schedule and then leave these people have been good to me sort of but they tend not to follow the rules especially on paydays are checks always come late on holidays instead of early like everyone else and a lot of the time I feel like I’m not getting my fair pay especially with the amount of overtime I work anywhere between 100 and 150 hours every two weeks

622,"It’s a long read but I need advice ✌🏻

Alright so I’m travelling to Europe in June with my mate. We’ve been best friends since we were 10. We’ve recently had a bit of a falling out.

Context 

He’s recently started “seeing” a girl who is in our friendship group. All our friends are a bit unsure about it.

Anyway, some of our friends voiced their concerns in general, I voiced mine by saying I don’t want it to impact our holiday. We initially both promised to remain single but his loophole is that their not “labelling” anything 🤷🏻‍♂️

My concern was that whilst over there he’ll be on his phone and won’t have as much fun and in turn impact mine (a bit selfish but when you’re spending a lot of money it’s hard not to be)

We talked it out and everything was all good.

Fast forward two weeks later. Our group of friends catch up. He’s in a shit mood. Apparently he’s been acting all cold and rude to his workmates as well as us. I tried having a conversation with him and he just showed no interest and just walked off midway through the conversation. We wanted to go to the shops later in the evening and he didn’t want to come with us and gave no reason. In the end he came. We get back and decide to watch a movie I ask him what’s wrong and he says nothing. He goes to have a cigarette and I ask if I can have one and his reply is “no I’m saving them”. I had given him $25 dollars 4 days earlier to split the packet. I told him this and his reply was “that makes up for all the times you’ve asked me”. In the end I told him to stop acting like a 5 year old, called him a cunt and walked out. 

It’s been 3 weeks and we haven’t spoken. The only thing I’ve heard from him was when I graduated school and received a small “congratulations” in a group Snapchat. (Mind you he graduated his schooling a month ago and I sent him a large text saying how proud I was” to get something so little back after working hard this past year kinda sucked. 

I’m concerned about the holiday because we have things paid for etc etc but from a friendship standpoint i dunno what’s the best way to approach it.


We have a history where he’s been a bit of a shit mate. his last girlfriend ( who was best friends with my ex) after my breakup, disliked me for whatever reason. (Mostly my ex not being a fan of me and utilising girl talk lol) Because of that she told my best friend to choose between me and her, which is crazy and unfair to do. In the end he actually chose her. But even in the time before making the decision, he barely made time for any of his mates because he was so invested in his love interest. 5 months later they break up and he apologises to get me back. After a long verbal outburst and a pretty distant period we slowly built our friendship back up to a really strong point. But now he’s gone and done this again, and I don’t know if it’s a coincidence that it happens to be around the same time he’s got another romance occurring. 

There’s a lot of information but given the Europe situation and this history, and the current events, how should I approach this. I need a few perspectives here without bias form people who know us.",20Feb2020,1

you probably need an explanation on what happens right.. yeah you do.  
so when I explode at her it's like I'm scaring her, trying to make her submissive to me and I sometimes feel the urge to kick her but luckily I haven't but what has been happening was me choking her and pinning her down, and she is a small dog and I don't want this to continue.

I'm looking for some advice about my friend, 

I'm french btw, and 21, my friend is a Female; let's call her Marie.

Marie and I met in middle school in 6th grade; she is a blonde with blue eyes, smart, kind, and funny, the perfect girl. And while i was young, i never look to her more than friendship, my year in middle school were awful i was on the bad side with some bully, got into fight a lot and for the rest of the term with only texted through message on the phone or facebook ( or MSN too ).

She was always, and i mean, always a friend a mine. My father sees her as a second daughter, and yes, it's true, he like to be cheeky and say he'd love to have her as a true daughter. But i always told him nop. She is waaaay out of league. 

Even now i think she is, but worst, she is even way out of league even for friendship, i don't know what to do anymore, I always talk to her on social media, making sure she is always ok, taking care of her. 

She got robbed once and lost her favourite item, i bought it to her and even bought her a special teddy bear with a shirt with a picture of her family on. ( It was an old gift). Yet she never come to me, never ever. She like to spend time with someone that used to bully me , i don't know what to do anymore.

However we come from different cultures, in her family it is a requisite that she finds someone from the same culture, Mine isn't as strict. Despite our differences we still manage to see each other (behind her parents and siblings back). What we do basically is stay in the university or we go out yet, places too far away where nobody will notice us. But this year her brother coming to the same university we are going to and things are going to get a lot stricter. We plan to just meet in empty classrooms and thats it, she fears if we ever meet anywhere else public shit would go down, her to forcefully leave me.

628,"So I decided to get back with my ex and I’ve been really happy and were also having a baby on the way and I’m also happy about that as well. 

So awhile ago me and my gf get in a stupid fight and we she breaks it off or I did in the heat of the moment and then next day she texts this guy saying “I think your cute as fuck and I pretty sure you thought I was weird in high school” , I know we weren’t together and she did it because she was mad or something that’s okay/fine. Anyways I get a bit jealous and suspicious when we get back together because she always had a notification from this guy and she told me he keeps
Hitting her up and they don’t really talk, so things were rough for us and were kind of on and off but mostly off due to me being a insecure. I go to her house to surprise kind of and we make up and she tells that they talked while we were broken up but it’s was probably when we were together too because shit was so messy, she confesses to me that he asked for nudes and switch went off in my head and I knew there was more ( she didn’t send any btw). 

I message this guy and he tells me everything and says when we were broken up she responded to his Snapchat story saying the meaning of life is too suck dick your dick( to a question that said what’s the meaning of life wrong answers only),  but he has a device that lets him know who says it. I do think this was an honest mistake because obviously it was anonymous she didn’t know who it was too and that they’d be able to find out it was her. 

Anyways he tells me that she initiated every conversation and they didn’t really talk but she seemed really interested that he played guitar and she told him to listen to music and shit, but he did say there was no flirted or anything or making plans and he thinks she did To make me mad. Essentially just talking but not really just short convos. I was mad because she talked to him after he knew what she said about him 

She tells me that she maybe started two conversations and that she tried to make it awkward and shit because she was embarrassed because she didn’t mean to say she wanted to suck his dick or anything, she tried to leave him on read but he’d hit her up and they really had short awkward conversations, they both told me and had since both blocked eachother on everything.  

Apparently this guy is a huge asshole and is mean to people and is really full to himself and that’s why my gf talked to him because she was afraid he’d start shit. I also blame myself for treating he bad and being an asshole when I could have tried to be more civil.

I’ve just gotten a lot of answers saying this isn’t a big deal and break up like just answer all over the board but I have been happy since we’ve got back together

She’s trying really hard to make things work and I did break up with her for awhile and I realized how much she regretted doing this and that she didn’t say anything was lying and she was afraid I’d blow up if she told the truth.  I know it’s not cheating but sometimes it lingers around. But I do feel like a better person around her and a happier person with her and overall more relieved. I think maybe she did something like this out of anger, she has let a guy compliment her before who she was talking to when she broke up with me for a couple months for her own reasons before but thats not really an issue you anymore, and another time she posted about her ex like 3 days into our relationship but I don’t believe that guy existed and it was more of an attention thing and I don’t really care that much",20Feb2020,1

631,"So I met my girlfriend on tinder about 10 months ago and shes awesome. I really love her and her personality. However, ive come across an issue where I dont find her as attractive as i used to. Shes beautiful but some things about her are turn offs that I'd feel like an asshole if i wanted her to address it. About 5 months ago, i went to her home country of Taiwan and i had a blast. Taipei is an amazing city. Initially, due to the long distance nature of our relationship, i had mentally prepared myself that things would end once my trip to Taiwan was over, however, while over there i met some fellow Australians who told me about career opportunities in teaching English and how great it is. Now I've struggled with being directionless in life and this sounded like an excellent solution. Teach English, get paid pretty well and all without major qualifications. 

Now my main dilemma is that i want to move overseas to fulfil my career goals and finally have my moment of independence (move out of home and really be an adult) but i don't see my girlfriend in that picture. I kind of want to be completely single. I love her so so much but im worried I'll look back at this time in my life and think that i missed out on that feeling that I won't get when im in my 30s. The weird part is that my girlfriend introduced me to this country and i cant help but feel really rude for moving all the way to be near her after the awfulness that is long distance relationships, and then breaking up with her. I don't mind being with her for longer but part of me knows where its going to end up but i cry at the idea of breaking it off with her because shes the greatest woman I've ever been with.

So I immediately hugged him, said I'm sorry and that I've had a rough day and this morning I felt guilty so I drove him to work, apologized again and said it wasn't like me and he said it's fine and he stopped thinking about it right after.

Thing is, I still feel like shit, and I know it's disproportionate because I feel I handled it well. It was probably 20 seconds total and in time I caught myself, gave a hug and sincerely apologized two days in a row.

We kept texting on instagram and we're going along pretty good, 3days later we saw each other again on monday, we sat alone far away from people we had alot of fun joking around and talking and then we starting talking about us, i asked her like ""what are we"" and she said ""friends"" i was shook because i thought we're more than friends we kept talking and then she kissed me, we kissed for a while and she sat on my lap and talked even more and she kept saying we're just friends for now and how she doesnt like relationships and boys because of her ex i really felt broken not gonna lie but i respect her opinion and what she went through and didnt say otherwise, same thing happens next day but this time she was like getting closer to kiss me and then she backs off laughing kind of teasing me but next two days she started replying late on insta and kinda staying with her friends and doesnt wanna want us to be alone together but she still smiles and holds my hand and leans on my shoulders! when i asked her like if that's normal to her to kiss,hold hands with a ""friend she knew for 4/5 days"" and she said yes that's normal to me

I loved her but I am not still in love with her. The actual problem is that I have to see her face EVERY SINGLE DAY. I try to forget her and this ""forgetting countdown"" resets everyday.

Another problem is that this situation fucks my studying as well. I cannot concentrate and this gives me a really stressful mood. If I can't get into the college I want, my whole year literally will be a trash.

I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have received an unofficial offer for a job I really really really want. The pay is $2 more an hour than I was asking and comes with amazing benefits and great hours. I also love the staff already. The only thing I’m waiting for now is approval from the HR department (which there is no real reason for it to not be approved unless they do not like my personality through their assessment). I have also received an offer from another job (salary I had told them was the absolute lowest I could go, along with later hours and weekend hours which I do not prefer) however I do think I would love the staff there as well. I spoke with my preferred job yesterday (which marked one week from my interview) and I know that I have the job, but they do not know how long HR will take to approve me. So at this point I have decided to take the risk and wait for the job I really want and know I would be happier in and I need to decline the offer for this other job. I have never been in this position before as this is the first time I’ve ever really played the field looking for job offers. I do not want to burn a bridge with this other job because I will likely work in relation with them at my preferred job and I would love the future opportunity to work for them if my situation changes.

644,"Some background, I work private security. It’s a good fit for vets right out of the military. We have a large turnover rate. People quit all the time, and they usually quit mid-shift or on the spot because they despise our boss and the company. I don’t blame them. I think about quitting everyday, but the job pays well, and I have things to pay for. 

There’s an entire myriad of management problems here, so I won’t get into most of it. I regularly get a call from my boss first thing Saturday morning (my usual weekend) asking me to come in and work because someone called in sick. I usually say no. Then my boss and other higher ups get mad at me because I didn’t cover someone else’s shift. (I actually have a life outside of work). I work overtime every week already. They need to hire more people, but the hiring process takes months since it’s a government contract, and people need appropriate clearances. 

Today, someone called in sick from a 12 hour shift. I was scheduled to work 8 hours. They tell me “so and so called in sick so your working his 12 hour shift”. I tell them that I don’t want to, that I have things going on. They tell me that it’s my responsibility to find someone to cover for me if I want to go home when I was normally scheduled to. It’s a shitty situation, and things like this happen all the time. For the longest time, they wouldn’t even release the schedule until a day before the new week started. Employees here hate the bosses, and vice versa. 

I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do in this situation. People here can get fired for leaving their posts without relief. If I decide to leave at the end of my scheduled normal shift, could I get in trouble, or would it fall on the person who’s on the schedule for this post? What do I do? This is bullshit, I hate my life working here. But I can’t find anything better at the moment. I’m not in a position currently to quit my job. I have school and other things to pay for, and my skills from the military didn’t translate that well to civilian work.

650,"I'll preface this by saying a few things. First, I'm using a throwaway account because I know a few people on reddit, and don't want this coming to their attention (numerous reasons but we'll skip over that). I also don't know exactly what kind of advice I'm looking for in response to this post, but anything and everything will be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if it gets pretty long too.

So, to start off. Not to sound cocky or anything, but I'm normally the one giving advice, so it feels a bit odd asking for it, especially the internet and about things of this kind of nature. I therefore apologise if my question isn't so clear. Proceeding though, here's some background for you - I think it probably will help. Back in June/July of last year, I made friends with someone over Instagram. It was a case of just being a friendly person, helping someone out. Which led to us getting talking, making a connection and therefore becoming friends. Things progressed - as they do. At one point, I then realised that we'd spoken to eachother pretty much every day for a solid 4 months or so. She also admitted to me at one point that she had a crush on me. But we couldn't do anything about that, mainly because she's in CST of the US, and I'm UK based. She had just ended a pretty toxic relationship before this, which I had been helping her through. One of my friends stupidly tried to get involved too, by telling her I was into her, right around the time of the breakup. None of this affected our friendship whatsoever though. We continued talking as normal for a decent while after these events. We also both said we were eachother's best friends at some point. So I guess you could say we Friend Zoned eachother (if you believe it exists, I wouldn't say it does entirely). I should also mention that I'm a very helping and loving person. And whenever possible, I like to praise people and tell them how much they mean to me and how much I appreciate them etc. It's just what I do. She'd never objected to any of this either. We've also been supportive of eachother throughout the entirety of our friendship.

Now. A few months ago, I start noticing things dropping off. Our conversations slowly start dropping down to majority of the week, then half the week etc. Life moves on. I get it. But we're still really good friends. I was fine/happy with how things stood between us. Move to about 2 months or so ago now, and I feel like something is up. I'm getting lackluster responses, if I even do get a reply. The ratio was maybe 5 messages on my part trying to initiate conversation, to her 1 reply. So I ask her for no BS, full honesty, is there something wrong? We have a conversation about things. Basic jist she comes out with, is that; I'm too much for her; I'm too cringey and give her too much praise (I can get that on some level); she'd become kinda scared of me (in helping her through her toxic relationship, I made a few harmless jokes of having her ex ""sorted out"") and she believed I had a dark side to me so didn't want to come to me with her frustrations about me in fear I'd do something; I talked too much and our conversation types weren't very compatible because she preferred multiple short brief conversations as opposed to long lasting ones etc. None of these had seemed like issues to me or that they were causing issues with her whatsoever during our friendship. But she also said that she didn't want to come to me with these issues, because I was her best friend and she loved me and felt that if she came directly at me with these frustrations, I'd get angry at her and would flip out - potentially ruining our friendship. This coming from her fear of a non-existent dark side she believed I had/have. She then says ""and I have a bf now too"". I get that she's been focusing more on her relationship, than our friendship. Which, btw, I'm completely fine with and I'm happy for her - I've never particularly wanted anything beyond our friendship so there's no point saying I'm just being desperate and thirsty. Even so however, I was kinda hurt as we were supposed to be best friends, but she was only just then telling me about all of this. Leaving everything to build up to this point, and after she'd been with this guy about 2 or 3 weeks. It hurt as I felt we could talk to eachother about anything and everything, I'd known nothing of this guy's existence, and I had to find out all of it like this. Anyways. We talk things over, and we agree to give eachother a bit room to calm down and work things out etc. I said I'd let her be the one to send the first message when she was ready to pick things up. That came and things were ok for a bit. Since then though, she broke up with that guy, and our conversations have drastically decreased in quantity and quality. I get maybe two very brief conversations out of her a week, and I can be waiting on a reply for days on end. She still says I'm (one of) her best friend(s), but yet I barely get anything from her? She posted a number of things recently about a crush she has, and how she's trying to ghost him so that her feelings don't build too much (I think she mentioned a distance issue), but it's pretty hard to do. ""I don't know how to ghost someone?"". ""How do I ghost my crush!?"". Meanwhile I'm left thinking ""Just do the same as you're doing to me, 'cause you've pretty much been ignoring me for 6 days at a time, then just offering as little conversation as possible when we do talk"". I've also had a few really low points recently, and when I tried talking to her, I've gotten nothing. I'm still waiting for her to even read that I tried talking to her through my last one. Despite all those times we were there for eachother through in the past, it feels like she's had enough of being there for me.

So I really don't know what to do guys. I really treasure our friendship. She is one of my best friends. But lately I feel like it's been almost entirely one sided. If I try and bring up conversation, I'm mostly met by silence. And if I was to try things like I used to, and just keep messaging in hopes she reads something, I may get a reply; but it'd also be exactly the thing that she said she doesn't like. On the other hand, if I literally do nothing and don't message, I feel I can pretty much guarantee that she won't be the one to initiate any conversation. I know she's got a bunch of other friends and she once said it's kinda hard trying to balance everyone. But I feel like I've just been swept almost completely aside from everyone else. I feel like I'm Woody in the scene in Toy Story 2 where Andy says ""Oh. I forgot. You're broken. I don't wanna play with you anymore..."" and drops him. Like I said before, I get that life moves on. I get that people grow apart. But in this particular incidence I'm just confused and a bit frustrated at how I can supposedly remain her best friend, and her conversation is like there's nothing wrong, yet I feel I'm a side character that is overlooked until/unless it conveniences her, or she's finished with the main characters. I don't want our friendship to end, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't either because she's said multiple times about not letting anything come between us and that she'd never give up on us. However, I don't know if I can cope with things going on as is. It's like a cartoon where they wave a carrot on a stick infront of a donkey and it chases after it. Then it gets worn out and gives up, but then the carrot's waved infront again and we're off chasing again. The donkey being me and the carrot being our friendship.

So yeah. I really don't know what to do. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. And before you say anything along these lines, again, no I'm not just thirsty af for a relationship. I don't want anything like that with her. And I'm not desperate for anything. If I was, I'd be ""crying"" to her, begging for things to change. I just want to try and work out the best way of moving forwards. Whether that be by moving on, or working out how to ""fix"" how things stand. I apologise for the length of this and thank those who read through it all",20Feb2020,1
651,"For some context, I have epilepsy as well. Recently diagnosed and I had a tonic clonic seizure back in June, it was originally misdiagnosed as functional neurological disorder. I have myoclonus and she has abscense seizures. We are both on the same medication. 
I understand why she wouldn't want to tell anyone and pretend that she doesn't have any issues, she's a very stoic person. I have never seen her cry in my entire time of our friendship, despite the fact that she's always been there for me. 
We are planning to go away together with a few other friends soon for a few months, and what if she had a seizure when we were away and we didn't know?
I had an EEG done in December and she had one done in January, and she was really scared. Why did she feel she could come to me about it? I know I'm not owed information, but when I was diagnosed with epilepsy, wouldn't that be a good time to come to me and to talk about it? Shared trauma and all that. Having someone in the same boat as you can really help with dealing with something, I have a lot of intrusive thoughts and talking to my friend with intrusive thoughts really helped me to cope. 
Also I found out through our parents, they've been friends for years. When her mum found out I had epilepsy she went straight to mine and they went out for coffee and chatted about it for a while.
I just need some advice about how to deal with this, im obviously not going to say anything to her and I know when to keep secrets because ""touts are targets"" and all that. I just feel a little bit shocked that she felt she couldn't talk to me about it.",20Feb2020,1

653,"Here is just a little more info regarding this question: I myself am on the autistic spectrum (PDD-NOS) and this question keeps reoccurring to me after hearing stories like these from friends and other sources. Just to be clear, I am in no way insecure about me being autistic. It is simply who I am and I wouldn’t have it any other way. However, I am still curious if there is an option to eradicate this mental prison within myself. The word “prison” is an exaggerated term of course, after all PDD-NOS is a mild form of autism. When I tell people I am autistic people usually act surprised, and some even refuse to believe it. I however still believe that this hurricane inside my head greatly impacts my life,  limiting me from sometimes making real connections with people that I like or sending me into a spiral of insecurity and paranoia which I find very difficult to escape. I have known that I was autistic since I was eight. I went to a hospital with my mother because I had problems falling asleep as a little kid (still do) and this is when I was diagnosed. Since my 20th I began to think a lot about myself and have started to become aware of my own thinking patterns and since my 24th (which I am now) I am almost fully aware of them. 

Meditation has helped me with this, and I learned by recognizing my thoughts I find it easier to let them go. Still, I have my good days and bad days, and even on good days the amount of thinking I do only differs by a margin of 5% from the bad days (just a guess). I am fully aware that the vast majority of people have an inner monologue or even a dialogue inside their own mind which holds them back from experiencing the world fully, but I am pretty sure that my inner monologues are a bit more stretched throughout the day. Rather yet, my mind will not shut up unless I am occupied with something that I am *REALLY* into, meaning that most of the free time I have or events that are boring even in the slightest bit will get occupied by my brain. Most of the time these thoughts aren’t even monologues but rather fantasies that keep me in this passive state of mind, unsure whether I am the one who consciously put that thought inside of me or my “autism” (which might or might not be an external part of my personality). Even though I just said that *“I wouldn’t have it any other way”*, I still would like to be able to genuinely enjoy a conversation with someone and to stop playing this social game of chess trying to figure out what to say or do next. I am *good* at this game of chess, which is probably why people don’t notice my autism, but I want to be *me* while conversing and not a version of me. I also want to enjoy the world individually through my own perspective without being sucked into my own self worrying about other people/ my own future or past/ random stuff.

I think of tens of thousands of sentences to write each time I write a new one and forget all them once I try to recollect these possibilities, so I might have left out a huge chunk of information about myself. Should there be any questions then feel free to ask them here or send a pm :)",20Feb2020,1
655," I just wanted to check and see if anyone had advice for someone who is thinking about potentially going to medical school after having a non-medical degree.

656,"Hi - My dads term life insurance plan recently came up for renewal. Is it a good idea to renew given the context below? 

* The renewal came in for 10 years, $4k/year for just my dads policy 
* My parents still owe a significant amount on the house. Their mortgage was refinanced for another 30 years, with little to no equity in the house (yes, not ideal)
* My parents finances are very tight with almost having to live paycheck to paycheck with no savings.
* If anything were to happen to my dad, my mom would not be able to support herself financially, let alone pay for the mortgage. Knowing her she will also not want to downsize or rent a smaller apartment.
* My dad got sick recently prior to the renewal but is now fortunately doing better and has been cleared by the doctors.

My thought process is that if anything were to happen to my dad, the policy could help pay for a place for my mom to live without financial strain. Or is this not worth paying the life insurance and saving that to use for a rainy day fund?",20Feb2020,1
657,"For some context - I'm 18 (turned in January), live with my parents and am in my final year of secondary education. I'm an only child and am very close with my parents. My family is heavily influenced by conservative views, the military and Catholicism. My mum is foreign and because of circumstance, i am closer with her. Don't get me wrong, my parents have a happy marriage but I relate more with my mum even though I am close with my dad. However, recently i've began to notice how controlling my parents are.

Firstly, they dictate who i date. No, they aren't trying to set me up with people but every time i like someone my mum will find a flaw and my dad will express his conservative views. Even though they're 9 years apart and met when my mum was in uni, god forbid i talk to someone older than me. 

I've always liked tattoos and am looking forward to getting one. Whenever i mention getting one, my dad asks me what my mum thinks and whether she's ok with it. My mum uses the ""your body is a temple"" bs. If it's my temple I can do whatever i want with it, no? Of course not. I get the ""i created you and your body don't you dare ruin it.""

Whenever i want to make a decision, they give me every reason under the sun to go against what i've decided but then end it with ""BUT we want you to be happy"" or ""BUT you're 18 now so it's not up to us"" or ""BUT we're so happy you can talk to us."" 

Don't get me wrong, i know i am very lucky to have the relationship i have with my parents because i see how shit some of my friends have it. I'm spoilt and don't have a curfew but i'm beginning to feel restricted or that everything i do has to be a group decision. 

I'm so conflicted because I don't want to ruin the relationship with my parents because I'm sure they're only doing what they think is right for me - plus they pay for my education and i live under their roof - but I want my independence and I want to be happy. After all, the mistakes I might make by taking my parents advice does not relay back onto them, it remains with me. So, why shouldn't I choose to make my own mistakes?

658,"So I moved out this months. This was the first time I’ve ever been on my own actually paying normal rent etc and I felt proud of that cuz my life hasn’t been easy and I’m finally happy and feel like i can rely on myself. 

The house I’m living in is really nice and I’m supposed to have roommates. My friend lived in a really shtty dirty house and told me how bad he had it, how he was so upset about it, how living with his sister was terrible so I helped him by speaking to my landlord and now he’s moving into the room downstairs. 

Anyways, I didn’t realize what a pretentious dck he has been. His friend asked about me and apparently he was told by him that “oh yeah I’m just concerned about her cuz she’s in suuch a bad place rn” when I’m not. I’m happy, I made that clear. He made it seem like I was broken somehow ..... He’s just out here looking for ANY minor details about my life to act as if he’s somehow doing better than me. I asked what made him think I was in a bad place. He said it’s because I don’t eat enough vegetables and vape cuz it helped me quit cigarettes. 

Let me get it straight though, he accompanied me when I went grocery shopping and he kept nagging me about my fcking food choices, pushing me to buy sht I didn’t want to with my own money like “oh u need to eat better, u need to be healthy like me” I asked why he keeps nagging me and that it’s condescending, he said it’s because I need someone to tell me these things cuz I don’t have parents to do it IM 22!!!! He insinuated that my parents don’t care enough about me even though he knows nothing about it.


This whole time he’s been talking about several people this way and I honestly don’t even think he’s a good friend anymore. He talks about how his friends don’t know how to act, tells me about their issues etc. I’m questioning whether he’s exaggerating about them too. 

Him living in the same house which is much nicer and cleaner will just give him something else to boast about and make others feel like he’s in a much better place in life than them. I regret it cuz i should’ve let him handle it on his own. There is no genuine care or concern from him, he has nothing on me so I can’t believe he went after 2 minor details about me, analyzed tf out of them to act like my life is tragic like some snobby prick.",20Feb2020,1

661,"TL;DR University student with anxiety problems thinking about quitting minor in education and getting a parttime job instead to finance the coming two years

Hello everyone, I have quite the problem to unpack here, so, here goes:

I am 25 and I am a third-year university student. I was planning on graduating this year, but things took a different turn. Long story short, the first minor programme I followed was not to my liking (journalism) so I wanted to change minors and I took the minor in education course instead. But, as it required me to do the entire minor course in one semester, I decided to postpone writing my BA to prevent a too high of a study load (35 credits per semester is my limit, in terms of being able to realistically pass every course). 

The problem is, now I want to quit the programme for the minor in education as well (three weeks in).  

I followed a similar programme in the past for about a year and a half before deciding to go to university instead, but I quit that programme as well, as I was unsure whether I wanted to be a teacher or not for the rest of my life (after being an intern for 14 months). Now, about three years later, I've got that same feeling again and I don't know what to do about it. If this would have been 'my calling', why do I feel so incredibly stressed after each day at my internship? Yeah, teaching is very difficult, but I shouldn't feel so incredibly stressed right? I highly value the education and I was genuine in my pursuit to become a teacher, but I am thinking that I am just the wrong kind of person to teach. I only have to teach four hours a week and it is only making my anxiety worse (I have seen a therapist for social anxiety in the past) and it is making me very unhappy. I feel dejected and I am not getting any joy from it what so ever. Should I listen to my feelings or am I being unreasonable? 

Translation studies: 

After my first two days of teaching at my internship, I felt completely exhausted and my anxiety skyrocketed. I was not able to properly function for the remainder of that day. The weekend that followed was also very stressful because of that. This led me to search for alternative career paths and translation studies seemed like an attractive choice. I  never thought about becoming a translator before as it seemed like that were no enough jobs out there, but it turns out there are a reasonable amount of options out there and according to some sources there is even a small lack of translators where I am from (The Netherlands). I love languages and it is so stupid that I never explored this career option before, but now it has gotten my attention and I can still obtain a master degree that way. The thing I don't know is if I am overreacting about teaching or not. I kinda feel lost. 

There is also a financial catch:

I only have 14 months of student tuition left to finance myself (housing, groceries, tuition fees) and that is just enough to get my bachelor's degree next year (as I fucked myself with graduating this year by switching minor), but not enough to get my master degree by June 2022. This is not too big of a problem, however, as I can fairly quickly get a parttime job to be financially independent. 

Minor in education:

Getting that minor in education would mean I can get a teaching license for middle school, which translates to steady employment for the foreseeable future, yet should I? I can't think straight and I am prone to just drop this minor as well and start over next semester to finish my BA. 

Can someone please help me? 

Long story short:

\- swapping minor study programme led me to postpone my BA graduating by a year

\- teaching is incredibly stressful to me, making me feel like complete shit, exhausts me mentally

\- not sure what to do instead, translating has piqued my interest

\- slight money problems

\- quarter-life crisis much",20Feb2020,1

663,"So this is about a former friend (Fuck, let's call him Micah) , a girl I haven't talked to in 4 weeks (let's call her Molly), and their emotionally abusive relation ship.

Now I started talking to Micah a few months ago. During that time he would always put me down and insult me. He also told me a bunch of stuff and said it was his test to see if he could trust me. Now that I look back. That was rather manipulative. He said he felt sad all the time. I told him I couldn't diagnose him and told him to see a psychiatrist because it could be a mental health issue and even said I go to therapy. He went on about how he's not crazy and stuff like that. He obviously didn't want help. 

 He started dating molly, and they were talking about meeting up and etc. pretty quickly. Constantly bragging about how he got pics. Etc. 

Molly and I would talk about stuff. Not anything about relationships. Advice. Joking around etc. Micah would ask many times what we talk about. I found out he wouldn't want her talking to guys,, or even got mad when she had guy friends. Meanwhile, he constantly bragged to her and me that he was getting girls snapchats, and constantly talked about girls he could date. I told Molly this was toxic, and she was upset about his actions. 

This eventually got to a point where I got upset with him because he started flirting with a new girl because he and Molly hadn't talked in a week. He bragged about how she was upset that he was dating molly. Fast forward a night. 

Me and my buddy went into their call and confronted him. Micah started lying and saying he never said that. Blocked me and told everyone I was a backstabbing guy who was fake af. 

I told Molly and her best friend. I showed molly pictures of him threatening to block me for calling him out. I gave molly as much advice as I could, and said she should leave. Apparently, they're still dating, and I should take my own advice. If she doesn't want help. I can't help her. 

Fast forward to now. It's got to a point where I have friends who are leaving me because Micah got in their head and told them I was a POS who only cared when I had no one else. I know that if they're leaving because of that, theyre really not friends, but it honestly sucks that some rat can destroy friendships like that, and it's just hard to think about.

The problem is, over time, they got me more expensive and quality things, so I got used to getting more, and now they don't support me anymore other than only giving me $2,500 a month to live off of, which is almost nothing.

My parents will be extremely disappointed in me. I have already disappointed them 3 times before. They fight because of me, and only me. For example, when I got a 750 on SAT Physics, 32 on ACT Science, or 1470 on the SAT. I know that these are very good scores, but my parents are still angry about them.

I am afraid that my parents will yell at me and beat me, or even punish me if I tell them what my career path is. I can tell them that it's God's calling for me, but they won't believe that. My parents and I have not gotten along the best in the past, and I just can't talk to them about this. In the past, they have physically and verbally abused me, they have talked bad about me behind my back (when I could hear them), and they also compare me to my siblings.

Just because I am a male doesn't mean I must study engineering. Ben Carson became a doctor, FDR was a lawyer, Plato and Confucius were philosophers, Jeremy Lin and Lebron James play basketball, and Ptolemy was an astronomer. Many of my friends want to go into engineering, but that doesn't mean I have to. I have talked to a few close friends at school and church about this, and they just told me to tell my parents and not worry too much about how they will react.

My parents paid so much for my education and all that. Yet I disappoint them by wanting to be an economics teacher (I also plan to teach environmental science and philosophy). I have anxiety and depression, as well as paranoia and scoliosis. I will get ridiculed if I tell my parents.

On the other hand, my sister wants to be the owner of a ballet studio. My parents are perfectly cool with that, and my mom drives her to ballet class 3 times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: How do I tell my parents that I do not want to be an engineer? I want to be a teacher (preferably teaching AP/IB in high school).",20Feb2020,1

673,"so, after a perfect two years of amazing relationship, I did something stupid and cheated on my gf. I am filled with remorse, regret and pain, and I will never, ever do this again in my life. I was going to tell her, but the girl I cheated her with ( an Ex) contacted her first, and I would do everything I can to undo it, I cant, but I will do my best to mend it. There is love between us, we have been already intimate, after the deed, she has told me she forgives me, and she is affectionate at times, and cold at others. She loves lyrics, songs, so I wrote her a song to ask forgiveness. Please give me your opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

All the bliss, everything in the world,

All my life, desires, dreams and hopes,

The slice of heaven so divine, for which Id give my life and die, 

I trampled it, I hurt it, I damaged it, and worst, I made you cry.

&amp;#x200B;

All the columns, I toppled them with my lies,

And I lied, looking at your emerald eyes,

No excuses, I risked a treasure for a dime,

I Injured it, I scarred it, I wounded it, and worst of all, I made you cry.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish, I could take back all I did,

Go back in time, and not throw life into an abyss,

Cheat, deny and lie, its what I did and now we are dry,

I slashed it, I spoiled it, I cracked it, and even worst, I made you cry

&amp;#x200B;

And now Im filled, with regret and shame, and miss our peaceful days

all the name you told me, all the time you touched me, your caresses, I set everything ablaze

All I wish, is id never hurt you, never made drop a single sad tear

I just love you, I dont want to lose you, and right now, Im so damn scared,

All I want, is to love you, as before I always have,

I want you, adore you, love you with all my heart,

I promise, I will never ever, hurt you or lie again,

I will be with you, loving and patient, until there is no pain,

So I ask of you, love of my life, please find forgiveness for me in your heart.

&amp;#x200B;

All the sunsets, I want to share with you,

all the walks I want to share, until we go trough a hundred shoes,

every sound, every taste, every grass patch were we lie,

I bruised it, I Ignored it, I marred it, and why oh why, I hate that I made you cry

&amp;#x200B;

My mistake, I will regret it all my life,

And I will live, doing anything I can

To make it up to you, to make you happy Ill always try,

I cheated, I lied, I was selfish and damned, oh why, oh god why, I made you cry

&amp;#x200B;

But sweet baby, I love you with all My heart,

I want our future, to be with you all my days

I could not live, with us being apart,

Ill give my life, to get out of this maze,

To feel your beating heart, and your arms every night

I would give half of my remaining days to make everything alright,

So I ask of you, love of my life, please find forgiveness for me in your heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Please take me back, I am filled with shame, regret its all my fault,

You did nothing wrong, it was all me, our trust I did assault,

I know it will take time , to mend this harm, and to again be able to laugh

So I ask of you, love of my life, please find forgiveness for me in your heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Please forgive me, I will never hurt you again, because you are the light in my eyes

I feel so cold without the warmth of your skin, no music without your voice,

So I ask of you, love of my life, please find forgiveness for me in your heart.

Ill be patient, humble, honest and truthful, please forgive me love of my life,

Its the only time you'll eve have to forgive me, so please forgive me, just this once.",20Feb2020,1

The problem is that since she is new, she is always with this one girl that she gets along with making it hard to get a conversation going between me and her.

I don't find many girls at college who are kind of ""my type"", but the ones I do are out of my league. I have painfully realized the fact that all friends are temporary and most of them try to get personal gains out of friendship. Also I cannot talk about this to anybody as it'll obviously portray me as weak and desperate. I am average looking, fairly smart and I've been kind of an introvert (1 have zero social confidence) since past few years.

The hall smelled like some kind of burning, but definitely not weed. A friend suggested it may be crack if it’s a plastic burning-like smell, which it kind of was. 

When I knocked on the door they didn’t respond, the music was playing right by where the door is at. I had to knock harder and harder and by the fourth knock, after some shuffling a man (the tenant is a woman) came to the door, locked it after a lot of jangling, and said what sounded like “oh it’s the guy who lives here” from the other side, never opening it to speak to me directly.

I gave up and went upstairs halfway expecting to call the police for the sake of the music but it cut off shortly after.

688,"First off I’m sorry if you don’t believe in abortion or this triggers you in any way, it’s not my intention to start drama or bring up negative feelings. I just need advice. I was with this guy (lets call him Daniel) for 8 months on and off and we were honestly really toxic for each other. I loved him whole heartedly and I know he had to of loved me or we both wouldn’t have kept going back. I deleted so many friends out of my life because to me this was the end game, he was my one and only and it didn’t matter who was in my life because I had him. He was all I wanted and all I needed. I ended up getting pregnant, I (21) had mixed feelings on keeping it or not. I made the mistake of looking up baby names but he (20) pushed for abortion. Told me if he knew I would have kept the baby he would have never had sex with me without a condom and he told me he would leave me because he couldn’t be a dad. I wasn’t on birth control and I know it was stupid, we were drunk together on New Year’s Eve and just got carried away. 

We do long long distance and I ended up deciding to get an abortion 3 days after I found out I was pregnant. He’s an hour and a half away and I had to go to the appointment alone. I had to take the pills alone, I had to go through the lowest point in my life, alone. He was MIA the night I thought I had to call 911 because it hurt so bad I thought I was truly going to die. I think after that I held on to resentment and the thought that if he wasn’t there for me at my worst he doesn’t deserve me at my best. 

Fast forward 3 more days. I blow up on him for something so simple because my emotions are in disarray. He tells me if I say “fuck this” one more time he will break up with me. I pushed his buttons and said it again. He broke up with me. For the first 2 weeks he wanted to get back together with me, yet never made the trip to try to win me back. I shouldn’t have expected him to come see me but the way and the timing of him breaking up with me I felt as if it was deserved. 

I ended up becoming friends with the people I was friends with before him and they welcomed me back with open arms. Fast forward a month and a half and I text him when I’m drunk, I emailed him telling him that I miss him because he had to block me, due to him not being able to move on if he keeps in contact with me. He told me if I stopped drinking, stopped going out, and stopped being friends with those same people then he will think about taking me back. 

I miss him with my whole heart but I know that I shouldn’t take the chance of ruining friendships AGAIN, just for a chance of a relationship with someone who is bad for me. And it’s not just him I feel as if I’m bad for him too. But I truly thought he was the one and it hurts so badly that he’s not in my life right now. Are these feelings natural? I feel like I’m going absolutely crazy and I know I need to get over him I just can’t. Please give me some advice for me to move on. I know I can’t go back to him and I know it won’t happen but I’m just not doing well at all through this. I just want to be someone’s favorite person again and I can’t let it be him anymore. 

Please give me advice for moving on.

Sorry for formatting. I’m on my phone and if I read it over again I know I won’t post it. Also please don’t come at me for getting an abortion, I didn’t know what to do and felt as if it were my only option. I do regret it, I just wanted him.",20Feb2020,1

701,"I first noticed it in December. I used to use Kik, so I know what the notification sounds like and I also know what kind of activity typically goes on there nowadays. Me and my mom were home alone in the kitchen when I heard the all too familiar sound of the Kik notification from her phone. She looked down at her phone for a few seconds before turning her phone off again. I don’t remember if it was that time or a time after but I was able to catch a glimpse of the notification and the name of the person who texted her was “*city near us* Beefcake”. It’s because of that and the fact that my parents communicate through iMessage that I know it isn’t my father. I immediately got a horrible feeling about it. All throughout the Christmas season I’d hear that annoying notification sound from her phone or would catch her on Kik, but would never be able to read any of the messages. After Christmas, I didn’t see/hear anything for a while and my parents seemed more affectionate so I convinced myself I’d just been paranoid and nothing was wrong. But today I went out with my mom and the entire time I would hear that stupid notification. She was glued to her phone, texting whoever this may be. I wanted to say “why are you on kik?” Just so she’d know that I know that she’s on Kik. But I got too nervous and never did. When I’d try to subtly move closer to her just to see if I could sneak a peak at her phone, she’d subtly shift away. I’m a crazy paranoid person, so I have no idea if this is all in my head and I’m just exaggerating the situation. I don’t know what to do. Next time I hear her on Kik, should I say anything? My mom’s still affectionate towards my dad, but they’re really good about hiding their issues from me and keeping that stuff behind closed doors.

702,"I (22M) moved into my apartment building about a month ago. I've been having trouble sleeping some nights. A couple of nights ago was one of those nights.

It was about 3AM. Something I do (but probably not anymore after this) would be to iron my clothes and get it out of the way if I wake up so I can adjust my alarm and get a little more sleep before work.

I was not quiet enough and I hear a bang and ""Are you kidding me?!!!! Something, something, motherfucker!"" It was clear that I woke my neighbor up.

I immediately stopped what I was doing and just decided to lie in bed, very embarassed, waiting to fall asleep. The next day, after coming home from work, the neighbor had movers over and as I got my mail, I hear ""He was making that damn noise last night!""

Let's be clear. The noise completely my fault, and doing what I did was a terrible idea, especially in hindsight. In the future, if I'm having a ""bad night"", I will read a book or something or just try to go back to sleep.

My question is how I should deal with the situation? Obviously I'm gonna make sure I don't make noise again but how should I deal with this neighbor?

Part of me thinks that I should just not make anymore noise at night and that it will eventually blow over. The other part is thinking ""just knock on her door and apologize already!""

From her reaction and the amount of profanity she was using, I don't know if that would just piss her off more.

703,"Hello reddit. I'm a (not very accomplished) student in Europe. In my country, my field is not very well paid (1000€/month) and I have the chance to go to the US for an internship at a crazy cool company that would open a lot of doors for me in the field of my studies. I have two problems. The first is that my country is a paradise to live in and i would prefer not to leave it since I am with a girl (whom i'm going to marry as soon as I have a way to provide for us) and my whole family is here. The second problem is that I've been playing with the idea of being an air traffic controller (ATC).   


I got my studies delayed because I never wanted a desk job from 9 to 5, where i would feel like just a number in the company. The company at the US is incredible and the CEO is an amazing guy with a lot of experience and that would teach me a lot. But at the end of the day I would end up doing a dull and not very exciting job. As an ATC, I would be able to have a (very) confortable livelyhood (my familly is very poor and money never was a motivation for me, carreer wise, but it would be great to earn a good amout of money) and every one that i speak with says that they love their work, that the company is amazing and that they never feel like they are sofucated by their job or that they feel that they are traped in a routine for the rest of their lifes.  


I'm completely in love for the ATC job. I mean, it's everything I wished as a profession. A great company that pays well and is located in my country. The problem is that the selection process is incredibly hard. It's my last year to apply for the ATC course and I have to answer the US company for the internship. Both of them shouldn't be possible to have because I can't accept the internship and then turn it down since it would make the company to lose the money from the visa and other sponsorships that they would kindly give me.   


I've been asking friends and familly for some advice and it's a delicate subject since the entrance in the ATC course is a completely unknown. What would you, oh reddit sages, do?

Ps. I'm in the aerospace engineering field and the US are a dream for everyone in my country. Some of my colleagues even go for some NASA internships but I am not good enough.

705,"So I’ve been talking to this guy for several months now. For the most part, we’re great. He treats me really well and we have fun when we’re in each other’s company. However, there has been a couple of red flags. He has an attitude problem and when he gets mad whether it be from other people or myself, regardless, he’ll let it out on me. I’ve spoken to him about this and he said that whenever he gets in a mood, I should give him space to cool off.

Monday night, we were hanging out and I said something that triggered or annoyed him. After that, his mood was completely ruined and we sat in silence while he took me home. He was really cold towards me. We didn’t talk the whole next day and I was “giving him space.” Tuesday night, he asked to “meet up and talk about things” since he didn’t like how the previous night ended. I wasn’t ready to speak with him because of the way he treated me. I didn’t respond until Wednesday night asking him when we should meet. Now, it seems that he is purposely leaving me on seen and ignoring my text. 

Is it right for him to act this way and not tell me what has pissed him off right off the bat? How much space should I give him until it’s considered emotional abuse?

I’m thinking about either ending things with him or hearing him out when we do talk and giving him another chance depending how long it takes him to respond. My patience is running thin.


Edit: I’d like to add that before he dropped me off, I said “thanks” as a way to initiate convo and end the night on a better note. He responded with “bye” with a very dismissing attitude. I felt that there was no room to reach out to him in any way after that which is why I expected him to resolve things.",20Feb2020,1
706,"You can skip this paragraph it's just a Little about me.

I turned 25 today. I graduated with my Mechanical Engineering degree 2 months ago. 

I have an internship currently for 2 more months where I work 3-4 days a week (29 hours max) at a place 25 minute drive away. Job is relatively easy for what's expected and I can relax at work sometimes on my phone for now since I'm interning not much to do after I finish my work.

Personally, I prefer Engineering over nursing / lawyer / whatever else there is in the school degree lists.

However, I'm severely depressed now. I don't want to work a 9-5 job for the rest of my life. 9-5 means, you get up at 7:40 am to get ready, come home at 5:20-5:30 go to the gym and your day is over.

For the rest of your life. To me, this is fucked up. 

I've discussed this with friends and they all told me the same thing, try doing what you love.

What I love to do is attempt to make funny videos / internet status. Yeah I get it, the market is saturated everyone wants to do that. However I'm trying my best and what makes me happy is not waking up for someone else to do stuff I don't really want to do. (Engineering isn't what it's made out to be).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the advice, I find that videos should be high quality otherwise they're shit. My phone is shit I'll try to get a better one so if anyone has any recommendations for that (preferably selfie camera is better).

TikTok is doing good for now, I have 4.9k followers although that doesn't mean much on TikTok. A lot of people have 5-10k followers.

There's a guy named Anwar and Waleed who are really funny. Basically them.

I would love any advice. For the record, as an Engineer I'll be making 60k in a few months every year, I'd rather do what I love and make half that because at least I'd be happy waking up.",20Feb2020,1

Yesterday I went to the flower shop where they said they were coming from, and the owner told me they didn’t send me any text message  and don’t have an employee with the name the text gave me. I know it’s a stretch but sex trafficking has been happening a lot, and I’m super scared. Do you think it’s what I think? Or maybe someone messing with me? Idk what to do. I have no evil ex, no enemies. I traced the number on Facebook, it came to a Hispanic mans page, all in Spanish. Is there something I can do moving forward? Please help",20Feb2020,1

I feel like I’m over her but inside I really don’t know that I am and i feel like if I saw them together it would destroy me. She also has said to my friend that she wants to get with him at the party to upset me and if I’m being completely honest it would upset me.

For some background I live in Pittsburgh which is a pretty decent tech hub and have pretty decent references I can use on my resume. The problem is that I took a lot of my IT classes early on alongside my generals in community college and I feel like a lot of what they taught me is semi useless now especially when working with my peers on our senior project.

Eventually I got drunk,  I found another girl and I slept with her. Unfortunately I caught genital herpes. Well I'm sure I did because I devolped a blister looking thing on my foreskin and my results for syphilis were negative so I know it had to be genital herpes.  I dont know what to do I'm only 17. I can never go back to my old life. I made one mistake and I payed for it, I cant ever change it. Its sucks , I wanted to have a life with a family , now idk how i could make that work. I honestly been having suicidal thoughts but I'm such a openminded spirit and I know that suicide is not my destiny. I been crying every night thinking of all the missed opportunities I have just for the dumb mistake. Worst part of it is I want my girl back. Never going to happen now. I would never put her at risk of this nightmare. Itd be best for me to never contact her again. Even though I know this will shatter her heart I know it's the right thing to do.

About 2 months but started off as barely anything, past week worse than ever. Took multivitamins and iron vitamins since this started for about a month but they didn’t do anything at all so I stopped.

Always feel dizzy and confused, and can’t ever catch my trail of thought. Really often stumble on words or forget words 

Nearly fainting every time I stand up. Sudden rush of dizziness, have to hold onto something so I don’t faint, lasts from 15-20 seconds 

Pins and needles really often even from sitting normally. Very quickly and at times I shouldn’t get pins and needles, understand if I’m sitting on my foot etc but that’s never the case

Was out a couple of days ago and just feel like I had no circulation from the shoulders down, felt extreme aching even when I hadn’t done anything. Felt like my arm was going to fall off. Left arm.
Constantly getting this in my legs too but mainly my right one.

Constantly feel like I need to go to sleep. 

Always feel like I’m floating 

Cried today after eating dinner, my right leg felt completely fuzzy and numb and I laid down and felt like I couldn’t breathe probably, was really struggling to breathe

721,"I (31F) was bullied in my last year of high school by 3 girls who I thought were friends. They were the cool girls and looking back I really tried really too hard to be friends with them. Happened over several months of subtle bullying and manipulation, drinking and taking drugs and resulted in them getting raging drunk and high, cornering and screaming at me and calling my mother to yell at her for how “poorly she raised me.” 

There was more than happened after but I never got to confront them with how fucked up that whole experience was. I’ve honestly blanked out some of the details of that year but it left me with a lot of social anxiety and some mistrust of new people.

That being said I’ve managed to make close friends with a few people as an adult but I still think about this incident and how I never stood up for myself.

Since then I’ve moved countries and cities (for other reasons) unfortunately, the ring-leader of the girl gang lives in the same city and there is a chance I’ll run into her quite soon or at some point.

The thought of meeting her out makes me feel paranoid and highly anxious - feels exactly like I’m back in high school.

I’ve fantasized about what I’d say if I ever ran into her but I’m afraid that would get scared and act friendly like nothing happened.


Is there anything I could do to prepare to see her? What is a good reaction if I see her that doesn’t betray my own experience but doesn’t make me look crazy?

Any good tips to get over this kind of fear?

My room only shares one wall with the rest of the house, and then the rest of my room juts out into the backyard on all three sides. On one side, right outside my bedroom, there is a little sitting area, which is where my roommate sits when he smokes.   
So here is the problem--on and off for the past few weeks, I have woken up to my room REEKING of cigarette smoke--the problem is never during the day, when it happens it is always at night. I'll look outside when it happens and I never see anyone there. I'm beginning to wonder if he's smoking inside the house from time to time? The smell has mostly dissipated quickly and from what I can tell hasn't stuck to my clothes. Until today. The smell woke me up an hour and a half ago and has dissipated a little, but I can still smell it. I can also smell it on some of my possessions now.   
How do I go about broaching this subject with my roommate? I've considered texting him one on one, but I don't want him to feel attacked. I also thought perhaps I could send a text to all the roommates like ""has anyone noticed a weird cigarette smell coming into the house late at night?"" playing it dumb kind of thing. I'd like to see him smoke either out in our front yard, or farther away from the house.

My FH struggled at first because he had referred to her as a him for about 21 years. I worked with FH and was able to have him regularly using her proper pronouns and name. However, when SIL came out to her parents a few months later, there was a bit of a snag. Her parents were a little upset at first but ultimately said they support her. 

The problem now, is that even though they say they support her, they never use her preferred name and pronouns. They say that they are still trying to adjust to the news, which I guess I could understand -the whole ""mourn a son, celebrate a daughter"" thing, but its been a year and they're still doing this. It's gotten to the point that because of them, my FH has reverted back to misgendering and dead-naming her. It really upsets her, and she feels like her parents and FH don't actually support her.

736,"Doesn't matter where I go or whom I talk to - people these days apparently have a really weird relationship with food. I want to change my diet as I am a bit too chubby for my liking, but I find it incredibly hard to stick to anything because everyone's eating habits totally suck. 

I grew up with 3 meals a day and snacks in-between. So breakfast, lunch, dinner. Breakfast was usually eggs and a sandwich, or a bowl of cereal. Lunch was an average sized meal and where we ate until we were full, really. Dinner was either leftovers from lunch or toast/salad, so a little bit lighter. But each meal was satisfying and no one went hungry any portion of the day.

I tried to keep this ""tradition"" up, but failed miserably because no one in my life seems to ""want"" 3 meals a day at normal times: my boyfriend does not eat all day and cooks an elaborate, huuuuge meal at 2am. My mother only eats two slices of toast a day and then raids the fridge at night. 
None of my friends have breakfast, or lunch for that matter - they go out for dinner in the evenings. So all day without food. 

At work, it's also weird. 5am is too early for me to have breakfast, so I used to take breakfast to work with me, but everybody complained at me ""snacking"" at 9 or 10 so I stopped and just held out till lunch with a grumbling belly. But lunch at our company is literally 1 sandwich OR a small salad. That's ... a third of what I'd like to have for lunch to be satisfied. 
But everybody besides me, so around 150 people, had no issues with this. I'm the only one who finds this to be not an acceptable portion size. 

Long story short - whats the average amount of food people consume these days? I feel like a total outsider, trying to get in 3 satisfactory meals a day! 

People often tell me 3 meals a day is wayyyy too much and its no wonder I don't lose weight etc. However that is pretty bs because my meals are healthy and I'm fat because I eat all the chocolate, lol.",20Feb2020,1

  I'm a 24 year old man and I live in East Texas. I grew up in California and my family moved here mid way through high school. In the years following I personally chose to go back to California and then return to Texas two more times, before staying in Texas by choice around 20 years old. I was dating a girl who I planned on marrying, and worked 3 part time jobs so that she could go to cosmetology school. When she got out she decided she could do better than me and we split. The generalized depression I've struggled with for years got worse and I began going out more and ""experiencing life"" in ways I hadn't before.

740,"Growing up, race wasn't talked about or an issue around. I had friends of every race and didn't really think much about it. As I grew older, I learned about systematic injustices and absoltuely agreed they needed to be.  

Then, one summer in college, I worked at a restuarant (in a fairly white but diverse part of town) where a large percentage of our clientele were African American. While I did have a few ""karens"" or stuck-up white people, and really had shitty people of all races, the majority of my experience with African American customers was negative. They constantly tipped less (or not at all), ruder, dirty looks, insulted me, given the middle finger, got called a bitch for not letting a table leave without paying, seeing a coworker brought to tears because how a large party was treating her, etc. I left because I genuinely felt abused by a good percentage of the customers. I've always been a big believer that you can true character of a person based on how they treat those they perceive as less than them. In my experience in the restaurant industry, African American failed that test miserably. It really shifted my perspective in a negative light and I'm still working on overcoming it.  

After college, I got a job in my field and became a teacher. For a while, I the prejudices seemed tk By far, the majority demographic I struggle the most with classroom management and write referrals for are African American students. Plus, after I transitioned at school, I lost the complete respect of several black students, several started stopping by my classroom merely to gawk and/or laugh. They're the only ones who I've ever had to redirect using ""gay"" as derogatory. Literally no white, Asian, Middle Eastern, or Indian students cared; in fact a few said supportive things in private. I'm just like ""no wonder transwomen of color are more likely to be murdered."" I can't stand how loud they are, when they walk down the halls blasting rap music for everyone to hear, dress like thugs, and in fact the whole rap/hood/ghetto culture just rubs me the wrong way. It really does comes across as glorifying violence. Sometimes I'm like ""How did we get from the Harlem Renaissance, jazz, blues, soul, and The Cosby Show to gangster rap and calling the characters on Blackish 'white washed'?"" While us white people look back with disgust with shame about what our ancestors have done, sometimes I wonder if black people of the past are seeing their children and grandchildren and going ""What are you doing?"" 

So yeah... that's my story. I don't want to have these prejudices, and feel like I'm contributing to the problem because of it. I don't know what to do about it. I've opened up in some circles about this and they're either like ""that's racism, we're not going to talk about that"" or simply say ""Stop being racist"" as if it's a switch I can turn off.",20Feb2020,1
742,"male, 22 years old

Hey guys, I have a problem/ question to you:

Since October I am studying in a new city (university).

I made friendship with a guy here, he's really nice, and everything, a bit fun and stuff. And he's living in my house, 2 floor above of me, so sometimes we hang out, drinking tea and stuff from 9pm till 10pm, when the day is finished and next day everyone is busy with studying working, and stuff, you know.

So its a good to have a friend (I couldn't find many people who I could bond with here) but the thing is:

1. he's only talking about women. Women here, I just got a number here, I want to go out with her ... all the time . Like everyone likes to talk about women and girls for a while, but every fcking time, man common, thats not everything in life.
2. Because of his sooo many women stories (she is coming over later, I got the IG, I want to this and that...) I feel envious. I really don't want it, because a friend should not be like this (like me in that situation) but I can't help. Of course I want also women, I mean, hey, I am also a man! And I can't help but feeling like ""OMG What does he have, me not...""
3. When we are out together, he is (of course) checking out every woman, so when a group of lets say 5 beautiful women are there, he tries with everyone of them, and whoever left, I can talk to. Thats the feeling I get with him hahah. My point of going out is, having fun and a good time, but for him this is connected 100% with getting laid, or at least numbers, IGs and so on. And you know the impact friends have on someone. If you spend time with anyone, there is NO WAY, you don't get influenced by him at least a bit (in my opinion :) ) --&gt; So I also think about, I need a woman and stuff, but before I came here in October I said to myself, I just wanna be productive and good in my studies, and just enjoy my time. If that means partying, or just playing ps4 with friends, or having a gf or not, it doesn't matter, I just let it flow.
4. But with him everything is like ""having a plan"". having a plan, how we get the girls group to like us etc etc...

hahah I tried to explain that all a bit to him, but he is just the way he is. And thats good so, everyone is different, he can be what he wants, and I can be.

My question: Should I cut ties with him? I only think, then I am alone again and who knows, if I find a friend with whom I can go out like that again... Because he also likes, just as me, going out, for example to new bars or new clubs (its not that I drink that or anything, just like to meet new people..)  
And in my experience not many people are like that anymore..

I tried finding jobs and it’s been a month or two and still didn’t manage to get any. I can’t travel much as my card is left with $6 and I have to pay adult fee which is $4 every time I take the train so this sucks. Basically I’m stuck at home, lonely with only a younger sis to talk to. My parents look at me as a freeloader because to them, I’m staying at home doing nothing and still get to eat, sleep and stuff so they’re really fed up with me. My dad is also disappointed of me for some reasons and decided to not talk to me. They do not give me money or whatsoever so my only hope right now is to get a job that maybe pays me right after as its almost impossible for my $8 and card money to last for a whole month before I get my pay. I just don’t know what tf to do now. Got too much going on mentally man and I don’t have anyone else to share this with so I decided to share with y’all redditors. All I can do now is stay home or go out do my hobby and nothing else. Anxiety is also taking over me now so, this is shit lol. I really need advice from you guys please help me out. Tried my best to get a job but seems like it’s not gonna happen anytime soon. Maybe an advice on how to make money or something? Any advice or tips on this shitty life would be great :))

750,"Hello all, I'm back again with a question about a friend of mine, ""Eni."" 

To make it short, I've always felt uncomfortable with Eni's behavior (gossiping, emotional unloading without a heads up and guilt tripping) and had ghosted them in the past. They recently got back in contact with me about working with me again and I had denied their offer. They replied with an ""Oh, sure then."". A seemingly calm reply to their history of explosiveness after rejection.  

So now they're suddenly ""more active"" in our discord and now that they don't have anyone to listen to in private messages, they're going about what they've done before, gossiping about people who's ""done them wrong"", trying to seek attention by dropping triggering or inappropriate contents (They had started to talk about suicide and dropping NSFW images in the chat)

I just woke up but I'm not having this. I'm tired of their behavior but I want to be the bigger person and deal with them civilly and tell them (civilly) to cut it out with their bs and sob stories. We can't kick Eni from the discord atm since our Mods and Admin are more active on the weekends. 

So for the next few days, do you guys have any tips on how to civilly get them to stop or reduce doing whatever bs they're doing?",20Feb2020,1

752,"I was out drinking with my friends last weekend. They invited me and as requested, I paid the one with the car (CG for Car-Girl from now on) 10€ to drive me there and back home. I was also told that i would be included when they would go for a ride around town.

I was pretty drunk and a guy I liked asked me if someone could go get him and drive him to where we were, so I pleaded with CG and promised her 20€ once I get paid (March 2nd.)  BUT she also refused.Another friend asked if we could go to the guys house and CG said sure, so we went.I had way too much to drink and was feeling really sick and tired so I asked if CG could take me home, before I started throwing up which she declined. CG, the other friend and the guy went to another room, leaving me alone with a passed-out girl.In the end I threw up several times and had to beg CG to take me home for an hour before she drove me home, once again due to the other girl asking, but not before laughing at me with the guy for throwing up and the bathroom smelling like vomit. I was so embarrassed and almost cried.

After CG had dropped me off I took a shower and went to bed and she texted me while I was sleeping, asking for that 20.I told her that I promised to pay on a certain day but she kept begging and said that I never talked about a date and that she needed the money now. I texted her multiple times about the set date but she somehow failed to save those texts and claimed that I never texted her about a date.

The other friend is saying that I don't have to pay her but I know what I promised. I still don't feel like I should pay after she failed to drive me home when I asked so I'm torn between paying her 10 since I gave her that other 10 earlier, 20 just to get her off my back or nothing because she refused my offer earlier.

756,"I consider myself to be a traditional monogamous person. I was overcome with physical attraction to this married woman who is in an open marriage late last year. At first it was supposed to be a fling but has since evolved into us seeing each other 2-3 times a week and speaking on a daily basis. We talk about how our days are going, what’s going on with her children, etc. as if we’re boyfriend girlfriend.

She is married with 3 children and also sees a girl once or twice a year. 

I am fully cognizant that she is not leaving her husband. I don’t expect that to ever happen nor would I ever ask that of a woman with children. 

We had an honest conversation yesterday about our situation. She asked how I was doing in all this and that if her situation were different she’d love a bigger relationship with me. Not that this really matters, this is just nice to hear.

Before you ask, yes I am making efforts to see other girls. I went out with one two weeks ago but it went nowhere. We had nothing in common.

One part of me says move on because this is a waste of time. Sure the sex is great, sure we enjoy each others company. But where is this all going?

The other part of me says continue to see her while I look for something more permanent since I don’t have other girls I’m interested in. Seeing someone openly and being able to see other people myself doesn’t sound so bad. But I have jealous tendencies and am unsure how good this all is for my psyche long term.

I’m asking for you all to hear me out about what I need to do here. I know it’s easy to say “move on” or “find someone new” but I don’t have a lot going on in my relationship life right now.

758,"this is a part two of the previous post i posted here, i’m sorry i haven’t linked it because i’m on mobile but i will later when i have access to my computer. the gist was that basically i live alone and pay for my own things but my mother still wants to claim me as a dependant on her tax returns, which requires her to know my yearly income to deduct it from hers. i lied to her when i sustained an injury that caused me to not be able to work anymore and told her i was still working because she’s very controlling, unreasonable, emotional, and some would say abusive in some ways. i was too scared to tell her what happened because i knew she would punish me. now i regret the lie because i’m so scared of it coming out and i don’t want to hurt her feelings that i lied

basically the update is that i told her she shouldn’t claim me as a dependant and that since i wasn’t one i would claim myself as independent. she told me essentially fuck you and that she was going to be claiming me as a dependant until i turn 24 (legal age that you can no longer claim someone as a dependant unless they have a severe disability here) and there was nothing i could do about it. i feel very scared and trapped. even when i said i’d do my own taxes she still somehow needs my income and won’t leave me alone about it and i feel backed into a corner. i could just put all that information in a sealed envelope for her accountant and maybe she’d never even see the details but i don’t know. i just kept telling her i wanted to file myself as independent and she kept telling me she wouldn’t let me if i did my own tax papers or not. i just want to be free from her and be able to live my life and this is hurting me. i’m not sure what to do. everyone in the comments said i needed to talk to her about everything and have the big unpleasant talk, which is fair, but i don’t even know what to say to her without making her hate me and never forgive me. i feel like a horrible person for lying and i’m starting to wish i was dead because of her constant control. what’s the best way to go about this? is it to talk to her about it? if so, how can i do that without her hating me and never forgiving me? i forgot to get her a mother’s day card once when i was 10 and she still reminds me of it and gives me shit about it to this day. i know she’ll never let this go and i don’t want to no longer have a mother who loves me",20Feb2020,1

There is a little bit of truth in the last part though but that’s not because she’s making friends it’s the fact she’s distancing herself from me to make friends but it’s not like I don’t let her. 

I mean this is or was one of my bestest friends and I thought highly of her and it hurts to know that’s what she views me as. I’ve always been there for her even the bad parts and where I give her advice on things.

I have a bubbly personality and I always try to be super positive and you could say the most extrovert in our friend group but how does that mean I only care about partying? I’ve never even been to a party. 

Now she views me as this shallow person. Is there actually something wrong with me because of the fact I encourage people to go out and have fun? I wonder if that’s how all my friends view me? It always looks like I’m happy or a spoilt brat but it’s so not true. I’m just an only child. Now she wants a break and I cannot stop hating myself or sobbing.

773,"My boyfriend's family cannot take care of their dog for the time being and she will be staying with me and my boyfriend for about a year or maybe longer if her owners don't take her back. She is a 13 year old Chihuahua Daschund mixed breed and about 20 lbs. She has stayed with me for about 6 months so far.

Because of lack of training, the dog has poor socialization and has a bite history. It will attack or try to attack other people and dogs and has bitten me a few times unprovoked. 
It is also not spayed. She is also super possessive over human  food and toys and will growl and attack if they are being taken away.

Since she will be staying with me, what steps should I take to train her and decrease her aggression? I will be saving money to take her to a professional dog trainer but I need advice on how to train her while I save up money. 


Steps I am thinking of taking:

Walking her with a muzzle. My bf and  I usually walk her for about 10-15 minutes each day, twice a days. Is that enough? Should I be taking her on long walks?

We are both at work all day; how do I keep her mentally stimulated while we're gone?

Would it be possible to crate train her at this age? 

She will also no longer be able to jump or sleep on our bed. 

I want to train her not to lunge after strangers or dogs and to not bite people unprovoked. She has tried to bite a neighbor and she has bitten me because I picked up a sock next to her. Possession is a huge issue with her. I don't want her to get hurt or potentially hurt someone because of her aggression so I am desperate for any advice.

2) Becoming an assistant teacher in Spain for 1 year. This pays next to nothing with $1000 USD a month to cover living expenses.

776,"So in the past few months, my family is increasingly moving apart. It's been slowly simmering for some time and now we're all moving apart. At first I was sort of in the train of thought that if we needed the space then it was overly going to be beneficial; but I've started to see trends. For instance, my dad and aunt had a falling out and haven't spoken in over a decade. I'd like to think this won't happen but I'm feeling like it may.

So my family is divorced in 1994 (I was 6). My dad re-married in 1998 when I was 10 years old. My mom dated a guy who was abusive but left him when I was 18. I moved out on my own when I was 20. I have a younger brother who is 3 years younger. He's always been one to copy what I do, and it's not usually bad. I would wear a certain style, so would he. I'd buy a console, he'd buy the same. Stuff like that. Well after I moved out he did the same when he was 18 (I was 21). He went through a revolving door of bad roommate situations. Mixed with the abuse we faced when he was younger and that created some resentment in him towards others. Eventually around 7 years ago he stopped coming to Christmas and other events. He doesn't really respond to texts, phone calls, or facebook messages. Last time I needed to talk to him I went to his work since that was the only place I knew I could reliably find him.

My mom since has re-married and the man she married is a bit off. He's never one to take initiative to meet up or chat. He suffers from depression and anxiety attacks but fails to get any treatment for it. My mom's also a compulsive liar, and it's always been this way but then this past christmas was my breaking point. My mom called me to tell me that my step-dad had ran off. My brother didn't show up. So I came in and got everything ready for Christmas. Then afterwards my step-dad sent people rather rude texts, and kicked my mom out of the house they own. My mom in the days later said to various family members that she was choked by my step dad and he gave her a black eye. Which I have my doubts, because she would know to leave or call the cops. So I brought it up with her and she said that it was being exaggerated and that he had his hands around her throat but wasn't choking her. Which to me makes no sense. So I pressed her and eventually she admitted to lying about it.

This frustrated me. Ruined my holidays really. So I've taken a couple months to think about it and I'm still not sure what to do. My nana/papa on my moms side have decided to not attend any more family events with the two of them. My aunts and uncles are also unsure of how to handle this  I could keep ignoring my mom and step dad but they really are the only immediate family that will attempt to reach out. My dad never really does, and if I text or call he won't reply (probably where my brother gets it from).

Maybe I'm overthinking this and should just let these things lay as they may but I guess I should try to keep the family together; but I have no idea how to handle it in a way that is healthy and maintaining my goals of keeping everything honest and healthy. Really could use some help.

TL;DR: My mom, dad, brother, step-mom, and step-dad are all at a distance, and I feel as if something's not done, it may stay distant forever. I need some advice on how to handle this in a way that's healthy and respectful.",20Feb2020,1

781,"I’m 19 and my 17 yo sister is living w/ me since 6 months and it’s a nightmare.

The problem is, she is emotional, she cries and throws tantrums and calls my mum at every minor inconvenience. 
In the other side I’ve been depressed since a long time and I feel like it made me stop crying and expressing anything at all : even when I feel very very bad I just tell myself it’s normal and I don’t cry bc if I cried everytime I felt bad I would be bawling nonstop.
The thing is, people (mostly my mom) tend to take the side of the person whose showing signs (crying,whining, whatever you want) of sadness, bc strangely they must think there sadness is more valid or genuine, and since I’m not crying I must be the one in the wrong.

She is taking the same course at uni as I do and she already proceeded to take all the friends I made last year with her. I wanted to help her integrate not take my group of friend and explode it. (Bc she also managed that every friend that saw through her act and wanted to stick with me would be pushed away from the group and also resent me)

Talking is impossible to resolve something, she always shuts the door and don’t wanna hear anything everytime her comebacks run out. Otherwise she starts crying and calls my mom to immediately incriminate me. 

As an example, the thing that made me write this post is what happened this afternoon:
My bf wanted to surprise me and came with snacks for both of us. He told my sister she could eat with us if she wanted to. So she came and I asked her if she could help me and clean the table while I prepared the snacks, and she immediately answered by “why should I clean it I always do it anyway, you never do anything”. 
Mind you, I have been doing ALL house chores since 6 months in order to “relieve” some stress for her first year of uni. I felt humiliated in front of my boyfriend so I answered that actually, I was doing my FAIR share of work and she was the one who was kind of never doing her part. She then started making a big fuss and shouting at me that she was doing all the work (yay she started the dishwasher 1 time this week what an achievement) and ran to her room. 
And honestly that was IT for me, it had already been more nightmarish than before these past two weeks and now she wanted to throw a fit in front of my bf ?
I went to her room, opened the door and stayed standing right there. She told me multiple times to get out of her room and i said no, this time I want to talk and not have a door being closed to my face.

It was getting so out of hand I decided to get out so I wasn’t more embarrassed in front of my boyfriend and she would stop her tantrum.
I begged him to go sleep at his place but he refused bc he said it would hurt the situation even more (he’s probably right) with both my sister and my mom.

786,"TLDR: my teacher excluded me from a classroom wide plan and I'm quite sullen because of it. 

So I'm a naturally long winded person and I'm aware this isn't a huge deal. The easy fix would be to simply have better study habits but here we go anyway.

I have a year-long course at the moment. I am in my second semester as an upperclassmen. Last semester, I failed to complete a number of specific online assignments. They were due every week and typically not exhausting to do... 

The website itself? Fine. Tedious, but fine. For this reason as well as myself being a procrastinating dumbass, I opted out and my grade suffered because of it.

As a bit of background, this teacher is... Interesting. They ""jokingly"" threaten students every other day. They openly and loudly talk with their favorites about how they would love to knock students out. They beratted a student for coming back to class late, said student admitted that she had a mental breakdown. Teacher continued to ridicule her, saying she needs to see a counselor and nealry reducing the student to tears. Quite the sight. Also quite infamous for leaving the old ""69.89""s. A yeller. Satan essentially.

This is a personal qualm. They somehow, against every odd, speant the entire semester so far as well as much of the semester last year discussing racism and colorism in a class with nothing to nessesarily do with it. At my school it is the norm to write the standard on the board. She is apparently expempt. I may seem like an asshole, but I'm a poc myself. And as a bit of a literature buff, I would like some other shit too. I'm aware that it is black history month. Her point of view is the sort of ""race is a social construct"" stance. A direct quote. 

Now back to my case. Teacher announced this semester that those who consistently preform well on the aforementioned website will be excluded. I decided to step up. 
On a whim, the teacher has excluded me from this. I checked the code of conduct (no, really) and it stated that for a level one offense- the only one of which I fall into being 'refusal to follow instructions'- and the punishments that may apply include ' loss of privilege' and 'enforcement of positve behavior'. (I had no idea my education was a priveledge). I'm wondering if I would take this up with her directly or if there's any grounds for me to report her on.

As I'm writing this there's a heated classroom v teacher yelling match.

Regardless, from this post you can probably conclude that I'm a lazy idiot who tried to get by on the system and failed.",20Feb2020,1

793,"English as a 3rd language, sorry. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I work in a internacional company and we have different ""teams"" in different countries. We also have parties with some divisions from the same country quite often.

Last year I was put in the same team as a guy who is really attractive and basically had at least one date with every good looking woman on this company. 

We became friends quickly as we have the same kind of jokes and hobbies (and some crushes). One day we were just hanging out and we kissed. Later he invited me to his home and after that we started to be friends with benefits. 

I don't know how people from work discovered that since we didn't have any ""couple"" behaviour outside his or my house. Well, after six months, we decided to stop, since none of us wanted a relationship and the new manager said that he would go to London and I was going to the peruvian team, where I started on the company, but not my homeland.

Everything was fine, until yesterday. I was in the bathroom when the new manager got in talking with someone. What she said:

— Do you believe ""hot fun guy"" was going out with the tomboy from eng? I couldn't believe when I heard that. [...] Last Friday he didn't want nothing with me. [...] Yes, ridiculous! I can't stand to see him with that shit crippled girl. [...] No, he is going to stay there just for few weeks, for trainings. She is really in another team now. [...]

I just freezed and listened. I got angry and sad, couldn't do nothing but listen and hold tears.

I know they already had something in a party before she moved to our division.

I am short, with short hair and wear gaming T-shirts and converse shoes. If I hadn't boobs, I could easily pass as a teenage boy cause I'm not so good girly looking. And yes, I have some disabilities and can't walk very well. 

I love Lima, but it's good to be home again and I would like to stay more than one year here (I landed here on Feb 26 last year). What's bothering me is that she could have put me away just for the sake of her sexual life and I am REALLY angry with being called ""shit crippled girl"". 

I thought about going to HR, but I didn't record her talking and have no proof of what I have heard. I don't know if I should go and talk to her or warn my friend about her sick crush on him. Reddit, what should I do?


Long story short: I was friend with benefits with a guy and the team manager apparently managed to get us a ocean apart and said shit about me but I have no proof and I'm upset with this situation. 

P.S.: I don't know if crippled is the best word, but she called me of a rude and insensitive way to call someone who has disabilities.",20Feb2020,1

795,"I have always had a rough relationship with my parents, therefore I had decided when I was younger, I knew it would be best for me to leave as far away as possible from my parents. I mentioned the idea of moving to Florida for college to my mom and she was actually really all for it as long as we had the means and money to do so. The years have gone by and the topic was brought up again in Freshman year, and again, I had my mom’s faith but my dad avoided the college talk as much as he could. I completed high school with lots of community service, work, involvement, and awards. I had a strong resume for colleges, applied to four (including my dream school in Florida) and got accepted to all of them. However, I didn’t know my mom had a vision for me and forced me to apply to one of the schools that I didn’t like. I gave it a chance. I attended some events but I still felt like it wasn’t for me and my heart was set on my dream school. Slowly, it became an everyday argument of whether or not I would go to college in my state or in Florida. Money is not an issue and our family is not close, but my mom likes to guilt trip and manipulate me into thinking that I will “ruin my life and the family” if I make that decision to leave. It’s becoming so toxic to the point where it’s affecting my physical health. I can’t handle these everyday arguments because now it’s driving me and my parents apart. My mom has become emotionally and verbally abusive and tends to harass me over email or text about every little thing, with the college decision being the top priority. To make things more confusing, I had started talking to an old friend again and we figured we had romantic interests. He has been close to my family since we were in 7th grade but we did not talk for many years due to some issues he was going through. To sum that up, we decided we didn’t want to be a part from each other and we wanted to live in the same area. He gave up everything for me, including his college decision so he’s taking a year off. My mom gave him the green light to do so but that was when I was going by what my parents wanted. I mentioned Florida and started making those plans but they absolutely hate the idea and I can’t do anything about it. They’re dragging him into the situation and have gone as far as to threaten to leave me in debt or homeless if I involve him in my life. I don’t know what to do or what options I should take.

My core group of friends however, who I could rely on to hang out any given weekend for the past ten years , are pretty much no more - one guy is suffering from a mental breakdown and has turned into a neo Nazi- I called him out once on it and made fun of the Nazi group that he’s joined (I’m mixed-race so what does he expect) and he won’t speak to me anymore and my spineless other mate has taken his side even though he himself is Colombian. The third person in this group tried to sleep with my ex girlfriend and caused a bunch of drama between me and her resulting in me losing my shit and verbally attacking him to the point that he will no longer speak to me ever again.

799,"So recently I've fallen back into gaming more, since I have found I have a bit more spare time when my girlfriend isn't around. I don't necissarilly prioritize it, and I'll do all daily errands and tasks before I sit down and play games for about an 1-3 hours in a day, probably about 4-5 times a week, maybe more if there's extra alone time. 

This issue comes when my girlfriend comes home. I usually get off as soon as she comes home so we can spend time together, talk, and do things. but sometimes I'm RIGHT in the middle of a game and want to finish it up. During this time she *demands* my attention and says I play to much, but when I finish my game and start fully conciously asking about her day without any other distractions, she tells me she no longer wants to talk about it and her high energy has passed. She does this everytime I have a game overlap when she comes home.  In these times she then will want to smoke some weed and decompress, ultimately just sitting on the couch and watching TV together until she passes out, and we go to bed. Well last night she fell asleep, and I didn't work the next day so I said screw it I'll over indulge a bit and play more. At some point she woke up randomly and started getting so mad at me for playing my game when she was asleep, stating I have a serious problem and I'd rather play games than to go out and spend time with her. I can't even find words to justify myself, other than I only play when responsibilities are done and she isn't home, or if she is asleep. And that demanding my attention mid-hobby is unfair. No matter how I schedule my hour or two, I always catch flak. I keep telling her how rude it'd be if I demanded her attention while she was playing music, and then getting mad at her if she was doing it (quitely) while I was asleep. She just thinks I'm becoming a loser with a gaming problem. 

Am I in the wrong here? I enjoy being immersed in a fake world for a little bit, and I don't feel it's anywhere close to a problem, 1-3 hours a day spaced through the week seems like nothing compared to my past or what others play for. How can I help allieviate this aggression towards my hobby?

800,"Today is the day i decided that i've had enough.

I will try to summarize the story as much as possible. To anyone taking time out of their day to read this, thank you.

I have a brother, 27 years old. He's 10 years older than me and is a very self-centered person.
He has made my life a nightmare. If me, my mother or father tried to argue with him when he was doing something wrong, he would always go for violence. He beat me for as long as i can remember, since i'm 10 years younger than him he never had a problem overpowering me.
He finished college several years ago, never had a job and doesn't go out looking for one either. Ever since he turned 18 he has been more behaved, due to fear of my father kicking him out, but still is an extremely toxic person, who always puts himself about others.
Currently, he just watches anime, plays video games and does some housework.

He always keeps saying that he is a ""special case"" and that people should just accept that his situation is ""not like anybody else's"".

Several people have tried to help him to change. My mother, my stepmother, my father, his friends from school and from college but he always spits on everyone's hand and keeps making excuses for why he can't or doesn't want to follow their suggestions. Unsurprisingly, he currently has no friends or SO. Everyone eventually got fed up of his ""i'm superior"" crap and went their separate ways. It's always about him, him and him.

Even when noone is interacting with him, he still manages to make everyone uncomfortable. For example, as i mentioned before, he plays video games, and as is to be expected from a computer, sometimes there are problems, errors, etc 
Whenever something isn't working on a computer, he start to become extremely toxic. He starts clicking the mouse faster and faster, and giving one final strong click.
Starts pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del furiously and starts to yell things like ""why can't things just work?!"", ""the engineers that made this are a bunch of incompetents"", lets out loud groans, bangs the table and generally making a huge fuss. He does this every time, for years, almost daily. Me and my friends that have met him and witnessed some of these scenes came fo the conclusion that he probably does it for attention. We started to see more and more that the things he does is for attention.

Things are getting unbearable again. He walks into my room and does as he pleases. Kicks open the door, slams the windows open, turns the fan that was pointed to me for himself.
All of these things are making me lose my mind. I'm 17 and am currently studying to pass an entrance test for college. I'm trying to get into the best university of the country, hundreds of kilometers away from here, but even if i get in, it will only be next year. All of these things that he is doing is seriously impacting my studies negatively.

The only solution i have in mind is to speak to my father and to basically put my brother in line using fear, just like that book, ""Leviathan"".

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",20Feb2020,1

I (20m) recently started dating a new guys (25m) and have been seeing him for about a month and liking him a lot. But I just had a sexual health test and found out I have chlamydia from a previous one night stand. 
I’m on medication and will be cured from chlamydia in week.

However I’m wondering do I have to tell my new partner that I have chlamydia? We have gotten a bit intimate, but the most we have done is a bit of oral - and it is very unlikely to contract chlamydia through oral sex. Also he mentioned he’ll be getting an STD test anyway. So do I have to tell him that I have chlamydia? 

It’s just so embarrassing to me and I don’t know how he would react. I’m scared he’ll be grossed out and not want to see me again. Then again he is 25 so I’d hope that he wouldn’t react in that way, but I don’t want such a small thing, where I most likely didn’t pass it on to him anyway, to affect our relationship.",20Feb2020,0

805,"Hello. I'm basically a mess, or that is what I feel like as of now. I have a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering, a degree that was supposed to be completed in 4 years but I took 6, in that period I absorbed very little knowledge about my field. I'm good with computers, I can code, fluent with c++ and learning python (I learnt coding after 4 years of engineering as I  couldn't handle the technical information, if you're wondering why I took mechanical engineering in the first place). I also worked for a year after my 4 years of engineering at home sales. After I cleared by bachelors I felt like I should get education from a better country and a good college, so I started shortlisting countries and various universities for the course of project management. I came across countries such as Australia, Singapore and New Zealand which were good for my course and also the country provided the lifestyle I could adapt to (totally an introvert and hates going to clubs). After reaching out to colleges it turns out that the fact that I took 6 years to clear and the pile of backlogs made it more difficult to move forward. The time I took for granted came and bit me in the butt at the worst possible time. After the rejection I have been feeling completely down and demoralised. Working out is the only way I can get some frustration out thinking of what a LOSER I turned out to be. I'm not able to think straight for a couple of days and I'm worried this might get worse.

He would play around, hop and run. Then after a few months he started to vomit. 2 times a week or so. We took him to a vet and he said he didn't know. Then another one and another. All couldn't find the problem. One of them suggested a big hospital for animals and with no another choice we took him there. In there we learnt that his stomach walls were thicker than normal cats which made his digestion much harder. As an attempt to digest his body started producing more acid. Then led to vomitting. Doctor said that there were no way of curing this. And gave us an acid regulator pill. We started to give him that. He was no longer vomitting if we didn't forget to give the pill. But his condition worsened. His body got accustomed to the pill so we had no choice but step up the dosage. This started a cycle. And at this time. At the third year it is at a point that a normal adult would take that amount. 40mg twice a day. And if we ever forget or change the food they have he starts vomitting everything. He is sick of this too. So much that all he does now is sleeping eating and watching some walls or his siblings. We have dozens of toys and pet him, love him but he just runs away thinking we would give him the pill. So any idea on how can we make his situation better?",20Feb2020,2

Then she wonders why they're crazy and dumps them back on me! I also understand as a nanny I do light housekeeping but grandma will let the boys DESTROY the house and expects me to clean it all up bc that's my 'job' and tries to get me to do things for her that the mom would never ask of me. ex text me she's taking the boys to swim 30 minutes before class and demands i have them dressed and ready to go for her, wash the guest room sheets and clothes and iron them after grandma stays over.

814,"This is coming from a recent post i saw on r/love, saying ' Confess your feelings because life is unexpected ' or something along those lines. That just got me wondering.

Well basically I've liked this girl for almost three years now. Usually when i liked someone ( two other occasions) they've liked me back, and without sounding overtly narcissistic that's been the case with most girls// ofc except her.

She's definitely been someone i liked the most and for the most time, i tried forgetting her (for reasons I'll explain ), and for a bit i did and managed to date someone else, but i quickly realized i liked the person i was dating nowhere near the same amount and quickly broke it off. 

Well basically she comes from a very conservative and religious family, so her family knowing anything is a no go. Her cousin ( the family is very close) and me are really good friends. I've spoken and had conversations with her for so long it's seems unnecessary to lose it. On top of all this is i know for a fact she doesn't like me, and i can almost say with certainty she's never liked anyone, and she's one of those people that just seems so disinterested in dating and liking people, which frankly makes it hard to imagine dating her. Im certain i like her tho.

My question really is that seeing a that is it a good idea to tell her or just try to move on?

819,"Yesterday, my boyfriend was at work (retail job) and a certain manager came over to him and observed. He works at a tech store and this particular manager is in charge of pushing sales and upgrades onto customers. He continually pushes workers to try to get customers into some kind of deal or upgrade. I’m sure his manager bonuses benefit (workers don’t). Anyway.

The customer present was not interested and had already been asked. When they left, the manager said to my bf “what happened there?”. My bf said he had already asked about upgrades / specials and the customer wasn’t interested. The manager then said “you need to try harder, you’re not taking this seriously, maybe you need to rethink your position here, maybe you’re not a right fit here, if this continues, I’ll have to write you up and terminate your employment” then remarked as to how angry he was and has to step away. My bf just responded with “ok”, surprised at how this manager behaved.
The manager then went directly over to another manager and talked about my bf.

I told him to file an HR complaint. I am furious myself, but as I don’t work at that company, there’s probably nothing I can do. He filed one online (big international company that seems to not care about the retail workers from what I see).

Some of his coworkers are very nice, but timid people that I’ve met, and genuinely would not be able to handle that kind of confrontation. I should also add that my bf is always early and always stays late. He works very hard at his job and has a good reputation overall. This particular manager has been there for yearrrrrrrrrs so it’s likely that the other managers know he is a jerk and nothing has been done.

Any advice?",20Feb2020,2
820,"Normally, losers choose to be losers (they don’t do anything, play video games all day, smoke weed, etc). Sure some losers are that way because of reasons outside of their control, but most choose it.

I came from a middle class home with seemingly no particular disadvantage. So I’m fortunate in that regard. But I don’t understand why I turned out such a loser. I’m a 23 year old guy. I live with my parents. I’ve never had a job or a girlfriend, no money, no friends. 

I don’t understand. I wake up at 5:30 am to go to college. I work hard in my classes and get mostly A’s. Currently I’m a junior and have a 3.9 cumulative GPA. I’ve remodeled my parents’ kitchen and bathroom as well as painted rooms throughout their house. I clean my parents’ bathroom and mow the yard. I always try to respect people and keep my word. I’m never late.

So what gives? I try really really dang hard! Why do I get nowhere? Most of my high school classmates are married and buying houses and having kids. And they never worked as hard as me. Why can’t I find a job or a friend. Or find a girl that likes me? What’s wrong with me?",20Feb2020,1
821,"my gf [18f] and i [18m] are in a bit of a dilemma as of now. we are new to the whole dating scene and are planning on going to prom together. however, we attend different high schools a ~2 hour drive apart. we both have traditional parents that we would like to avoid telling or hinting that we are in a relationship with each other. as of right now, both of our parents and families do not know we are in a relationship. we are only going to attend the prom at ONE of our high schools and would like some advice regarding which one to go to and how to handle parental interactions! i will lay out pros and cons to both locations and more background info:

going to her prom:

pros:

her mom likes me a lot
her friend group is more fun
the venue is downtown
she has an orchestra performance that day so i can watch her play on the same day
cons:

her dad is questionable about me and her
food sucks there
i have to drive there in a suit
going to my prom:

pros:

she will already be in my town for a competition
both of my parents will arguably handle it better if they were to find out
food is better
more activities to do before and after the dance
cons:

people suck here
venue is much more boring
a dress is harder to transport long distance
no mode of transportation for her back home
​

the parent situation: although we both are comfortable with each other, we would like to wait a little longer before our families know of us, just to avoid conflict by slowly introducing and integrating ourselves into each others' lives and families. however, going as a prom date could be a dead giveaway and could cause specific problems with her dad. posing as a ""friend"" is an option, but somewhat questionable, though.

824,"Welp, that's it.
My Uber and Lyft alternate Lime has officially stopped being my alternate ride home.
Before you start congratulating me and asking what I drive now, no, that didn't happen at all.


They put my area in a red zone.
Meaning that if I got even within 2 miles of my residence the scooter's motor would get killed and my last mile solution home would have come and gone.


RIP saving hundreds of bucks January 2018-February 17, 2020.
RIP beautiful canyon trips.
Off roading experiences.
Errands from home and back I could do.
For free, completely for free.


You see, unlike a normal Lime participant I enlisted to become a charger.
After an initial signup, you buy from Lime four chargers for $40 at $10 each with the intention to charge nearly dead scooters out in public, ride them home to your house, charge them, and return them to a designated hub for a few bucks direct deposited to your account.


But see, just a few bucks wasn't worth it to me. What WAS worth it to me was not having to shell out $7 for an Uber or Lyft just to take me to the nearest bus stop from my parent's house in the Tarzana mountains. 


So what are my alternates? In Tarzana, and anywhere within West San Fernando valley, no scooters remain. The closest is in Van nuys in East San Fernando valley and those Birds cost 39 cents a minute versus the free for the first half hour and 7 cents a minute arrangement I had with Lime. Wheels, Jump bikes, and Bolts can only be found in the densest areas of Hollywood, Santa Monica or Downtown LA now. And all of those are very premium.


So back to being a hermit until I can find another electric powered solution to get around? 


Great. Just what I need when I'm trying to figure out what I value in life. I need to explore different avenues, meet people, head to the library, go to events, socials, music festivals, theaters, restaurants. I can't do that without a job, and with no easy way of getting around, how am I to work?


I have to find a way to make money from home and then use those funds to purchase rent elsewhere so I can live a normal life. All I want is to live on flat land away from my parent's hill. I personally hate cars. So why must I be forced to either use one or kill my back to get home? If I can find a way to make enough money to afford an apartment on flat land then I would feel hundreds of times better about my situation than I currently do. 


So since I've honed in on music as my motivator and money earner than I just need to talk to enough people and collaborate and work on things and just be open to ideas and be vulnerable and continue to pursue and write and flourish in that sense because that's all I can do.


I can't stand standing at a register Bay.
But I need to work at a lifestyle away from being that security guard. I really have to push my musical interests past a level that I wasn't eager enough to go down until I decided to try this awakening today. But now that I've had it I see that music, repairing the relationship with my mom, and finding a place of my own are the 3 key components of my pursuits. So I'm sure with success even moderately, all 3 will simultaneously be achieved and I'll be on another world of elation.


For now, I'm back to having my mom pick me up at the bottom of our hill and back to the struggle of having to rely on her, or walk 4 miles home uphill on a bad back.


Wish me luck.",20Feb2020,1
825,"I apologize in advance for the long story! 
I don’t want my family in my life, I think. I am mostly not sure how to go about what I think I want? 
My siblings and I have never gotten along, they all had their unique personalities growing up (The charismatic musician, the mean/tough girl, the intelligent and witty one) and I was more just an awkward quiet one, we had foster siblings growing up, I got close with my foster siblings and I didn’t really bond with my other siblings. When I went off to college, it became a huge issue of them thinking that I left because I thought I was better than the people on my hometown. My sister has sent multiple texts threatening to kick me out of the family because I don’t talk to her enough or I don’t respond with what she wants, we’ve had plenty of fights (I always lose, she’s fucking strong), my brother ended up transferring to my university despite me begging him not to after he admitted to me that this was more a jab at the fact that he wants to show me my father will pay for his college and not mine, and my older brother and I just avoid conversation in general. The next issue is my mom and step father, as they’re what makes this so hard for me. My mom was a gem, growing up I thought she was the most hard working and kind woman I ever saw. When she married my step father, or maybe when I got old enough to understand, I noticed she has a horrible tendency to manipulate people. If I don’t check in once a day with her as a 20 year old, she freaks out and claims I don’t care about her anymore. I really love her and we were so close for so long, but stepping back it almost seemed inappropriate for a mother-daughter relationship and it got very toxic when I tried leaving. My step father is more likable now than when I was younger, but the last lengthy conversation we had a few years ago he told me that when I claimed to be sexually assaulted it was because I wanted to not get into trouble for changing my own Netflix password and lying about it (I was tired of my whole family using accounts I paid for, too many and I couldn’t log in anymore). Him saying that shocked me as I thought we had always had this little understanding of each other. 
If I could choose, I would text my Mom maybe once a week and the rest would be history. But that’s not really an option, because my Mom will not stand for me cutting off my other siblings. I also have two younger siblings that I really enjoy, one I could always keep in contact with but the other is too young to contact me himself. I have managed to keep this awkward distance with everyone where we aren’t fighting, but it’s so uncomfortable. I don’t know how to approach them anymore.",20Feb2020,1
826,"I don’t have a permanent address. My parents suddenly moved away a year ago and left my behind in this state I never asked to move to in the first place. I don’t really talk to them much, and it’s for the best. I’ve tried to talk to them about co-signing for a loan for me and they’re too afraid it’ll hurt their credit score and they’re in no position to offer me money (not like I’d take it anyways) 

I’ve exhausted my financial aid because I switched my major as a junior so I no longer can get Federal Financial Aid and I owe my school $2400 before I can register for my fall classes for my senior year, if I can get past that then l can figure out a plan for the rest of my tuition.

I currently work as an RA which pays for my room and meal plan which unfortunately means I can’t work any outside job otherwise I risk losing my position with the school due to their policies regarding Resident Assistants and outside jobs. The job itself only pays $60 every other week and there’s no way that would ever pay off $2400.

I could sell my car but I need it to live. Should this all fall through my car will be my home for the foreseeable future until I find a friend or someone to move in with. Everything else I have isn’t worth much.

I just need to graduate, this can’t all be for nothing. I’ve worked too hard to come short by a year. I’ve maintained a fantastic GPA, worked tired nights, dealt with everything that comes with being an RA, I’ve worked so hard for this and I don’t want to give it all up.

834,"I've always had a great passion for acting. Since I was 11, I have been taking drama classes to improve my acting skills! I joined my school drama club in sixth grade and I have made great plays around my school. I was the best acting student in middle school and one of the best members of my outside school drama community that works for one of the most famous stages in the entire city.

But this year, our drama teacher decided to move me  from my drama club into the drama community of the school (it means that the group I am in controls all the drama activities around the school).

At first, I thought that we are just gonna do some extra jobs with acting, which I didn't mind at all! So I joined, got the badge, and was an official member  of the ""RFDC"".

But I noticed after few months that we have been doing nothing but babysitting seven and sixth graders and discussing their work in every meeting. And all the other jobs we got were doing our teachers favors like decorating her classroom,stage, etc... And doing schedules for the students activities that sometimes don't even have anything with drama. We didn't do a single play or anything related to us

At first I just thought that we just started with training other students so we could learn more about drama and leadership or something, but that is what we have been doing all day... Just working for the teacher while she sits in her throne of glory giving us useless tasks to put some weight off her shoulders!

And after I realized it, I was in huge anger. That women was wasting our acting skills that we have trained for years just to join this club and do useless bullshit and she is going to do the same thing with the younger students. It is not even acting classes anymore, it is just working for this Karen.

I want to quit, I really do, but there is this one thing stopping me from doing it. Which is this drama club will help me get a scholarship, join the student council, closing my community service record, and gaining respect from most of the school.

Drama is a huge deal for my school, so joining the drama club will help me more then any other club in the near future (I checked with the school office and all of the above is 100% true)

It's been a weird day of posting too much today, but I'm really at the end of my wits.

I live in a country where therapy isn't very accessible, I can't afford it, and my parents have been raised to think that mental health is made up so no way on earth are they going to pay for it. Getting a job isn't possible either because third world countries don't hire part time employees and I'm a student (20f) rn.

I have severe self confidence issues. I think I'm ugly, boring, worthless, stupid— and I know I'm probably not as bad as I think I am but it's very very hard to internalise this. This puts me in situations where I'm constantly beating myself up, it's pretty pathetic honestly. This has also led to some pretty extreme alcohol issues, won't lie, which makes everything worse.  I'm always sad and I'm continuously self sabotaging situations and relationships for myself.

843,"Background story. my ex boyfriend and i had dated for a year and a half, broke up the day before thanksgiving because he said he didn’t feel like we had much in common. after a year and a half together. then we get back together right before christmas, things aren’t really going great. He often would wait hours to text back because he was playing video games etc. So I wasn’t 100% happy in the relationship. We break up February 5. I was okay with this because honestly I was feeling the same way about it, the relationship had kinda come to an end. 

On Valentine’s day I find out that he had been flirting with another girl and asked her on a date in January. She said no, only because she had just broken up with her boyfriend a few months back and just wasn’t ready for a relationship. 

So, he didn’t really go “all the way” but he asked her on a date, flirted and obviously had interest in her while we were dating and would have gone had she said yes. (he made a reddit post asking for advice on how to proceed with her, got her flowers for valentine’s day and stuff).

848,"My girl best friend invited me over to her house and she said that two of her other friends were gonna be there and they both had boys going with them, so she repeatedly kept asking me to come and said she would be 3rd wheeling if I didn’t come so eventually I decide to go. 

Once I got to her house I could tell that she was kinda drunk and she was being really touchy with me, once I made it inside I asked where the boys where that were supposed to be coming and she said ‘you know how boys are, they like to play it cool, they are coming later’ so I just sat and watched part of a film with her and her friends. Me and her ended up going in the kitchen and she continued to be really touchy with me. After about an hour of us both being in her kitchen and us both drinking I ask her where the boys are and then she says to me that they were never coming and she said that to convince me to come, at this point I am really shocked and she can tell by my face so she starts getting embarrassed, I assured her that I wasn’t bothered and that I was just supprised about it. 

Eventually she says to me she was tired and she wanted to go to bed and she asked me to come with her, we both go upstairs and long story short we ended up having sex then falling asleep. She ended up waking up at like 5:30 in the morning and woke me up, we talked for a little bit and just lied in her bed together. At this point I’m wondering whether we were going to regret this and if it only happened because we were drunk. Although yes we may have still had the alchohol in our system it pretty much had wore off at this point but she continued to be touchy, etc. Every now and then if I turned away she would crawl on top of me and just lie there.

At around 10 I get ready and go home. After sleeping at home I wake up and snap chatted her just like normal for a couple times and then she says to me ‘are we gonna pretend like nothing happened or what? And asks me how I feel, I reply with ‘dunno, you?’ As I was trying to gauge her feelings first and I genuinely didn’t know how I felt and she just ignored the subject and we just started talking about something random again. Later on in the night we start talking about it and Everytime we ask each other how we feel we both didn’t give straight forwards answers and at the end of the conversation she says that she will think about how she feels and she will message me in the morning. 

So.... the next day goes by and I’m waiting for her response. Mid-day she says ‘I think we should just be friends, unless you think different’ and this confused the hell out of me because if she thought we should just be friends then why did she add the ‘unless you think different’ at the end as how I felt wouldn’t change how she feels. So I reply with something like ‘ye I mean if that’s how you feel then there’s no point forcing something’ and then we carry on talking for a bit and she says ‘is that really how you feel’ and once again I say ‘I don’t know’ (because I really didn’t know) and then at the end of conversation I say ‘before you said you think we should be just friends so is that what you want or no?’ And then she said ‘ye I think that’s best’ and then I said ‘ok let’s do that’. Once she sent me the message saying she thinks it’s best we stay friends it kinda made me feel some type of way that I haven’t felt before, this girl is like the only girl I talk to and she’s been my girl best friend for like 3-4 years so I genuinely didn’t know if I liked her or not and now for the past couple of days I can’t get the situation out of my head and it’s been getting me down because I feel like now I realised I like her and in a way I feel like I’ve pushed her away and missed my chance. 
When we have been talking for the past couple of days she has been being really blunt and replying really slow and we are never usually like this together and even if she didn’t like me I feel like we may have ruined our friendship.

The reason why I need advice is because I don’t really talk to girls in a romantic way very often so I always just assume they don’t like me and I feel like In this situation she may have been giving me massive signals and I’ve just been completely ignoring them and now I’m wondering whether I should just let her know how I feel. The main things that I’m confused about is that she initiated literally everything that night and the next morning being pretty much sober she didn’t seem to change her attitude towards me however I feel like she was the one to cut things off as after she said she was going to think about things she said that she thinks we should just be friends but then if that is the case why is she being very blunt with me now and acting different.

This probably seems really long and unorganised but I’ve kinda just put all my thoughts in at once aha, advice/opinions are appreciated.",20Feb2020,0

Basically he’d ask me how the weekend was looking, referring to the date we’d arranged. I’d said the time I could meet him and if that was okay with him. I also asked him if he still wanted to meet up (I got the vibe he didn’t because the text felt off).

I totally get people have lives and can’t always respond instantly, but to say he was texting fine before and now it’s like he can’t be bothered is making me question things. Plus, he’s not working this week so technically he has more time.

He even told me when he gets bored of someone and/or likes someone more he just stops texting the initial person.

Reading this back now, I feel like an idiot because it’s probably obvious he’s just not that interested in me, especially considering he’s done this before.

I want to unfollow him from Instagram but I don’t want to seem petty. I just have a thing about erasing stuff that makes me feel less and I’d be lying if I said this hasn’t made me question my worth.

I’m not all that excited about meeting him either now because he’s gone so cold, so in the instance he does text back should I just ignore him?

In my mind, I think he’s started chatting with someone new around two weeks ago when he started to go cold. I think he’s then gone on a date with them this weekend and they’ve really hit it off — he’s maybe even slept with her as to why he was silent all weekend lol. 

If he has met someone, that’s totally cool. It is tinder and dating after all. 

I feel like that’s why he’s gone cold though. 

What do you all think? What would you do?

852,"My child goes to an in-home daycare.  The family has 4 children of their own.  Mother is a stay at home mom with a part time job on the weekends.  And father is a ""handyman"", and for almost as long as I have known them; he has not had a steady job.  I get an excellent deal on the price of the weekly daycare costs (under the table tho, so we cannot claim the daycare expenses on taxes); and we've been using the same daycare provider for several years now.  Just before Christmas, she asked me for an advance of a week; which we've now been doing for almost three months.  But recently, at least 1x a week if not 2x; she will ask me to paypal her money and then give me cash the following morning.  Most times she has done this it's worked out, but about every 3rd time, she mysteriously doesn't have the cash or it's close to the end of the week, and I'm just like, I'll send you the rest and we're good for next week.  

My problem is, it's getting out of hand and I feel like she is taking advantage of my nice-ness.  I've had to dip into my own savings to cover stuff I needed to pay because she didn't pay me back when she said she would.  I don't want to cause a fuss, cuz she watches my kid everyday; but I'm getting tired of taking care of her problems.  They are grown-ass adults and should be able to handle their own money.   I've said no a few times, but I need to figure out a way to say ""hard no"", going forward.  Without harming our daycare relationship.  I'd love to just pull my kid out, but the price is really great and we've working with them for about 6-7 years now.

When I walk home from school, on occasion a friend picks me and her up so I've said 'hi' and been like 'oh what homework did y'all get today' before; about two days ago we walked home after this truck started following us she caught up to me and we started to chat, we said bye and had a conversation without any awkward pauses. Today a couple of dudes from our school catcalled me, I noticed her walking ahead of me so when they drove off I caught up to her and said hi. She didn't hear me the first time (earbuds) but when I said it a second time she took them out and apologized. I point out another truck and make some joke, we talk again about school without any awkward pauses. We again say bye to eachother after pausing for a moment where we both go our seperate directions to finish the conversation, and then we walk off. I'm worried that might of been a weird way to approach someone again since we don't really know each other? She seems like a genuinely nice girl and I don't want to come off creepy and persistent.

* **What problem are you solving?**

People interested in Asian fashion or want to have a try, but there is no channel exists that can integrate fashion products from Asian designers.

* **How did you come to this idea?**

1. Once I wanted to buy an earring from HEFANG Jewelry created by Chinese designer who was awarded the gold medal in jewelry design at London International jewelry, but it seems no platforms or website can delivery its products out of China.
2. Another similar situation is I had some trouble to browse and even buy Japanese clothing.

* **How are you uniquely qualified to execute this plan? Why you?**

I am an Asian girl and would be happy to enhance worldwide interests to Asian fashion and leading designers. I am someone who enjoy Asian style a lot.

* **Jewelry would my minimum viable product (mvp)**
* **My target market:** focus on Mainly female aged from 16-35, chic millennials, enjoy life and interested in Asian fashion or culture.

3. After all day working, she has huge passion to hang out with friends
4. Enjoy Tv shows and fashion magazines / blogs to lower stress

3. How can we bargain price and interests with designers?",20Feb2020,1
857,"So we adopted a 1 year old rescue dog who was very shy when we got her but to most my family she has warmed up and is no longer the little bit shy. All of us except my grandad. Now my grandad is at my house almost every day and equally cares for her and even spends most of the day with her while we're at school so he's not an unfamiliar face. The problem is when we're not there she always stays at the other side of the room to him and even if he puts a treat down for her she will not eat it till he is out of the room. When we get home she will only go to him and settle down if he is eating, not sharing with her I will add just eating, and if he isn't she usually runs away. He isn't aggressive to her, never raises his voice and its been about 4 months now where he is around through most of the day and it takes her less than 30 mins to warm to people she's never met before it's just him.

I'm a 17 year old (18 in 2 months) guy.

My friend has a 14 year old sister who for the rest of this post i'll be calling ""14y/o""

We hang out at his house sometimes and whenever i'm there 14y/o keeps trying to get me to go on a date with her.

I've tried to make her understand that she's too young for me and that her asking me out makes me really uncomfortable. Unfortunately that hasn't stopped her.

I've told her brother about how this bothers me but he hasn't been able to do anything about it, It also doesn't help that their parents keep making my friend take her along with him because she constantly asks if she can hang out with us and are convinced that the crush thing is just a misunderstanding.

Other things she's done include:

* Somehow getting my phone number and calling me before she went to bed because she was bored. (I've already blocked her)
* Constantly trying to touch me, even when told to stop.
* And of course trying to convince my friend to give her my address.

I get that people get crushes and that is fine, but i really want her to stop this creepy shit.

Does anyone have any advice? I don't think she'll stop any time soon.

As they took a left turn to exit the highway they were hit by a Arkansas State Trooper who was traveling at 115 mph, with no emergency lights nor sirens, in a 45 mph zone, after weaving through traffic and even crossing over into oncoming traffic all in the name of ""catching a speeder with his hazards on."" The Arkansas State Trooper's Office could filed no criminal charges against the Trooper First Class that was in control of the vehicle.

He is livid, and every time ANYONE in the company is absent, he gives the ""I've been here 23 years and I've only been absent 7 times"" speech and everyone knows it. And he lists off every time he's been absent. Like congratulations, asshole. Want a cookie?

867,"**TLDR: older men keep entrapping me in conversations at work and won’t leave me alone on my lunch breaks, afraid if I say anything I will be the asshole** 

I [f19] work as a cashier for a fairly popular fast food restaurant while I go to school. I’ve worked long enough to have some regulars, some who just say hello and goodbye, but there are two regulars who just make themselves way too comfortable with me and entrap me in conversations because I am on the clock. 

One man “Bill” literally never stops smiling at me, and when he first met me he called me a “small beautiful cute lady” and repeated my name under his breath a few times. He has a wedding ring and spends hours in our dining room. It’s my job to pick up trays, trash, wipe tables, etc and eventually I feel like Bill waits there until I have to do so and tries to make small talk while getting closer and closer. Once during my lunch break he came up and told me “I see you’re eating, I wanted to talk to you but I’ll let you enjoy your break”. Great! I thought...until he saw I finished eating and sat next to me and used up my entire lunch break talking to me. He then made comments about my figure and said I had poise. I felt so upset I wanted to cry. He’s also asked me if he can call me what “my friends call me”. 

Another guy named “Joe” usually was a nice guy to see, he always complimented my glasses and talked about how good his day was. He genuinely seemed like just a cool guy...until I went on my lunch break and sat a few tables away from him. He then proceeds to try and have a conversation from the other table, eventually getting closer and closer and making comments about how pretty I am. He also came up next to me as I was eating and showed me pictures of all his family and him as a child, then offered me the rest of his meal.

My mom married my stepdad 4 years ago. He has always been mentally abusive. She is a foreigner on a green card and he is constantly reminding her that if she ever leaves him, he will make sure to kick her out of the country. She always refuses help and pretends that everything is ok. At first he will only scream at her when no one was around but recently it has gotten worst. He tells her that she is useless and stupid, screams at the top of his lungs that she should get a job but everytime she does he screams even more that she is never home and doesn't pay attention to him. So she quits the job and the cycle begins again. It's heartbreaking to listen to her talking about how much she loved that job but was forced to quit. He is mentally unstable and refuses to take medication. Lately he has bought another gun, my mom doesn't tell me much about whats going on but she confessed that some nights he says how he wishes to shoot himself and that he carries it everywhere even leaving it at her car sometimes without her knowing. She is very scared. He is not physically abusive at least thats what she says. The only time that she has seen him been violent was when they had this dog. The dog behaved bad one day so he beat the dog up. A couple of weeks later he gave the dog away and my mom told me she felt so relieved that the dog was finally away from him. He is constantly making derogative ""jokes"" about her.

874,"My husband and I are in the middle of a very rough patch and the last few weeks have given me a lot to consider. Sorry for how long this is going to be but just for some context.

I had a medical crisis last week where I had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance in the middle of the day. For a few hours I wasn't sure if I'd make it, if I'd have the same quality of life, and if our 3 young kids were going to be left motherless. Everything turned out to be best-case scenario and this week has been much better. However many of my husband's actions during that time are baffling to me. 

-I was rushed to the hospital around noon. He was called immediately by my work and they told me he had been informed of my situation and was going to meet me there. He didn't show up until close to 5 because he had to finish up some things at work. He's a mechanic. I respect his job, but I feel like it's a job where he should have been able to explain leaving for the day with that kind of emergency. 

- In those 5 hours the only time we communicated was at 3 when I texted him that I was doing OK and that plans had been made for the kids already. His response was ""Ok.""

- I was sent home that night with instructions for an immediate followup the next day. I was still symptomatic when I left. He was not able to put the kids to bed and I still had to do the bedtime routine for 3 kids before I could go to bed.

-I wasn't able to drive so he had to take the day off to take the kids to school. I had to get the kids ready, breakfast made, and when I said I was going back to bed while he took the kids, he told me I was going with him. He needed me to help him figure out the drop off lines for school. I told him I was not feeling well, and he said I could nap in the car.

- l was not able to nap in the car because he didn't know which schools the kids went to or how to get there. 

- He didn't want to fight with our 3 yr old so rather than taking him to school he stayed with us. This meant that he just dropped me off at my followup appt which was fine but frustrating because one of my symptoms was a sudden severe speech impediment. It would take me 5 minutes to get through one sentence. So trying to communicate by myself was challenging.

-Also before our appt he found me lying in bed and reminded me to get laundry done before we went.

-My dr. Told me I had to go back to the hospital to run more tests including a lumbar puncture. When I called my husband to let him know he said that no way could he get me there and back and also get the kids from school in time (untrue - hospital was 30 minutes away and the kids wouldn't be out of school for almost 3 more hours). He said if I wanted to go I'd have to wait until after we got the kids. My friend ended up taking me on her lunch hour so I wouldn't have to wait. 

-I ended up being there for 8 hours. Alone and struggling, with my speech, to explain what I was experiencing over and over again to countless nurses and doctors. At no point did he ever call or text to see how I was doing. 

- When I called him, just before 8 pm, to get a ride home he really didn't want to. He said it was so far away, and he'd have to get the kids in the car, and he had no idea how to get there. He offered to call his sister to come get me but at that point I didn't want to impose on anyone else. I begged him, told him he could use Google maps, and promised I'd get the kids to bed. He did agree to come get me.

-Then he complained about it the whole way home. He told me how much he hated night driving, the city, and the hospital was so confusing. Meanwhile I was feeling extreme side effects from one of the medications I was given to help control my symptoms. 

-He went to work the next day. The older two didn't have school because it was a teacher workday but our 3 year old still had school. He refused to take him because he didn't know what to give him for breakfast and he had to get to work right away. I told him that I was so tired and uncomfortable and it would make my day so much easier if I didn't have to worry about chasing our son. The older two are pretty self sufficient. He refused and said no it would make him too late. When he left our house it was half an hour earlier than he normally leaves. And our son's school is on the way to his job. 

-At no point did he help with the house chores. The dishes piled up, cat litter uncleaned, the clothes unsorted. I did get caught up over the weekend but I when I asked for help he just looked at me blankly and said ""help? How? What do you mean?""

Anyway. All that has made me pretty hurt. He told me last night that he thinks I hate him and don't love him anymore. I said I don't hate him but his actions last week really had me re-evaluating where we stood in our marriage. He got mad and told me that it's ridiculous that even when he's trying his best he will never live up to my standards and I'm just finding reasons to be mad. He said that my criticizing him about last week was to make him feel worthless.

I will add that I've begged him to get therapy for us and for himself. But he has continually refused. I'm just tired of having the same argument. It's clear that he has no interest in changing but I'm also no longer willing to accept less than what I feel is the bare minimum. I'm not even mad. I'm just over it.

But are my standards too.high? Am I being too harsh?",20Feb2020,1

For example,when I'm on a long trip, such as a vacation, if I don't masturbate for 3 days in i feel this urge/stress, and I just quietly go to a bathroom at midnight, and masturbate. Is that, a problem of any kind? I do feel like, there is a certain level of taboo surrounding this topic, Sorry if I made anyone feel uncomfortable reading this,And, for those who are willing to answer,Thanks in advance!!!!",20Feb2020,1

881,"I'm in my last year of high school and in my country we have to pass all our subjects to be able to graduate. But, I still have three subjects left, which means in my school, that I have to learn the entire contents of last year from those subjects and pass them in a single test. 

My problem is that those exams will be oral, so I will have to speak in front of three or more teachers about those subjects. But the idea of doing that makes me want to cry everytime, and I always do cry in front of the teachers, which makes me feel a lot of shame, although I studied a lot for the exam.

I don't know what to do about it, since I've spoken to my mom and friends about my procrastination problems and the crying at oral exams, but I still don't know how I could change that.

882,"Hi, I'm Dylan, and I'm hoping no one in my friend group has Reddit. If you know me personally, I kindly ask you to stop reading, but at the same time, I can't stop you.

Thanks to Hormonesᵀᴹ I've had 3 crushes over the past few months or so. Before I list them: yes, I am bisexual.

The first one was a guy. I wanted to ask him out for the longest time, but he started dating my best friend. (He's not a dick, he just didn't know)

The second was another close friend of mine. But I wasn't sure if he likes men or not. So while that one cooled down, I feel like it's not entirely gone.

The third one is the biggest problem. She's a close friend, and I tell her almost everything (except for my crush on her, of course). She broke up with her previous boyfriend because of some personal issues that she's still dealing with. I don't want to bother her with, plus the fact that I'm sure I'm not her type.

So overall, my question is: how do I get over crushes in my close friend circle?",20Feb2020,2

She tells me that she wants to have her ""hoe"" phase. So after a while I tell her how I feel about her and she says I'm like a brother to her and her best friend ever.

I know what the obvious solution to this is but I've formed a bond with her. I know what she's doing that shes keeping me in her pocket. I care so much about her though. I know who she is and I think she needs me there for her. She never really had anyone to be there long enough for her, not to mention past relationship problems that im not in the place to tell.

892,"Hi all,

I am a M(27) and i really need some advice on what to do. I came to London 1 year ago and immediately found a job in hospitality where i have been working ever since. 
4 months ago i met this new starter F(27) who recently just arrived to London and works in a different department than me. 
The first time we saw each other we introduced ourselves and started talking what seemed like forever. We both agreed that it was as if we knew each other for a long time. We exchanged number that day. 
The next day i asked if she wanted to grab a bite after work and we did. We talked a lot more and we spoke so openly about everything and no topics are taboo. Both her and I are single and we both came to london to try to make a better life for ourselves and live our dreams - she was a dancer back home and i want to be an actor.
We continued to see, call and message each other whenever we get the opportunity and this went on for about a month. One night we talked about why we were single and she told me that she came out from a relationship when she decided to move to london. I told her i came to london because i felt i would have more opportunities but after working in hospitality and earning minimum wage i felt that i am wasting my life and that the cost of living in london is expensive so i feel i am struggling and so decided against being in a relationship with someone. 
The more we talked the more we became really close to a point where our hands were always all over each other when we see each other and this went on for about 2 months but we never did anything sexual. We obviously spoked about what is going between us and i even told her i was not ready to be in a relationship and she understood that and we continue this kind of relationship. At the end of the third month we spoke again about our relationship and this time she told me she want us to be friends and to behave like friends in which i agreed. 
We spoke less, saw each other less but we still message each other. One day i sent her something and usually when she sees it she would reply but she didn’t. About 4 days later i sent her something and she saw and didn’t reply. This was the point when i stopped messaging her because i felt something was wrong. On some off chance i saw her at work she didn’t say anything to me when she saw me and we talked in a way i felt that we are now just colleagues. And this has been going on for a month.
I mean as i mentioned i was ok with us being friends but the way she behaving now i feel like she just didn’t want me in her life at all and I don’t really understand where this is coming from given the fact we talked openly about everything.
I have been holding on for months to the no contact rule because i felt maybe she need space but this thing is always on my mind and I don’t know what to do. I still care about her and i don’t want to lose someone like her.",20Feb2020,1

I moved in with my best friend. Before we moved in together I shared everything with her without a second thought. I would drop anything to be there for her, which is why I am in this position to begin with. It’s been 8 months and I’m starting to realize so much that I never noticed before. I’m starting to realize how co-dependent she is. I also kind of feel like she’s trying to be me. It’s weird. I don’t think it’s good for me to continue to live with her but I don’t know what to do because we are best friends and she can’t afford to live on her own. I’ve always been very loving and given her the benefit of the doubt but I’ve been thinking a lot and I’m realize maybe that was naive of me. A close friend brought up the movie “Single white female” and it seems way too familiar of a situation and it got me thinking a lot. Please let me know if maybe these are my own insecurities and I’m being crazy or if my thoughts are valid. Also what I should do with this situation. She’s very sensitive and I don’t want to lose our friendship but I also don’t want to lose my sanity. Help! 

- She not very nice but does it in a “funny” way. It didn’t bother me before but now that we live together it’s constant and too much. Plus I’m starting to act like that too and I don’t like it. Ive been blunt about how I don’t how she treats me. It could just be her personality but it’s also become draining. I don’t think she realizes 

- I feel guilty every time I go do something without her because she takes it personally, shuts down and stops talking to me. When I try to talk to her about it she acts like nothing is wrong and refuses to talk about it. 

- She always says that’s we’re basically the same person, but we’re definitely not. So it’s kind of odd. 

-I prefer my alone time but I never get it anymore because she needs my attention whenever I am home. She is probably bored or lonely but it’s taking a toll on me. I’ve talked to her about it, she tries to give me time but it’s hard. 

- My hobbies or interests become hers overnight. Then she advertises it like she’s in love and obsessed with her new hobby on social media when in reality she’s not actually that into it. 

- She buys the exact same things as me a lot. I didn’t mind at first. But it’s started to be too much and weird 

-She’s very pessimistic about everything in life. Life has been rough for her recently so I try to be there for her and help see the bright side but it has becoming very draining 

- She’s good at being there for me during hard times on the phone but In person she’s the last person I want there because she makes the situation worse for me. I’ve mentioned this and she’s working on it. 

- She has been messaging a guy I have previously dated and also swiped right on a dating app on the guy I’m currently dating and kind of plays “dumb” when telling me about it. She keeps bringing it up....

-I try to talk to her about things but she takes it all very personally and gets upset about it so I have to tread lightly. I get it; because I would probably feel the same. But we can’t resolve anything if we can’t talk about it. 

Obviously I’m not perfect at all and I’m sure I do things that’s frustrate her. But this behavior seems kind of odd to me.

She’s very pessimistic and makes fun of a lot of the things I do regardless of the conversations I’ve had about how mean and rude it is.

The thing is, as said in the title, I feel as if I can't fall in love with anyone at all. Regardless of how attractive or good looking an individual is or my current relationship status with them, all I feel is a more contact-involved friendship between two people which hereby is supposed to have intense amounts of serious emotion and affection, though all I bring to it is crackhead energy and kindness - the same traits brought to best friends n whatnot. Everyone says that you have to find the 'one' before you can truly feel that spark nothing can touch; making you feel all woozy inside, but it's sounds like a bunch of fucking nonsense. Also, I've previously looked online for this issue and all that comes up is that people feel this way if they have an abusive past or have a past with zero compassion and affection, though none of that makes sense to me. All I see is clusters of friends all getting into perfect love based relationships; constantly showing off their affection in public and becoming increasingly more intimate with each other, whereas here I am, single as a Pringle for nearly 2 years, waiting helplessly for the 'one' to appear when most people can't bear to look at me.

I got home from work today and there was an obvious damp patch on the ceiling on the second floor of my house. It's roughly 2x2 feet and is showing up as a stain (i.e. it's not dripping or anything like that). I was at work for 9 hours and it started in that time.

I've investigated in the attic and there appears to have been a small leak from one of the water tanks, but I can't see any more water coming out. There's a small puddle under one of the tanks that is about the same size as the damp patch and not very deep (it's only surface level). It's very hard to reach so I haven't cleaned it up yet.

All the taps and water in the house seem to be working fine. 

I need advice on what to do about this situation, specifically how to stop the ceiling getting worse and how to look for and stop the cause?

The town we live in is drastically different from the city we lived in before. We went from living in a small city with 90% people of color to a town where it's 98% white people. So obviously, her school has a very small population with the majority of white people. I don't go to school here because I'm 18 so I go to community college out of town. 

Anyway, ever since my sister moved to this school, there have been a handful of incidents where she's come home crying because her ""friends"" are being mean to her. I'm not 100% sure of what they're doing to her but she keeps saying that they're mean to her. I want to point out that when she first came to the school, there was another new girl. They both became friends, but this year, they've started to drift away. My sister tells me that everyone is nice to her friend and no one bothers her. Turns out: her friend is a little white girl. All the girls who bully her are white (with the exception of one other girl). I honestly don't know if this is a race thing or whatever because I grew up in a very diverse area, so I've never experienced first-hand. 

My sister has come home two days in a row crying because those girls were being mean to her. She says that whenever she wants to play with them, they say no. Whenever she's doing something, they always make fun of the way she's doing that one thing. They mock her and make faces at her. I'm literally at my wits' end.

We’re exes again because I wouldn’t let this go, but we’re still friends. For some reason I’m just mad at the whole world. There are times where I believe yay finally I got over it but then something triggers me and I start to spiral. This entire thing destroyed my confidence and has made me feel like I was never enough. I know technically I didn’t get cheated on, but fuck, it felt like it. I was led onto believe he was only fooling around with me so how could I not be upset.

922,"I've been working with kids most of my life and I love it (after school programs, pre-school &amp; daycare). I love the chaos, I love the things the kids say. I feel I'm good at classroom management and I'm passionate about it. It is very fulfilling work and it brings me into the present moment. But the pay is not so great and I never finished college to finish my degree so I wasn't able to pursue teaching Kindergarten or anything like that. It was never my main thing, just a side job most of my life. 

A few years ago I started a small business. Well the business ended up being very very successful. I make in 1 month what I would usually make in 6 months at any job. My husband quit his badly paying jobs in retail for us to work together. 

The first couple of years were amazing, I get paid to do a creative job, my husband and I can live comfortably and I don't have to worry about money anymore. No boss. No work hours. Make my own schedule.

But over the years my mental health has deteriorated, I spend most of my day alone working on a computer screen, my husband as well. Even though were together we don't interact much because he's busy fulfilling orders and I'm busy working. Ive tried gym memberships, hanging out with friends and family more often, volunteering work on the side and it does help but I can't help but wonder if spending 8 hours a day alone working from home just isn't my thing. To help with anxiety, I have been meditating, focusing more and resisting rumination/worrying.

I've always had anxiety most of my life but now that I have 8-10 hours a day to worry and ruminate and be alone with thoughts my anxiety has become a serious issue to the point where I now am in therapy. I miss working with kids because it was 8 hours a day *of not being in my head*, being in the present moment and it was emotionally and mentally fulfilling, I loved it and I miss it. 

Problem is I can't just walk away from this career, it would hurt not just me but my husband too. He loves this job he loves the freedom and I don't want to be selfish. I would still need to go back to school to be a full time teacher and the pay would be a huge cut. My husband has other passions too, like music and DIY working with his hands too and I wonder if he would prefer it but when I ask he says he likes his job now. Loves it. 

Ive tried bringing it up to my husband but it's very tense because I'm between a rock and a hard place. I enjoy my job it has its perks and I'm so *LUCKY* and *BLESSED* and a lot of people would *WANT* to work from home I get it (I feel guilty to even say it) but in many ways I'd rather do something where I'm *AROUND* people, doing meaningful fulfilling work. I like the social interaction, working with kids and just generally being *NOT HOME* for 8 hours a day. I know it sucks to wake up early and to have a boss (for damn sure) BUT I also miss it too. Am I just overthinking this? Or should I find a way to make my career meaningful? I've never even had a full Time teaching job it would be a huge risk to leave this and then to find out I don't like it. So maybe I am overthinking this and I'm just not appreciating what I have...I go back and forth often with it.",20Feb2020,1

Due to my mental illnesses &amp; disorders, I’ve always had an extremely tough time with school emotionally. This year it’s been especially bad, I have over 2 weeks of absences due to me being unable to come in without crying/melting down/self harm for hours. I’ve been to practically every single kind of school, and this one has been the best out of 14.

I’m not bullied (to my knowledge..) And my teachers only get on my nerves at worst. My grades are awesome and I have no doubt I can get my GED and do well on the SAT’s. I’ve explored basically every other option, and I think I just cannot handle highschool itself.

—CONS— 
- Working from home has been very isolating, I struggle with severe depression

- I feel mentally drained constantly from solving other people’s complex technical issues, when I get off work, all I want to do is play video games or sleep.

933,"This is my first post on reddit so bare with me.

So, like the title says I fell through a roof.

The roof only had the synthetic felt/underlayment on it (what goes on before the actual roof. In this case a metal roof."" So as im just getting on the roof to install an anchor point to tie my safety rope too, I take a step on what seemingly looked like the rest of the roof, solid plywood with a synthetic felt/underlayment over top only it was a huge hole in the roof that was covered up by the underlayment. Well needless to say I went straight through and down to the concrete below landing directly on my back fracturing 3 vertebrae. Now, we assume the homeowner, who has done most the rest of the work on this house, is the one who put down the underlayment but, when Workmans comp &amp; my boss asked who did the underlayment all he will say is ""im not answering questions but I know he wasn't wearing a harness"". Well yeah no kidding I didn't even have a chance to screw down my anchor point let alone harness &amp; tie off. But it sounds to me like he's already contacted an attorney. Should I be doing the same? Do I have a case of negligence on the homeowner (or whoever)?

Now per safety standards you NEVER leave a hole in a roof covered up with only underlayment. You're supposed to leave a temporary plywood over it until it needs to be removed, at the VERY LEAST you cut out the underlayment and put cones, markings, orange spraypaint or anything except covering it up WITHOUT marking the hole OR telling me or anyone on my crew.

Now, because of someones negligence I have a busted up back, out of work for a minimum of 8 weeks (Workmans comp is giving me 2/3rds my normal pay), can't even put my underwear on by myself &amp; im basically bed ridden &amp;, possibly going to have long term disabilities because of this.

And no, nothing is wrong with her, she’s been to the vet so many times and the peeing is just her bad habit and her way of acting out when she doesn’t get what she wants. It was a habit established by her previous owner, whoever that was, I didn’t adopt her till she was 9 and she is 15 now.

951,"Let me start this off by saying, this is a plan we've had for a while. It's not something we just came up with 3 days ago on a spur of the moment decision. Right now me and all my friends are basing all of our colleges in our state close to our hometown and we're planning on living all together rather than staying at home or on campus for our first year. We've looked at a few apartments through many different websites and have settled on one that is only 17 minutes away from where we live (though that information isn't too important, I just thought I'd add it anyway.) We actually have an apartment tour coming up. 

Here's where it gets a little tricky. 

Literally none of our parents believe in our plan, whether that's based on lack of maturity or the fact that they don't want us to, who knows. Though we don't have a bunch of money saved up, we are currently saving (I currently have 2 jobs in high school just to save for things such as this.) We also would be able to bring furniture from our homes, so buying furniture wouldn't be such a problem. 

The Details. 

The apartment we're looking at is 3 bedroom for roughly 1,600 a month (split between the 5 of us.) We realize there are other costs that go into it, but that's just a big picture that we're focusing on right now. We have been friends; some of us since pre-k, some of us since 6th grade, but all of us have been a full group since freshman year of high school. I don't mean to make us sound like that bitchy popular group (because that is far from what we are.) but we are a very exclusive group and a majority of us don't have friends outside of the group, not because of rules but by choice, so having a falling out is not really a problem to consider. 

The Question. 

I guess I just need some advice on how realistic this is. It would be greatly helpful, but not necessary, to get some advice from someone who maybe moved into an apartment when they were younger and the pros and cons that come along with it, or if you just want to add your input that would be great too.

A few minutes passed. She then passed round her sweets, gave one to everyone but myself. Nobody said anything but I could see people looking at her like “wtf?”. And her friends moved her sweets away after she did this. 

For a while last summer, I sat there wracking  my brain wondering what I had done to her.. as far as I am concerned there is nothing. I have hung out with her and her friends, they both still talk to me.. so if I had done anything inappropriate they would be ignoring me too?

I haven’t thought about her behaviour in a while, but this did get to me and was somewhat humiliating.

I don’t quite know how to interact with her, it is really quite awkward when we’re sitting in the room and she is blatantly ignoring me.

It’s truly bizarre behaviour that I have never come across in my life.

I don’t know how to respond to her, other than to sit there and ignore her behaviour, despite not enjoying doing this?",20Feb2020,1
958,"When I moved in with my now fiance over a year ago he had a stray cat that he would pet when he would go on the patio to smoke. I absolutely love animals but especially cats. I eventually saw the cat had badly matted fur (long haired) and was a little skinny. I've slowly turned him into a house cat. Fiance is gone long periods of time for work and I've been home alone pregnant and I've bonded with this cat a lot. He changes the cats litter and feeds him for me often.
He has some issue though with chasing the cat around the house for fun. I've begged him to stop it really upsets me and he wants me to use a safe word if I'm serious. Which I'm never not serious about harassing the cat. It's abuse he claims it isn't. He's never hit the cat or anything but the cat hides and hisses when he walks by sometimes. I threatened to rehome the cat but he says he loves the cat. I don't want the cat to be harassed and I'm I can't deal with this anymore.

I’ve found a travel group that does organised tours all around the world and I’m particularly interested in doing tours of Australia and New Zealand (which they provide). Both the Australia and New Zealand tours look absolutely stunning, and although I’d love to do one after another, my wallet cannot take that. I do intend on doing whichever one I don’t do once I’ve saved up again in the future but my main question is, which country would people advise on exploring first?

Both tours are 25 days long each and roughly the same price (with Australia being slightly more expensive). The New Zealand one explores the coastline of both islands and the Australia one explores the eastern coastline and some of central Australia (like Alice springs and Uluru) 

I’ll be travelling solo (nothing new to me) but the tours are done in groups of 15 or so people which I think is really cool and a great way to meet new people. They are both high activity with hiking, cycling and other activities like surfing and diving. Any and all advice and ideas are welcome please!

I have always been a good student but sometimes she stresses me out. I'm 19 and I'll be 20 soon. I'm responsible enough to know that I have schoolwork to do and turn things in before it's  due. I even have my own studying schedule that works best for me. What should I do about this situation? Thank you in advance.,20Feb2020,1
972,"Trigger warning for mention of self harm also sorry if this is a mess 

Some background: 

A girl (16F) I (17F) used to be friends with once borrowed around $100 from me 3 years ago on a school trip we took. She spent all her money the first day of the trip on an overpriced souvenir so she no longer had money to buy herself food, so I told her I’d give her $10 a day (trip was 5 days long) for a meal so she wouldn’t starve. (BTW I had a job around this time so I had enough money at the time to give her the money without stressing my wallet) along with the $10 I gave her for a meal I agreed to give her another $50 to use carefully for small souvenirs so she wouldn’t have just the one item- equaling about $100.

Over the course of the months following the trip she promised she’d pay me back once we got back home. Didn’t happen. Later on, she promised to pay me back when she got a job over the summer. Didn’t happen. The next year she promised to pay me back after she moved. Didn’t happen. Then promised me that she’d finally get a job. Didn’t happen (again). 

At one point I was willing to just kiss the money goodbye when she starts flexing her new Apple Watch and Air Pods she had recently got (About a month ago). I asked her if she could afford those items if she could finally pay me back. She said she was going to in a few months. I asked her if she could pay me back before our school trip (In April, so about 2 months from now). She didn’t reply and just walked away offended. 

To mention, I didn’t stop being her friend because of the money. I stopped being her friend because she lies a lot. Like, a LOT. Also including the fact she tried to play both sides. Ex: A guy tried to sexually assault my best friend and so we stopped communicating with him on all platforms and in rl. Meanwhile, she would trash talk him while with us while continuing to talk to him as a friend. At one point after the incident they even dated for a short period. 

Now recently her parents put her in a mental ward for being suicidal, which I honestly feel like is false because she’d show up to school with the shallowest of cuts and shove them in people’s faces bragging about being so edgy and depressed. She was caught talking about them loudly to a classmate by a teacher who reported it. 

WIBTA if I asked her for the money, yet again, about a week before the school trip?",20Feb2020,1
973,"I'm 17f and my mom hasn't been allowing me to go to school for roughly 6 weeks now. She thinks I'll get murdered or something else bad would happen if I went due to ""the voices"" that she hears in her head.
She also cries and laughs randomly without context/not wanting to talk about it. She's 75% of the time paranoïd and acts as a psychopath. I have no freedom, she always HAS to see me. Whenever I go to the bathroom and she doesn't see me while she's doing whatever she yells my name.
When I'm in my bedroom, I can't close the door / she checks every 15mins or so. 
I cannot cook nor am I allowed to clean, if I offer to help or just do it, she takes over. She brushes my hair and treats me like a doll, but she says mean things to me as she brushes my hair, almost with hatred. Calls me a mistake and other things as she brushes my hair, feeds me negativity 24/7. She says I'm a whore and thinks I've done incestual things with family members while infact, I'm a virgin and haven't even kissed before.
 Accuses my dad of being into young teens and doesn't let me be alone with him. When I used to go to school (before she didn't let me attend) she and my dad would both bring me by car and pick me up.
Usually I'm barely in time due to her taking a lot of time of looking ""pristine"".
I have custom dresses like a fucking barbie doll.
I've been severely depressed since age 12, not diagnosed by a doctor but I know I am, I also have some severity of germophobia and have a lot of anxiety.

I used to harm myself but stopped in march 2018. My mom saw the cuts and went to the principal.
I got called and she took my wrist and showed it to them demanding an explanation, saying I'm a bright young lady who isn't weak and asked who bullied her daughter, Infact, she was the cause of it. 
Since then I have had even less privacy then before. I'm only allowed to be within our own house. I'm not allowed to go outside without an adult.
I'm a normal functioning human being besides the fact that I have allergies for 9/10 things and it's not deadly at all, also have sensitive skin and eczema + asthma. 
She attempted to take my life 5 times now. 
She doesn't remember what she did when she becomes a very overbearing sweet mother. Even back in my home country, my own best friend wouldn't believe me when I told him the things that happened and told me I was being a drama queen and that she was a super great mother.
 Everyone around me believed her, and I felt heartbroken. 
She does everything for me, she's always been very nice when she's not the psycho, she always calls me a sweet nickname which I do infact hate, but she shows genuine love and affection, even though at times it's quite.. abnormal.
 I've never learned how to do things by myself and feel like a human piece of shit.
I'm always on my phone, it's an escape for me from this prison in real life that is living with my parents. My dad is usually on business trips and they fight 24/7 and he's never home due to that.
 He says she's possessed and needs help and has spend so much money over the years but nothing helps, I said it's something psychological.
She has probably multiple mental issues.
I think she also has trauma from being a sexworker in Brazil against her own will, being abused by her exfiancé, leaving her 3 kids behind, my dad buying her away and giving her freedom.

 I thought I could handle being here until I finished my basic education, you know? But I'm not that strong it seems. It just.. it just gets so much harder as time goes on, I thought I got used to it, but seeing my dad do nothing.. hurts so much.
I've been in this foreign 3rd world country for roughly 4 years and I.. repeated a same grade 3 times due to abuse and other things, finally proceeding to the next year through a lot of effort, my online friends and boyfriend helped me a lot.
I feel like the effort is all being wasted because now I'm losing another year probably if I don't go back to school.

. I told my dad about it too but he said that I'm being dramatic and that I'll be on my own, without them.
 I'm honestly scared to leave because I don't know anything or anyone besides them and they're the people who took care of me for so long.
 It's just so hard to finally leave and wanting to leave them behind.. my dad is a good person but he has a lot of flaws.. a lot of bad things happen, my health gets neglected a lot and just.. neglect in general. I suggested we needed family therapy or just therapy and they said no.

TLDR: I get abused/neglected at home by my parents, I want to leave them and go back to my home country but I'm scared. I want to tell my dad to choose between my mom and I but honestly?

I tend to be opinionated about things, and I tend to speak my mind.  My problem is distinguishing when I'm going to far vs.  being shut down because someone doesn't like what I have to say.  Being of the female persuasion means that many times people are used to women submitting instead of vocalizing their views.  But on the other hand, I do have a tendency to want to be right, so I will keep arguing if I think I'm right.  I also have no problem arguing with someone about a topic like politics or religion and walking away no hard feelings. I cool pretty quick, other people do not.

986,"So this girl I kind of have a crush on called me a couple nights ago. She has a boyfriend, and complains about him constantly. I don’t believe I’ve let her know about my crush on her, but as she was saying goodbye, she said “Love you.”

I don’t know if it was just to be friendly, I don’t remember her saying it to me before. I don’t know how to respond by saying it back or not. I’ve always been a very close friend helping her with emotional trauma every now and then.

987,"Is life really that wonderful experience? Throughout my life i have seen many people, many povs on life and it seems, like with gods, that there's is no real reason besides being better.
Gods aren't true - that's the first lie we live in, same applies to fate etc.
Nothing besides core of us is really worth to fight for -  many POV on how country should be ruled, many povs on how people should etc. Are just our way to have best environment to live a life it seems.
So what's the point? Love is only about finding values you care about (so magical aspect goes away) friendship is seeking a value that you want in them.
Maybe that's wrong what im saying, maybe. Honestly it seems just a life that i ""need"" to life rather than ""just"" life... There's always that, that people will care in the end about themselves. 
But maybe that's only my post-breakup sadness that plays a role in this? Before that i was the same as now ""Be better at what they value, be better at what you want, become better than your parents"" and when i met her, i was once again living a happy life... Trusting in this ""magic"" origin of love, that it's the moment that i was looking for. Unfortunately , due, as i thing, my decreasing value and not becoming better and showing her my ""true"" self she broke with me. And it starts again.

I started my degree when I was 18, then I joined the military. The 4 years that I was in I didn’t get the chance to do schooling. When I got out I went right back to school. We move so often though that it’s been hard to ensure all of my credits transfer over. 

As it stands, I have a year and a half left. And then I want to go on to get my masters. But this means I won’t be done with schooling or have my dream job until I’m about 30 years old.

990,"so I was applying at cappella university for the counseling program but I didn't have the gpa. I have my bachelors degree. so I was going to apply for the ""masters in clinical psychology counseling track"" but the program does not have enough credits to qualify for the LPC (licensed counselor) required by pretty much all the prospective employers. many states also requires thousands of hours in addition to the number of credits to sit for the LPC exam. what does this mean? would I have to take extra classes and make sure that I get enough supervised hours to sit? I really wanted to work as a counselor or therapist or in a similar type of role. I love children, working with individuals, listening to their problems, and finding ways to help them. I am not interested in becoming a teacher or social worker.

I wish my GPA was higher but unfortunately I was the one working more and paying on my mom's mortgage and car payments during my undergrad. if I had the time and didn't have the burden of her bills I'm sure I could have done much better. this wasn't the case and I couldn't devote the time I needed to my assignments in undergrad. its different now. my mom is financially stable and I moved out. I have the free time to devote to school.

I submitted the application anyways, but am wondering if I should pursue something else instead? I always had an interest in business, I know several MBA programs exist, but I do not have experience. I run my own side business for a few years, loved it, and made really good money, but I have not seen any promise in the research I had done on it. I could also see myself in a management position, I am very organized and good at resolving conflicts. 

I feel very discouraged and lost. I have spoken to the admissions counselors and they have been condescending and were not very helpful so far.

996,"I was misdiagnosed with Asperger's almost four years ago (I don't have it, I'm neurotypical), and ever since, many people started to treat me in a more child-like and condescending way, and that made me feel quite depressed...

Yesterday it was my birthday, and they sang happy birthday for me in our college class, they brought  cake and snacks and stuff like that, some people even hugged me. I was shocked and didn't know how to respond. My first thought was that they did it for pity or because they still think I have Aspergers (haven't told some of them I'm neurotypical). My second thought was being grateful, I said thanks and tried to speak to them, although I was nervous and had cold hands and feet.

I tried to befriend some of those people in the past, but I was the one who texted them/tried to know them 8/10 times, so I eventually got tired and stopped contacting them, except for group projects or college stuff. And the interactions I've had with others were just saying hello, goodbye, lending them things or helping them when they asked my help (sending them slideshows, pdf books or things like that). 

I hope they didn't do it for pity, it would be like life was rubbing salt to my emotional wounds saying: ""Most people just pity you or treat you like a child, and aside from some friends, you'll probably never be able to make new genuine connections, because you're too broken and rotten inside, and people think you're a special needs person"".

That's why it shocked me when everyone started talking to me. A girl whom most interactions I've had were just asking for my help or saying hi and bye uploaded pictures of me in her What's App state, and the one who had the idea (another girl) started to talk to me a bit more after our teacher of Human Rights talked about being inclusive with neurodiverse people a few months ago.

My loved ones (family and one of my best friends) told me either that I deserved that kindness and a lot more, or that I shouldn't think like that, because that would be being ungrateful, because not everyone gets something like this, and because it's a big step for me in my recovery from depression.

What should I do? Sometimes I want to ask them if they think I'm different or if they do it for pity, but I'm afraid that it will backfire and they would truly hate me.",20Feb2020,1

I kinda had a crush on her before they got together but a whole thing with her and her ex-boyfriend made me blow my shot and now they're together. I thought my feelings for her had vanished but suddenly they've reappeared and made me a mess emotionally.

So last night I was at work when these feelings first reappeared and I kinda started stating them out loud (I don't work with anybody and nobody was near) and now she answers every message I send with a quick, no more than 3 words, sentence. She also used to hug me whenever we met and whenever we left again, now she's kinda giving me the cold shoulder, not really talking when her bf isn't around.

I'm getting kinda scared that she may somehow have heard me talking while I was at work or I have made her mad somehow. She's one of my only friends right now and I really don't want to lose her.

However, we were chatting and I see her getting a text from him and I could see that she got nervous cause I saw it and she just pretended that she didn't even get it. I had told her about how he was avoiding me and how it hurt me so she probably also understood that me seeing those messages wasn't gonna help me.

I don't mind them talking but I really disliked her reaction and how she didn't even say anything about it.

I am fine if she's into him as well and I wouldn't mind giving him up for her but I really hate how this situation is going.

I ignored her texts and the last thing she sent me was ""why are you ignoring my texts?"" cause she probably saw me being active on other group chats.

We became very close once we went to the same school but late last school year and early this school year, our mutual friends and I have agreed that she cares too much about popularity. She clings onto anyone who has a lot of friends or “status” which I honestly don’t see. Recently, it’s been getting really on me and our mutual friends nerves. She chooses other “popular” acquaintances over her best friends. Lately me and her other best friend have felt like we both are only friends when she doesn’t have someone better around. I honestly feel like I’m mad for no reason because she can have any friends she wants, but when she ditches me and friends and leaves us in the dark, it enrages me. She expects us to understand when she flakes on us for someone else. Sorry if this doesn’t make sense I didn’t read over it lol.

This has made me strive to get the best job possible and buy a house whenever I can, which I can gladly say I’m moving towards very nicely.

The reason for this post is that my young half sister; who means the world to me, is starting to realise the nature of her dad and due to her age I think it’s impacting her big style. He bullies her, shouts at her constantly, smacks her and shows a lack of attention to her in comparison to my step sister (doesn’t live with us). It’s getting me down because I’m nearing moving out in the next few years and it’s been getting worser for her, to the point where my partner has even noticed it. I want to report this, or atleast mention it to someone but the stepdad is the main source of income for the house and my mum wouldn’t be able to afford the mortgage on her own. 

I feel like this will have a big impact on my sister later on in life if I don’t do anything as she might not have the same work ethic as me.

Longshot....

Hello hello everyone,

I am a 2018 undergrad in english and theatre. I can honestly say that when I was attending college I only did it for my grandmother (my mother passed when I was young and didnt graduate). 

I've been teaching kids for a while, &gt;5 years. Different things, martial arts, dance, english, etc..  

I have always been interested in medicine. When my mother passed I got invested a bit. I sort of spent most of my life, just going through the motions and in my late 20s (late start, I know). 

I've been thinking of getting my grad in psychology and/or child development and then (hopefully) going to med school for peds. 

I know it's a long, lengthy, and expensive process. If anyone has any advice or cautions, words of encouragement, etc.. I'd truly appreciate it. 

Also if anyone has an alternative... I can take them into consideration. I don't want to be a teacher forever. 

Thanks for reading,
C.",20Feb2020,1

Literally ANYTHING distinguished that I do or accomplish, she has to post it to the entire world on Facebook. 

I don't like advertising what I do, and I personally don't think graduating is that big of a deal.

I don't like being in the spotlight, and it really bugs me that her identity revolves around me.

1015,"TL;DR: Bf’s roommate made me extremely uncomfortable while drinking and I don’t know if I was being overly sensitive or dramatic. Is this even worth mentioning to my boyfriend or not? 

I have no one else to ask so I ended up here. Basically, last night me, my boyfriend and another friend decided to get drunk at home. At some point, my boyfriends roommate came downstairs and started taking shots and at this point, I was already kind of gone. My bf and our other friend decided to go outside to smoke which I didn’t want to do so it was just me and the roommate inside. He started talking to me and getting really close to me, to the point our hair was touching. I tried moving away for some space and he kept coming closer and violating my personal space. The entire time he kept asking for advice about something personal (I dont remember) and said I was smart enough to know what to do. I was very uncomfortable by his sudden closeness but I thought it was just because I was drunk and not thinking straight, therefore overly sensitive. Eventually, he offered to order everyone Taco Bell and I was pretty hungry so I agreed. I was the last one to order and I guess I stumbled a bit and roommate said “If you are okay, give me a high five” so I high fived him, but then he held onto my hand and continued talking about some personal stuff, which I didn’t like. I eventually pulled my hand away and sat down. Throughout the night he kept trying to get into my personal space and trying to have private conversations with me and I was just really uncomfortable and I tried convincing my bf to let us leave but he kept saying “I want to smoke, so just wait inside.” But I didnt want to be alone with the roommate anymore. He was also sort of handsy and kept touching my shoulder, putting his arm around me and patting my back. Not only that, but with the sudden sense of extreme discomfort I suddenly realized that I was the only girl in a house with 6 guys and I was way too fucked up to drive or even move properly. Something like that has never bothered me before because I am always over and am usually very comfortable with all his housemates- even his roommate. I stayed with my boyfriend for an additional three hours and eventually fell asleep on the table because I didn’t want to tell him anything or say anything to anyone in case I was being dramatic and not thinking straight. I am pretty sure he got annoyed at me since I kept asking if we can leave and I was being needy. 

The roommate has never acted like this before and he was pretty drunk too. I asked my friend and she said that since I was still very uncomfortable today then it definitely is something worth mentioning, which is true, I am actually avoiding stopping by his place after work. Is this even worth mentioning though, since it seems insignificant over paper, and was I just being overly dramatic and sensitive? He never did anything truly inappropriate, after all...",20Feb2020,1
1016,"I came home last night more drunk than I’ve ever been before. I only have vague memories of what happened after arriving back. Turns out I made a complete ass of myself in front of my parents.

It involves me being unable to talk, having completely slurred and incomprehensible speech. Couldn’t walk on my own. Looks like my dad helped me get undressed and put me in the bath. Again, I have some memories of them being irritated by me, and I’m worried about everything they’re not telling me about what happened.

I’ve struggled with self hatred for a while now, and this really is the final straw for my self esteem. Part of me wishes I had died of alcohol poisoning whilst I was out. I’d kill myself if I wasn’t so afraid lol.

1018,Ok so my mom and I go to this international grocery store a couple times a month to get some Asian snacks or some shrimp because it’s better there. There’s a lot of workers in there and also in the aisles . So there’s this Hispanic guy who I’m positive is older than me (probably 20s to early 30s) I can’t really make out exactly . So I’ve been going there a lot more recently and every single time we go in this guy and I make eye contact for a few seconds. Sometimes multiples  times in the store. This happened again two days ago and before we went I actually got a little bit more put together and sprayed perfume. I purposely went out of my way to look good . So when we went I walked into a aisle with my mom and there was the guy and another coworker. They were speaking Spanish (I don’t speak Spanish I’m Pacific Islander / white) and I swear I heard one of them say “that girl” in English . The coworker looks at me first then The guy who I’m talking about  walks down the aisle walking past me but again we made direct eye contact. Is it weird or desperate that I kind of get a rush every time this happens? This could mean nothing and just be chance but I don’t experience this with any other guy at any other stores I go to frequently. He notices me every time I go in and stares even if my mom Is right there. I loo right back at him. Idk I’ve been thinking about him a lot lately and not gonna lie I’ve been fantasizing too.

I found this as a win win, I can't remember if I took the day off of work or not,  but it's irrelevant. We had a really fun trip all day. The concert was miserable for me, but that's my fault for going (loud noises), but we made up for it with other fun stuff. On the way back home it was clear he wasn't going to pay for gas, but that was okay I just decided to let it slide. But when we were driving late at night I was getting sleepy and asked him if he could drive so I could take a quick nap and he agreed. He ended up speeding and getting a ticket and freaked out about it. After the anger ended from that (he was upset it would affect his parent's insurance), we got home and I dropped him off. I said because the ticket was around $125 he could pay me later if he needed to. We never talked about it again. I admit it bothers me, but he is a good friend I have had for almost 15 years. I don't want it to affect our friendship. I get we are both in college so money is tight, but I wish he would at least say he can't pay me back, I would be willing to forgive it if it's really that tough. How do I go about handling this?

Unfortunately when I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with two diseases that would never allow me to be in the active military or reserves. So that was my first goal getting crushed. In high school i was pretty talented in sports and even talked to quite a few colleges about playing for them even got a few official visits but my grades weren’t there. By the time I graduated I assumed sports were out of the picture and enrolled a community college. Spent a year there and did miserable and failed out. Mental health took a bit of a dip and realized I need to switch it up. So I found a community college that had a football team so that way I’d feel like I’d have motivation to do well in school. That worked for the first half of the semester and I got really good grades. But then the football ended and my grades plummeted it’s been two semesters since then. And here I am I don’t want to go back to school, football has been ruled out at this point because of my grades and I got fired from my job a few weeks ago.

1027,"Hello all, I have found myself in a dilemma as of late and I’m not sure how to handle it.

So I have met this group of people around a year ago and it consist of, regularly, five people including myself. I met them over an online video game and have talked to them everyday for at least a few months straight. As of late I have been questioning whether or not I should continue to be friends with them, and I have no idea how to approach the situation. 

To give context as to why this is difficult for me, these are the only people I have had solid, friendship like contact with for the past year. A year before meeting them I was very isolated and alone for most of my time and I continue to struggle with that today. I would describe this group as toxic and carefree, and very void of empathy. They pretty much say what they want to say, no matter the outcome it might have on that persons confidence/emotions/mental state etc. This has been done to many people in the group, including myself, and though I would say I have a thick skin hearing the same exact joke about yourself over and over every single day gets tiring and extremely annoying. Their sense of humor, while I understand it and get why they find it entertaining, to me comes off as abrasive and very shocking for the sake of being shocking. They agitated and make people angry just to see their reaction. 

I wouldnt say I fear bringing up my feelings to them, I just avoid it because I know the outcome that will come of it. I would basically be mocked and ridiculed for feeling the way I feel about the situation. If they don’t understand your feelings or why youre feeling that way they simply just wont care. They’re always right and you’re always wrong.

At this point I’m lost and confused, I want to leave but if I do I’ll go back to being in a state of isolation and having no one to talk to. And I don’t want to be alone. 

Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated, because I genuinely have no idea how to handle this situation.",20Feb2020,1
1028,"Male and 18. Up until now, I've enjoyed a ""lazy"" and hermit life. I've been living with my parents and I don't have to pay for anything. I take online college classes and all income I have is from student loans and financial aid. However the time is coming very very soon to get a real job. I need the extra money. However...

My life has been very bad the past few years. I've had some abusive people messing shit up all around my house, both physically and mentally. Now there's a good chance they'll move out and never fuck with me again. However in my mind, I'm thinking to myself ""I just spent the last few years never living life to the fullest. Once they move out, I should enjoy the life I had before these people ever fucked things up. I shouldn't now just limit my life again by getting a job just as things in the house cleared up"".

Does that make sense? I've been living in a messed up situation for years, and that may come to an end soon. However, I won't be able to enjoy my I unmessed up life because now I'll have the responsibility of a job on the back of my mind. It doesn't seem fair. It's like shit barely got out of my house, and now I'm gonna create it for myself.

Of course I will have to get a job one day.

This also means that I ironically want to get a job even more when life is going crappy. I have nothing much to lose. Because adding some shit on shit doesn't make much of a difference, but creating my own shit ( by getting a job when my life is going well) where there's none feels like I'm fucking myself over.

1037,"To begin, I moved country 3 years ago and have kept in contact with two of my best friends (we'll call them Beck and Quinn), we talk on a group chat everyday and video chat alot. Two other girls I was in the same friend group with (Jill and Molly) got really upset when Beck and Quinn came and visited me in the England. After this Jill completely cut me off, unfriended me on social media and ignored any mention of me in conversation (according to Beck and Quinn who still talked to her), Molly talked to me if needed but we never got along as great friends so we rarely talked. They were offended to not have been invited but they never talked to me after I left or made any effort to stay in contact.

A few holidays later both to England (where I live) and Scotland (where they live). I spent a week in Scotland staying with Beck and Quinn and also met up with Molly and had an okay time (nothing ""went down""). Jill was conveniently on holiday the same week.

We decided to try end some bad blood and invited them to Paris for New Years, this is two years after I left. Jill said she would be civil towards me but doesn't respect me and I found out she's not angry at me for the holiday but something else I don't know about. (This was found out by Beck and Quinn)

Surprisingly Jill hugged me at the airport and she acted like nothing happened. Throughout the holiday she proved very difficult to be around and we breathed a sigh of relief when she went to bed extra early every night (10pm), most nights Molly would join her around midnight. Beck, Quinn and I would stay up chatting till 4am, these nights of constant chat were our favourite part of the week.

The last night we stayed up really late with Molly too, she used to be troublesome but had matured alot since I last saw her and she was okay to hang out with. She understood Beck, Quinn and I were three best friends and tried to insinuate that it could now be a group of four with her, and slyly invited herself to our next holidays, to which we did not outright agree or disagree to.

She has not texted me since but has tried to hang out with Beck and Quinn alot more since Paris. We now want to plan a summer holiday, our main plan since we don't have much money is for Beck and Quinn to come to England for two weeks and stay at mine and do cheap activities. We haven't said anything to Molly but she thinks we're all going to plan a summer holiday together. 

Now to ask the big question, how do we tell Molly we don't want her to come on holiday with us? 

Molly is okay but she's not us three and we really want a holiday with just us. Also Beck will be moving to Australia in August and this may be one of the last holidays we have together as tickets to Australia are really expensive. 

We don't want to hurt Molly because Beck and Quinn still hang out with the same group as her and she's still a friend. As for Jill we decided in Paris that she would not be invited to another holiday and she doesn't seem to be expecting it either.

We don't know what to do and keep in mind that we are a tad socially awkward and will find it incredibly difficult to talk to Molly about this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ❤️

1038,"I have met this guy 3 years ago. We talk everyday and know everything about each other. It started as flirting and sexting and he even used to see me as a potential but now we're just friends. I always had feelings for him so I decided to tell him and he said we're good as friends and he wants to keep that. How do I get him to see me more than friends? How do go back to where things started? I can't live without him but I want more than just friends.

I just don't get it, why wouldn't he want a relationship with me if he thinks I'm funny, great company, he trusts me a lot and finds me attractive. We have a lot in common and are really good fit and I know he even told me he wants me to always be a part of his life. So why are not in a relationship already? If this isn't love than I don't know what it is. He even sometimes does things that feels like we're in a relationship, like sometimes I feel like he's my boyfriend. We both rely on each other and support each other a lot.

Now my main job wants me to relocate to an area roughly 3 hours away, preferably as soon as possible, with better hours. The problem is, I literally JUST got done with the onboarding process with my part-time job and finished computer modules (no actual training yet), and feel like an absolute douchebag asking to be released from the position, which I'll probably not be able to give a proper 2 week's notice (which is a courtesy). 

I'm set on leaving this part-time job I've been accepted to, but can't figure out a way to word my resignation letter or how I should convey the message in person as I will meet with my supervisor tomorrow morning (for the first day of training), and while also not providing a 2 week's notice since the main job will want me to take over the new location immediately. 

After thinking for hours, I think the best method of action would be to just tell the truth and the entire story as is, but if anyone has a better idea, I would really appreciate if you shared it with me.

1050," I'd like to get some advice on... let's say almost everything. This post is not to draw sympathy, pity or anything other than solid and honest ideas on what to do or what not to do....

I'm 24, a virgin, never had a girlfriend, no education, about 10'000 swiss franks in debt, was involved in minor criminal activities for some time. Yeah, basically I'm a complete fuck-up. Only thing missing would be a jail sentence. I was just lucky to never have been caught. Oh, and please don't give me the ""don't talk about yourself like that""-crap. I have to be honest if anything is ever going to change. 

**Goals and life situation**

I stopped my apprenticeship in the IT field 5 years ago. Since then I was in the swiss military and quit, tried some different jobs and quit, developed an app that didn't have any success and quit, tried to grow online businesses and guess what.. I quit. Quitting is a common theme in my life and I have realized that I was a quitter (Can I say ""was"" if I started not quitting just some time ago?) a long time ago. I quit almost every little thing but there was one thing I never quit and that was sports. I started Kickboxing when I was 17 and then later found MMA at 19. I fell in love with it almost immediately but I often didn't have any money to pay for training so I've had long breaks but in those breaks I never stopped training. You know... basic stuff, bag work, strength n'conditioning (lots and lots of sprints). It's the only thing I never quit because it's the only thing that keeps me sane and gives me some kind of... let's call it ""pride"". I dreamed of being a fighter (well, I still do tbh) but I sucked at managing money plus didn't have much of it in the first place. My kickboxing coach started to notice some of my strengths when I was about 22 and we trained more intensely. I had 3 amateur fights then I stopped visiting kickboxing classes because I couldn't pay the fee. I already owed him the fee from last semester and I just couldn't go there anymore being the jerk-off I am. I felt bad for not paying. My coach gave me a lot and I just couldn't live with me taking advantage of his generosity. I vowed to change my life by starting some kind of business so I could pay and spend my days mostly training as it is the thing that makes me most happy. I failed, quit and got depressed. Pretty much every time after I quit something and got depressed I started doing dumb shit like selling weed, burglaries or just stealing shit in general. I've always been kinda depressed and I have experienced heavier waves of depression from when I was 16 years old. You know that kind of thing where you think you're in excruciating pain and contemplate suicide. I'm fucking scared of death so every time I went to the train station to take the leap I couldn't bring myself to do it. Plus I got a niece (she's 13 now) and I love her very much. We're close. She's a good-hearted, highly intelligent kid and it really makes me happy to see her have success this early on. There's no reason why my selfish ass should make her life miserable... Anyways, after this ""wave"" I didn't experience any other kind of major low and I got a little better. I tried another online business, failed again, quit again but this time I was less harsh on myself. Fast forward to today I am starting yet another online business with my sister and I have never been this consistent. Been working on it for almost two months now. I never stopped training on my own and it helped me tremendously. I'm worried about failing again and I'm also worried about my sister giving up on the business. It's not that she did much (I did pretty much everything). It's just that her trust in me and me not wanting to disappoint her makes me actually do the damn work and it has been feeling good... So much for self-actualization. 

**Relationships**

I find relationships to be extremely hard. It's not that I'm bad at communicating. I can be extremely social, funny and I actually care... It's my feelings of worthlessness that hurt me in every aspect of my life but in this one, they tear apart almost every chance of me connecting with others on a deeper level. So maybe this is the part where I am going to tell my ""sobbing story""... Obviously didn't grow up in a loving environment. There have always been outbursts of sheer hatred and violence.. I am Albanian and in our culture, it's quite common to hit your kids. It's also one of those cultures where strength is praised and weakness and vulnerability is something you can never show.. My dad used to beat the breaks off me. He used belts, his fists, sticks. He beat me, chocked me but what hurt most was actually the fucking psychological terror he used. During beatings, he would tell me so much fucked up things. ""You worthless piece of shit!"", ""You're never gonna be anything!"", ""I'll kill you!"", ""You're trash!"". He would often go on rants and he would talk shit to me for hours and I had to listen because if I dared to walk away he would say: ""Where do you think you're going? Come back or I'll fucking kill you!"" My mom was just as violent but she was able to show at least some affection. My dad also beat her and I was so fucking scared of him that I didn't say a damn thing when he did. As a kid, I was close with one of my brothers but he became schizophrenic and my parents put me into one room with him. He talked to himself nonstop at night and if I told him to shut up he would get bad and sometimes hit me. He was never the same again. I was lucky to have found some extremely good friends early on in my life and they really care. It's one of the reasons I'm not 100% fucked up. The mother of my best friend was very caring and she created an environment where I could feel safe and actually make friends. I learned so much from them and every time we get together it's not just fun but I also feel loved and understood. So yeah, my friends are fucking awesome! I love them to death. But friends can only be friends (not to say that it wasn't enough, it's more than I deserve honestly) and that brings me to one of the most problematic areas of my life: Romantic relationships. It's not that girls don't find me attractive. I look good. I'm healthy, I have a great sense of humor and I can have great conversations. I've even been approached by girls. My problem is that as soon as I like someone they become god-like. My fantasy plays scenarios so intense that I sometimes forget that it's not real. The girls in my friend's circle are all highly educated, talented, well-spoken and just awesome.. It's hard for someone like me to not put them on a pedestal since I already feel inadequate. I can't use girls that like me and that look attractive but that I don't want to get to know better for sex.. It would make me feel like a fucking piece of shit, especially when she would have some kind of hopes.. And as soon as I like someone I can't fucking be myself or try to get closer to her because I think I'm a piece of shit and any kind of rejection is a validation for my negative feelings about myself AND if she was to like me for any reason it wouldn't be a good one because.. Man, I can't imagine someone loving me. And if they do they're making a mistake... This is how I feel and I know that it's mostly bullshit or at least to some degree but isn't it the truth? I mean I am trying to be a good person and really care and I help without expectations and I want people to do good but does that matter...? I'm still a loser and that's not just me finding reasons on why someone will never love me it's just a statement of facts. I'm a loser.. But I'm working on not being one anymore. It's just that I don't know if I'm ever going to be confident enough to think: ""Now I'm ready!"", and that despite of my immense feelings of worthlessness I can't turn off the desire to be loved.. I often think about having someone now so I know they ""really love me""... I think that is very selfish. It also sucks that I seem to want to compensate for the love I never got from my family which is just fucked up... The first thing I stated when introducing myself was that I'm a virgin and the second thing was that I never had a girlfriend. These two things just came to mind first and I think it's because of my desire to fill the void. I just feel incredibly lonely in this world and I don't know what to do about it. I feel irreparably damaged.

**Dealing with my mind**

I think I've been or still am mentally ill. My thought processes seem poisoned by extreme feelings and maybe trauma... I know that dreaming of building a business and becoming a fighter is delusional. I understand that many people think I'm a nutjob when they ask me about what I dream about and I tell them. I just stopped caring. I didn't study in school so I was never too good. University was a dream of mine as a kid but it obviously remained a dream because of my laziness. I could still go to uni but 8 years of studying just to be able to get a job (4 years matura, 4 years uni) plus all the years of work to finance the education... Working on delusional dreams gives me at least 1% chance of succeeding at creating a life where I don't wake up wanting to put a bullet in my head... I'm stressed because I know about my situation and I really want to change it. And by want I mean want. It's just often hard for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel because I've been depressed since I'm a kid and I've experienced so much rejection in all areas of my life. I went to 3 different therapists and on Monday I will visit a new one. It helped me in the past but obviously whining about all the crap won't help. I need to stay busy.

1054,"Hello all you lovely people. After a bit of advice here.
I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years, 2 months ago after finding out he cheated on me for the 3rd time. (He was messaging other guys and sending/receiving pictures). The first 2 times I forgave him, giving him an ultimatum the second time; do it again and it's over. Guess what? He did it again. I broke up with him like I stated around 2 months ago. I'm considering getting back with him and here's why:
1) During the whole three years we were together, he treated me like an absolute prince. He spent all his time with me, bought me gifts, took me out for meals and made me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. 
2) We both have a lot of issues, including mental health issues that have affected our relationship. He was very clingy and loving, and I was sometimes very distant and distracted. He suffered with depression, stress and anxiety like me, but he never spoke about it like I did. I used to sometimes be toxic and take my depression out on him. These are things that we never talked about and I think a lot of issues were because of this. I believe my behaviour partly drove him to message other people because of my lack of love/attention, and toxic behaviour. 
3) When he was cheating on me, he was messaging other guys, sending pictures, but never actually met up with anyone. (That I know of, of course). He has admitted to doing the same in previous relationships which is a massive red flag for me, but as he only messaged, is it as bad as physical cheating?
4) We have spoken in the past week and he finally opened up to me about why he cheated. The thing is, I completely understand why he did what he did, but not when he was in a relationship. It was the attention and the rush of being wanted and needed that drove him to message people. He thrived off the attention and felt that he missed out on having a free, single life where he could mess around and have fun. Since breaking up with me, he said he's realised that is not who he is, or wants to be. 
5) I don't want to miss out on what could be the best thing I've ever had in my life. He made me so happy, and I've been so depressed since not being with him. He was a massive rock for me and I don't feel any better about the breakup even 2 months on. 
I've had mixed opinions from friends and colleagues about what I should do. I know the decision is ultimately up to me, but I am completely lost as to what to do.",20Feb2020,1

1056,I had a dentist appointment today to get a root canal done. I gave my boss ample notice for said appointment. He had somebody follow me to the dentist office to make sure that’s what I was really doing. I returned to work after the appointment and worked the rest of the day in pretty bad pain. I got them to write me a work excuse saying I was at their office from 9:00 am till 12:00 pm. I feel like that’s extremely unprofessional. It really makes me uncomfortable. I’m not sure what I should do about it. Or what I can do about it.,20Feb2020,1
1057,"Hello Reddit, I am hoping this will not be too long but I am not in a good place right now and need some advice about my relationship. 

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years. We met in high school and it was perfect. He was my first relationship, first everything really. I met him my junior year of high school when I was 15 turning 16. Well fast forward a few years, he graduated high school and went into the military. Again, the relationship wasnt perfect but it was damn near. He was 6 hours away from me and he drove to see me quite often. He loved the military and I loved seeing him with a career he loves.

Well 2 years ago he unexpectedly got honorably discharged earlier than expected due to medical conditions (nothing serious, he is not disabled by any means, just some random medical problem that the military deems unfit). When he got out, I was about to be a sophomore in college and was moving out of the dorms anyways, so we moved in together. Honestly, in my opinion it was a little too quick, but hey I love him and it was either that or him move in with his parents 4 hours away, which both of us didnt want. 

Since he got out of the military he has been lost, and I dont blame him. That is all he ever thought about and knew and now he doesnt know what to do. He has become depressed and again, i dont blame him. But, ever since then he hasnt had a drive or a passion. I am now a senior in college, graduating at the end of the year with my nursing degree and have a job lined up in my hometown where me and him both want to move to. 

But. Here is where i am so utterly confused. After months to years of working BS food service jobs, I got him a job at the hospital where he makes full time benefits (not good pay though.) He is not in college but he plans on going back soon to get his degree, and in a few weeks he starts classes to go higher up in the hospital and make more money. But i am graduating in a few months and will be starting my life out of school and I am so excited, but now I am realizing that soon we are going to be in 2 completely different places in life. I am in college, have my friends, my hobbies. He has been living here with me and hasnt really made any friends, stays at home when hes not at work, and has just become so lost and depressed. 

I dont blame him at all and really have been trying so hard to help. I have been helping him financially (Which has been really hard since he works full time and i am in school 24/7) (but also he has made significant improvements in the last few months so im proud of that). I have to remind him to not waste his money and it has gotten really frustrating. So in light of this, I asked him to move out a few days ago into his friends (who is also getting out of the military early). 

Anyways, I know this has been long but the point is what the hell do I do? I love him so much. HE is the love of my life and i truly see a future with him... but the him that has a passion and drive and motivation. He lost all of that. I am hoping that when he moves in with his friend and is farther from me, that he can really learn to live on his own before we move in together in our own place (we have lived with roommates). I cant be the mom in a relationship though. I hate how he isnt smart with money and that he hates his job so he calls out and that results in his paychecks being nothing when he has a lot of bills. I know he is starting a new job soon that hes excited for, but man. I really am lost here. Hes my best friend, someone that i thought i would spend the rest of my life with. Have kids with. And now all of a sudden im having serious doubts because of how much he has changed (and how much I have changed tbh). I miss him being happy. I miss him being the center of attention and him being the friendly one since im very antisocial and have a lot of anxiety. But now hes isolated himself, has no drive, and doesnt know what he wants to do with his life. Do I see how we are after i graduate and have had a few months of living alone? Do i talk to him about my doubts? Should i stop being so hard on him since hes only 22 and we arent supposed to have everything figured out? (hell, my dad didnt go back to college till 25 and had a rough few years but now owns his own business and is very successful). 

If you have made it this far thank you. I am not okay at all and i cant bare the thought of losing my best friend, but its coming to the point that maybe he should take some time for himself and learn how to be happy without me, since i am the only income of his happiness right now.",20Feb2020,1
1058,"I am a 19 years old medical student. For the last couple of weeks, I have been trying to arrange an itnernship for my summer holiday. I got accepted by 2 different laboratories from different countries and I promised both of them that I will be in their lab on 20th of June. Both laboratories sent me the invitation letters and I thanked both of them as if there was no problem, and I said that I am looking forward to being there. Now, I have to make a choice and reject one of them somehow. I think the best way to get rid of this situation is to lie properly, but I still haven't found a good lie. Any suggestions will be appreciated.",20Feb2020,1
1060,"I'm an 18 year old male, and my life is so pathetic at this point. Everyone around me can find relationships and people that are head over heels for them extremely easily. I have a nice family and amazing friends... but legitimately all I want at this point is someone who cares about me on a deeper level. Physical touch is something I really, really crave aswell (not neccesarily in a sexual way, I genuinely just want to know what it's like for another person to willingly touch me). I can hardly function anymore. If I'm in public, I'll see a couple, or even an attractive female and get extremely sad. If I turn to social media to get my mind off of things, I'll see couples bragging about their lives or even memes that are solely directed towards couples. I've recently dropped all my hobbies for one singular hobby that somewhat replicates this feeling (online roleplay). My addiction to it has become unhealthy as it's the closest thing I think I'll ever be able to come to having a genuine romantic relationship with someone else. Idk, this all might be the hormones since I'm still fairly young... either way, living life like this is cold as shit, mentally and physically. I need help.",20Feb2020,1
