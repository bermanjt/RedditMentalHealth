0,I’m a guy in college (accounting major). I applied for a couple internships but didn’t get picked. I do have an opportunity for a summer construction job. Do you think it’s too tough for me? I don’t really work out. I’m mostly just on the computer doing spreadsheets so this would be a change for sure. Could I do it?,02Feb2020,1

3,"I love my boyfriend with all that I am, and theres no doubt I want to marry him. But I'm starting to get a little sad I'll never be proposed to. 

We've been together since we were 15 and I've dreamed about him asking me for years, and I've dreamed about being proposed to since I was little. 

I dont think I'm just being impatient? Like I do want to marry him, and I'm graduating this year and I want to start our grownup life being married. And i want to marry him and be his wife. So why not propose right? 

But now whenever I watch a guy propose I get a little jealous and sad, I'll never have that moment :/ I'll have our moment where I proposed, but I just hope I dont resent never being proposed to. 

Thoughts? Idk I kinda just wanted to get it out there. I guess advice on how not to resent this decision?",02Feb2020,1
4,"Recently I’ve been scared of my life changing, I’m turning 18 in a year and I’m scared of the thought of the thought of growing up. I hate it, why I’m scared of change? When I was younger I always wanted to be older but now I fear it more than anything.",02Feb2020,1
5,"Currently in university and do part-time programming work; high grades and decent pay but incapable of maintaining good/healthy habits for shit, zero self-control, life is an utter mess. I'm a lazy tosspot who whiles away most of my free time on pointless shit like abstract music/art and obscure software with no tangible value.

Been sleeping 3 hours a night the past month as my body just won't let me sleep more (and I have terrifying nightmares), and appetite fluctuates like crazy. Also been wrongly referred to an ""early intervention in psychosis"" unit as the deluded government social worker I had to speak to completely misconstrued me and made erroneous assumptions.

While I somehow still have friends, I'm a KHV/never had a gf as there's something intrinsically off about my personality; I used to do modelling so know I'm not hideous, girls have asked me to sleep with them and I've shared a bed but always too shy to make a move.

I spend hours literally talking to myself, as I get into arguments with myself as if I'm talking to another person and compulsively have to try resolve the conflict, it's really odd... even in public, I don't give a fuck anymore. I can't comprehend my internal monologue, it's like a personality that's continually shifting and trying to sabotage me.

Only reason I haven't killed myself is I couldn't do that to my family, but I'm effectively killing myself in life smoking like a chimney and drinking like a fish to escape this torture, don't know how to stop.

Venting I guess but desperate for any advice on what to do, if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and just how to feel normal and want to work towards something ultimately constructive and more than myself so to speak.",02Feb2020,1

8,"So, I live with two friends of mine in an shared apartment. We’ll call one Frank and the other Kate. Frank, Kate, and I are all real good friends (we’ve been so for about 5 years). We all see each other as family, however, recently Kate has been kind of a dick. Kate’s mother is extremely abusive and thankfully she has gotten out from under her mother’s thumb a long time ago. Since, then her and her mother have been on and off. However, this last year and a half she has let her mother slowly back into her life due to various different reasons. 

Me and Frank have objected to this due to the fact that she takes all of her pent up anger and present anger towards her mother out on both of us. One minute she’ll be fine, then she’ll talk to her mom and she’s a dick to both me and Frank (mostly me though cause Frank is at college/work). Me and Frank have talked about it in depth a lot the past few months and is getting fucking old. I don’t know why she doesn’t have better coping mechanisms and I’m just tired of being her personal punching bag. I’m considering cutting as much contact with her until I can permanently get her out of my life.",02Feb2020,1
10,"I can easily sleep through my alarm clock and also I usually don’t get a lot of sleep. Any waking up tip you’ve got might help, thanks.

Bonus info:
it might sound as an excuse but sometimes I really feel like I’m not in control when I hear the alarm clock. Like sleep is winning me over without me being able to do something about it, all while being aware that I need to wake up. Might be a mental issue about the whole thing which needs to be worked on.",02Feb2020,1
11,"Back in Kindergarten, I met this good guy who quickly became my best friend. I felt this profound connection with him, but we ended up drifting apart and never really talked to each other after Grade 5. It took until the end of Grade 9 until I found this connection again and met someone who I really cared for and felt connected with. Unfortunately, I met this person while on exchange in Germany.

She is now my girlfriend, and we've been doing long distance for around 6 months. She came over at Christmas, and I'm going over there for Easter. We plan on seeing each other on the Summer break as well. When I'm with her, everything feels so amazing. I truly love her, and she loves me. However, lately, I've felt shitty.

It's only after school. I always wake up happy and am decently happy during the school day, but I just feel like shit by the time I'm at home. I guess I doubt her love for me, I feel like maybe she isn't as interested as she once was. I'm perhaps a bit too analytical, but I do know that she still loves me from her actions, but there aren't the all nighters and such from the beginning of the relationship. I know that it is stupid, but I feel this doubt that she'd be able to stay attracted to someone like me. I apologize too much and I think maybe I'm too concerned that she's doing well all the time? That's what she has told me. I really don't know, I just feel weak and unconfident in myself. How do I fix this? I've always thought I've had good self-esteem, I think it just might be relationship insecurity? Regardless, I love her and just want to get past these negative episodes I've been going through and go back to the dopamine highs I used to get long after our video chat was over.",02Feb2020,1

14,"So I’m a straight male (just to clarify) and I have a girlfriend. I love her lots, we’ve been dating nearly 9 months and it’s going well. 
Now there’s this other girl that I used to like a couple years ago and she’s only recently come back into my life. Me and my friends think she likes me and I feel like I’m starting to have feelings for her too as well as my girlfriend. I am very confused even though I’ve had multiple relationships in the past (but nothing like this has happened). I just wanted to see what an outsider to my POV would say about this.

15,Hi! I'm currently a high school student with a part time job. I'm saving all my money for my future and looking for some advice. When I was young my mother passed away in a drunk driving accident.

20,"I think my mum is faking her disabilities and using it to manipulate everyone.

I’ve thought this for a long time but no one else openly expresses the same thoughts, likely because it’s hard to mention it may be fake when she might actually be struggling.
My mum has M.E, fibromyalgia and a few other things that I don’t entirely remember.
The symptoms of M.E aren’t entirely visible as it’s called an invisible illness. People tend to think it’s just being tired but it comes with excruciating pain, struggling to think and talk and move. I had a friend who definitely had this and it was agonising watching what it did to her at such a young age. And yet my mother only seems to display symptoms when it’s beneficial to her, refuses to work even though she has energy for other things such as spending hours and hours on her phone, going out socialising, playing games, drinking alcohol to an excessive amount, etc. 
She struggles to even do the laundry or tidy so all the rest of the family (despite us all being genuinely sick etc) have to do it. She’s refused to work nearly her whole life but it seems as though she’s only got energy for things that suit her. 
Not only this but often if she didn’t want to deal with my needs as a young child, she would say she was tired and do this thing with her voice where it sounds like she loses it. (She still does this daily) Yet if someone outside of the family talks to her while she does this, she’s suddenly energetic with a normal voice again. It absolutely infuriates me because this has consumed my entire life. 
She says she’s tired and yet she won’t rest or sleep and lashes out at me in anger when she claims she still feels like shit. 
She’s inconsistent, too. Often she claims she’s got a disability that she forgets about within a month. She’s on an ungodly amount of meds and is also an alcoholic, which leads to violent outbursts and more emotional manipulation to get things from my family members and I. She hides her drinking from us and blames her drunk behaviour on her disability. Yet the next day we find the empty bottle of booze.
I’m losing patience with all of this and I don’t know what to do. I’d feel horrible if she actually was disabled but I’ve lived with this my whole life and I truly believe she’s faking it.


Tl;dr: I believe my mum fakes a disability for the disability cheque and so that she doesn’t need to work. It’s also a convenient excuse for her being a horrible mother instead of raising her children. I need help with how to handle this.",02Feb2020,1
21,"Hey guys, i'll try to keep this short . I (F25) have been living with my boyfriend (30) for about a year now. We moved in together around the time he began having a lot of personal issues . He became extremely depressed, drank all day, was usually rude when he was drunk, and made me and others feel just awful in general and embarrassed many of us if we went out drinking . We dated for a long time before that, and I didn't feel like breaking up would be a great idea while he was in such a horrible state of mind . Fast forward to now, and it seems like he's worked through these issues, and has been in a much better mood for about a month now . While he felt horrible and was depressed I had been cleaning for him, making food, offering emotional support, and just tried to be there for him. The roles have kind of switched now . I really think I'm depressed after the death of a friend combined with being emotionally and physically wiped from taking care of my boyfriend for the last 11 or so months. He has still been in a much better state of mind, but whenever I ask for a hug or some support, he usually doesn't hug me or hold my hand because he doesnt want to hold hands too often because then ""it wont be special any more,"" and he usually interrupts me or stops listening when I try to talk about my feelings even when he ASKS for me to explain how i'm feeling . When I try to bring up anything, he has mini temper tantrums and says ""what did I do NOW"". Mind you, I ask for nothing except time. I havent asked for money, jewlery, dates or flowers or ANYTHING. Ive been crying myself to sleep lately, and although he puts in some effort, im not sure if I should give him a little time to adjust to me not taking care of him, or if this is a red flag and I should consider ending the relationship .  Any advice would be appreciated, and I can answer questions or add details if needed . thanks",02Feb2020,1
22,"I'm going to be 29 this year. I got fired from a job working as a bar back at the beginning of the year for not showing up because I really didn't want to work there anyway because I'm tying to do better in life and I have been a pretty bad alcoholic for the past few years. I had a friend who offered to help and was going to let me stay with her until I found a job and got on my feet because I was living with my mom in my hometown 30 minutes away from the metropolitan area I live near. Unfortunately due to her own mental illnesses and PTSD she decided after I had gotten a job only a half a mile away from her place that it's better for her to live alone. So now I'm stuck at my mom's house again with no job. I have a lousy car with 120,000 miles on it and it's a Chevy so I'm sure it's only a matter of time until the transmission goes out on it but really I would prefer to not have to drive or have a long commute anyway because I'm terrified of the IPCC report saying we only have 10 years to cut CO2 emissions in half to stave off horrifically cataclysmic climate change. The only jobs around here are fast food or gas stations or an auto-part store and none of those sound particularly environmentally friendly or like they'd pay a living wage. This town is mostly older boomers who don't care about the environment anyway. I have terrible anxiety about almost everything. I'm terrified about our national government and an insane president who threatens WW3 with his freaking tweets who might be the puppet of a loose canon iron fist KGB operative. I have a high school diploma. I went to trade school for electrical construction but I absolutely despise the construction industry and the kinds of people I had to work with. So far my only thoughts are to go back to audio transcription online like [Rev.com](https://Rev.com) but they don't really pay that much and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before those jobs are completely automated. I really don't know what to do. I'm at a loss. I never thought I'd end up like this at almost 30 because I was always one of the smart kids in school but I couldn't finish college because I had to pay my Dad rent as soon as I turned 18 and had to work all the time and now college just seems far fetched anyway.",02Feb2020,1

24,"
So we have been together for two years and have had a good relationship. I’ve seen him get angry once about a year ago but since then it’s been good. 
We put an offer on a property last month and things are moving quickly however since the offer he has twice gotten mad at me. 


Last week he told me to F off and that I was an idiot because I spend all my time on the phone to friends and don’t have a hobby ( I’m a nurse and I’m exhausted after work sometimes I just want to chill on the phone ). This all started because I didn’t have a specific paperwork bit that I had no idea I needed and he called me an idiot for wasting his time trying to fill out the forms. 
He didnt apologise as he refused so I let it go even though I really didn’t like how he spoke to me. 
Then today, he got mad because a form we needed filled out had missed its deadline ( it got sent to my parents address so I saw it late ) I said that I’m sure it’s something we can sort out as we didn’t get told it would be sent there. And he walked out on me In public calling me an idiot and an incompetent tool. 

I get that a mortgage is huge stress and maybe that’s why he’s lashing out at me but Last weekend I told him that the way he spoke to me made me feel like he doesn’t value me and that it brought up a huge insecurity of mine. 

I was brought up in a very conservative background where purity was everything to a woman. 3 years ago I lost my virginity drunk to an ex who basically used me and I still suffer emotionally from it. Like it brings me to tears when I think about it. I told him last week that the way he spoke to me brought up that insecurity that I’ll never be enough to a man because I’m not a virgin so the fact he did it again this weekend really upsets me. 

He called me acting normal an hour ago and saying he won’t apologise but now I’m worried. I have this sick feeling in my stomach that I’m making a huge mistake and it’s too late to go back now that things are moving fast with the mortgage. 

What have I bloody done. Sorry if this is long and rambly I just don’t know what to do?",02Feb2020,1

26,"I turned 18 about two weeks ago and a senior in high school. I’ve always had a great life but progressively, things have been getting worse and worse. I’ve reached the point I don’t know how much more I can handle and I never imagined I would be saying that. I am the guy who is always there for people but I never talk about how I feel or what’s up with me. 

To put it simply, I am failing high school. I am watching all my friends graduate and go off to college this year, and I’m being held back to repeat senior year. I’m having a heath issue, my lung collapsed. The girl I fell in love with, I feel her vibe changing. She has been through so much(she was raped over the holidays and her mom organized it) and I wish there was more I could do to help her. She says she still loves me, but I feel the change. I wanted to be a doctor and go to college myself, those plans are gone now. I don’t have a car anymore, someone hit me and totaled it. My dad is not in my life, but he is now causing me issues... I watch my mom struggle for me and work so hard for me, and I want to help her, but im not even passing high school. She’s never said it but I know I’m disappointing her. And so so much more. 

As I’m writing this I can feel the tears in my eyes... I have tried so hard and this is where it’s gotten me.

27,"     Hey reddit, I am a college student (m18) who is dating a girl in high school (f17). My roommate was really good friends with this guy (let’s call him Brad) and he would often invite him to our dorm. Brad has a lot of problems and shows signs relating to a psychopath. He is very manipulative, impulsive, lies almost constantly, and will do anything to get his way. Brad had a very bad and prominent reputation in his former high school and it carried over to college. Knowing some of the things Brad has done, he is very deserving of his bad reputation. But because I never had a personal problem with him, I decided to be friends with him anyway. At one point, I even considered him to be one of my best friends because I thought he changed. Unfortunately as the semester went on, Brad became much worse. I can’t say exactly what happened, but Brad ended up getting in huge legal trouble with the school. Because of this, my roommate and I decided to cut him off for good. After we cut him off, school was a lot less stressful. We went our separate ways and everything was so much better for both of us
     
     Unfortunately, this period was very short-lived. I own a MacBook for college and it is synced to my phone. This makes it to where I can text people off of my computer. I’ve recently learned through other students that while Brad was in my room, he went through my computer without me knowing and took pictures of “sexts” I had between me and my girlfriend. These pictures include my girlfriend posing sexually in a dress (not nude but still obvious sexual intent) and me responding in a sexual way. Not only did he completely invade my privacy, he also sent it out to multiple people. I still can’t figure out how and when he was able to get in my computer. Surprisingly enough, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. I know this because while we were friends he showed us some horrible stuff he has on other people as well. What would stop him from doing the same to me? I can’t sleep at night knowing he has reputation-harming photos on both me and my girlfriend. I’ve known Brad for a while now, and he is the type of person to use that against me in the future. I know if I confront him about it that he will just lie and it won’t go anywhere. I also don’t want to provoke him as well. This situation has caused me a lot of stress and I don’t know what to do about it. Any of you guys’ advice would be greatly appreciated.

My family is very similar, and we're cutting down on meat. I'm planning on going fully vegetarian by the time I'm 18.

Also, I have a small business. I sell greeting cards to people in my community but also ship to other places in the country. It's relatively new so it's not that big yet. I buy supplies for it from my local Kmart.

I know it sounds trivial, but all the materials I buy are made in China. Shipped over using fossil fuels. Paper that is probably not sustainably sourced. And in addition to that, I have to ship some of my orders on a plane, which is especially bad since my city is relatively far from many of the cities I ship to. And finally, I'm powering consumerism, the very attitude that is leading us down this dark road to destruction.

Maybe it'd be okay if I could find sustainably and locally sourced materials, and only sold locally so that I could deliver by bike. But otherwise, I don't know if I can continue with this with this. I know my store isn't very big, but it's more of an issue in principle for me. And if I'm gonna shut it down, it's gonna be easier to do it now when it's still not much.

Anyway... I just want to hear what you guys think about this. Am I batshit crazy? Am I on to something? What do you think the best course of action is for me to resolve this inner conflict?

Thanks for sticking with my through this rant.",02Feb2020,1

43,"I’ve found that biting my nails seems to help (or rather is automatically coupled to) my concentration when studying. I’ve tried snacking but it’s too distracting and it doesn’t help that I really dislike chewing gum which is supposed to be a good substitute. Subconsciously my hands automatically go to my face either so I can chew at my fingers or to scratch at my skin... (weird I know) and if I’m not biting my nails then I’ll be chewing at my lip.

44,"I'm a 30 yr old male, and I've been going through a lot of sexual changes lately. I work as a head lifeguard at a high school pool, and so I'm surrounded by half naked teen girls of all ages. And lately, I find myself having a lot of passing (almost invasive) thoughts about them and their bodies. The ones that are 17/18, I don't feel bad for, maybe because it's legally acceptable. I just try not to oogle them too long or often because it is disrespectful. But when I see some of the younger teens, I see that they are budding with sexuality and I just feel sincerely curious about them and their bodies and what they are going through and experiencing. It is 100% innocent and in no way predatory. But I can't help but feel gross for even having the thoughts, but most of the time I don't even want them to happen. They just come into my mind; like, I will immediately get an image in my head of them naked. (However, there is a limit, as I have zero curiosity or anything like that for any younger, pre-pubescent girls that come to swim.)
I feel like a lot of this comes from my own puberty/childhood. I grew up in a very shameful, closed-minded, Christian houshold with an angry father. So I spent a lot of time asking my mom about puberty curiosities. And she would get so mad at me that I was brought to tears almost every day for just asking innocent questions about my body and about girls my own age and women. I didn't even start masturbating until age 13, and even that was looked upon with such shame and disgust by my parents. Eventually our family moved cross country and I had to totally start over socially, and I think that left a lot of that sexual trauma unresolved.
And for whatever reason (probably because I'm now finally in a emotionally/mentally safe living environment for the first time in my life) these sexual curiosities are now surfacing. I accept them, but I have such a hard time getting past the self-shame, judgment and disgust that is conditioned from my past. I've even come across naked underage girls online and had my curiosity piqued in what feels like a completely harmless way, but I feel disgusting for even being curious. I try to remind myself that there's a BIG difference between innocent curiosity and the sincere desire/urge to manipulate, molest, predatorize, lustfully fantasize, etc. But still, my mind basically just lumps me in with that anyways. I've learned a lot about myself and my general anxiety and self-awareness in working through all of this myself so far. But I just wanted to see if anyone has any advice? 
I'm not opposed to CBT or other therapy, but I also don't feel like it's neccessary. I like the reward of being able to work through things on my own accord. I just think it would help to know that I'm not alone, or I'm not that weird.
Thanks in advance! Sorry for long post.",02Feb2020,1
45,"Okay so I'll try to be as succinct as possible, but basically:

Recently, I got into quite a big argument with my Mum. Insults were thrown (admittedly mostly from my end) but then my Mum did something that, to me, was completely unforgivable.

I won't go into too much detail, but I had previously confided in her about particular behaviours that I literally hated myself for doing. Thankfully, the behaviours I'm talking about have pretty much ceased due to me working extra hard at my mental health and learning to manage my emotions, but it was something that she knew I was trying extra hard to overcome.

So, during this argument, she decided to use the very same information that I had confided in her about against me during the argument. Something that she has done to me before in varying degrees. Granted we were arguing and I had said a few hurtful things, but they were very much on the surface, I guess the typical stuff one may say when they're angry as opposed to stuff that is deeply personal. Imagine someone using the one thing you hate about yourself against you? Believe me. It's not nice.

Well, to say I lost it would be an understatement. I basically told her to get the hell out of my house despite her pleas to try and make things better after basically massively back stabbing me.

Anyway, fast forward a few days and I call my Mum in hopes that we can rectify everything that happened. Which is huge for me as I admittedly find it hard to swallow my pride. So I apologise for what happened, hoping that she might apologise for what she said too, but no. After I apologised, she then took it as an opportunity to start calling me rude and excusing herself for what she said to me, using the same fucking excuse I get from both my parents which is ""I'm your mother/father"". In fact, she didn't even feel as if she had done anything wrong. Then after I tried to explain how what she said hurt me, she gave me a half-assed ""I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings"" in a real shitty tone.

Now, I do believe that children should respect their parents. However, I have also always thought that a parent should model respect to their children and I've always felt like my parents have never done that. In fact, I think a fair amount of my issues as an adult are due to how they were as parents. Instead, whenever there would be arguments or whatever, it was always the same excuse of ""I'm your mother/father and you should respect me regardless"" there would be never be an option for a two way conversation to allow me to at least be heard and understood and I guess I've finally decided that I've had enough. With both my parents there has always been this false ideology of respect and, in the case of my Dad, fear at times. Basically, this whole idea of ""you are the child, we are the parents so what you say or think doesn't matter""

So now I'm not speaking to either of my parents, which is a pretty big deal for me since I did always think I was close to them. But after my Dad ended up shouting at me over the phone and telling me to go live my life, I decided to stick up for myself and make the choice to do just that. So I ended up sending them both an email explaining how I've felt during all of this and ended by saying that if this is what it takes for them to not speak to me then so be it.

In all honesty, I feel kinda liberated, almost like I've finally broken the biggest barrier to my personal development, which is being able to stick to my OWN believes rather than having my parent's beliefs forced upon me. Neither of my parents have tried to even come close to hearing my side of the story throughout this whole thing.

In my opinion, I do feel like I'm doing the right thing for ME and my own personal development by holding my ground. But of course, I find myself reflecting on it all. 

Which brings me to my question: What should you do if your parents think they deserve your respect regardless of how they act? Should I continue to hold my ground or am I not seeing something that I should be seeing?

Thanks in advance.",02Feb2020,1

49,"So there is this kid in my school that is the same age as me, and there's so much I want to tell him about why I hate him but I have this almost gut feeling that I shouldn't, like there's something holding me back. So the stuff he does may be considered minor from an outside perspective but it fucks with me so badly and I don't know if I'm overthinking or not but this is what's happening. So I used to be good friends with this kid in year 7, but going through the years I noticed that he was changing and just becoming an asshole. He would  would do things like take my food at lunch and either throw it in the bin, on the floor or at me, keep calling me names and do some other weird shit like spit his chewed gum in my face. And to this day we have some sort of neutral friendship if that makes sense, like we're not as close as we used to be and I hate him but he still tries to talk to me.

So the reason as to why I don't know how or want to tell him everything is because of who he is or what he became, I'm worried if I tell him why I hate him he'll embarrass me in front of everyone, like he'll mention all of the ""dirt"" he has on me, everything I've done wrong he will just tell everyone about I it. And he has a very large group of friends. And if that isn't the reason, then I feel like if I tell him everything wrong that he does he'll just beat me up, cuz he is definitely capable of it and he is the kind of person to do it.

There's a lot more to him that I don't know how to put in to word, I'd have to have some sort of hour long conversation in person to fully explain him.",02Feb2020,1
50,"Hi!


I work at a small volunteer run Cafe and Bookstore. This is a difficult situation that happened just this Friday and I'm not sure what I should do.

I am friends with a co-worker at my place of work. He is the same age as me and we've been friends since the start.

This past Friday I was asked by one of the mentors if I could clean the mini fridge we have at the coffee counter to hold the milks and extracts.

I had sprained my ankle about a month and a half ago and it's still kinda sore if I get up from really low on the ground like I would have to be for cleaning the mini fridge.

I explained this while my friend was nearby.

My friend then told me that he knows I'm ""a ball of lard"" but it was no excuse to be lazy.

Now I'm not thin but I'm not super overweight either. I am a bit chubby. His comments made me uncomfortable because he didn't say it like a joke and I'm very self-conscious about my weight.

My mentor made him stop saying if I couldn't physically do it then that's okay.

I don't know what to do. I feel if I tell my manager, she will tell him to not make comments like that and then he'll know he upset me. I don't like people to think I'm weak.

What should I do?",02Feb2020,1
51,"First time renting an apartment. My boyfriend works as a security guard for a certain company that also rents out apartments. These apartments he gets a discount on so its the ideal ones were looking at.

Well she let us know one is available but it is 1 bedroom short (which we can work with) but would like the extra space. She said it would be available for Early-Mid April and that is my ideal time of moving. I dont want to be moving in May.

54,"I’ll try to make this short but this might be a wordy question. I have always been a rather sensitive/emotional/person with personal issues, and I have at times in my life had to lean on other people, vent, ask for advice, or just needed emotional support in general from those around me. I feel lucky to have had that support, and they have never been shy about telling me how they would handle things if they were me, and as far as I know I was receptive to and grateful for their help, even if I didn’t end up following their advice.

Well, things have finally settled down in my life, I feel like things are going really well for me, but at the same time I am seeing quite a few family members and a couple friends that are in crisis, and I have been trying to be there for them, but I feel like not a single one of them wants or needs any help from me, not even an ear for them to vent to. I get that people don’t want unsolicited advice, so I can understand them getting annoyed by that. 

The thing is that I know this isn’t personal, every one of these people just happens to be the type of person who keeps their feelings to themselves, and thinks crying or asking for help is a weakness. These are pretty much all the people who are close to me...brother, sister, best friend, in-laws, Even my own husband, who is not in crisis, is happy and healthy, doesn’t seem to ever need any emotional support from me. As a result I feel like the relationships that should be the most intimate are merely acquaintances. I’m to the point where I am feeling bitter towards these people because I feel like if I vanished, everyone would be just fine without me.

I have 2 kids, and of course they need me, and I try to focus most of my energy on them, and that is fulfilling to that facet of my life, but it’s just not the same thing as feeling like you can contribute to another adult loved one’s life.

Looking back, I’m pretty sure she liked me too, but I was too chicken to do anything about it, and when summer came, we lost contact. When school started again we started talking again, but then she started dating someone, and I started to avoid her as I didn’t want to put myself in a painful situation. They broke up, but I remained distant. I really want to be friends with her again, but I have no idea to approach her without talking to her for a year.

81,"Today was my brother’s 16th bday party. Yeah made him a homemade card and present. Also I spent hours on making a slideshow of his life in chronological order. It took forever. After I gave him his presents he never said thank you and for the rest of the party he terrorized me. A lot of people say “that’s just the way brothers are” but they don’t realize how bad it really is. I have looked up to him my whole life and have tried my best to give him everything he wants and basically treated him like royalty. But, he has always given me the opposite treatment. He makes fun of me, hurts me, blames me for things, insults me by saying I’m depressed, stupid, a retard, ugly, not loved, etc. Anyways, after his presents he has absolutely terrorized me. He it throwing things at me, putting things in my face, stealing my stuff, hitting me, yelling at me, and more. For example, I was playing the piano, and he comes up and starts banging the keys and every time I try to touch it he slaps my hand. He also found a golf ball and keeps on putting it into my face and throwing it hard at me. He also keeps bragging about how he got so much cash and that therefore he is more loved by our parents. Which I know isn’t true because they are very supportive and loving parents. Another example is, I went upstairs into my room to check on my cat. She is scared of people she doesn’t know so she was hiding. He comes into my room turns the lights on super bright, which scares my cat and starts tipping over and moving my stuff around. Along with my ceramics that he also chips in the process. He does this because he knows bothers me because I have OCD. He also steals some of my stuff and hides it in high places because I am short. Then, when I come downstairs to play games with my little cousins, he says “why are you down here? Go somewhere else and cry!” But anyways, I have already forgiven him because, I am like that, too easy to forgive. I love him as much as a sister could possibly love her brother, even though he acts like barely loves me at all. Is there a reason why he is like this? How do I make it better?",02Feb2020,1

She told me she's glad both of us are virgins and pure in the eyes of the lord and couldn't imagine marrying someone who wasn't.

For the record she told me well in advance that she was a virgin and wanted to wait until marriage and knowing how strict her parents are, she never done anything bad.

I never touched her sexually, never cheated on her, or pressured her into anything.

But I thought she knew what I was like when she knew I was in a frat.

87,"Hiya,

I've lived with my parents for 25 years and I recently was approached by some good friends who want me to room up with them.  I think that I'm interested in taking their offer.  However, this is a huge step for me and a scary one at that.    I would like to say that my parents are wonderful, I couldn't have asked for a better upbringing, they've sacrificed a ton for the wonderful life I have now.  They have no issues with me staying at home, and in fact, encourage it so I'm financially stable when I'm done with my degree. 

 I was homeschooled and an only child growing up,  so I was very spoiled and I still am.  I'm still checked up on constantly when I go out with friends, and I just don't feel like I'm an independent person as of right now, and I'm scared that my parents will take my moving out very hard.  However, I feel like this is an ideal situation for me to build self-confidence and carve my own path into the world.   Being 25 and living at home has made dating hard for me as well.  Gone are my teenage years, and I feel like women expect you to have a place of your own, for privacy's sake. 

So far, the place that I'm moving to would only be 15 minutes away from my parents, and the rent is cheap (around $450 for rent &amp; utilities).  I have a job that would allow me to afford this without any debt right now and I have enough saved for the Summer when my work has to cut everyone's hours.  I realize that I won't have as much money when I'm done with my degree.  However, I think that I need to take advantage of my youth and live life to the fullest.

I was wondering if anyone else has had an experience similar to mine?  Or can tell me if what I'm doing is too far fetched.  Should I take up the offer to move with my friends?",02Feb2020,1

(30 minute commute plus 15 minute walk in). I am in charge of an outage at a major power plant and theres no ""taking a mental health day"". Realistically, I will only get 6 hours of sleep a night at best until the unit is running. I want to maintain a 45 minute lifting routine before bed every other day in order to not lose muscle, but aside from that I will be walking 20,000-30,000 steps per day so I dont feel the need for cardio. 

Honestly I am terrified because I need optimally 8 or 9 hours of sleep to function properly and feel well and this will be the first time I go this long without a full nights rest with no off-days for catch up. I struggle with anxiety and by the time I get back to the hotel there will be 1.5 hours for exercise and eating and then 8 hours until wakeup. I am the type of person who needs a few hours to rest.

So I'm not a native English speaker and live a country where very small percentage of people know the language. I learned as a kid thanks to video games and can't even remember the times when I didn't know the language. For last 5-7 years I use English as the default language. Which means I only watch movies in English, read books in English and all my devices are set to English language. It's not something I think about it's just my default go to language. When ""think aloud"" I do it in English but haven't had the chance to actually speak with someone for some time now. 

These days I feel like the stress I feel when I imagine I'd talk to someone is overwhelming. And it keeps me from doing stuff like playing games with friends. English speaking communities are much bigger and I definitely could join voice chats but that damn stress is ruining it for me.

92,"Hello all,   


This is something I've been struggling with for the last year and a bit...since I turned 24 really. I feel like I'm in a spiral, and I'm not going anywhere with my life...I work in IT, been working in it for about 3+ years now. I'm in a respected position, making 55K a year, working closely with incredibly skilled and awesome individuals every day, and learning new things, but I feel unhappy...and that I'm wasting my time.   


I love IT, I love Ops work, server management, development, network diagnostics, ALL OF IT. This is something I truly feel I love, and enjoy, but, my position has, I feel drained all enthusiasm, and killed any desire I have to even move, or go anywhere...I work in a customer service-esque position, but over the last year was moved into a hybrid of engineering, and customer service (They didn't want to give up ANYONE for CS, and so to prevent me from quitting, they gave me the closest thing to the work I wanted to do, to get me to stay....)  But, even with this ""New position."" I'm still forced to stay in their ques, do the generic grunt work that at this point is a waste of my time, on-top of being forced to take on the work of people who refuse to do much of anything, and would rather pass it off to someone else (I've brought this up, but ""They get their numbers, so it's no big deal."" Despite the fact it's killing me and pissing off our customers....) and just drains me mentally.   


Before I could go home, and continue to learn, and improve. I self taught my self Python, PHP, building and managing Linux Environments, learning how to use various monitoring software, using Vmware, Hyper-V, AWS, and Azure, and understanding how memory, and information can be stored, and recovered in case of an emergency. developing plans and improvements for existing products, and working together with others after to not only improve what's going on, but to jump start my own skills.   


but now? I'm lucky if I have enough energy to even google anything, by the end of the day I'm so mentally drained that I just can't stand the idea of doing anything IT related, that I just turn on a movie, or video games for 2-3 hours and go to bed, just to start all over again...And I don't want this to be my life, I don't want my life to be me, hating what I do, but I feel trapped.  


I used to actually like this company, but after so long I've come to hate it, but at the same time, I feel like me leaving would be like saying ""Fuck you"" to those who tried to assist me...not to mention my own fear of mine of going some where else and failing miserably....I feel like I'm going in circles, I feel trapped, not just at this company, but within my self.

There's a-lot of other little things that I think adds to my stress, but that's just working for a company in general truly.

Any advice is welcome.",02Feb2020,1
93,"Tl;dr my mother is overprotective and took it over the top by grounding me for walking 5 minutes to and from a gas station close to my house because i didnt want to ask her cuz she always says no



My mother is very overprotective to me (15M) and my brother (12). She rarely lets us do anything where she isn't 100% filled on everything we are planning like hanging out or going to parties. If i want to see a friend she needs to know everything about them instead of just trusting my judgement in friends. This also applies to the little things like walking down a mildly busy street on the sidewalk (which i will talk about later). Now I could understand this if i was a troublemaker or something like that, but im not. I do great in school and have never received any detentions or punishments for doing anything bad and have all my grades over 95. I am also very cautious about getting hurt when doing something where i could get hurt. But the thing that brought me here to ask for advice is what goes over the top. I live about 500 ft from a gas station that is just down a very mildly busy road. I am not allowed to go walk down there even though it takes 2 minutes and i cross the street at a school zone to get to it so there really isn't a danger. Sometimes my cousin who is the same age as me goes down because he lives with my grandmother and she is much less overprotective. He usually gets snacks and sometimes i send him with my money to get something for me. But everytime i ask i get shut down even though i always pay attention to my surrondings to be safe when i walk on any street (which i only can do with my mother). I decided that today im just gonna not be secluded in my house becuz my mom wants me to be safe so i went without asking along with my cousin. Took like 5 minutes to go and get our stuff and come back. I was very cautious and no drivers came close to me. Then apparently my mom got home when i was out for that short time so she caught me and then grounded me. I was trying to say how it was safe and i wasnt doing anything dumb but she just says that she doesnt care and ppl are drunk (we live in a good neighborhood) and will hit me. I got real mad after that so i went and looked at about 6 articles about helicipter parenting and why it is bad and sent hera couple. I also went to see the positive affects and they weren't many that i actually had. This one about negative effects https://wehavekids.com/parenting/Children-of-Overprotective-Parents-Are-Slated-For-Failure is very truet to me and i show many of the effects listed.

99,"Hey all. I am in need of some advice on many levels, an I am helping someone can help me or point me in the right direct(s). So, in the interests of keeping myself as anonymous as possible I've created this alt account and also am going to try to trim down my story as much as possible, so some things may be a little vague or slightly altered (but can elaborate if absolutely necessary). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I am a person in my late 20's that feels like they are living in some sort of *Series of Unfortunate Events*\-esque life. I was born into a very unhappy, impoverished home. My father had/has a substance abuse problem amongst other things, and I have not been in touch for several years. Mother is just not fit to be a mom. Lots of abuse, instability and problems. Moved many times because often evicted, etc. Very little immediate family nearby, and the ones that were did nothing to help despite clear evidence of abuse and neglect and often made derogatory remarks towards me as a child to ""stop being a spoiled brat"" etc. when I outcried to them about issues at home. (Relevant later on). Family services involved at points but ultimately useless and things never change.

**Teens/Early 20's:** Once I was older, I definitely was able to take control over the situation more and eventually bio-dad was kicked out. Things got better and down the road mom meets new guy. He's nice, things are good, much later on we move in with him. He's the only good guy in my life story. He helps fix many things, everything getting better, mom does a total 180 etc. I try to go on with my life and get away from rest of shitty family and go to college. Stepdad (not remarried but call him that) becomes seriously ill. I have to take leave from college to come back and help. He later passes away. Everything is screwed.

**Currently:** So my situation right now is complicated. I left college a few years ago to come back to help and wasn't expecting his prolonged illness to happen like that, and certainly not for him to pass away. I was expecting to take a semester off or at MOST a year. It's now been several. Because mom hadn't remarried yet (huge mess w/bio dad), she was not entitled to pension and usual spouses benefits. So financially, things are very bad. My family is also extremely awful to me. I am unsure where to start, so I will address my main points below. 

1. Financial abuse(?) by family. Because of all the things that have gone on throughout my life, I have constantly bailed my mom out. This has included prior to turning 18, taking me to the bank to cash out college money distant relatives had set up for me, savings bonds etc and signing them over to her. She also has repeatedly opened up multiple accounts like credit cards, utilities, and even put leases and deeds in my name due to her credit record. I've given her tens of thousands and currently pay most of her expenses which is almost my entire income, I had to actually forfeit my apartment to come home and pay for her because I could not afford both. I asked my family for help and they basically told me I was ungrateful and said a lot of really mean things about how I don't love my mom. I feel like I am being extorted and manipulated because they make me give over easily 80-90% of all my money I've ever had but will occasionally ""loan"" or ""gift"" me back $50-$100 and then they tell me how lazy and unappreciative I am.
2. All of this has obviously made it really hard to have normal relationships... even just for friends. But currently my significant other is a pretty decent person and I feel like I'd really like to be with them, but we are really butting heads over all of this. I feel like they aren't there for me as much as I'd like and I get upset, but then I've also been realizing this probably is a lot for most people to be thrown into. So, unsure how to proceed. My past romantic relationships were not good to say the least, and my last one was particularly toxic. That's an issue for another time.
3. Overall just manipulation, gaslighting(?) and mistreatment by my family. I feel like they are very controlling over me. I have very low self esteem and more and more I'm realizing they've been breaking me down over many years and I feel like I only exist to be a slave to them. They are always quite harsh about everything from my appearance (wow you look like you've gotten pretty fat lately) to name calling and tons of other things. I feel like this systematically has worn me down and made me not realize none of what I deal with is normal. They have a GPS on my phone ""for my safety"", get angry if I don't allow them on my social media but then leave derogatory comments on my pages or message me to say nasty things... it's all pretty insane. They also withhold/steal my mail/vital documents making it difficult for me to keep my life in order.

Basically, I am making trying to make a game plan to get away from them, but I fear retaliation. They have threatened retaliation mainly in the form of destroying all my belongings that are stored at my parents (which was fine when stepdad was alive, he would have never let that happen), public embarrassment, and/or harming/getting rid of my pets. I have not been able to find a place to live where I can take them because obviously they take all my money so how can I! I don't know what to do, or how to get started.

With being generally liked for being relatable to others, I feel like I cannot be myself or say my opinions on certain things.

I often feel very shy, reclusive, and I find it incredibly hard to start conversations when I’m alone. I used to use games, music, and videos as social coping, focusing on the words as if they were directed towards only me, but recently the effectiveness of those mechanisms have dwindled and I’m starting to feel intense emotions of loneliness and anxiety.

I never feel like I truly fit in. I CAN fit in but I don’t feel like the real me has a spot among anyone.

107,"I hope this is a good place to ask. If anyone has dealt with insomnia and has any tips and tricks it would be greatly appreciated! So First off, I’m a 24 yr female. I was diagnosed 2 years ago(although I went years without an actual diagnosis) with severe depression and anxiety. It’s usually never caused this sort of thing before so I’m unsure if it’s what’s causing my insomnia this time. Now it used to be, I couldn’t fall asleep, but when I did I slept for a good amount of time. Enough for me to do everything I needed when I woke up. However now, falling asleep is only an issue part of the time, and staying asleep is definitely a problem. I can’t seem to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. I’ve been going to bed between 10pm-midnight. Wake up every couple hours until 2-4 (it’s different every night). Usually around the 2-4am Mark is when I can’t fall back asleep. I try to just lay there, not look at my phone, anything to just fall back asleep. It hasn’t worked. So I usually get up after an hour of not working to try and do something. What was meant to only be awake for an hour or two ended up being until between noon and 2pm where I usually get so tired I fall asleep. Then I wake up around 6pm. It’s gotten to the point where no matter what, when I’m awake, I’m tired, my head hurts, my eyes hurt. I just want to sleep lol. Now this all started this past Tuesday I’d say. Monday... something major happened in my life. Which really kicked in the anxiety/depression. I would love to go see a doctor but I don’t have a job, and I don’t have money. I’m barely getting by as it is, much less with more medical bills and prescription costs. If it keeps up or gets worse, then maybe I’ll go but right now I just want to try and fix it on my own.

115,"I (17F) have to live with my abusive father (56M) for at most 7-8 more months before I can leave for college. He is mainly emotionally and mentally abusive, but can be physically abusive, which I'm most worried about because he is a huge man and I'm a stick compared to him. Tonight I tried to use the printer and we got in a shoving match and my mother (42F) and my brother (14M) had to physically prevent him from lunging at me after I called him various expletives. During the next 7-8 months there will be multiple instances in which I will be alone with him while my mother is at work. I haven't talked ten words to my dad after he hit my brother in the face about 3 weeks ago.

116,"I feel like it might be pointless posting this because from an outside perspective it doesn't seem like there's much I can do, but I figured I should try anyways. I was on omegle a couple weeks ago and I started messaging this guy who is around my age (16). The conversation was very random and lighthearted at first, but then he started asking questions about relationships with big age gaps. He asked if it was okay that he liked older women and then vice versa. Of course I said no the the latter, which he seemed a little disheartened by. I asked why he was asking about it, and he told me that he had a crush on his mom and wanted to be in a relationship with her (bare with me, I know it sounds like a troll at first). I thought it was a joke, so I just said ""well don't fuck ur mom lol"" and he said ""well obviously I'm not going to, but she touches me so much and I kind of like it"". I asked how she touches him and he said that she takes baths with him and helps him clean his foreskin and kisses it when she's done (yikes). He continued to tell me other things like how she makes out with him sometimes and how she flashes him and ""accidentally"" walks in on him while he's changing. There were many other things that I cannot remember right now, but it just kept getting more and more clear that she was abusing him and manipulating him into thinking he should like it. While it definitely seemed like it was a troll at first, the more he talked about it the more I realized that it was something serious that was actually really negatively affecting him, and as a csa survivor myself, I feel obligated to help.

117,"Whoever is reading this I thank you for your time.

I moved states a couple years ago due to financial issues and was just kinda dragged around when I was an older teen (16-17 years) and didn’t have a choice. I finished my senior year in High school in the new state and made a couple new friends. Well, “friends” that leave me on read all the time especially when I simply want to hangout.

Constantly being around my family is driving me crazy especially since they don’t support me at all unless I let them control me and what I do in the future for the rest of my life. They’ve hurt me and said things that cannot be taken back. I feel...Nothing towards them. I don’t hate them but I don’t love them either I just feel nothing. I’m surprised I feel that way despite them screaming and telling me in my face I’m a disappointment and how I’m ruining my life. 

Lately I got a job at retail and everyone seems friendly , easygoing, understanding and patient. Silly me thought that’s who they are until I gave a couple of them my number/social media only to find it discarded in the trash or “lost” without an attempt to get it back. I don’t mind a simple “no thank you.” Or “sorry I don’t know you well enough.” Would’ve been perfectly fine.

I’ve tried opening up again and that’s how it went down. I shouldn’t be hurt by it and just move on but I’ve been feeling alone and unwanted for about 2 years now and it’s getting to me. I don’t want to look or sound desperate but I really don’t know how to handle this properly. It’s even gotten to a point where I feel so unwanted I want to inflict self harm. But I won’t do it I’ve seen what it does to people and it’s an endless cycle that’s really difficult to break out of.

My question is how to I cope with it in a healthy way? I don’t have the money to see a professional. At least not yet. But what can I do until then?",02Feb2020,1

I just found out that my best friend (of the opposite gender) likes me. Our friendship is kind of weird. We cuddle and hold hands, and kiss each other on the cheeks. But he has a girlfriend, however this is a high school (9th grade) girl friend.

I love him, and I like him so much as a friend that I don't know if I like him as more than a friend to. I'm scared that if I'll say I don't like him, I'll late find out that I do, and not be able to date him. But I'm also scared that if I say I like him and date him, I'll later realize that I don't like him.

I want to stay as close of friends with him, though I know that this won't be possible unless we date.

And then on top of all of that, we go back to the fact that he has a girlfriend. He has expressed in the (recent) past that he doesn't like her anymore and wants to break up with her, but doesn't know how.

There is so much to consider, I also know that if we do date, our other friends will be assholes about it and make fun of us. But also, I've always wanted a boyfriend.

119,So a friend of mine just moved into a new place and I went over to his house to drop off his DVD and he asked me if I wanted to come in and see his new place. I said okay and I started walking but he didn't shovel his driveway and I was wearing flip flops so when he couldn't see me I ran back to my car and left quickly. He texted me asking where I went and I didn't reply. What would you think?,02Feb2020,1
120,"I'm 30 and had some medical issues come up. I've been on and off disabled for most of my life. I currently can't work or really function. I currently live at my parents beach home with my BF. We can only afford 500 a month in rent which BF pays to my dad monthly. They also have another tenant. My dad is also disabled for different reasons and my mom is unemployed. My mom started seeing a violent pedophile and cheating on my dad. This all came out after I moved in. It's been almost 2 years of dealing with this guy, who is now back in prison. 

I discovered texts between my mom and the pedo where she complains about me and he promises her to beat the gay out of me and other really violent things. He is now in prison threatening me because he thinks I'm somehow to blame for him being in jail again. (He skipped bail and ditched parole).

My mom has, beyond starting the whole mess and bringing me into it, bought the pedo several cars in her name including the one he skipped town in, wired him money into another state after he fled, and is now sending him money in prison and getting his mail at the house. 

I really tried to help my dad. He is legally blind. I would tell him that my BF and I were here and if he wanted to seperate the bank accounts and stuff we would help him. At the beginning I tried REALLY hard to be as supportive as possible. He told me not to blow up and start ""drama"" and try to patch things up with my mom. For example we ended up spending over a hundred dollars on our credit card to make sure she had a good mothers day because according to my dad she is ""going through stuff"" just to find out she was telling everyone she knew that we treated her like garbage and ignored her all day.

After finding out the pedo was threatening me from jail, I was beyond upset. I tried to talk to dad. It got heated. Waited a few days and really tried to reach him about how it's been effecting me and I'm scared for my life and that continuing to enable mom no matter what he says, shows that he cares about moms comfort more than my actual life. He said I was controlling and he WAS going to maybe do something, but of course not now that I confronted him. That, and I don't know WHAT he has done to ensure my protection and that keeping them close and ""monitoring"" them allows him to know what they're scheming. 

For some clarity my mom is an idiot. Shes a bad liar and also most likely an actual sociopath. She has no empathy at all and reacts like an alien pretending to be human and has my whole life. 

Dad doesn't have money for food because mom overdraws the bank account every single month so I've been using my food stamps to help him out. Mom stopped paying the mortgage for awhile to fund her extravagant life of MLMs and Landmark Education, and paying her personal hair stylist 300$ for haircuts and now sending her pedo BF money in jail. She even sold family heirlooms to send him money.

Dad refuses to do anything about the money because he hopes he can get his wife back and work on their 35yr old marriage. He is getting worse health wise and wants her to step up and do the finances and take care of everything. She has only ruined his credit and put the house in a HUGE amount of debt. This is also the third time shes had an affair and one was with his best friend after I was born. I'm worried he is going to lose the house and I honestly I don't feel safe anymore. I understand things aren't easy for him, but this has gone on for a very long time and I know the only answer is to leave. We just don't have anywhere to go or the means to really do it. We struggled with being homeless and living in BFs car before we moved in because it wasn't a good atmosphere before the affair was revealed and now dad relies on our money to pay for his health insurance. 

I honestly thought he just didn't know all this was effecting me because his mindset has been ""it's my marriage so it only effects me"" but he said he had always known how it effects me and that makes it  worse tbh. He says he cares about me and our family (sister and her child) and I do still love my dad and wish we could work things out, but he has made it very clear that he doesn't care how it effects me or my life and it breaks my heart. I'm having a very hard time with all of this and welcome any comments or advice or help because I don't know what to do...",02Feb2020,1

126,"Throughout my life I have always been the “soccer kid,” and I played soccer from elementary school through middle school and highschool, finally making the varsity team my sophomore year.  I was always good at the sport (relative to everyone else at my town) and because of this I felt like I would lose my greatness if I quit.  As I went about my soccer career, the list of reasons I want to quit has only grown.

The first thing that prompted me to want to leave is that the girls on the team are unfriendly.  This sounds shallow, but it’s the plain truth: they are the “popular” girls at school, and tend to gossip about others and exclude.  I feel that I don’t fit in, as I am less popular and have different friends.  Another reason I want to quit is because I lost interest in the sport.  I feel less passionate, confident and skillful when playing soccer, and I dread all of the practices and games.  The team itself is also very bad: we rarely work on physical fitness during practices, the girls come to practices and games hung over, and we lose more than half of our games.

My main motivation to quit is because I have found another, more positive sport in my life: running and track.  I like all of my teammates in track, because I have more friends, and everyone is nice and inclusive.  Moreover, the team is very hardworking, in contrast to the soccer team, and our practices are always physically demanding.  Track is also about personal performance, so I can do my best without feeling like a burden to my teammates (or without feeling disappointed if they are not working hard).

I plan to quit soccer and pursue cross country my senior year, the only things holding me back are: the amount of effort I have put into soccer throughout my life, the expectations of those around me to play soccer, and the effects it may have on my resume (as I would not be sticking with something for 4 years).

TLDR; I have found that I no longer enjoy soccer as much as I used to.  Should I quit soccer and pursue cross country?",02Feb2020,1

129,"So I (18F) am working my absolute ass off to get into my dream university. I’m taking online classes cuz I’m super behind from concussions that my parents gave me 2 years ago and then again 6 months ago. I didn’t leave them cuz I do truly love them even tho they are insane. Yesterday I put in 10 hours straight of work on the world most amazing paper I’ve ever written. My average in the course is a 98 but because it was my final paper it was worth most my grade. My mother (50F) forces me to read it out to my father (60M). And that’s when shit broke for me.

So I read the paper to my dad whom ignores me and watches videos with the volume up while I’m reading. Then after my mom asks him to comment and tells me that I’m incompetent and then proceeded to lecture me telling me all the things I should have had in my paper. Which BTW were already there and backed up by sources. I get angry and I know this doesn’t seem like a big deal but it took me YEARS to be able to construct a coherent paragraph after the major concussions he gave me none the less an amazing 5 page paper. I submit my assignment and forget to write a reflection. Then I backhandedly write one and submit it. When I got my grade back the essay was perfect but the reflection was incomplete which dropped my entire grade by 8 percent.

136,"Hello, first off I’m going to apologize for formatting as I’m a mobile user, not super experienced when it comes to Reddit, etc etc. This got kind of long and vent-y, so I guess my title is the tldr?

I’m a guy in college. I’ve got autism and a past of harassment/abuse, so my confidence and “natural social skills” are almost non-existent. Growing up, I never really had many friends, and I’ve never had any long-lasting friendships (one in elementary was so short that I was only friends with a girl for a day at a time with a payment of goldfish because I was so desperate).
When I was growing up, I was harassed daily, though my memory isn’t the best as it started in kindergarten and since it was all I ever knew, I didn’t even realize it was bullying. I was labeled the annoying kid and kind of just accepted it and ran with it, so I guess it was true since I had undiagnosed autism and ADHD. Because of that, the only friends I had growing up were pity friends/acquaintances. When my parents moved when I was going into 5th grade, I was shocked because nobody was harassing me like they had been at my old school, so I did my best to erase my personality/interests in the hopes that I wouldn’t be bullied/I wouldn’t stick out anymore. And that worked mostly I guess. That’s when my self-isolation really kicked off.

Middle school is kind of a blur to me, I hardly remember anything but I do get kind-of nightmares about being there now and again, so it probably wasn’t all that great. I started hanging out with the “reject” crowd then, and I continued to hang out with the bottom of the barrel in highschool because I thought that they were the only ones who wouldn’t care about my annoying-ness. One of the guys that I almost hung out with after school was a huge asshole pervert, but I guess he’s better now, he’s got a job in welding so that’s cool. (I guess I forgot to mention that I rarely hung out with anyone outside of school- which wasn’t so bad for me, I’ve always been able to entertain myself). In like my senior year, I got into a really toxic / mentally abusive relationship, which fucked me up really fucking badly (I had been starting to get better through therapy and being put on medication), and I was thrown back to square one. I’m still in therapy and still medicated, though I’m still really struggling.

Since then, I haven’t been able to keep up a friendship for more than a semester or two. I’m still living with my mom (my parents got divorced this summer), and I don’t have a job yet as she has let me focus on my education, though I’ll be getting one as I take a break from college when I get my associates degree come this spring. 

I’ve got two gals that I hung out with last semester and got close with, but this semester I don’t have any classes with either of them and we haven’t yet really hung out much outside of class, so we’ve just been occasionally texting. I really don’t want to lose these friends, but I don’t know how to really do that, and I struggle with trusting them in fear of them turning out like my abusive ex.

138,"**tl;dr I feel like a huge hypocrite because I judge people for being anxious, negative or angry, and I feel like I have asymmetrical relationships. I don't know how to deal with it.**

I'd like some help sorting out my feelings and figuring out what to do, if someone's willing to go through my wall of text. I hope this is the right sub. If there even is one.

I have a friend. Let's call him A. He has his quirks. I don't know if it's relevant, but he has Asperger's syndrome.

One major point about him is that he's a very anxious person. I've known him for years, and it's only recently that he's stopped regularly having talks with me (or rather talking *at me*), in a process where he just repeats and wallows in negative things and refutes (or asks me to argue at length about) any advice I might try to give him.

Since then, he's started taking some medications that seem to help, and I'm glad. But back when he was doing it, there were periods where I was often just thinking that I was *tolerating* him as a friend and one of those days I'd cut him off. I never did though.

I've had several such friendships in my life. Relationships where I felt like the other's therapist more than my friend, and more often than not I was acting like one whole secretly judging them. Feeling good about helping them, yet feeling superior with all my wisdom. What's up with That? Why do I seem to attract people with lots of problems? Why do I feel this way? I feel like an asshole posing as a saint.

I know anxiety is absolutely not a person's fault, but I'm not an anxious person, and I can't quite grasp why, but it irks me very badly. Any time a person exhibits anxiety for something I don't feel should be stressful, inside my head I roll my eyes. Honestly, I hate this reaction more than I hate the anxiety. I feel really guilty about it, and those two feelings intertwine into a very unpleasant mess inside, and sometimes I worry it will (or already has) become apparent. And even if it doesn't, doesn't that make me a huge hypocrite?

Another thing about him, that I silently judge him about but shouldn't, is conversation topics. Roughly speaking, it feels like a third of the time he talks at length about things I'm absolutely not interested in (either at all or definitely not enough to warrant such a long discussion). So far, it seems this is a classic for people on the spectrum, and while I get slightly annoyed, I don't think I internally judge him too harshly about this. I love to learn in general after all. 

But it's compounded by the other third of the time where he talks about negative things. He may be taking behind his boss's back, complaining about his girlfriend, or telling me all about the bad life choices someone made.

All in all, it means I don't enjoy talking to him most of the time, and sometimes I actually want to avoid conversation with him. Even though he's one of my best friends!

He also has some peculiar ways of doing things. And I'm the kind of person who can't help but want to do things the right way. Sometimes it's true what he does is objectively potentially a bother for others, it a breach to the rules. Sometimes it's not, and it achieves the same result. His wrong and ""wrong"" ways of doing things often make me want to correct him. But like, I'm not his parent, am I?

So I'm stuck between feeling like I'm burdened with ""raising"" an adult, and the feeling that I shouldn't even try to correct him since he's an adult! 

And I know it's useless, too. He hates authority. He wants to do things his own way. That's very different from me. I always want to know the one best way to act, and I'm really thankful whenever someone will help me improve.

He's such a nice person in many ways, but I sometimes hope one event or another will separate us, because of all the psychological pain I seem to always subject myself to around him. I don't even know I'm supposed to feel, but I feel really guilty about the way I feel a lot of the time, and it's stressful.

And whenever I talk about him in particular, to other people, it's like it's always something negative. 

Another element is anger. I don't like it. I know it's supposed to be a healthy emotion, but it's like it's against my values, whatever that even means. Whenever someone gets angry, my esteem of them drops. It's like deep down I think they shouldn't be allowed to bother others with their lowly rage. Isn't it unfair that only that one emotion would be unacceptable?

So whenever someone gets angry, I kind of get disgusted by them, and then by myself, because what kind of Pope do I think I am to be morally admonishing people?

These internal judgements and conflicts are probably not healthy. Hell, I've been talking with a potential love interest, and I'm considering not meeting him just because I don't ""feel it"" since I've seen he's anxious (i fear I'll be stuck as someone's therapist again) and capable of anger.

They're all inside, but maybe they get out a bit without my knowledge. It might explain why I don't have many friends.",02Feb2020,1

Anna seems to have came from a bit of a rough past, she's very nice but also very tough love, no fucking around type of lady. When I first started training under her, she was really hard on me but I stuck it out because it's just her personality. 

Well on Friday, she had told me that she was just approved to buy a gun. I'm not really into guns, as they scare the shit out of me. I told her congratulations. She then mentions she's gonna call our manager and see if she can carry it on her at work. I already knew that we have a policy for no weapons, but I just kept quiet and nodded. Anna then said that even if they said no she'd still keep it in her drawer. Honestly I don't know if she really meant that, because she likes to seem like a bad ass but she also really likes her job so Im not sure if she would ruin that.

I work for the federal government and I make about 80-90K a year but with my new raise I’m in the 100K as of 2020, give or take the overtime. Now my current commute to my work from home is about 40 minutes. I’m getting married soon and looking to move to a new town for my husband to be close to the military base. I’ve researched and researched the closest apartments I could in a affordable range and my commute would then turn to 1Hr and 7 Minutes say traffic ISNT terrible. It’s all highway pretty much, as I drive that now. So, in turn, what do you think? I’ve lived in the same old city for all my life and the thought of a new life with my husband in a new city seems exciting. I’ve paid all my debt so worrying about extra money say a car issue happens is no concern, as well as my car is 2018 on the newer side, better not have any issues (eye roll).

Yesterday, my boyfriend and I were supposed to go on a date. I bused to his house, and he met me at the bus stop with his friend. I was taken aback, but I thought that his friend would leave soon and then we would go out. Cut to later on, it was almost 2 hours later, he was still hanging out with his friend. Smoking weed and listening to music. When his friend left eventually I got excited but then when I looked at my bf my heart sunk. He was greened out. We went to lay down, and it took me a while to find my courage and voice so I asked, “I thought you wanted to go on a date?” Which he kinda ignored or didn’t hear me. When he sobered up while walking me to the bus stop, he asked me what was wrong. I told him I was upset, he like called himself a piece of shit, a fuck up, and all of that. So i ended up having to comfort him. He only stopped putting himself down when I told him that it wasn’t his fault and that I wasn’t upset anymore. On the way home, my phone died, he texted me 23 times making sure I wasn’t leaving him, and making promises, then blaming me. I feel like a I did something wrong. What could’ve I done better? What should I have done? What would you do?",02Feb2020,1

   So I’m thinking about giving into my stalker. I was dumped before Christmas by my bf of 10 years. My roommates are assholes, my friends tell me they want to hangout but nothing happens. I went on tinder cause I was alone...and confused. I thought I can causally hookup with a guy and maybe stay friends since we operate in the same field. Well I thought our second date went terrible at his house...I felt confused and went home before anything else happened besides playing video games. I didn’t text him after but didn’t block him, I did delete tinder.  He showed up across the street from my my bus stop home. Luckily at the time I was learning my route and took the wrongish bus. He followed for a bit. He was a bit bulky, but I didn’t mind. I had a few encounters with him. The police can’t do much without more documentation. I’m falling apart here. My ex has my stuff still and I’m waiting for therapy to start this week and my roommates are shitty for smoking on a no smoking lease. They have their boyfriends over so often it’s bringing the utility bill up . I’m pretty sure they’re tampering with my stuff now...Idk what to do...

150,"So, long story short. I'm married. For about 3 years. The relationship I'm in started off weird. We dated after a one night stand ended in a pregnancy.  5 years later we got married. Now here we are. We fell into a rut, things weren't the same. There was barely any communication, no romance, barely any sex. It wasn't great. I was on a yearly ""talk"" about how I wasn't happy and thing needed to change. 

Well, I had this ""talk"" again for the 7that time and had enough. I got close with a coworker and a small relationship started. Nothing serious, we hung out a few times. We had sex 3 times.  I told my husband I wanted to separate. We did. I ended up sleeping in a different room because we couldn't afford a different home.

During this time the friend was having his own issues. He was married but was about 5 years into wanting to leave to a 10 year marriage. I feel we met at a time where we both were miserable. 

After I talked to my husband things started to improve. He gave me the attention I was looking for. I finally felt like I was in a marriage.  During this time time, I had this talk with my husband,  separating and everything,  started school, for a better career, and left the job I hated (that friend and I worked at together)

Things improved on my side. My husband was better I didn't hate my job, everything was co m.j omg together.  I mentioned for a second time, to my friend that I wanted thing to go to a friendship level. I respected that my husband was trying and wanted to put in the same effort. After a while he told me we needed to stop talking so we could get on the same friendship level. 

He told me he felt it was my fault he was pulling away from his wife. He didn't thinks we could be just friend talking. He stated he didn't think he could be happy with his wife,  if I was an  option. We stopped talking. 

That was a week ago.  I'm at the point where I am deleting him off all social media and blocking him. I feel if I'm the issue with his marriage, I should make sure nothing starts back up. 

Am I making the right choice? If there a chance for us to be friend...or am I right making the choice to cut everything?",02Feb2020,1

Not only because her name starts with a b 
It’s also that I just realized how much of a bitch she is.(b is 26 and is currently going to college)
Look my sister have bought me things shoes games snacks she even let use her old iPhone 6s Plus when I was going into high school
But she knows what she was doing I had an old 
Slow lg so this was a massive upgrade and it ran faster the display was bigger and nicer the sound was great but when I got attached i was trapped.now I had the phone for a few months

 My phone if I was playing on my ps4 and in a party chat talking with my friends she would she would go to the kitchen which is close to the living room where I am and do her “homework” 
Aka be on her phone and whenever I got to loud she would be I like “hey I’m trying to do my homework stop being loud” even when I’m talking at (not yelling) she would be like hush or I’m taking my phone.i managed to make it through freshman year without her taking my phon...I ment her phone.i got through half the summer with it until one day me and my mom got into an argument and b jumps in and is like just shut up and what sucks is I couldn’t say anything back because she could take away her phone.so I said “no ones talking to you” with an attitude because I was pissed and she was like “you know what put my phone on my bed” I didn’t by the way and I sat on the couch and she came to me took the phone from my hand for the rest of the summer and I was Furious 
Not only because she took it she played me what ever she wanted I had to do it she played me I was a puppet to her so towards the end of the summer my dad said he would by me a phone. A iPhone 7 and when my sister heard of this she tried to convince to take her phone the 6s plus back because it was bigger. But I knew exactly what she was doing she wanted me to be a puppet again so I declined the offer and stuck with the seven.

I (21 F) and my husband (23 M) have been married for around a year now, and dating each other since late 2017. I just want everyone to know that my husband's mom (my mother in law) is big on spirituality. She believes that she is from native American shaman background despite the fact that she is clearly caucasian. Anyways, she does massage therapy and says that she believes that through her massage therapy she can actually hear the spirits and thoughts of her clients. She also runs a weird business of doing home cleansings for 'evil spirits' charging people upwards of $100 dollars to burn sage around their home and walk from room to room essentially talking to herself. My husband has also been working on his own ghost hunting website claiming himself able to do essentially the same sorts of things and saying that I will soon have this ability as well and people can get appointments with me. 

Here is where the conflict happens. I do not want to take part in his ghost hunting business. I have never hunted for ghosts before and frankly I do not believe such a thing even exists. My husband says that I am not contributing to the 'family business' and his mother wants to teach me how to hunt for ghosts. I don't know what to make of this. Should I be trying to learn these traditions since I am his wife and technically I am part of his family now? I am also a bit offended by the fact that he said that I will be learning to hunt for ghosts on his website despite the fact that he has not given me a chance to decide for myself whether or not I'd like to learn how to do this.

154,"The restaurant I’ve worked at for 2 years has been receiving calls from a blocked number for years, even before I came. This caller will say perverted things to whoever picks up the phone. He will ask the person to help him play a prank of one of his family members. He will the describe the prank, which is usually sexual, and say he is currently jacking off. He asks sexual questions like if you’ve given head or had sex. He describes the porn he’s watching. And describes why he is pranking his family member; the latest reason was he caught his 13 year old sister giving head to the adult neighbor. 

Just recently, the guy has been calling and asking if he could talk to me, asking for me by name. He’s also been saying he’s watching me in my driveway with my friend and that he’ll hand over the phone to me to prove to the person who picked up at the restaurant that he’s actually watching me. He also said that he’s my uncle and this is a “game” we like to play. This obviously has creeped me out and I’m afraid of it escalating. I’m not too confused as to why he knows my name, because my coworkers have screamed it out before to get my attention and I have given it to customers who’ve asked. I’m assuming this guy has come into the restaurant before and that’s how he knows. I’m afraid he knows more identifying information about me. My car is pretty recognizable and I’m one of the few people who drive to work. (A lot of my coworkers don’t have cars).

156,"Hello guys, 

I have a situation which I want to talk about this have made me very depressed this semester.... but I am debating whether I am right or wrong in this situation. 
So two things, first is that last semester I was in a very HORRIBLE relationship, I am talking he was manipulating me, gaslighting me, was horrible to me, and also cheated on me. But during our relationship he would always talk about this Brazilian girl who he dated for a little time before me and how much he hated her. He would always compare me to her, and always find a way to bring her up. And it wasn’t like he never got over her, it was more like he wanted to get a revenge from her because she ended up telling him she wasn’t into him. But he would ALWAYS bring her up, even when I was literally doing intimate stuff with him. So I got very sensitive every time I heard her name or she popped up on my Instagram or something. Because in terms of personality we seem pretty similar and I endEd up becoming super sensitive about her event after the breakup. 

Anyways I really tried to forget that and stopped following her and really just let it go for 2020. BUT also to mention I am pretty close to 5 girls and we are best friends for almost 3 years and they know about  how my ex always compared me to this Brazilian girl. Well well well I found out one of my friends interned with that girl and they are literally best friends. And two days ago my closest friend in the whole world went to a pain night with that Brazilian girl and my two other best friends were there. I don’t know what to think anymore. I started crying because I really tried to forget my ex and her and everything else but starting this semester this Brazilian girl went from someone my ex talked about to being part of my friend group out of nowhere. And what bothers me is 2 of the girls in my friend group know how sensitive I got but still hung out with her..

Am i going crazy or do I have a right to be mad in this situation? Should I just avoid my friends? or should I just fake smile and act like there is nothing wrong? 

Any answer helps :) 
Thanks you!",02Feb2020,1

165,"So, for almost a year now, I was going through a tough time in my life and one of my professors noticed. He asked me to stay after class one day and asked me some questions and me being diagnosed with severe anxiety, everything about my life came out about the abuse I sustained from my mother and about not knowing my father and how I was getting to know his family now and that my mother was not happy I was talking to his family, and I was afraid of her, she almost killed me a few times while I was growing up. He told me that if I needed to talk about things, he would be there to listen.

Well, fast forward to a few months later and I get the news that my mother was planning on moving back in with my grandmother and I (I live with her to help take care of her and to save money from renting an apartment, plus, my college doesn't have dorms since it's a community college). The stress and memories of what I dealt with were coming back and were causing me problems. I was debating on talking with my teacher or not, but he did tell me I could talk to him if I need to, so I did. I told him that I was scared of her because of what she did to me. I said I was really thinking about just disappearing and starting my life over, he told me not to do that and he would find some help.

He emailed me the next day and told me his dean directed him to this one councilor who worked at the college. Well, I went to her and she tells me that she can not officially help me because I was not apart of their program she was with, but she directed me to an outside source. They have been wonderful so far.

Well, my mother has been coming home once a month to bring her stuff here a little at a time, but every time she's here, she argues with both me and my grandmother and upsets her (which is one reason I think she had her second heart attack since it happened not long after my mother left.) Anyways, my grades and mood would start dropping during and after each visit, and my professor apparently went to see this dean to tell him that he thought I was going to commit suicide. It was also after this meeting (which I didn't know about at the time) I found out that a security report was filed against me. I wasn't supposed to find out about the report and the guard who told me was fired. 

The dean called me into a meeting with him and my professor, and this was the first time I met him. In this meeting, this dean told me that all my relationships with students and professors have been inappropriate ever since I started and because I was female I had to act differently even though the guys I hung out with acted the same way and it was fine what they did, and then he continues to tell me that the guard was probably going to try and kill me. My professor didn't step in the entire time this dean was saying these things and even said he felt hurt by some things I said about ""his"" teaching to students in another class (it wasn't his teaching I was bashing it was the online program we used because it was inconsistent, the online book had so many mistakes, and the program to turn in homework was always messed up. He didn't build the program, he didn't even have a say in how his class should be built, the college left it up to a board to do and teachers have no say). So, in my mind, I was thinking that he turned that report in against me since they still wouldn't tell me who did, but if he didn't, then why was he in this meeting? So, I felt hurt by this and was convinced he did turn me in to security, but I was confused because why would he help me if he was going to do something like this?

Later on, I wanted to hurt him so I made comments like how I wanted to stick a bullet in my head or jump off of a cliff and I made sure he was in the room and within earshot to hear. After two weeks of this, I finally snapped at him and asked him why he turned that security report in against me instead of talking to me and he (like all the other professors I asked) denied turning it in. He then told me that he had gone to the dean before the report was filed, telling him that he was afraid I would try and kill myself. It was also during this meeting that he told me when I first went to him for help and they were looking for a counselor for me that he said the dean wanted to know who I was, what the situation I was in, why did I need to talk to someone, and just all these questions. He told me that he told this dean that it was between me and him and if I wanted to tell him about my problem then it was up to me to do so. He said the reason he was in that meeting was that he informed the dean about the fact that I knew about the report filed against me. I felt better about the situation and things went back to normal. 

Just before we went on break, I wrote my professor an apology letter for what I had said in his class and for what I did and let it go. I had also bought whiteboard markers for his class because of my eyes (I had previously had Lasik surgery a few years ago and my eyes are starting to go bad again which I knew would happen and he was using these dried out markers that were hard to see and hurt my eyes and he was taking a long time of getting them replaced so I did it for me.), but I didn't make it on to the next class, (I failed by .1 of a point). Also, during the break, my grandmother had her heart attack, which shortening that story, my mother and my aunt blamed me for her heart attacking saying I should have done more to help, how I'm not doing anything with my life and stressing her, and how I ruin everyone's lives. This made me hate myself even more and think back to the recent events of last semester so I wrote another letter to my professor saying that I was sorry for everything and how I hope to never see him again for his sake and mental health.

This past week, this dean wanted to talk and so I agreed and met up with him and he told me that this professor showed him the letters and, the dean, said I needed to stay away from him and never contact him again. He also contacted a therapist from the other campus, which first I was told we did not have one, second, she drove over an hour to get to this campus, third, I told them I had one, and fourth, he sat in the room with us for an hour while I talked with her (needless to say I left some things out until he left, like how I was molested in high school by one of my uncles which tied into the abuse from my mother because she told me to stay quiet). 

I have not seen this professor and he has not explained anything to me even after I emailed him (before this meeting mind you). I'm confused, I feel betrayed, I'm hurt, I feel like I was to get revenge on him, and I feel like I'm never going to trust another person ever again or allow anyone near me. Am I overreacting? Am I the bitch everyone seems to make me out to be? Should I just disappear and start my life over as I had planned in the beginning? I don't know what to do.",02Feb2020,1

168,"I graduated college in May and moved across the country to start my first post-college job in a city where I don’t know anybody. I’ve always been fairly introverted, but in college I had a bunch of different classes with different people. I joined my school’s LGBTQ+ org and eventually became president. Having the weekly meetings as well as events really helped me to make friends. 

When I was in school I really didn’t go out a lot. Loud music and crowds really drain me, so going to bars or parties just tired me out and I always left early. The only place I could go out consistently was a fairly small gay bar that never got too crowded and had weekly drag shows. I hate dancing, so with the drag shows I just got to sit, enjoy the show, drink, tip, and go home when it was done.

I’ve been making efforts to meet people, especially other queer people, but it hasn’t really stuck. I have a fairly good group of work friends, but we met because of our job and not necessarily common interests. I joined a gay tennis league, but so far everyone has been at least 20 years older than me, and it’s kind of the off-season right now so there won’t be a lot of people playing until the season starts in a few months.

I want to meet people who are going to want to come over and play Mario Party, or board games, or watch Drag Race, but I’m not really going to meet those people by going out to clubs.",02Feb2020,1
169,"I'm 23 and I've been married for two years with my partner who is 26. We've been together since I was 18, we've been living together for 4 years renting a townhouse. We don't want kids. 

He makes about 90k a year. I make 30k a year. We live very happy lives together. Believe me, he does not care about how much money I make and he knew long before he married me that I will never make much more then I do now in my career. 

I decided to not pool our income together. I want his money to be his money and my money to be my money. We split rent and all the bills 50/50, I pay for my own food, ect. 

After all living expenses, I'm able to save $600 a month for whatever I want. Which is more than enough for me. We go out to eat a lot, see movies, travel together every year. I put aside $200 a month for a trip. 

However, our goal is to buy a house in three years. Splitting mortgage we be much more expensive than splitting rent. I'll be 26 by that time and he'll be 29. We'll both be able to put down $15k toward a down payment in three years time, so 30k total. 

We both want a 15 year mortgage on a 230k house. We live in an area where you can get a nice house for that price. Overestimating on what the mortgage will be just in case the market changes, our monthly total price will be $2000 a month, so $1000 split. 

So after calculating all of living expenses, food, car, mortgage, taxes, my 401k, ect, absolutely everything, I'll be able to save $200 a month. $200 to spend on whatever I want. 

Once we pay off the 15 year mortgage, he'll be 44 and I'll be 41. So I'll be able to spend at least $1200 every single month. And once I'm 55 I can get my 401k, and I'll make even more money by then so after all life expenses I'll probably save at least $1500 a month to spend on whatever. 

So when I'm 41 we'll be doing very well. What I'm concerned about, is the 15 years in-between, the ages of 26 to 41. I'll only have a fun stuff budget of $200. 

This means I can't go on a trip every year like I normally do, more like every three years so I can save for other fun things in life too. I'm totally fine with that because it means once I reach the age of 41 we can go on a trip wherever we want. 

Please share your honest opinion. Is only having $200 too little for a fun stuff budget?",02Feb2020,1
170,"This was originally going to he for AITA, but they have a no violence rule, and this does have some physical abuse in it, so if that triggers you, please click off.

My stepfather is one narcissistic, manipulative, lying piece of shit.

Since the beginning, I never liked him, we barely talk, and I mean BARELY, the most we talk when he gets home is me saying ""Hey (his name)"" and he says ""Hey (My name)"".
I have no emotional connection with him, and he doesn't even try to have one with me OR his own son! He feels like a stranger in my own home.

He has no respect for others. I have a breathing problem in my nose where my nostrils are smaller than usual and it gets very hard to me to breath (forgot the name) and he's always smoking around me, like smoking IN THE CAR, while he can hear me wheezing.

He's known to blow things out of proportion, my mom and him are always getting into fights, Once he got mad that she was hanging out with her coworkers/friends who are mostly male since she works at a pretty physical job. But my STEPFATHER has FEMALE FRIENDS he hangs out with, but thats ""different""

He's called her ""crazy"" for thinking that he was cheating with another woman, he manipulated her, making her believe that she was the insane one, and in the end, He WAS cheating on her! And they had a kid a KID!

And I think the most serious of all...he's beaten my mom, I don't know how many times this has happened, but I only know of one incident. I was staying up late, waiting for my mom to come home from a party since it's hard for me to sleep with noone in the house.
My mom finally came home at what I can remember was probably 1am. I smiled at her and asked about her night, but she didn't respond, I noticed her chipped up and broken long nails, one nail was even half off her finger. I asked her about it, and she told me she'd tell me tomorrow.

I mean he had a sad period but we’ve gotten over it. Well, now he’s dating someone and we still have a “special” relationship. I feel wrongly that I’m still attracted to him and he is for me but that’s the chemistry that we both share. I have tried letting him go, but he will not have ANY of that. He would break up with the person first before he loses me and I can’t do that. SO I’m stuck in limbo. I like him (might I say, love him) but I can’t see myself in a relationship. So, when he doesn’t talk to me when he’s with his actual SO, I feel so devastated and lost. Much so that I dreamt about him last night and my mood is sour the past few days because I feel like he is ignoring me. I know this sounds completely crazy, but I don’t know what to do.

I’m not the type of person that typically finds themselves in these scenarios so seeing as how it’s happening you can imagine that I have no idea what to do.

184,"i am 16 (female), and my boyfriend is 17 (we are in the same grade). we don’t go to the same school, but we met through a mutual friend.  we’ve been dating for nearly five months now.
now, i know there’s such a stigma around high school relationships rarely lasting and such, but i’ve never had such confidence in wanting to be with someone for a very long time as i have with him. i don’t want that stigma alone to affect what ends up happening.
but, whenever we haven’t seen each other for a few days or more, we seem to get into more arguments, usually about petty shit, and i grow deeper and deeper into question about whether it’s worth it (which is probably just my anxiety talking). whenever i see him again, everything is fine and back to normal.
here are the recurring issues that have come up throughout our relationship:
1) religion. he’s a very devout baptist, i am catholic, but don’t go to church (an important thing to know throughout all of this, he has lived in the south his whole life, i am from the midwest originally). my parents stopped making me go to church after middle school, after i got confirmed. they don’t go either. it makes no difference to me what other people worship, how they worship, or how often they worship. but it bothers him. he sometimes takes it to levels where it seems like i’m an atheist or a satanist. i’m not. i believe in god, but i have kept myself distant from religion because of fucked up things that have happened to me throughout my life that no one should go through. those things personally make me question some aspects of religion. he doesn’t get that. he’s lived a pretty happy, non-traumatic life, so i understand why he doesn’t get that. but he refuses to make any effort to understand and borderline forces me (tries to, anyway) to go to church with him. that won’t make a difference in what i believe or what i’ve been through.
2) his parents. he doesn’t know they are a problem. they are the typical, conservative, uber religious type that you’ll see in the south. in the few conversations i’ve had with them, they’re very nice people, and i’ve given them nothing but respect. however, me and my mom think they lowkey don’t like me, because of a few incidents. the first being his mom’s sort-of rude comments to my bf about my religion. the second being the TWO times my mom has sent goodies over to his house, and we never got a thank you back. the third being the few times he has been grounded for failing classes, and only grounding him from seeing ME. that’s right, not his friends. i have a 4.5 GPA and constantly tell him to do his homework. i am not the problem. and the fourth being the couple times he has come up with quite strange excuses as to why his parents said no to hanging out, when he was very active in making plans just a half hour before (he will come over to my house any chance he gets, and that sort of thing. he’s not distant). his parents are also quite strict, and about the wrong things. we never go to his house because we would have to be supervised by a parent at all times IN THE SAME ROOM. my mom will leave us home alone for hours, because she trusts us and knows we won’t fuck, at the very least.
3) probably the worst, and most important one. our future. he’s dead set on going into the military. i want to go to college for computer science, move out west, and have a happy, successful life. it’s really not the him going into the military that is a problem (even though my anxiety and paranoia will absolutely go nuts and i’ll drive myself insane), but every other element about our future. he wants to keep his ass parked where we are living right now. i absolutely hate it here. i want to move somewhere where i’ll be paid well in my field, and where we are right now is not it. additionally, i can not stand the people or culture here; i haven’t lived in the midwest for nearly a decade and i would still take that over anything else. he refuses to budge at all (not even to a BORDERING state), despite the fact that i will be the one living in our/my home all of the time while he is gone 3/4 of it. he’s also indirectly bound me to having kids young (anytime i say i don’t want to, it’s basically a “too bad”), wants to keep all kinds of weapons in the house (which i disapprove of, because of my childhood trauma, and independent, but liberal-leaning beliefs, but is probably the one i could deal with out of all of these), and basically anything that would prevent me from living the life i want to live. relationships are about compromise. i get that, and i am willing to give up a few things to be with him. however, i refuse to rewrite my entire dream that i have had for years now because his stubborn ass won’t budge on ANYTHING. not a single little thing. if he doesn’t change his ways, and i stay with him, he’ll be out doing everything he wants to do in life, while i’m sitting alone, in a house in a state where i don’t even want to be, being heavily underpaid, and dealing with my bad anxiety and paranoia on top of that. i don’t want that for myself. i want to be very successful, travel, live in the city, and not settle down for a while. i want to truly enjoy life. he wants the polar opposite. i know it seems far away, but with him only leaving in about a year now, we have to figure this shit out a little earlier.
4) the way he treats me. this is not an abuse situation. it’s more of a “since he has me, he doesn’t act like he has to fight for me” type deal. girls my age get paragraphs, constant compliments, endless love. i get none of that. i did before and shortly after we started dating, but not anymore. i’m lucky if i get an “i love you” twice a day. next
to no compliments. the one time i said something about it, he got mad. i need constant reassurance about things, which is why i get paranoid about it. yet another thing he doesn’t understand.
but i love him despite all of this, that’s the hard part. i don’t think i’m at the point where i’m so attached i could never let him go, but i don’t necessarily want to. i’ve dealt with toxic relationships before but i don’t know if this one really is or not. i feel my friends are somewhat biased because they have heard more good stories than bad. so please, someone give me their honest advice about this. i don’t know what to do.",02Feb2020,1
186,"Long story short, this guy and I previously had a romantic dalliance. I won't get into many details about the situation unless prompted, because there is just too much to state. Anyway. This man and I really liked each other. I cannot describe to you how strong of a connection we had- it was other-worldly, supernatural, electric. Anyway. He had a girlfriend and I didn't know. When I asked him out, he revealed her to me. I was angry and thought he meant it at first so I ignored him for a while. Then I went back to thinking he was making her up, like out of immaturity because he wasn't ready to be with me. So I went back to believing he was single because of how much he flirted with me. He toned it down after the revelation but we still kept it up a bit. And then he pushed me away in a big way when things got too far. Overall though, I'm not upset about his flirting with me while he was taken because we both couldn't control ourselves. His flirting with me heavily as well as some other signs lead me to believe he doesn't love/is unhappy with his girl.

Then I had to move away, so I had to leave him behind without warning. I discovered him on Instagram after opening up an account, and saw that he did actually seem to have a gf. He had pictures with her, but strangely posted only until after I moved away. I followed and liked a few of his photos. Then I commented on one of them, an innocuous happy holidays comment. He almost immediately blocked me after that, because I tried to visit his profile again and it said user not found. He was trying to hide me from his girlfriend/others.

I can't get over this. I used to have dreams and ambitions I was before he did this that I was happily working towards. I had moved on a very good amount, and now I have 0 motivation to get on with my life. I know it sounds pathetic, but I can't help it. It's just a blocking, right? I've tried absolutely everything- exercise, hanging out with friends and family, fun outings. And I do enjoy my life, it's just like it now has this very subtle tinge of unhappiness to it. Nothing is working to bring back my passion and hobbies. 

You could say this guy is worth doing this to yourself, but I truly liked him (albeit I did see his flaws and immaturity in how he was a lot of the time). His blocking me was the final push out of his life. 

My friend told me he never had the guts to approach me or break up with his girlfriend because of his low self-esteem, which is why he pushed me away a few times. I do believe this to be true having seen how he acted, especially round me...but I just can't move on after this. And weirdly enough, just last week, out of all people, I saw his girlfriend on the train to work. I got onto the train and she was sat in the seats directly across from me. It felt so surreal to see her in-person...and she looked so sad...it really gave me a mind-fuck and made me question everything even more. I mean, what are the odds in a city of one million people? I've never run into anyone else I know ever in all my years I've been here. Just a very weird coincidence...

I want to get over his blocking me to achieve my long-term goals specifically, but don't know how.",02Feb2020,1

I also tried to speak to my older brother about it and he says I can stay in his room If I want, but usually kicks me out when he’s playing video games or when his girlfriend comes over, (which is all the time) so I don’t bother going into his room anymore. I try explaining to my parents, and they always swear they will talk to me brother so I can have his room since he is leaving soon, (apparently) but they never do. I asked my mom to talk to him this morning, and she did, telling him that I’m moving in with him. I was overjoyed that he agreed, but soon realized there was not enough room for my belongings and his, not to mention a 15 year old and 18 year old sharing the same room.

190,"So I've pretty much decided to move from NYC to Philly which would greatly reduce my cost of living. The problem is I can't really decide when to move and I feel like the indecision will result in me simply not making the jump. Hence any help will be greatly appreciated.

Anyways, I randomly decided to move April 1 at one point. I can't remember exactly why but I didn't want to put it off for long and I felt like I would have enough savings by then (about $6500). Also the longer the wait the more I feel stuck. Lastly, my birth control shot is in March so I would have the freedom to wait 3 months after that to get my next shot.

Recently I've thought that June 1st would be a good date since it would be exactly 2 years since I've moved in to my first apartment here. I'm currently on a month-to-month not a lease, so this date is really symbolic. And again, I'm worried the longer I push it off the more mentally weary I'll be. The other downside is that I will have to find healthcare at that point and quickly to get my next birth control shot in due time. However, the pros would be that my roommate-- who is actually my sister-- has more time to prepare and I would definitely have more savings.

Understandably because they’re all staying they will keep the furniture but I think I have a right to receive some money back as everything is still in great condition.

196,"Well, this is complicated to explain; English isn't my mother tongue tho. I had been in a 'friends with benefits"" situation with a close friend of mine (a 24 years old girl) for 3 months. We both have a lot of insecurities because our exs weren't nice (we both had depression because it. Me personally, lost two entire years of my life; and I nearly got expelled from my campus). We doubted if we could end as something more than 'friends with benefits', but because our insecurities (in my case, I wasn't really sure of what I wanted) we talked and promised each other that we'd think about it while we continued as we were.  She studies in other city different from where I am, so if we want to see each other, one must pick a train for 2 hours; and January + beggining of February is where our university tests schedule start; so we couldn't see each other in a month. This situation added to my success this year (I finally get good grades, and I feel fullfilled) and that we argued a lot this last month; make me notice something: I want to feel fullfilled with a lot of new things that I was unable to do when I was depressed; and I need peace around me to heal from all my other insecurities that I still have. I won't be able to heal these insecurities if I'm not single, it will be even harder if I keep arguing for silly stuff.

I think that she needs time to heal too, probably, even more than me.

So after an argument we had around 1:00 am (GTM+1), I talked to her and told my decision. I told her that I still consider her like one of my best friends, that didn't change; and that I don't feel hate or resentment towards her. She started trying to convince me, that I was rushing my decision. Then she started making me feel bad: 'I was healed but now I'm hurted again', 'I will leave our group of friends because we both know that we can't work as friends and I will feel pressured', 'I'm always 'the best friend' but never someone truly loves me', 'You will stop talking me in a month', 'You will search a new girl in a few months', etc. She cried and came back, she didn't apologize tho. I still understand her, and I know that it's not fair, but what am I able to do if I feel this way.

I'm hundred per-cent sure that I'm not doing this because I don't feel anything (something that happens, but that's not the main reason). I don't want to flirt, have sex right now or meet a possible GF. I want to enjoy some time with myself. I'm young, and I feel like it's my time to try new things right now that I have the time and the energy, and enjoy: draw, take photos with my Reflex, study some subject not related with my career, go to the gym, find out a new film or hobbie, join a club...

201,"I’ve come from r/amitheasshole, but they directed me here (among other subs).

My girlfriend (23) has suffered from night terrors since she was 7. She’s in therapy and has been since they started, and she says it’s helped loads, but she goes through phases (usually 3-4 days) of extreme night terrors and then sleeps fine for weeks-months before having another phase.

She’s in one now, but it started last Saturday and is still going on. The first few nights I just let her do her thing, but the past few days she’s getting increasingly exhausted. She has no appetite, huge circles under her eyes and she keeps dozing off at random.

I try to coax her into laying down with me but she refuses. I don’t try and push her, but I probably am more than I should, but I just want her to calm down because the more tired she gets the more frantic she becomes. Tonight I tried to get her to lay down for almost an hour before she pretty much collapsed from being so tired and I just picked her up and put her to bed. She’s been asleep for about 1- 1 1/2 hours and everything’s good thus far, but that doesn’t mean nothing will happen.

In the other sub they told me not to ask her to sleep, and to talk to her about letting me come with her to her therapists to get some tips on how to help her. But her appointment isn’t until Monday afternoon, and I don’t know how to help her until then.

If it matters, I’m a 25 M. She doesn’t have much family, only talks to her moms mom (grandma) and her moms siblings and their spouses (2 aunts with a husband each and an uncle). Other than that she pretty much doesn’t have any family. I don’t want to ask my family for advice because honestly I don’t think it’s their business, and her family is so small I don’t know how much help they would be.

I just want her to be happy, or at the very least not completely miserable. And I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated. If any of you have night terrors or experience with them, how do you cope/help your loved ones cope?",02Feb2020,1
202,"I’m currently unemployed.  My last job was technically temporary and tied to the elections, but in the months leading up to the election, I was told that I would probably be kept on after the election.  As we got closer to the election, my supervisors didn’t know what would happen after the election and said there would probably be a break.  About a week out I asked if I should plan to not have a job after the election, and my supervisor told me yes.  However, on the day of the election, my supervisor told me it was not my last day, but she did not know my next day and didn’t know when she would find out.  I applied for unemployment the next day.  Fast forward two weeks and I was called to come back to work, and a return date was scheduled.  A few days later, my supervisor told me I was not going to be able to return because I had applied for unemployment and HR was worried that bringing me back would be some type of fraud even though I hadn’t claimed any benefits yet.  Basically I’m trying to figure out what to put down for job applications.  I could put “temporary position” but I feel like that makes me look stupid for not having planned better and implies I knew the job was temporary.  I also don’t want to put that I was fired because that’s not exactly case because I’m eligible for rehire and was told I would get a call when they hire more people.  I feel like putting the truth of “my employer wouldn’t let me return to work because I applied for unemployment” also looks bad.  Does anyone have any advice for how to word this?",02Feb2020,1

Now S might be getting kicked out of school. Here's a little bit of context.

At the beginning of yr 12, S went to Africa because his family works there and wanted him to come, he had organised an online distance schooling but wasn't able to do any of it due to not having any internet for 7 months. When he got back, he did summer school and then enrolled in this school that is mostly like home school but required you to come in for at least 10 hours a week. This was all going well until he had to go back to Africa again, this time only for 3 weeks, but he never got to tell the school that he was leaving due to it being sudden.


Now that that's out of the way, we can get to the current situation.

S is meeting with the school this Monday, they will most likely be kicking him out due to his sudden absence and he's freaking out because he isn't sure what to do, and is worried his life is effectively over. My question is what are his options? He has just turned 18 and is worried that due to him being an adult his options are limited. I'm not entirely familiar with the Canadian school system since I'm an Aussie, but I will do my best to give more details as necessary. He said he only needs 30 credits to graduate if that helps any

213,"In September I moved in with two random girls because I was starting a job shortly after. There has been some tension between me and one of the roommates - lets call her the crazy roommate. Since the winter things have gotten better but we still keep our distance. 

I thought me and my other roommate - lets call her my normal roommate - were getting along really well and getting closer. She would constantly complain to me about the crazy roommate. I recently found out when she left her texts open on her computer in the living room that I have become the target of her never ending complaining. She thinks I talk too much, that I go out with my friends too much, that I am irresponsible, that I am inconsiderate of our apartment (specifically her kitchen things, even though she uses all of mine). She seems like she wants to be friends with me when I am with her but I am now seeing that she is simultaneously  critiquing my every move and broadcasting it to her parents, boyfriend, friends from home, you name it.

He sent me a video of someone getting hit with an axe in a corner store. It wasn’t too graphic so I didn’t think much of it, until a couple days ago. I sent him a funny video of a car crashing with a wii bowling sound effect on it, he replied with a video of a literal dead body being scavenged for meat. In the video three people are literally destroying this dead body and tearing it apart, I don’t want to get too specific. They took the guys eye out. After watching this I was immediately disgusted and felt like crying (kinda). This wasn’t even the worst part.

And she’s very oppressive of my religious beliefs because I don’t agree with Christianity. I’ve also been trying to get a job to make some money to leave but I’ve had 0 luck with that. And I definitely don’t have the money to go take the GED test. I’ve also got no one I can move in with. She also never listens to anything I have to say or how I feel about anything so I don’t know if I should just say fuck it and grab all the important shit and just leave or if I should just smile and grit my teeth and get through it till I graduate.

220,"So, for almost a year now, I was going through a tough time in my life and one of my professors noticed. He asked me to stay after class one day and asked me some questions and me being diagnosed with severe anxiety, everything about my life came out about the abuse I sustained from my mother and about not knowing my father and how I was getting to know his family now and that my mother was not happy I was talking to his family, and I was afraid of her, she almost killed me a few times while I was growing up. He told me that if I needed to talk about things, he would be there to listen.

Well, fast forward to a few months later and I get the news that my mother was planning on moving back in with my grandmother and I (I live with her to help take care of her and to save money from renting an apartment, plus, my college doesn't have dorms since it's a community college). The stress and memories of what I dealt with were coming back and were causing me problems. I was debating on talking with my teacher or not, but he did tell me I could talk to him if I need to, so I did. I told him that I was scared of her because of what she did to me. I said I was really thinking about just disappearing and starting my life over, he told me not to do that and he would find some help.

He emailed me the next day and told me his dean directed him to this one councilor who worked at the college. Well, I went to her and she tells me that she can not officially help me because I was not apart of their program she was with, but she directed me to an outside source. They have been wonderful so far.

Well, my mother has been coming home once a month to bring her stuff here a little at a time, but every time she's here, she argues with both me and my grandmother and upsets her (which is one reason I think she had her second heart attack since it happened not long after my mother left.) Anyways, my grades and mood would start dropping during and after each visit, and my professor apparently went to see this dean to tell him that he thought I was going to commit suicide. It was also after this meeting (which I didn't know about at the time) I found out that a security report was filed against me. I wasn't supposed to find out about the report and the guard who told me was fired.

The dean called me into a meeting with him and my professor, and this was the first time I met him. In this meeting, this dean told me that all my relationships with students and professors have been inappropriate ever since I started and because I was female I had to act differently even though the guys I hung out with acted the same way and it was fine what they did, and then he continues to tell me that the guard was probably going to try and kill me. My professor didn't step in the entire time this dean was saying these things and even said he felt hurt by some things I said about ""his"" teaching to students in another class (it wasn't his teaching I was bashing it was the online program we used because it was inconsistent, the online book had so many mistakes, and the program to turn in homework was always messed up. He didn't build the program, he didn't even have a say in how his class should be built, the college left it up to a board to do and teachers have no say). So, in my mind, I was thinking that he turned that report in against me since they still wouldn't tell me who did, but if he didn't, then why was he in this meeting? So, I felt hurt by this and was convinced he did turn me in to security, but I was confused because why would he help me if he was going to do something like this?

Later on, I wanted to hurt him so I made comments like how I wanted to stick a bullet in my head or jump off of a cliff and I made sure he was in the room and within earshot to hear. After two weeks of this, I finally snapped at him and asked him why he turned that security report in against me instead of talking to me and he (like all the other professors I asked) denied turning it in. He then told me that he had gone to the dean before the report was filed, telling him that he was afraid I would try and kill myself. It was also during this meeting that he told me when I first went to him for help and they were looking for a counselor for me that he said the dean wanted to know who I was, what the situation I was in, why did I need to talk to someone, and just all these questions. He told me that he told this dean that it was between me and him and if I wanted to tell him about my problem then it was up to me to do so. He said the reason he was in that meeting was that he informed the dean about the fact that I knew about the report filed against me. I felt better about the situation and things went back to normal.

Just before we went on break, I wrote my professor an apology letter for what I had said in his class and for what I did and let it go. I had also bought whiteboard markers for his class because of my eyes (I had previously had Lasik surgery a few years ago and my eyes are starting to go bad again which I knew would happen and he was using these dried out markers that were hard to see and hurt my eyes and he was taking a long time of getting them replaced so I did it for me.), but I didn't make it on to the next class, (I failed by .1 of a point). Also, during the break, my grandmother had her heart attack, which shortening that story, my mother and my aunt blamed me for her heart attacking saying I should have done more to help, how I'm not doing anything with my life and stressing her, and how I ruin everyone's lives. This made me hate myself even more and think back to the recent events of last semester so I wrote another letter to my professor saying that I was sorry for everything and how I hope to never see him again for his sake and mental health.

This past week, this dean wanted to talk and so I agreed and met up with him and he told me that this professor showed him the letters and, the dean, said I needed to stay away from him and never contact him again. He also contacted a therapist from the other campus, which first I was told we did not have one, second, she drove over an hour to get to this campus, third, I told them I had one, and fourth, he sat in the room with us for an hour while I talked with her (needless to say I left some things out until he left, like how I was molested in high school by one of my uncles which tied into the abuse from my mother because she told me to stay quiet).

I have not seen this professor and he has not explained anything to me even after I emailed him (before this meeting mind you). I'm confused, I feel betrayed, I'm hurt, I feel like I was to get revenge on him, and I feel like I'm never going to trust another person ever again or allow anyone near me. Am I overreacting? Am I the bitch everyone seems to make me out to be? Should I just disappear and start my life over as I had planned in the beginning? I don't know what to do.",02Feb2020,1

226,"Back during the holidays I went to a holiday party at a long term friends place, and as soon as I got there she warned me about a 'slight' flea issue they had. My bf came along. We very soon noticed after a few hours that it was not a slight issue at all. We had been drinking and already agreed to stay the night because neither of us would have been able to safely drive. I ended up basically getting eaten alive, but I am the least of my worries. Friend of mine has 4 cats. All very young and at that point I could already tell that the fleas have been around a while. The poor things couldn't stop scratching. I offered back in December to take the cats in someplace to get flea treated ( using their car, I have driven it before for them and didn't want fleas in my car to possibly effect my pets) while they bomb their place but they said they could handle it. ( little did I know they never made an effort to handle it)

Fast forward to this past week. They asked if I could watch their place and cats while they were gone for a week. I agreed. Me and my BF went over every day to check on things and I am horrified. One foot on the carpet and 30+ fleas latch onto your socks let alone you pants. I ended up grabbing the young cats and there were FILLED with fleas. They had bald spots all over their body from scratching. Their skin was dry and cracked. They were licking and scratching themselves raw. I ended up buying cat flea shampoo products along with moisturizing shampoo to try and help them feel a bit better. I cannot stand to see them live like this.

I wanted to bomb the place while they were gone but I just couldn't put them in my car because even though my seats were leather the fleas would have for sure attached themselves because of the sheer amount. I didn't sleep at their place at all, but even from being there my legs and stomach are COVERED in flea bites. I had to high heat wash everything I wore, and changed before I returned to my place just to not infect my cats

When they got back I messaged them about the fleas and how I was mauled by them. They told me the fleas were basically 99% gone. Total BS. Their poor white kitten looked like a dalmatian. 

They do feed them, but I think the fleas show a sign of neglect. The poor things cant even sit/lay still.

Im scared to call welfare, because I dont want to hurt the friendship but I value the cats more. 

I just dont know what to do. I feel like even if I convince them to let me help them bomb the place they wont take those actions on their own in the future, because I have already offered to help multiple times with fail

234,"TL;DR

I'm about to be the legal drinking age but I'm recovering from an alcohol addiction.  My coworkers and family have seen me drink before and will want to take me out to bars. How do I hide my problem and stay sober? 


Here's what's going on: I'm 18 in Canada, and in a year I'll be of legal drinking age. 

My mom and dad have different perspectives on alcohol, I've had a few beers and wine with my dad but my moms very hesitant to let me drink at home and would rather me have a few drinks in a social situation so I don't normalize drinking at home. Pretty reasonable considering alcoholism runs in both of their families.

Im still living at home and like your average teen I had liquor hidden in my room, except I started drinking it on my own in the evenings when I was home alone and on the phone with friends.  But things escalated when I would get drunk about 3 times a week, including school nights.  Eventually I was getting drunk, a little tipsy or at least taking a shot before bed every night. Also, I would have a drink before work and I would sometimes still be drunk when I woke up for school or would have a drink in the morning too.

I managed to hide it from my parents because I'm super lightweight, and didn't produce many empty bottles or smell because three shots would make me full on drunk.

Anyways, a few destroyed friendships and relationship later, I was at a camp without alcohol and it was hell (detox I think? I was sick and miserable) and realized I was addicted physically and psychologically.

My family doesn't know about any of this, and I've been sober for months now, and it's been the biggest challenge of my life. I'm worried that when I turn 19 they'll want to take me for drinks, or my adult co workers  have already said they'll take me to bars etc.

How do I avoid drinking considering all of these people (coworkers and family) know that I've drunk alcohol before but don't know it because a serious problem?  I want to stay sober but I don't want them to know about my drinking problem. Help?",02Feb2020,1
235,"I’m 24F and he’s 25M. When we dated originally, he had an extreme alcohol problem. He never directly hit me or anything and never touched me sober. But there was some incidents where he did hurt me while drunk, as well as verbal abuse. He also cheated on me. It’s been three years since we dated. He lived in a sober recovery house for 6 months and graduated the program and is now working at an addiction treatment facility. We have so many of the same ‘weird’ interests that none of my other friends have, like Pokémon and anime (which is why we were together for so long and happy when he wasn’t drinking). 

He reaches out to me and says he just wants us to be friends and a support system for each other (I’ve been going through a hard time this past year personally with mental health). He tells me how much he regrets treating me the way he did and if he could change any one thing, it would be that. He said he still dreams about me and that he knows I was the one and it kills him everyday that he messed it up. I know if I asked literally anyone I know about this, they would say absolutely not and to block him. I feel like the situation is so hard though because I’ve never known this sober, working, functioning adult version of him. Please don’t call me stupid, because I really am not.

One moment I will be super hyper and funny and energetic, but other times I am really quite and shy. Also, sometimes I just space out and am sad I guess. And, I lie a lot. Like I am probably a pathological liar. I just can’t help it, but I am trying to stop.  I sometimes have a very forgetful memory, but I can also remember things from 12 years ago? I have weird phobias like holes, and am frightened by death. I also have OCD, and have weird mood swings. I am very emotional, I will cry at stupid things. I get way into my head and end up having panic attacks of what could happen in the future. I have a very vivid imagination and dream constantly. I usually imagine different scenarios and end up crying when they lead to someone I love dying. It is almost impossible to become mad. I always start laughing when I am mad or sad and I don’t know why and it frustrates me so much. I think I’ve only been able to yell at someone twice in my whole lifetime. I become attached to things like books or stupid objects. And I always get mad at myself and blame myself for everything for absolutely no reason. I always talk to myself. I usually explain things as if I were telling someone what is happening. I refer to myself as a different person I guess. Like I will ask “ do you think this is a good idea?” Or “does this look good on me?” As if someone is listening. I think that is about it. So, I know that is a lot. And there is probably no answer to my questions. I just want to know why I am like this? Or what is this? Is there a certain thing that explains my behavior? A certain or multiple mental disorders? Is this a bad thing? Is there anything I can do to help?",02Feb2020,1

238,"Growing up is hard. College, SATS, driving test, and everything else. I don’t know how kids manage AP or IB/AB level courses; it makes me so insecure. I’m also really shy and anxious and I hate it when people throw the word anxiety around like it’s nothing. Actual anxiety makes you feel like a freak, especially when people treat you like you are one. My life was once a strong, thick rope; it is now nothing but a string fraying at the ends. I feel everything is falling apart even though I seem to be improving on the outside. It’s not like I completely bottle myself up, I talk to my sister when I need to but I really want someone besides a family member to be close with and to really trust. I want someone I can talk to about anything, especially the deep stuff, which no one ever wants to talk about. All everyone in school cares about is gossiping, societal trends, politics, and other superfluous stuff lacking real depth, substance, and emotion. People are so rude and inconsiderate yet so proud and I can’t make it through school anymore with those people. It’s not that I get bullied though, but I do ALWAYS get stared at like I’m some murderer who deserves to rot for eternity or something. I just want someone mature who actually understands me and is willing to stay by my side whenever I need them. It’s so hard sometimes, especially when you realize that even the adults you once looked up to aren’t as perfect as they once seemed.",02Feb2020,1
239,"Okay so my brother (Jack) is 16 and my friend(Sam) is 17.  They started dating a little over a year ago and they broke up after 8 months because Sam cheated on him at a party. 
It caused a lot of tension because Sam was my best friend, and I stupidly forgave her, supported her and listened to her excuses. Whereas my brother is an emotional rock and I kind of just assumed he was okay(which he wasn’t.) In the end I realized that picking my friend over my brother was a really dick move and I promised myself that I’d always put family first regardless of the situation. I cut off Sam for a a few months to focus on Jack and slowly let Sam and I’s friendship build up again. 
Fast forward like 9 months later, Jack and I moved really far away from that town. Our relationship is really good as far as siblings go. And Sam and I are still friends. 
However, I recently came to know on a FaceTime with Sam that one of my brothers friends from our home town became really close to Sam and is basically snitching on Jack. What I found out is pretty disgusting. 
Essentially this is what my brother was saying to his friend: 

-that he wants to sleep with sam again When we visit for March break
- that her face is really ugly but he’s willing to look past it in order to smash again 
-that he’ll exchange Sams nudes for the girl his friend is talking to nudes 
-that all of Jacks friends here in the new town know all about Sam and have seen her nudes etc. 

And honestly I don’t doubt that he said or done any of this. My brother is very arrogant, self centered and a bit of a narcissist in my opinion. BUT my problem now is who’s side do I stay on?? 

My first instinct after Sam told me this (and she told me not to tell him) was to go and warn Jack about the friend who’s snitching on him. But I really thought about it and maybe he deserves this? The things he’s saying are really disgusting,  but at the same time I promised my self to always put my family first and by leaving Jack to keep exposing himself to his snitching best friend am I really doing that???

(Im in 9th now) I still think about her sometimes and I know that eventually age doesn't really matter. but I feel like she'll be settled down by that point, and I'll forever know I missed this amazing person..

Now they have access to every school account I have, except my email. The minute something minor happens, I get in trouble and/or yelled at. I’m sick and tired of this. Because I’m not performing as well as I used to.

A side effect of this is just anxiety. I don’t know when they are going to talk to me again (by talk I mean discussing school stuff which I hate talking about) and I feel so excluded.

I have also felt myself distancing myself from friends because of this. A lot of the time I just hide in my bedroom with my games and play. Games are like an escape from “beyond the door” for me.

My little sister isn’t any better. She is one of the most violent people I know and she always hits me or does something to hurt me. And when I retaliate I get in trouble. I thought I could tell her about my crush and if she could help me get a gift for her, but no. She ruins our little family night at a restaurant while I’m at the bathroom. She constantly mocks me in public and in front of friends about my shit grades which she keeps eavesdropping on those conversations.

My parents, although they have stopped a little, somehow find a way to bring up the girl I like and embarrass me about it or my crap grades in a lot of conversations.

All of those things cost a ton of money. If they remained single and either rented an apartment or house or bought a small house, they could save so much money. Personally, I’m going to stay single and childless my whole life and live in a small home. I’m going to have a lot of excess cash.

I was so shocked and just dumbfounded in that moment. It happened years ago and we have a good relationship now I don't know why it's starting to creep up on me now.

The debt was paid out over a month ago so I was confused and went to speak with the hospital billing department.

Her supervisor confirmed this after 15 minutes of me going back and forth with the secretary. I then called the collections agency and they were confused saying that my debt was paid in full.

So I’ve been talking with this dude for legit only a day, and he’s been venting about wanting to kill himself. I posted in r / internetfriends that I didn’t mind people hitting me up to vent, so that’s why. I stayed up most of last night with him to try and convince him to not kill himself, to no avail. He was talking about methods to kill himself with. Even though I said everything I could to do something about his intentions of suicide, he’s still hellbent on it, and I can understand that as we only had a few hours of conversation. Anyway, during that time, I offered to be his friend; because even though he didn’t say it, I felt like he didn’t think anyone cared about him or something. We exchanged instagram @‘s, too. Unfortunately, poor dude’s riddled with mental illnesses like bpd and schizo. He’s also on so many meds that “[he] can’t orgasm any more” and hasn’t gotten anything out of therapy. He’s a really nice guy, though— he sent me memes and we talked about the sport he does, which is rowing. I’ll also admit that I lowkey caught feelings for him? Yeah, I don’t know either. That’s irrelevant. But anyway, he just texted me that he “got his partial suspension system to work” and that basically means he’s trying to hang himself. I’m absolutely freaking out, how can I convince him not to kill himself? I can’t call the suicide hotline about it, because he lives in Germany and I live in the US. And before any of y’all say it, he doesn’t seem like the kind of guy to fake committing suicide or wanting to commit suicide to scare people. He’s genuinely a nice person. What can I do to help him or stop him? Can anyone give me advice? I care about this dude because I’ve been exactly where he is now. I can send y’all screenshots of our convo if you need me to.

255,"I am the head tenant on a house in the Bay Area, a region that’s one of the top 10 most expensive in the US. Finding a room under $800 is extremely hard. In my house, I rent a room for $725 plus expenses. It’s so cheap because it’s a converted garage and there are no windows.

I maintain the with paint, wall cleaning, and vacuum cleaning between roommates. When showing it to people I tell them WYSIWYG.

This new lady who moved in is the only applicant who passed the background check with a good credit score. Rent started Jan 1, but she had her old place through Jan 31. She’s paying double rent and staying at the old place. She moved stuff in our house but she has not been physically living in the room.

This month she steam cleaned the carpet and scrubbed the walls. She asked for pro rate the first week of Jan while the room was being cleaned. I threw her a bone and took $120 off the rent.

Two weeks ago, a rodent snuck in and tore a piece of the carpet. They came back 3x to the same spot and tore it. Then my landlord put in a trap and the lady put towels and aluminum foil around the door to keep the rodents out. So far, they haven’t been back.

She asked that the 5”x5” square of the carpet that was torn be replaced. My landlord was slow about acting on it. The actual replacement took 15 min, but the delay took him a week to replace it. During that time she didn’t set up furniture because she presumed he’d need a large working area. We told her she could do it but she chose to wait.

I bought her a sweep to put on the door, but it wasn’t good enough. She is hiring a handyman to install one. She also is having him put a latch on another door inside her closet that leads to the water valve, because she’s afraid rodents might sneak in from there. (Not true but ok.)

Dilemma:
Last night she asked me to take another $175 off the rent for the rodent issue. The reason is that she “couldn’t move in because the room wasn’t livable.” She also said she’s paying double rent and wants a break — I think that’s the main issue because she has not spent much time at our house at all. It’s Feb 1 and she’s still spending all her time at her old place.

I don’t want to absorb this cost. I pushed back on her and said I already pro rated the room for the first week of January. I don’t want to keep negotiating rent with her. Rent is rent.

She got upset and said the room wasn’t livable. So I messaged the landlord and asked if he would knock it off the rent.

It’s a shitty situation all around. What’s fair here??

Also, this lady is getting on my nerves. With her half moved in, do I nip it in the bud and say it won’t work??

TL;DR
New tenant wants to knock off two weeks of rent for January because the room wasn’t super clean and there was a rodent issue that required a piece of the carpet to be replaced. I am head tenant but I don’t want to absorb the cost. Plus, this lady is annoying.",02Feb2020,1

270,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

This is a very long story, sorry. It started less than 6 months ago, when I met someone through mutual friends. I just started playing this game, which all my friends including her, played. We talked every single day after meeting. She was just so nice and kind to me. 

Fast forward a few months later, she invites some of my friends and I, to her baking stream. This was where I first noticed, she was very gullible, and often listened to biased opinions. My friends used this as an advantage, and quickly made her question me. At this point, I started catching feelings for her, and it was bad. I was too obsessed with her; talking to her every single day, saying good morning/good night to her, and even started getting defensive if someone else tried talking to her. 

After this, my friends and myself, got into a fight with her, which resulted in her being blocked by them. I on the other hand, was blocked by her, with the reason of her wanting to be alone with her thoughts. She unblocked me 2 days before Christmas, and we startes talking to each other again.

It was January 1st, when everything changed. She confessed to me saying she likes me. I knew this was bad, since I was just getting over her. I made a huge mistake, and said I liked her back. After that day, the things we did were such couple-like. She wanted to have matching profile pictures on social media, she wanted to watch movies together, but the one thing she didn't want to do, was date me. I just kept pushing and pushing, into asking her if she's ready for a long-distance relationship, and she had the same answer. I don't know yet.

For 5 days, she presumably liked me. After that 5th day, she told me that she made a promise to her friend that she wouldn't like me and wouldn't have another long-distance relationship since her first ones were bad. This crushed me. I just couldn't get over her.. 

Fast forward a few weeks after this, and it's her birthday. I buy a stuffed animal for her, and it arrives on my birthday, only 3 days after hers. The same day, her present from her ""best friend"" arrives(one of my friends irl). On social media, she  took a picture of it, and captioned it ""I love you so much ****!! You're very special to me!"". When she took a picture of mine, she only said ""Tysm OP"".

Everyone clearly saw something going on between them. She seemed that she flirted with him too much, and he did in return. She started sending screenshots of what he said to her, such as ""you're so cute"" ""I LOVE YOU AHHHH"" ""I would totally date you"". I don't really understand why she would send stuff like this, to a person who she know likes her. 

That one friend insisted he only saw her as a friend, and nothing more. I never believed him. 

A few days ago, myself and her got into a ""tiny"" little fight from what she said. She accused me of lying about cutting, and that I only did it to get her attention. That was not the reason why I cut myself. It was because of what my friends had said about me. They said I was trying to get her jealous, by ""stealing"" one of our friend's girlfriend.  She stopped talking to me for 2 days, and then messaged me randomly saying it sucks not talking to me and that she's worried. 

I knew I shouldn't have responded, but I did. I didn't mention this, but a few days before the fight, she said ahe honestly really does like me. I responded asking why she was worried, and that she hates me. She said that hate is a strong word, and after that everything acted normal. We went back to talking to each other, day and night. 

Just 2 days ago, she blocked me. Some friends and I are in a group, for a project, and told her that I haven't been doing work. They've been using her as a motivation for me, which to their thinking process, if she doesn't talk to me, I work. The thing is though, that wasn't the reason why she blocked me. The reason was and I quote, ""Well I'm gonna not have to talk to you sorry, it's not me, it's for ****"" (her ""best friend"").

The past few days, I feel that I've been fine, but I really don't know anymore. I just get so lonely sometimes, which when happened I talked to her. I've been wanting to get over her, but something's been stopping me. What I think I'm trying to ask for help, is how do I get over her?",02Feb2020,1
272,"i’ve been stuck in this long stretch of depression and i’m not sure what to do anymore. i think doing irrational things daily, ranging from self harm (which i’ve done before), running away, or even suicide. i only stay clean of drugs and self harm because i know it won’t help however the temptation is constantly there  and it’s like an itch i’m trying to hold back from scratching. i don’t run away because of the consequences it could hold if and when i’m found. and i don’t kill myself because i don’t wanna hurt others. i actually kinda realized that the concept of every organism having its own life, soul, and personality and never coming back when it’s gone to be strange but not scary. i don’t believe in much of any religion however i do go to a christian church, i just don’t think there’s anything after life; i believe that whatever it was before life is what it is after so i’m not scared of it, just see no reason to speed it up to that ending I guess. i feel since i’d be in a nothingness void of nowhere, it’s not worth the pain itd cause my family, friends, or girlfriend. i lift weights and have a healthy diet, i skateboard and attempt at making music and lyrics, however i still cant find a reason to live day to day. i don’t really know what my problem is and i wanna see a therapist or maybe get a medication of some sort but i feel it’s a little excessive and is dramatic. i want death but don’t wanna hurt people around me, i hate causing pain to others. i don’t have anyone i feel comfortable with talking to, so i made this account just to post all of this on here in some desperate hope of someone humbly taking the time out of their day to read it and ideally reply with something..anything. I know i said i don’t wanna hurt people and everything but I know if i continue to live and feel this way at some point i’ll end up hurting myself, getting back into drugs, or something else and that’ll progressively lead into worse things. if anyone has anything to say, or advice seeing as that is the title of this subreddit, please consider typing it up for me.

277,"I should have sued my school for what happened to me in the cafeteria in 10th grade. An autistic kid who was known to have very aggressive and violent outbursts had one as I entered the cafeteria. I heard her curse at her special needs aide before throwing a plastic fork at the wall, which barely missed my head. Not sure if that was intentional. Then, she proceeded to run out immediately, but on the way, decided to grab onto my head. She tried to pull my hair, so I acted out of self defense and tried to remove her hands off of me. What could I have done, it was literally self defense, I was so scared for my life. What the aide said to me scarred me: “Take your hands off, we need to take care of this.” She said something like that, which implied that the offender’s safety was more important than mine. Maybe if the aide stopped the kid on time, that wouldn’t have happened. Anyway, 2 yrs before that incident, she ripped up my sowing paper in class that I worked hard on. Maybe she had a problem with me or something. I was always quiet and never had a gym partner for the exercises, so I’d always partner up with her. She’s always try to one up me, telling me I was doing the exercise wrong and showing me the right way to do it. The gym teacher said I did the exercise correctly, though. This kid like attention, and says “thank you so much/that’s amazing/that’s so cool, etc.” in a very over exaggerated and almost sarcastic way. It’s really quite strange. Other disabled and mentally handicapped or autistic kids have always stared/glare at me or try to approach me or start a conversation and I have no idea why. I spent 10 of the most humiliating moments of my life waiting for the 2 pairs of hands to stop harassing me (I felt nothing but harassed in that moment) as the entire cafeteria stared at me. I wouldn’t even call it humiliating at the moment because I was in too much shock to process what happened. Right after, I was given a note pad and a pen and was told to write down everything that happened while I was sitting in that seat where it all happened; right in front of everyone. They should have led to me to a more private area so I could recover from being assaulted. Only a regular side aide asked if I was okay. But  no one else apologized on behalf of the incident; no one took responsibility. I don’t know what they did with that note I wrote them, but I have my suspicions. I don’t think I can sue anymore because that was 2 years ago, but I’ll never forget how poorly everyone neglected their jobs as aides and as professionals who are supposed to be trained to be prepared for things like that. I would just like some support from you guys because it would mean a lot since counseling is not an option for me. Please be respectful and meaningful because I carry deep scars from it.",02Feb2020,1

281,"I am a 17 year old male if it matters.

I met this girl back in November of 2018 when I started working at my local pizza joint. We started off as just co-workers, became friends, had a ton in common, started sitting with each other at lunch and talked a ton. She shared with me so much about her past about how she was bullied in and out of school and how she has had problems with her self image in the past which put her on the brink of suicide and just so much about her life and I did as well. We shared things with each other that we hadn't even told our parents or ""best friends"" and we started dating. We went to dinners, met each others parents, movies, etc. We were attached to each other. We would meet each other at the top of a stairwell in school every morning where i'd bring her coffee, talk before class, etc. We hugged, kissed, relationship stuff. But one day out of the blue she broke it off over text. We went from her laying in my lap to her breaking up with me in just a few hours. Everything was so sudden for me and it hurt so much because I had no idea it was coming and this was the first person that I really felt ""in love"" with. She told me it was because she couldn't handle the relationship because of combined stress from school, work and the relationship. We stayed friends until January 5th, 2020 but I never got truly over it and still don't know if I am. (She broke up with me on November 5th, 2019) I wanted to be more than friends again but she had feelings for another guy we both knew and I couldn't stand to see them together so it sent me down into a spiral of confusion and depression that was even worse than when she broke up with me. One night at work she told me something that just pushed me right over the edge and I started telling her after she left, over text, that I was going go kill myself because there was no possible way I could ever be happy again and I just couldn't stand them two together and I got out of my shower that night (January 5th, 2020) and her and her mom were standing at my door talking to my parents.

She left that night and blocked me on everything and told me to get help.

I am now in therapy working on my social skills, depression, and more. We haven't texted each other in 4 weeks. I want to tell her that I want to try to be friends again but I'm not sure she wants to and I don't know how.

Any advice on how I should go about telling her that I want to be friends again or should I just let her go?",02Feb2020,1

284,"Hey, people of reddit,

I'm a 25 year-old man, single, have been working on IT for the past 4 years and currently on a journey to become a better person. This includes, but is not limited to, working out and losing weight, looking for better paying jobs, going to therapy, developing new hobbies and meeting more people in general; pretty much everything by the book of ""how to get yourself a better life"".

This is all well and good, but there is one slight problem -- my self-confidence. In a more specific note, I have impostor syndrome, and I struggle with letting go of a belief that I'm not good enough to have better things, despite working hard for them, which in turns discourage me to try to work hard in the first place. It feels as if my desire to have better things conflicts with my belief that I am not good enough to have these things in the first place.

Worse still, I am afraid of taking charge of situations -- even when I'm more than capable of handling the task at hand, or I am the only one who can do it at the time. When I'm solving a problem or directing people, these thoughts don't cross my mind, but once it's over thoughts pop up on my mind like ""how the hell they let me do this shit"", or ""did I do the right thing?"". Every now and then things go well and I am glad things worked out and even give myself a pat on the back for a job well done, but it's not something that sustains itself in the long run, and I fall back to the same patterns over and over.

So, I want advice on how I can break this pattern and start believing more in myself, and believing that I deserve these things.",02Feb2020,1
285,"Okay, so to give the context. My buddy and I have been closest of friends and basically almost brothers since the third grade, and we’re sophomores now. We were on Xbox and in a party, and we get our other friend, this girl, to join the party. About 10 minutes in she asks me if I want to come hang out and bowl with some friends. Everyone there consisted of her and her twin sister (not identical), me, and a couple other guy friends that me and my friend know and hang out with. But it’s at a point where my friend can clearly hear this, cause we’re all in an Xbox party. He isn’t invited at all. At the time I didn’t know what to think and since she was in a hurry to get an answer I said yeah I’ll go that sounds cool. 

So I went and hung out, but I didn’t mention anything about my friend who didn’t go, cause we’re a close group and it would make stuff super awkward. I did that for the good of the group cause I didn’t want anything ruined. Went bowling, had a good time, but my screwup was posting a video on my story about it. That’s when my friend texted me and was like y’all look like you’re having fun. I feel really bad for the guy cause as far as he and I know, everything should have been cool between him and the girls. I told him “yeah man, I really wish you could’ve gone. I have no clue what’s up with her not inviting you.” We talked for a bit but we have no clue what’s going on. He’s just planning to not hang out with her or anything, see if she comes around to apologize, but as I said before, we’re a group of good friends and I just hate seeing drama happen and no matter what it feels like this group is gonna start to divide.

I’m totally on my best friend’s side in this, it was totally wrong of her to just ask that in the party deliberately instead of just texting me. It felt very much like it was intended to keep my best friend out but keep literally everyone else in. I have no idea why this is, cause everything felt like it was fine between all of us even after I was invited as we continued to play Xbox.

I’m not trying to lose friends but I already know in the event that it happens that I’ll be on my best friend’s side. It sounds stupid and dramatic, but that’s because it is. Did I do the wrong thing by going? Was that better than saying no? What should me or my friend do from here on?",02Feb2020,1
286,"I live alone in a quiet, kind of hippy house in the middle of the bush and not very close to neighbours. I am away all day and leave several windows open for the cat to come in and out freely. Until now I have felt very safe and have never had any reason to feel like I need to be super vigilant about security. 

But a few days ago, my cat came inside with a burnt ear. Some fur was burnt off/singed and the tip was blistering... looked very painful! I put it down to her having walked too close to something hot (my nearest neighbour does work on cars and has had scrap fires sometimes). And I chose not to worry too much and just address her wound. 

Then just now I found two of my dog’s toys with burnt holes in them. The holes are about finger size and the black marks from the burn does track up a lot further than the hole itself making it seem like it had been left smouldering for a little while. I don’t smoke or know anyone who does. It is the middle of summer and can reach 34C outside.

287,"I’m a sophomore, played for 2yrs now at my school, and semester 1 has just come to and end. To be honest, at the end of this season I started to be less passionate in playing competitively in both school and club teams. My grades have also dipped, which isn’t pleasant to try and save them when they’re so far gone.

I managed to bring my grades back up after school szn concluded, but now I’m not sure if I want to play next year.

I still love volleyball and I love playing the sport, but my heart isn’t in the game and competing anymore. Sure it still feels great to win, but I don’t know anymore. I used to love everything about the game and the thrill, but I feel like it’s just stressful with how my grades turn out every season (especially since next year is junior year) and the pressure and responsibility I have to my teammates. 

A lot of people tell me that I should do a sport and stick with it my whole high school career as it is beneficial for college. I’m really glad I discovered volleyball in middle school and actually found a sport I loved playing, but as I stated before, the fire seems to have dimmed now that I’m almost halfway through highschool.

I’m not sure whether I should continue playing for the sake of my college resumé or if I should stop and play as a hobby with friends occasionally instead. Obviously the latter seems like the better choice for my mental state, but if this greatly impacts my acceptance into a college, I might as well just stick with it for another two years :(

i also don’t want him smoking with his ex anymore even as a group of friends. i just don’t think it’s appropriate for him to be getting intoxicated with her. he freaked out when i said this and told me it was no different than smoking a cigarette with her and i made it sound like he was getting drunk with her.
i really do care for him, but i have so much going on in my own life. being in this relationship i feel like i’m constantly coming second to him smoking with his ex and his friends (although he would just say friends because he considers her another one of his buddies). it’s dragged down my self esteem and some mornings i struggle to get out of bed because of how sad i am. i try to tell him how i feel but every time he puts off my feelings or ends up telling me i’m being immature and trying to make him lose his friends just like his ex made him do. i can’t get my feelings across to him.

303,"Sorry for how long this is!

My roommate was one of my best friends from college.  We’ve had a pretty good, platonic relationship which is why I though living together and signing a long lease would be okay since we both had jobs in a similar area.   Lately though, he’s been constantly putting me down or saying things that I find hurtful which has me considering breaking our lease and wiping my hands of our friendship.  It is at the point now where every conversation is pretty much him putting me down.  Here is some of the things he has been doing:

1) He make comments about my weight knowing that it is a pain point for me.  I was in better shape in college, but have definitely put on some weight (125 to now 150) after graduation but it’s something that I’m working on.  Recently he’s made so many negative comments about it that it’s been affecting my confidence since he always has something to say about it like “ I look fine from behind but from the side I have a gut”.  He has made comments about how I was thinner in college and how he would’ve slept with me then, but not now.   I also was fairly promiscuous in college and he makes comments about that and how I’m less now. 

2) He doesn’t really do any of the chores in shared areas.  We meal prep together and since he’s better at cooking, I offer to do the dishes we cooked in.  Now, he expects me to do all the dishes and will just leave his dishes in the sink for me.  The few rare times he does his dishes, he only washes the containers that he took for lunch.  This really got on my nerves when he put some dishes in the sink while I was washing them and when I asked him if he could help, he told me it was my job.   Before we lived together, I use to wash his dishes when I came to hangout at his apartment because he would let them pile up so I would offer to help him out with the.  My dog has to be on the shared floor during the day since it has hardwood floors, so I don’t mind taking the responsibility of vacuuming that floor.  He also will put the trashcans out but expects me to put them back.  I was on a work trip during trash day this week and came back very late that evening and he left the trash can out for me to put back even though I put them out and put them back when he’s on trips.  The trashcans are stored on his patio so it’s easier for him to put them away since he doesn’t have to walk around the house twice and can get back in through his room. 

3) He travels more than me and expects me to watch his cat.  In November and December, I had to watch his cat for over four weeks.   He promised me he would be back on December 31st and then extended the trip without telling me until the day he was suppose to return from the trip and expected me to cancel my New Years plans to watch his cat since she was ill and needed medication every 8 hours.  I was originally going to go to a different city that is four hours away for New Years.  My dog had also been neutered over the holidays so I was completely stressed out trying to take care of a sick cat and my dog who was recovering from surgery while still working.   Before he left, I also asked him if he had to leave so early for his trip since I knew taking care of an ill dog and cat with work would stress me out and it is a lot to manage for over two weeks.  He told me that his family wanted him home for the holidays early so I didn’t ask again.  I later found out that instead of being home with family, he went to Miami with his girlfriend for 4-5 days.  I needed to reach him one day because his cat had multiple seizures and had peed all over his closet and he wasn’t responding to my texts or calls so I called his mom to see if she could help me reach him and she told me where he was.  When he returned, he didn’t even thank me.  I had washed his bed when his cat she peed on it and tried my best to get the pee out of his carpets so his room wouldn’t smell like pee.  Instead, he was upset that I had left two empty cat food tins on his dresser.  

4) He doesn’t treat my dog very well.  I got my puppy back in July and he knew that I was getting him before we agreed to move in.  He’s not a dog person, so I try to excuse some of his behavior.  My roommate works from home on Fridays so I asked him if he could take my dog out for me so I wouldn’t have to come home during work to check on him.  I later found out that he was taking my dog’s water bowl away pretty much for the 8 hours I was gone so he could play League Of Legends and wouldn’t have to take my dog out as often.  He got made at me for being upset with him for that since my dog has accidents when I’m home and none with him so he was clearly in the right.  He also constantly tells me that I’m a terrible dog mom because his girlfriend has a better trained dog.  Her dog has been to a training program.  Eventually, I sent mine to one because of his constant comments.  He never has anything nice to say about my dog.  Even though I dislike his cat, I try to make an effort to get along with her and even compliment her to him for how she has warmed up to me.

5) He always makes comments about how he is smarter than me and is very condescending in how he speaks to me.  If I make a mistake or does something he doesn’t approve of, he immediately makes comments like “You’re so silly” or “Nothing you do surprises me anymore” or “Sometimes I forgot I live with a 22 year old and think I live with a 5 year old”.  At first, I didn’t mind but now these comments are pretty much constant and everything I do is “stupid”.

6) He makes plans with me and will not tell me anything, shows up hours later, and then gets angry with me when I ask him to let me know if he’s going to be late.  I understand that he has a new girlfriend and wants to spend as much time as possible with her and have no problem with that.  I’m happy he has someone after how he was treated in his last relationship and it’s nice that people has stopped commenting about how we should date.  He and I will make plans for example : “Let’s go get lunch at 1pm”.  He will go hangout with his girlfriend and I will do thinks I have planned.  It’ll be 1pm and I haven’t heard anything from him.  Then, he’ll come back at 4pm after I’ve decided to go eat already and say “Oh, I’m sorry I lost track of time! I just don’t look at the clock when I hang out with her.  We can just go now!”  The first couple of times I tried to be understanding and okay with this, but now it has been almost every plan that we have made for the past four months.  When we make plans now, I’ve stopped setting the time aside for him and plan on either pushing it back a couple of hours or just assuming we won’t doing them at all.   Sometimes he makes me feel like I’m just there to entertain him when she’s busy and I should have my time free for him, but if I run late on my plans, I need to be more considerate of him.

7) We were both single when we first moved in together and he had a ton of rules like “I don’t want to meet any of the guys you bring back.” and “Let me know when you have someone over so I can stay in my room.”  When he started dating, he expected me to meet every girl he liked so they could meet my dog even though he knows I have severe social anxiety and I don’t like meeting new people be sprung at me because I feel forced to say yes even if I’m not feeling well.  Then when I asked him to follow the same rules, I was being controlling. 

8) I work a much lower paid job than him.  I’m in marketing and he is in computer science.  Whenever I express my frustration with still being a temp and waiting for that full time offer, he always makes comments about how he would have never taken a temp job.  He also makes comments about how his salary is so much higher from when he was an intern and how mine only increased by $1 an hour.

9) I recently returned from a work trip.  He had gone into my room to put the blankets I use on our living room couch onto my bed.  I thought it was weird since we normal just put the unused blankets on an ottoman.  He was also lending me a space heater which he took from my bathroom.  When I returned from my trip, I realized that I’m missing a pair of gold earrings that were next to the space heater in my room.  I know with 100% certainty where they were left and they’re no longer there.  I don’t want to believe that he or his gf took them, but I can’t find them anywhere and have spent the past two days completely cleaning my room and shared areas looking for them. When I brought it up with him, he got really defensive and brought up how he has plenty of money and wouldn’t need my earrings.  I just want them back because my mom got them for me.

10) We pay the same rent for a master bedroom and one extra room each.  I turned my extra room into our guest room while his is his office which I’m only allowed to use it when he wants me to play League with him (which he usually gets angry at me for playing poorly).  While I was on my work trip, he turned the guest bedroom into a plant room without asking me.  So now, he has three of the four bedrooms. 

10) I’m trying to build my credit and was trying to use a rent tracking app that adds it to your credit.  I pay my rent in advance from when it’s due on the 1st of every month.  On the portal we pay through, it says that it is due the first of every month.  He always pays it after the first sometimes as late as the 5th or waits to get the late rent email.  Because we haven’t been fined for it yet, he won’t pay it by the first so I can’t use the rent tracking app because it marks our rent as late and will hurt my credit. 

At this point, I want to move out because I’m tired of feeling like a terrible person and tiptoeing around him and his girlfriend.  I’ve tried talking him to him about things, but all of our conversations turn into sessions where he berates me for being overly emotional, he’s completely innocent, and he never had any issues with any of his guy roommates.  I’ve tried to make efforts to get along with him and his girlfriend to try to make this living situation bearable but they both are very condescending to me so I’ve chosen to avoid them. He made these comments before his current girlfriend, but now they’re more often and harsher.  I’m not in the best financial situation since the dog training program was expensive and I’m paying more rent than I wanted to because he didn’t help me find a house during the search.  I ended up signing a lease on this place that was above my price range with nothing I wanted because he didn’t like any of the places in my price range and my lease at my old apartment was up.  His mom and I use to be really good friends but now after what I guess he is telling her, she is cold and rude to me which really hurts cause I saw her as a second mom.  Should I continue to try to salvage our friendship, just be roommates, or start looking for a way to move out? 

tl;dr:  My roommate is condescending and treats me poorly, but I’m not in a good financial position to move out.",02Feb2020,1

I got so scared that he might choose me, his face was red and he said to the class you guys better not fail this course otherwise I’ll make you do it again.

(not to offend anyone) but i can’t stand the whole idea of christianity and most religions. and people always give me shit for it and some of the adults in my life even try to force it on me and it makes me hate it even more. every single day im thinking of and looking back on better times. whether they’re childhood memories or even memories from the most recent summer. things shift fast in my life. i’m insecure and i find myself comparing to others. others who are better looking, have more friends, have more money, ect. im a very dark person deep down for the most part now. been that way for a while. traumas from my past haunt me. i constantly suffer headaches everyday. i can’t lose weight. i’ve gained weight. i’ve come to a complete blank in making music (i’ve been rapping since 2018) and no matter how much i want to make more music i simply can’t. most people who know about my issues blow it off, tell me im too young too understand, and tell me that everyone else has problems too and i shouldn’t be complaining. i’ve had an immense amount of issues in my fairly recent past, in the past year and a half or so. lots and lots of mistakes and lots and lots of situations and times where life throws me for a loop again and again. i once about two years or so ago i had  a lot of friends, and to make it short i was happy. my life was good. things change though, of course. mistakes were made and after all this time i’ve hit a dead end. i’ve aged too fast. all i ever want to do is smoke and get high again. when i drive (which really, is illegal for me right now) i drive fast. if i crash, fuck it i crash. i’ll die one day anyway. thats how i think. is it toxic? yeah. but can i help it? nope. im misunderstood too. i feel like im the only person who understands me. a family member i trust a lot doesn’t give me advice like he used to. i feel judged when i ask for it and he sort of blows it off and makes me feel like im wrong, even though i know its not intentional. so i’ve come here. i feel really mentally strained and i don’t even know what i am or where im gonna go with it. there’s a lot of things i can’t figure out and i feel like im too young to have to worry about them. i want to be able to enjoy my time being young (i’m 15) before i get too old to enjoy life. but anyway, if you took the time to read this, i deeply appreciate that. thank you. writing this made my headache worse so i hope i didn’t waste my time. but that’s all i guess.",02Feb2020,1

She called me last week after about two weeks of no talking and things were great we were talking like before and we're closer than ever in a non sexual way which was fine but I fucked up today and completely lost her trust and I hate myself for it.

321,"I’ll start off with context. I’m 29 and queer, started having casual sex a bit over a year ago. Saw a few guys, dwindled it down to one for a while. My fuckbuddy, we’ll call him Chris, is 28. We’ve been fucking over a year and I’ve sort of been exclusively fucking him for 5 months just because I’ve been most comfortable with things with him I wasn’t much interested in seeing anyone else. 


We have some seriously great sexual chemistry. But there’s zero social or emotional energy. We don’t really talk to each other about our lives. We don’t eat any meals together. We don’t talk about our interest. Just hitting the other up to link up. If I’m lucky he’ll put something on the TV before or after sex, but not really be engaged in it much, mostly napping. The only thing we do consistently before sex is smoke a joint... in silence.. looking at our phones. Finish the joint and get started. 

Chris starts to drop things like in the first 6 months like “I think about having sex with you.. All. The. Time.” “I want to see you more” “do you feel this good with other guys?” “We have the same birthday that’s gotta mean something” and as things progressed to the last 6 months and he’s saying “do you think it’s weird we cuddle after sex” “it’s strange that I’m able to have you sleep over, I never let anyone do that but I’m comfortable with you being here” etc. heck I thought he was going to burst in tears one time he was talking about how amazing the sex was we were in the middle of having.

I had to legit ask Chris what page we were on half way in because things started to confuse me with how he was talking. He said “I think we’re friends with benefits” and felt a little relieved that I could know what to expect of the relationship.

Things were fine for a while but then lately he’s been trying to control my tobacco use. I’m not so sure that’s within the boundaries of what he described as “friends with benefits”

My understanding is there can be two meanings of friends with benefits. Sometimes it’s people doing friend stuff and sex stuff, sometimes it’s just a more polite word for fuckbuddy.

Maybe I was hoping for the friend part to happen because I’m lonely as fuck, I don’t have any local friends, all my friends are 3 states away. I’ve realized it’s not gonna happen that way with him so I’ve started using a couple apps to find local queers I share interests with, but specifically saying I’m looking for friendship, but  also open to romance. Not looking for hookups. I’m sick of hookups right now. I want something of substance and to spend my time actually connecting with a person instead of just getting a good nut in my day. Well I’ve bumped into Chris on these apps, and he’s always logged on them. He can see whoever he wants, it’s not my business. 

Work, stress, illness, depression and insomnia has gotten the better of me this week. Chris didn’t seem interested in linking up earlier in the week on one of our usual days and I was secretly relieved cuz I’m just exhausted. He hit me up yesterday while I was at work but I was gonna be there late so I passed by asked if he’d be free the next day. He said yeah. So come today, I’m waiting for his text to invite me over. By 7pm I get impatient and text him a greeting. Noticed he read the text an hour later without replying. Waited an hour longer for a reply and then shot a text if I was being stood up. Another hour passes by and he said he just woke up and wasn’t standing me up.. it was a quarter after 10 pm by this time, I wasted my day waiting on him to invite me over and now he’s saying he was asleep and why it being so late was an issue when we do it late on the week days. I told him “the week day availability is tight, we never have a choice but to see each other so late. We’re both off on Saturdays and almost never meet so late on that day. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable for being upset” He agreed... maybe he only agreed to not irritate me any further and sabotage his chances of getting laid later cuz he pretty much knew by then I wasn’t fuck him after he put me off until an unreasonable time when we both have work the next day and he knows that.

I was a bit pissed he didn’t apologize for waiting to the last possible hour of the day to have me over when he said he was free today. I feel disrespected but I’m not gonna tell him that. I got upset and cried just a little.. (did I mention I’ve been stressed, sick, and sleep deprived?) I f

Now I’m just bitter. Back to having to tell myself “okay this guy really sees you as nothing other than a fuckbuddy, we only meet to get each other off, stop being frustrated over this” 

I’m really kind of turned off from seeing him now. But I don’t necessarily want to stop. I guess I just wish it were different. I wish he actually cared for me like a friend. But I can’t say that to him... 

I don’t necessarily know what to expect. I just feel like I’m going nuts in my head. I’m not in love with this guy at all, I barely know him outside of sex. I just wish there was more substance than just really good sex.",02Feb2020,1

My boyfriend brought it to my attention last night that I send him a lot of photos, and while he loves every single one.... he wishes they weren’t so frequent. 

I may have interpreted it incorrectly but that honestly made me feel dumb for sending him so many (which in my opinion isn’t that many). I am only trying to express how confident I am and how confident he makes me feel.

I know he enjoys the photos and getting to see me, but now I have this terrifying thought of “is he getting bored with looking at me?” 
Irrational question. I know. But I’m a little taken a back by this. I never thought of it being a bad thing to receive playful photos from your partner. 


So.. tell me your opinions! Don’t get mean or offensive, I’m simply asking for genuine and honest opinions.",02Feb2020,1

336,"I haven't been in a relationship for 2 and a half years now. That relationship only lasted 2 month because it was during an internship in another country. Before that was another 2 years. I haven't really tried dating because I have low confidence in myself since I started losing hair by the time I was 18. Just believed that I didnt deserve to be in one.

I've graduated school with a bachelor of science in a medical field but I currently work at a bar till I find a career. I work out 3 to 5 nights a week so I'm somewhat in shape. I dont really have any female friends that I'm close to anymore. They've kinda drifted away when they find a bf.  My friends are all moving further away or getting married so it's hard doing stuff on the weekends anymore. 

I dont try dating coworkers at the bar I'm working at but I've been more open to the idea but they all have kids, not my scene, or too young for me.  Don't want to be the creepy dude hitting on guests that come in because I dont really have game. I've never used dating apps because i dont think I'm photogenic or have that type of game. I've heard people say it's not worth trying. 

I just want to have someone close to me.  Be able to take them out and have someone to talk to. Only messages I get are group chats which kinda makes me feel like a loser. I'd be nice to work on a relationship. 

Any advice on what to work on and how to do it would help. Also any suggestions on how to put myself out there would be great.   Thanks for any advice.",02Feb2020,1

346,"I'm trying to move on from someone who made my life special.

 I've never really been happy my entire life. Nothing I did ever made me happy. I lost interest in all my hobbies. And I'm stuck inside all day because of having few friends and no car. 

It was a miracle I met her. We were both 18 when we met online. And we saw a movie on our first date and started seeing eachother officially after our 3rd date. We went pretty far and made dates together when we could. 

She made me feel wanted and loved. I tried dating before her and nobody gave me the feelings she did. This was special. And after about 6 months. She fell into a deppression and abuse from her mom. After basically being tortured for a month by her mom. She ended things. And we became friends... With benefits. Never really got around to anything much with that. Because it didn't feel right to me.

I was at her place and she confessed she still had feelings. But because of her mom she couldn't pursue the relationship. Then I started to go through stuff. And she was at a Christmas party when I called during a breakdown to have someone to talk to. 

I was on the streets with nowhere to go and just needed to talk to someone. She started yelling at me that I'm ruining her fun. And then Broke down crying. We didn't talk for awhile after that. And then I texted her. She said us breaking up was my fault and that she doesn't feel anything anymore... I think she was manipulated by her mom. But I tried to explain things. She was adamant on things. 

I've been kinda dealing with her being angry and things. And tbh I can't love myself. Never could. But finding someone I could love and spend my time with made me realize that love is a powerful feeling that made me motivated and want to better myself again. And I want to try and move on. Find someone I can love again who can make me feel that special feeling again. 

Problem is I'm stuck at home. Nobody to take me out. No car. Nothing social really goes on around me. And I'm shy as hell. 

So how can I put myself back out there. And get back into the dating scene. I've done online dating but I just can't hold a conversation because I've lost the ability to even have a meaningful one through text without freezing up.

Thank you to anyone who replies.",02Feb2020,1

348,"I know you’re probably reading this thinking: “well, obviously he needs to get help, get him help” but it’s much more complicated than that. My boyfriend has been depressed for as long as he can remember. He has expressed to me that he thinks about killing himself every day. Mind you, he doesn’t always seem depressed. It comes and goes but he has bouts where all he can talk about is how much better it’d be. Whenever something goes wrong, even just like him losing his vape, he yells about killing himself. My boyfriend is a very prideful person. He’s in the army (national guard so he goes once a month) which is the absolute worst thing for his mental health but they continually fuck him over. I finally convinced him to see a therapist who prescribed him medication for depression that also tends to help with ADD because he probably has that too even though he’s never been formally diagnosed and the army found out about this and literally took his gun away from him for the next time he was at drill which essentially humiliated him and turned his peers against him, making him more depressed. He has a three week training this August and he has expressed that he wants to physically harm himself so he doesn’t have to go. Of course, I tried to tell him this wasn’t a good idea but he says that if he goes he’ll be so miserable he actually might end up killing himself there. It’s really hard to get out of the army without some life repercussions that will make him feel like he has no hope for the future. He gets out in September but I’m very worried. On top of that his fucking therapist moved to California so now they video call through a site once a month but the last time he couldn’t figure out the site and just gave up. It was so hard to get him to see a therapist the first time because of how hard it is finding someone and he’s convinced it makes him a pussy. He’s convinced that him being gone would be better for the world and he’s just being a realist. He knows it’d be hard for me but I’d eventually get over it. He just told me tonight he’ll probably wait until I can pay the rent without him so he’s not leaving me with that. 
My ex-boyfriend actually killed himself and I had no indication that it was going to happen so I feel like if he does this I will blame myself for the rest of my life. 
I told him tonight that if I asked anyone what to do they’d tell me to alert someone about this and get him help but it’s hard for me because I don’t want him to hate me. He said if I sent him to a hospital he would DEFINITELY kill himself because it would be an embarrassment and it should be his right to do it without anyone stopping him. He’s very stubborn. I told him they’d have people trained to watch him 24/7 if he was on watch. He said he would starve himself. I said they’d tube feed him. He said he’d hit his head continually against the machine. I don’t know what to do. Part of me feels like if I do something about it it’s real and I don’t have the luxury of thinking this couldn’t happen to me because it has. 
I know you’re all going to tell me to get him help but if anyone has information on what they would actually do to make sure he would get better that would help. I also don’t want to expose him to all of his friends and family and the military since he’s been confiding in me. He regularly talks about the future and getting married and kids and his band getting famous and then turns around and says he wants to die today. I just need some convincing that this is the right move.",02Feb2020,1

Also like if I'm somewhere and she walking by she will do like this drive by kiss on the cheek.

351,"In order to pay my way through school this semester, I just started a job as the head barista for a big box bookstore in a town about 45 minutes from my house. I’ve worked for this store in the past and am coming back after a 5-year stint on the corporate side of retail with another company. Our café isn’t the *most* profitable in the world (thanks, Starbucks), and in coming into this position, it’s my job to turn the business around — one way being to improve my interpersonal skills and make customers feel at home; basically, tailoring conversation to the individual and treating them special in hopes that they’ll make frequent return visits.

With that being said, today I had a first-timer come in and ask for an off-menu item. No big deal. I told her I’d be happy to make it for her and even gave her a coupon to bring in next time. As I was making her drink, she started saying that she doesn’t get out of her town (a mountain community even smaller than my town, not too far away) and how nice it was to stumble on our business. Being rather familiar with the area she lives in and eager to work on my nice and friendly communication skills, I struck up a conversation with her about a trail I like to hike near her area. She proceeds to ask if I’m from around here, and I tell her where I’m from and that I’m just working here. 

Friendly conversation continues, even after I finish making her drink, and before she leaves, she whips out her phone and asks if she can take my picture. Now, anyone who knows me is well-aware that I don’t pose for pictures. I attempted to jokingly brush her off with a “What ever would you want with a photo of me?” to which she responded “I want to put it on Facebook to tell all my friends how awesome you’ve been! You’ve really made my day today.” In addition you my aversion for posing for photos, any of my friends will also tell you that I **never** put my face on the internet. Unfortunately, I am trying to increase our foot traffic and am not trying to offend anyone, so without thinking, I offer to take a selfie for her instead. She heads into the store to shop, and before she leaves the building, she asks me to remind her of the name of the trail I’d told her about.

Now, I am an incredibly skeptical person; I question **everything** and have a very difficult time trusting others and taking anything at face value. As of now, I’m feeling that I’ve committed a major oversight, and it’s making me sick. I’ve been off the clock for 9 hours now, and for 9+ hours, I’ve been replaying the scene in my head, wandering if she was being genuine or if there was something I missed, which may serve to secure some unforeseen level of detriment for me in the future — for three reasons:

1. She knows where I’m from/what town I reside in, which she kinda asked for.

2. She has my picture, which she asked for.

3. I willingly surrendered both of these things to her.

In attempt to ease my mind, I’ve scoured Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google search — you name it — searching my name, the business, and other various keywords and combinations that would sure fire lead me to this post she claimed to want to make, were it to exist. So far, my efforts have proven fruitless.

Does this seem cause for concern to anyone else, or am I just being paranoid?

tldr; seemingly friendly lady at work asked to take my picture, and my stupid ass gave her a whole selfie, despite my personal worries. Now, I’ve dwelled on it so much that I’m worried that she might hold some nefarious intentions that I didn’t see.",02Feb2020,1
352,"Hi guys, so this is gonna be my first post on here, and it’ll probably be way too long, but I just really need some objective advice rn.

So basically, I have these two friends, they’re sisters. One of them is 13 and the other is 18, so big age gap. I’m right in the middle in terms of age, so I talk to both of them because we’re friends through family. The older one was a TA to this one teacher in her high school. Recently though, he’s been under investigation for sexual harassment. She’s the one who reported him. She told a counselor who told the principal, who reported it to the police. This particular teacher is known for being a bit too friendly, and kind of invasive, especially with the girls in his classes. 

The younger one texted me about a week ago, saying “the police are at our house rn” and obviously, I was like “wtf why” and she explained this whole thing to me. 

Now, when I first heard about this, I was furious and confused, and worried and everything. I asked for more details but the younger one told me they weren’t allowed to talk about it, and that I shouldn’t tell anyone else what she had already told me. I didn’t pry more. 

A couple days after, I went out with a friend who goes to the same school as the older one. She had the same teacher. I didn’t mention anything about the case bc I assumed other people weren’t supposed to know. 

But then she was like, “Hey did you hear about the thing that’s happening with \[Teacher\]?” 

And I said, “How’d you know about that? I know the girl who reported him so her sister told me, so yeah I know.” 

She looked kind of surprised and said “Pretty much everyone at school knows. It’s \[Older Sister\] right? She’s been telling literally as many people as she can at school.”

I was a little shocked and *very* concerned that she would get in trouble for telling people. My friend showed me a couple of group chats where people were saying things like: 

“pray for \[Older Sister\]! She’s brave enough to bring light to these disgusting crimes!” 

“ban \[Teacher\], he’s a disgusting \[racial slur\]!” 

My friend, being a student of that teacher, was really surprised that he had been accused of these things. She knew he was bad, but she never thought he’d go that far. I asked her if we could change the subject, because I didn’t feel comfortable talking about this, and she didn’t bring it up again.

A couple of hours ago, I texted the older sister and asked if she needed to talk. She called me and we talked over the phone for around 2 hours. 

But during the phone call… she admitted to me that she exaggerated what happened to the counselor and changed her story with the police, and asked me what she should do. She told me that \[Teacher\] was looking at her ""lustfully"" and said some suggestive things, but didn’t actually try to kiss her or grab her like she told people. 

The younger sister keeps messaging me things like:

“I actually want that bitch \[Teacher\] to kill himself”

“That pig disgusts me.” 

So I assume she hasn’t told her sister what she told me. As far as I know, I’m the only one she’s told this to. And it breaks my heart that the younger sister, who’s a really sweet girl, is saying such horrible things. I don’t know what story to trust or what to say to either sister. Am I overreacting? What do I do? 

TL;DR: My friend falsely accused a teacher of extreme sexual assault and is spreading it around without telling anyone that her story is exaggerated. Her sister, and most people are blindly on her side, and I (as far as I know) am the only one she’s told about her story being false.",02Feb2020,1

355,"Hello Everyone,

I really need advice from a doctor!

I’ve been experiencing body pain for the last two days and it’s like a number 8 on the pain scale.

The pain starts from the back of my head, shoulders, back, sides, arms , hands and it radiates to my hips, pelvic area, and the bone in between my buttocks, and all the way down to my legs, and feet. Also after I urinate I feel itchy!

On January 10, 2020 I went to see a doctor but I was seen by the nurse practitioner. I had pain in both ears, and throat discomfort, I was coughing, body aches, chills but no fever. 

After I was examined by the nurse practitioner she said that I had otitis media in both ears and a throat infection. She prescribed antibiotics which was amoxicillin with calvunate 875/125 mg. A nasal spray to open up my nasal passages, Tylenol for the pain, and rubitussin for the coughing and phlegm. I felt better after I completed my antibiotic medication! A bottle of rubitussin, and used the Flonase spray for five days to be honest.

Do you think that I have a infection relapse?

*"" Throw the lumber over, man!

My neighbors (6 mo), a lady and her husband who have a daughter who doesn’t live there (later importance) got a dog around New Years who’s a puppy. He look to be 4 months old. The problem? They leave him outside ALL the time. In fact, it’s 1:20am and they just took him inside since at least noon yesterday. We haven’t seen any signs of physical abuse.
My housemates and I reached out to see if they wanted us to dog sit since a cold front was coming that week and the lady basically shoved him and all his stuff on us. Long story short the rest of the family still wanted the puppy and said the daughter would take him in but she has a few big dogs who might not like the puppy. No big deal everything ok right? Haha. Well it’s been 2 weeks since we started seeing him outside again and this is the latest and almost coldest (47F right now) they’ve left him out for.
I have a few videos during the days he was left outside. I’m going to call the animal shelter in the morning to get their take, but what do you think? It’s not abuse for a regular dog per my research, but does that change when it’s a puppy being left outside? During winter? Is this neglect or straight up puppy abuse cause he’s so young?
A question preferably to someone who works with animals, what’s the right thing to do here?

Thanks guys! Anything helps.",02Feb2020,1
359,"Sometimes I feel hurt by words or actions and don’t bring them in immediately, but when I explain my feelings at a later point, I feel immature and childish bring something up that people don’t remember because they didn’t think it was significant. Can someone explain how to let things go or what I should do? I’m a low emotional iq. 


I know people don’t mean to offend me, but I still feel upset sometimes.

Another thing I’d like advice on is sometimes I make an insensitive joke without meaning to be insensitive, and when I’m told that I bring up past actions (like things said) of the other part that are similar to what I said or did. Essentially I have a knack for noticing hypocrisies. 

I know it’s not right or healthy to act or think this way. It kind of feels like the whole “how can she slap” thing, I guess, but obviously if I bring something up from the past that wasn’t noteworthy to the person (they might not remember it) and I may or may not have been hurt by it emotionally.

363,"Well let me start this off with the problem I've been in some really bad relationships in the past and I'm really scared of getting hurt again, and even when I open up I still think about a girl that I fell crazy in love with and I close right back up.

Now for some context: When I was young my mom told me something that was way too much for a about seven year old op. She told me ""The day you were born was the same day I realized that I didn't love your dad anymore."" That being said I kinda ended up growing up with really strong emotional walls, I'd get mentally abused too so that didn't help my truat issues to be. Anyways, maybe it's not the same for everyone, but when you're a kid I feel like you're supposed to think that your parents are soulmates, but I never had that luxury. As the years went on it really showed and it hit a boiling point right before I turned 18 and he ran away and we went to go get him and then he ran away again right before I turned 19 to keep it short my dad has run away about 4 times. In any case my parents definitely did have an effect on my perception of love but what really fucked me over was a girl I fell madly in love with. We'll use her middle name to protect the innocent.

I feel in love with Jade after a full year of her being my bestfriend while simultaneously taking a bulldozer to my walls. We got together and it was everything I ever wanted someone who really cared. But a year later she dumped me and I couldn't ever figure out why I took it so hard, I actually felt depressed. One night 4 years later I figured it out, it was because I lost my girlfriend and my bestfriend on the same day and the day she broke up with me it felt like she was done fighting for me. Ever since  then I've been too scared to call anyone my bestfriend. So this right here redditors is my problem. Every time I try to open up I see her face, ever time I be myself I can see the parts of my personality that were made by her. Even last night I had a dream about our break up and I'm sick of it. It may not seem to strongly connected, but as I've taken steps to be a healthy better me I see the failure that was our relationship everywhere. Making me question at times if I'm even loving because I've grown so stupidly defensive about my heart.

I've always been an smart kid but never have I been more befuddled by something like this. I mean how do you get rid of a problem only you can see? You get me? No one else can deal with this but me and obviously I don't have a solution. And I guess before anyone asks no I'm not really depressed now, I kinda hate complaining about anything, but you see reddit I'm kinda backed into a corner because; my parents met at 14 and got married at 16, my oldest brother got a girlfriend the night of his divorce party, my second oldest brother got set up on a blind date and they've been together for 10 years and been married for two, and my sister turned a fuck boi into a working man that would die for her and the closest thing I have to a best friend has never been in a relationship. So not too many people in the family that would get it. So now I'm asking strangers on the internet for help. I am skipping over a ton but to be honest no one has 2 hours to read about my personal series of unfortunate events.

Listen I know this turned into a rant I'll sum it up in the tldr, but if I'm being honest I'm scared, of what I'm not sure. I'm not sure who's to blame or if there is any to blame. Crappy parents are par for the course especially when there best advice is always pray it away. Can't blame my lovers because I see more fault in myself than in them. Can't blame myself because my friends say that not fair. It's not all bad reddit I love life and every day I live. I just wanna be better, but my mental road block and my past just seem too hard to get over.

Tldr: Stupid, abused, trust issues having kid fell in love too young and now I can't seeing the ghosts of my past whenever I try to be a better person. If anything doesn't make sense just leave a comment and I'll answer really fast I'm not too good at seeing if my work is coherent.",02Feb2020,1

367,"I was reading the Askreddit thread on “what you regret most about your teenage years,” and it has caused me to write this post.

In elementary school I had one “friend” whom I would hang out with. When I started junior high we stopped talking, and ever since I have had zero friends.

Now as a high-school senior nothing has changed. I’ve never hung out with anyone outside school, never texted, called, FaceTimed or snapchatted. I have never been to a party or eaten dinner with someone. I have never had a girlfriend, or done much more than talk to a girl. I’m a loner, and I’m apathetic about life.

I’m not stupid because I do well in school. I understand social queues, and am not shy. My personal hygiene is fine, and I am a conventionally attractive guy. I’m not cringy or awkward.

I don’t know how to make friends. It was easier as a kid. I used to be able to ring on my friends doorbell and ask if he wanted to catch lizards, but now I don’t know what to say.

I can’t help but feel like I have wasted my entire high-school and teenage years. I have missed out on all those teenage things. My parents are robotic and talking to them is like talking to a brick wall. I feel like I am gradually losing it, and I’m not in a good place right now, and I need a friend.",02Feb2020,1

374,"Long story short: I liked a girl back in high school (April 2019), and she didn't reciprocate. We talked things through, ended up being better friends because of it. Still, it felt like hell the summer after graduation thinking about our old friendship. It took me forever to get over her completely. 

In December, she invited me to be her dance partner at her upcoming birthday party in April. I was very surprised, but of course I agreed. Part of me didn't want to see her again to avoid old feelings. A few weeks later, I went to her house to rehearse the dance. It's a lot more than I bargained for, and very intimate for a platonic dance. Luckily, the feelings have COMPLETELY faded. There's no awkwardness between us at all, but something still felt off. And I hate that I'm still making Reddit posts asking for advice regarding this individual. 

Anyway, I am not about the idea of seeing someone who I wanted to stay in the past on a weekly basis, in addition to a lot of people from high school who I thought I'd never see again. I was having a great time moving on, and I thought I already had. There's a lot of pressure squeezing in four hour dance rehearsal sessions every week to meet the April deadline, especially with my full-time university schedule. I absolutely despise the idea of this whole thing occupying my time until April. How can I get out of this?",02Feb2020,1
375,"I dropped out of school in year 11 (10th grade) because i just couldn’t handle the stress and pressure that school put on me. At that point in my life i was a depressed mess.

Anyway since then i’ve been doing a lot better, got a great girlfriend, awesome group of mates and been going to the gym a lot. But with my 18th birthday at the end of this year i can’t help but stress about what i’m gonna do with myself. I’ve tried several jobs but it just seems like as soon as i have the slightest bit of responsibility placed on me it just becomes too much and i bail out. My parents are super supportive and they just tell me that my path is going to be different, but i’m struggling to see any paths that could be options for me.

I have stuck in some kind of situation:

I need my own money for some purpose.

There are two options:
1) I stay at home and go for regular work in the supermarket.
2) I go abroad and work on the factory.


1st option has two cons: 1) Here I gotta work 10 months for needed amount of money and beyond the country only for 4 months. 2) If I stay here there's a chance I go to the army (but I don't want to. We have an awful army with 18 months of being there. And our country is kinda spontaneous so it's 50/50 I go to the military).

2nd option has two cons either: 1) I am away from home for 4 months alone (I'm 18) and I'm not able to make friends so I'm going to be completely alone for those 4 months in other nation. 2) There I'm going to work at least 10 hours a day and maybe for 6 days for a week.

So, I want to go abroad but given that I can't make friends and I should be working as a slave I'm not sure I could bear that (I have an experience living in another city alone for 3 months and one week living in another country).",02Feb2020,1

383,"My roommate (22/F/USA -- same as me) told me today that she doesn't think we should flush our toilet paper down the toilet. She also informed me that she has never flushed her toilet paper. Please allow me to elaborate on why this is an issue (context required for optimal understanding): 

There is a small trash can in the bathroom that I share with my five roommates. I've been noticing that this trash can fills up abnormally fast, and often overflows (even when it's not full, there are always multiple balled-up pieces of toilet paper on the floor of the bathroom. I usually will just pick them up using another piece of toilet paper and throw them in the trash can myself-- always assumed these were just tissues or something).

But today I was informed that these are indeed not tissues, rather they are my roommate's USED pieces of toilet paper.  I found this out because my roommate explained to me that we should ""never flush toilet paper"" because we have a ""septic tank toilet"" and that she ""never flushes hers."" In our lease, however, there is no mention of a sensitive septic plumbing system... our landlord never mentioned this either (and he is quite communicative about potential problems in our unit). Also, the rest of my housemates (the four of us) all flush our toilet paper all the time, and there is never an issue with plumbing aside from very infrequent toilet-clogging events that are easily fixed by plunging (shit happens -- ha ha ha). I also did some research online about septic tanks in the US especially and for US toilets/tanks, it says we should be fine to flush toilet paper.

Now here's my question: how on earth do I explain to my roommate that she CAN and SHOULD be flushing her toilet paper? And if she absolutely refuses, how can I explain to her that she needs to make sure that her toilet paper actually gets in the trash can, and not just near it? She is one of my best friends so I don't want to verbally attack her or hurt her feelings, but picking up her poop-covered toilet paper is unfortunately where I draw the line (for reference she has literally never taken out the bathroom trash... she's kind of lazy). Should I maybe have my landlord talk to her to inform her that he is okay with us flushing toilet paper, and she shouldn't have to worry? I don't know what to do, please help, I am so disgusted and confused by this, thanks!!!",02Feb2020,1

385,"So I am on a phone, so sorry if I make any mistakes. I am a freshman in high school and I’m somewhat friends with this girl in P.E. we started having small conversations here and there and then only officially started hanging out 2 weeks ago. I don’t know why, but I feel uncomfortable around her. (Let’s call her Isa) Now my personality is different around different people. With Isa it’s just a awkward feeling; in just 2 weeks she reveals so much about her life (I know people can reveal a lot in their life in a short amount of time, but bare with me) and is extremely touchy. (Mind you I have a personal bubble) The only reason I stay around her because during those 2 weeks she reveals that she is in a abusive household and she doesn’t really have anyone else around, so I try to get comfortable and comfort her by staying around her. A reason why I don’t talk to the school about the abuse is because she tells me she doesn’t to run away is that she has a little sister and another on their way too and I don’t know her last name. I feel as if I tell the school and the school calls child protection services. She will be taken away from her sister and will blame me and possibly hurt me in the process or since she’s almost 18 they won’t do anything about it, but tell her that I told them which I also don’t think would have a pretty after math. Mentioned how Isa is also very touchy; when I’m walking away she would grab my arm and make me stay with her even though I needed to get to class making me late. When I try to walk away and excuse myself she would get a little aggressive, when she lets me leave she would sometimes hug me extremely tight where I can’t breath, and she knows this. I may sound like a complete A-hole and that Isa might have attachment problems, but the level of how uncomfortable I feel is almost through the roof. I do truly worry about her on what’s going on in her household, then after getting worried comes with a feeling of uncomfortableness when she’s starts getting touchy. I don’t know how to deal with it I’ve staying up for a couple of nights thinking about this on what I should do.

386,"I(f) have a friend(f) who says “your so weird.” But the way she says it is like in a “omg lol ” way.   
For example, when she yawned I placed my finger in front of her open mouth as if I was gonna put it inside. (I do this just to mess around with my friends.) And I accidentally touched her teeth, (I know gross) and I acted awkward afterwards. And then she smiled and said “your so weird.” It wasn’t an uncomfortable smile. This isn’t the first time she has said that. 


So I naturally have cold hands and I LOVE placing them on people because I love to see their reactions when they jump. It’s funny lol. Anyways her belly was showing and I placed like the back of my hand on top of her stomach. She then said “oh my gosh stop” while she was laughing.I stopped after like 2 times and she was like “your so weird” but not in a rude way. She has done other things like for example, her dad gave us a ride home and she sat in the back with me. She didn’t sit in the front seat. She didn’t even sit on the other side, instead she sat like right in the middle of the back seat next to me. I was kinda surprised. Unfortunately, she is that type of friend. A friend who is nice to everyone. On Christmas, she made little baggies with scrunchies and a candy for her friends with a tiny note. On mine she put “I know you told me you lost ur scrunchie so I got you one.” Very thoughtful. To add on, when she is focused, she ignores me, but she tried to answer. Like when she was looking at her phone for a location I talked and she didn’t respond until after. There’s times where she doesn’t respond. 


I need to know if these are hints that she might  possibly maybe have feelings for me? She is sorta religious so maybe she does but she is denying it because it might be against her religion? I don’t know her exact religion but it is part of her life because she goes to church. I have asked her if she is straight and she responded with yes. But maybe she is covering up her sexuality because she is confused? She  has a boyfriend which I KNOW is a sign that she has no attraction to me but  if I believe that she does, my feelings are going to take over and I will forever think that maybe she’ll end up liking me,etc etc. 


So I’m asking, is there a chance that she may be trying to deny her sexuality? Is there a chance that she might have some sort of feelings towards me? Or am I just stupid",02Feb2020,1

My mom used to kick me out on the streets and him and his mom always took me in, fed me, and made sure I was safe when my own mother wouldn’t. The last time I had seen him I was 8 months pregnant with my second child. We always made plans for him to meet my son once he was born in September but things always come up for the both of us, work, my kids, etc. He passed away January 1st so he never got to meet him. He was so proud of how far I had come and how much I devoted my life to being a great mom considering the mom I had. It’s been the hardest loss for me in my life. It’s been the toughest year of my life. I wanted to give up so many times but my kids held me back. Also he loved all his friends and just wanted them to take the step in the right direction. He had many close friends and best friends. In fact I know that one had a child after he passed and made his child’s middle name after him. This was something I had planned on doing before I ever found out this person was having a kid. Anyway he had his child and made the middle name our friends first name as the middle name. December 23rd I found out I was pregnant with my third.

Would you ask the person if they are okay with it even though you NEVER speak with them? Also would you ask the passed loved ones mom if it’s okay? On one hand I don’t want to upset anyone and I really don’t know if anyone would care, and on the other hand I’m like nobody owns a name, he was my best friend too, I have every right.

Now i really dont like saying this just because it might sound idk shallow i guess, but im an ass man, meaning i like a girl with an ass i can grab, thick from the backside and curvy hips. My problem is now every girl i go out with, they could be great and have a pretty face, but they dont have that physical feature that i like. Is this something i would stop caring about once i get to know her better and actually fall in love with her? 

Its funny because with my ex we met online and i fell for her immediately without caring too much about her body, and when we finally met in person nd got physical only then i realized i got really lucky that it ticked all my boxes.

Maybe im still comparing? Im not sure, id love to hear mens thoughts who had preferences and just dropped them all or if they just dont care and their sex life is still great.

395,"[22 M] Thinking about my teenage years and earlier, i was always the guy who would have gone off his road to help anyone in need, people and friends have disappointed me many times.

After coming to live in a big city, I've always felt overwhelmed, stressed out and always pushed to my limits in a bad way, every insecurities i may have had got magnified a thousand times.
I've been through stress induced anorexia, depressive episodes and i was confused most of the times, just trying to escape from these worrying sensations because i couldn't do anything about them.

After many many problems i had to face, i convinced myself to become more and more selfish and hypocrite to people,that this would have solved the problem, because the problem has been my ingenuity and to fit in the big city i should behave like anyone else. 

I find myself trapped in this mindset now, it has become my second nature to take advantage of the situations, I've become a bittered adult who can only see what's wrong, i can't feel no more feelings, the only thing I know is that I'm confused and scared and constantly ready to react to something bad wich although keeps happening. 

I don't know if it's right to be that way, I'm not good and I'm fighting for my objectives and my sanity since 4 years without a pause.

Everything i did was for the sake of my objective, i sacrificed every possible relationship, every moment of peace but all of these sacrifices transformed me in a barely functional human being  incapable to even care for himself without falling asleep on the table while studying after a sleepless night of insomnia.

397,"He is okay to us. He has been around since forever and we only moved in 4 years ago. He treats me like his daughter but I really don't like him at all. I have a bad relationship with my real father so no, it's not that I feel he is replacing him or any of that stuff. This guy buys me stuff and keeps trying to get me to call him dad. I have been trying to buy stuff myself with my own card (I get visa gift cards since I am underage and dont have anything) but he always insist on buying stuff for me. I am 14 so I can't do much right now but I absolutely despise this guy. I just wanna clear the good stuff before getting to the bad stuff though. He gave my mom a job and helped out with finances and real estate at the beginning though. Here is the bad stuff though; 



We used to live in California, it was only me, my mom and my sister. He was entirely out of the picture. Then we moved here to Nebraska with him, so I guess I started resenting him from then on. When I was 7, we moved there for only 6 months. But one night, my family (he stayed home) went out to shop for a bit. My sister and I came back to our shared room when we got home and noticed a charger. We googled the model and everything and saw that it was a camera instead. My sister told my mom about it but her boyfriend tried to excuse it by saying it was for the Wi-Fi router. My sister was embarrassed and even hid for a while in the shower. I didnt believe the guy for one second but I was 7, what could I do? Fast forward, we came back to NE again. Everything was fine til 2 years later. He is arrogant and tries to act above all. He keeps spreading misinformation just to make himself sound smart. He is very judgemental too which makes this ironic. I know I sound angsty but here is where the biggest issue really starts;



He starts getting into this app and coding, which was the worst thing to ever happen in the household. The app is basically a god send for control freaks. My mom's boyfriend starts putting lights and switches into this app, making it so that the only way to turn on some lights or use switches is by using the app. At first it stuck inside his room. It was his thing, we didnt care. Then he puts out fucking phones in there. So now, he can track where me, my mom, and my sister are. At the start, I was always friendly with him. I was playful and everything and made friends with him because I wasnt able to make any other friends in Nebraska, I just didnt feel I fit in at all with other the kids. Anyways, I found out that he was tracking us, my mom and my sister had no idea. My sister still doesnt know and now my mom knows but she doesnt even like it (she wont say anything because she doesnt want to argue but you can tell she hates it). I made him take me out of there and my sister and my mom but he refused to take my mom out of there.




 We move to a new house 1 year later and surprise, there are cameras everywhere. My sister moved to Los Angeles so I am alone entirely. He has money upstairs in his closet that he cant put in his bank for some reason and he is worried that the manager is going to get in or something and get it. Okay I get it besides the fact that the cameras point literally everywhere but the doors or any entrance. The camera always faced the living room and kitchen. One time I was trying to learn to cook. He has a google home thing and for some reason, he thought it would be funny to do text to speech and ask me what I was doing from there(he wasnt even home and the only way he can see is by using the camera). I put everything away and left to my room. I don't like to spend time downstairs or outside anymore. In May he tried to change the lights on the stairs. This is where I blew up. The only lights programmed at the time was the kitchen and you can control is by a google(?) Lightswitch. But he thought it would be a good idea to program the stairs lightswitch so that the only way to turn it on is through his phone. I tried to use the manual switch but it would just turn back off. I hated it. You can use the app to do the same and control it but I didnt have much storage on my phone + I didnt want to rely on a phone just to make sure that I wouldn't fall down the stairs (which are very steep) in the dark all because he was too lazy to just use the switch like a regular person. He always goes on about how if I dont like something, I can just tell him and he'll handle it. I did that and he didn't do anything, kept saying that it was his house and whatnot. This was wrong on my part but I had a complete meltdown and couldn't handle it anymore. I took every camera down, even tried to take down the camera on the ceiling with a broom. He was pissed and my mom screamed at me (I talked to her about this before the meltdown. I even talked to her about the camera in her room, that she apparently had no idea about til I mentioned it yet still defended him). I locked myself in my room and avoided him entirely which was easy as we were leaving to visit LA the next day for 2 weeks. My mom left to Salvador and I stayed with my Sister in Lancaster so we had time apart).  When we got back, I continued ignoring him. This went on for a while and my mom got mad at me, she even called me and said that if I wanted her to choose, she will never choose me over him which just made me want out of the house even more. The issue must have drifted away because the cameras were all down but he tried to hide on to only face the top of the living room. Again, doesnt even cover the doors at all. He is stubborn and always tries to pick fights with my mom over little things. He belittles us but tries so hard to act like a good guy. He still buys us stuff and everything. I hate it though. My mom wants to buy a house but (thank god for me) doesnt want to leave it in his name. She thinks that if anything happens to her, he will give it to his family instead and kick me out. He is very family oriented but not in a good way. He lets them get away with so much shit it's not funny. I am just going along with the dumb happy family act for my mom at this point. I don't know if I am delusional but I feel like he sexualizes me too. I have seen him stare at my chest and even look my ass. I always avoid him the best I can. I don't know if it is real or just a delusion because of my real dad's (I have no problem calling him dad because honestly the word means absolutely nothing to me) influence on my life (he molested me and my sister 11 years ago). Once my mom is at work, I just hide in my room and wait til he leaves so I can go and get food. He always drives me to school though and my crush once saw me in the car with me. He stared for a bit (my crush) til I checked my phone and I never felt more ashamed of myself thinking that he may possibly think this guy is my dad. Shit, my moms boyfriend keeps trying to get me to call him dad, always asks ""when are you going to call me dad"" every single fucking day. 




I want to get him out of my life, I just want to leave this house but I am scared that he may get abusive towards my mom (he was shown signs about it). I just wish she would stop trying to defend him every single time something happens. I don't even understand why she would do it. I wish I can just buy a house and move away from him. I know she sounds bad here but she is great, she is just blind for some reason. There is never an instance where they dont fight yet she acts like it is normal. She takes care of me and used to work a fuck ton just to help me live through the day. She even invested in therapy for me which I gave up soon after. 



Tdlr; my mom's boyfriend is a complete control freak, I feel like he sexualizes me, but tries to act and make me call my dad, my mom has told that she will always choose him over me, I just wish he was out of my life.",02Feb2020,1

Last night I received a text that my estranged mother was ill. Last time I saw her was 5 months ago where she was still an alcoholic.

402,"I listened to a talk between a psychiatrist and one of their clients and client's problem really seems to resemble my own problem. I apologize if this isn't the correct place to post this.

I'm 26M. So, I've been in college for about 8.5 years (5.5 years at community college, 3 years at my current university) projected to graduate this May. I don't remember exactly when but probably during junior high, and moreso in high school, a habit manifested in me where if things got ""difficult"" for me in my classes, I'd default to half-assing those specific classes (AP/honors) and just spend my time after school playing video games, maybe because if I failed in games, it'd be okay because I could keep trying and getting better and essentially it feels like theres no ceiling for what I could accomplish for putting my all into video games. So, fast forward to college and basically a shit show happens during my community college years, extending my time there to 5.5 years(from 2-3 years). I get into my first semester courses, get mediocre grades because I refused to do homework in my tougher classes and, again, would spend all my time after class playing video games. Then, it got worse to the point where I was failing my hardest classes (which were multi-variable calculus and calculus-based physics during that period) and re-taking them multiple times, putting in the same low amount of effort. I'd always tell myself ""I'm going to work my ass off and get an A"" only to fall back to the same vicious cycle.

I transfer to university and the deep regret I had in my failures as a student (and as a person) essentially fueled me to work harder and my grades drastically got better. However, I still fall back to the same stupid cycle a few times here (failed basically the two hardest courses of my degree because I refused to try). I want to change. I realize this is my problem now and I want to be able to put in 100% effort, regardless of the outcome.",02Feb2020,1
403,"TL;DR: I no longer experience empathy and have become an asshole to my family and friends. What can I do to fix that.

—


I’m very conscious of my actions and how I behave, but I have been recently getting heated up much more quickly than before. My temper is shorter, I have lost an enormous amount of selflessness— which was something I loved about myself— and have replaced that with selfishness. It feels awful and disgusting when I reflect on what I’ve done and how I behaved, but I still continue to act like an insensitive asshole.


My current demeanor, at most times, is disrespectful and impolite. More importantly, I have lost the ability to empathize. I feel like I’m living the worst version of myself and I want to put in the work to fix things and to stop being an asshole. I just don’t know how.


I have had numerous sessions of self-reflection on my behavior and I understand that something is wrong with me and my mannerism. I have become more and more anxious and worried due to suddenly being so apathetic and incapable of empathy.


I understand that Reddit might not be the best place for counseling, but I have managed to distance myself from many of the people that once cared about me.

College has really been a great experience for me. In high school I had few friends and generally did little besides exist. Now I've made many friends and really grown as a person.

However, right now I feel I am at a crossroads. Despite the fact that I've had a good time so far in college, I still feel unfulfilled. I'm really worried that someday I'll look back at my time in college and realize that I spent it poorly and just pissed it away. Right now I mostly just focus on doing well in my classes, and hanging out with my friends. In my current existence, time passes quickly, and before I know it an entire quarter has passed. I'm looking for a way to slow down the time.

While in school, I've tried joining clubs and professors' labs. Often I enjoyed going to a few meetings but became kind of burnt out after a few weeks. I've never tried joining a frat or greek society, as I have never considered that to fit my personality, but I am open to the suggestion. I've considered trying intramural sports, but never gone through with it. I don't go to a huge school, so my options are somewhat limited

I apologize if this post has been somewhat rambly. I'm just afraid that once I graduate my life will return to how it was before, where I had little excitement or human connection.

Shes gorgeous has a great body. Her parents are pretty well off and funny too. Everyone respects her. She is always getting good grades since kindergarten (where i met her and now were adults. Shes always seemed like she had a perfect life. And she also has a really good paying job, place to live, car, etc. she takes really good care of herself. And always puts herself first to where people expect it from her and are used to hearing no from her. That’s probably the most biggest thing im jealous of.

I just wish i had these things. I learned everything late including how people are because i was so naive. Trusted people too much and never said no. Now im seen as someone someone could run over out in the world if they know me enough. Feels like im forced to identify with it bc if i say no nobody f-inf respects it.

So for the past year or so life has gotten insanely busy. Many life changes and I started a business which is thankfully slowly becoming more successful.

As my working hours and chores have increased, however, my level of overall enjoyment in life seems to be decreasing. I'm super busy. Productive. But I'm not having fun.

She is often incredibly condescending, angry and almost impossible to have a conversation with. At least for me. I see her talking to our bosses and other co-workers, but when I talk to her I only get short replies. Often delivered in an arrogant tone.  
What bothers me most is that she gets incredibly angry when I make mistakes, and so far it's only been small mistakes that are easy to fix. I'm new to this job and I even see some of the more experienced people at my job make the same mistakes (example: forgetting to put pieces of cucumber on the breakfast table).

I’ve never had a job that I wasn’t great at until now. The job I have now requires being careful and detail oriented. I work with a team and if I make a mistake other people have to catch it on the next shift. I work soon because I work nights vs on other shift they work by twos. So everything that happens in my shift is on me. 




I’ve never been very detail oriented. I can get a lot of work done very quickly, but my methods are not careful. I’ve made a few mistakes since I’ve started. All due to missing details. It’s as if I have to mentally turn on being careful vs it being a natural thing I do all the time. How do I make being careful a habit? I would like to excel at my job. 




I am a Med aide (not certified), but am working towards becoming a nurse. I definitely feel a disconnect from this job vs my pay jobs. This is the first time I’ve done school and work together with a demanding job. I don’t plan on being here forever, and maybe I don’t care enough?

I have never ever thought of put myself in a situation of cheating and I could never bring myself to disrespect my fiancé like that.

Some back story:  A friend of mine and I recently went out for drinks Christmas Eve to which we had a very cute hippyish bartender. Now my buddy always has this weird habit of saying something like “man that chick at such and such wanted you.”  But he always and I mean always says this in front of my fiancé. It makes it awkward and honestly most of the time it either never happens or I am oblivious to it. Now this last time we were out he said it again and I really don’t remember being hit on or even talking with this girl but I can remember she was cute had a great smile, funny and played great music. About 3-4 weeks later we return this time with our SOs she again is there but this time unwittingly I find myself talking briefly about either a song that had come on or ordering another drink. At one point a song comes on and I was like “oh hell yea” and kind of half assed sang along for a second and I caught her shooting me a funny look with a crooked little smile. This happened a couple other times in different ways through the night and it got my head thinking maybe she did. 

Now I have had a great relationship with my fiancé but in the recent months we’ve been arguing a lot more  and I’ve felt as though I just live in the house to pickup after her as she does school and work or I cook and clean while she does homework. I realize this may sound like excuses to go have an affair or an inappropriate relationship but I feel like it’s been more than that. Things we used to like to do together we don’t do anymore or she has no interest in anymore again not an excuse but maybe a reason why my mind is wandering. There is just something with this other girl I can’t shake. I feel the need to get to know her more that we have things in common we could bond over. I just don’t know where I want it to lead to.

431,"My problem is that I'm 18, in 6th year in Ireland. I heard in school this week a story about a girl in 3rd year. Apparently, she posted a video of herself mastrubating to a groupchat of girls in her year. They're all probably about 18. Now these girls, the very popular ones in the year, recorded this video and sent it around the school to loads of people. It gets even worse because even though I don't know this girls name I do know that she is in the special class. People if 5th year have seen it, 17 year old boys, and everyone is gossiping about her. I only heard about it two days after it happened and I hope the guidance counselor has been informed by now but what if she hasn't"" I don't know whether to step in though because I feel like its not my place given I don't know the girl but my own brother is autistic and I'm just thinking about how if someone exploited him like that I'd want to know. It's so confusing. If I do tell the counselor I don't want people to know it was me because the girls who will get in trouble for it have sisters or brothers close to my age and it's a small town. I also don't want to have the people who told me about it in the first place involved if I tell the counselor it's them who I heard it about because even though they have nothing to do with it they didn't ask to be involved. Plus the police might need to get involved because it counts as distribution of child pornography? Please, help me figure out what to do",02Feb2020,1

433," 

Hey guys, girlfriend and I have received news that Japan is restricting Chinese citizens that hold a passport from Hubei province from entering the country. This has taken effect on February 1st, 2020.

I hold a Canadian passport but my girlfriend holds a Chinese passport issued from Hubei. She left Wuhan 10 days before the lockdown (January 13th, 2020) and has been in Singapore since then. We have booked flights and hotel to Japan for February 4th, 2020, where we will spend 12 days before heading to Canada.

I've tried to research the travel restrictions and have called the hotline but it is intentionally vague with regards to Chinese citizens who have NOT been in China for at least 14 days. The lady on the hotline has suggested that I reach out online to see if there has been anyone in a similar situation that has been able to enter Japan with a Chinese passport issued from Hubei.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how we should proceed? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",02Feb2020,1
434,"So I went to see my doctor a few weeks ago because the stress of school was getting to me (second semester architecture student). I've been in treatment for depression for a couple of years but it felt as though my medication wasn't really working for me anymore. 
In the span of 2 weeks I've been diagnosed with, irregular heartbeat, anxiety, ocd, add and a severe depression (I'm not suicidial or at risk of hurting myself or others btw) . I'm bouncing around between doctors ans psychiatrists, have been taken off the medication I was on and have gotten something else  (more to come) which, takes a month or more to work. 
I'm currently just waiting to go to a new facility to get me some other medication for all of this, as it has already been established that the new I'm on won't even help. I will have an appointment within the next month but untill then I'm basically just suffering. I've been on sick leave for the past 3 weeks and is supposed to go back to school tomorrow, but I feel even worse than when I initially went on sick leave. 
We're going to begin our semester project tomorrow so if I'm going on sick leave again I'll most definetly have to redo the two semesters so I'm just at such a loss right now on what to do. 
Should I suffer through the next few months or go on sick leave again? I can't afford to quit school and reapply next semester because I'm depending on student aid and won't be able to afford my apartment without.

435,"Some background info: I’m currently 17, I have 2 younger sisters, one being 6 years younger and the other one 2 years younger. My parents have been split since I was 9 or 10 yrs old.

My issue has been around for a few years but recently come up again, my dads trying to get into contact with me again and I’m basically ignoring his texts almost completely, he’s offered to go out for dinner, see sport games ect and I’ve left him on read and I need to know if what I’m doing is right, and if I was just judging him off his character rather than his genetic relationship towards me, I would of blocked him on everything, except he is my dad and I’m unsure if my feelings should equate to me cutting him out of my life for the foreseeable future.

Everything below this is basically a summary on why he is an A Grade Asshole.

the main traits he has are:

* control freak 
* Alcoholic
* Abusive
* Snoop

He’s a control freak down to how many grams each person is allowed to eat for dinner (this happened, our food was measured)

He has lost his license several times before and after the divorce, he also lives really far away from my school so him losing his license meant we had to get up 1 hr earlier to catch a bus to school compared to a 20 min walk from my mums house

He’s abusive, has dragged my step brother out of the house for standing up to his douchness multiple times, this is awful considering that he moved into the house with his wife and not the other way around so he’s not even throwing him out of his house it’s his mums

And he’s a snoop, he would go through me and my sisters phones when we were a young age, I first got a phone at 10 so I could contact my mum when I was at my dads and for only that purpose and he would snoop through my messages ect, this continued until I was 13 or 14 which is when we had a really big argument and I said I’m going to mums and I haven’t been back since.

There’s also other things he’s done which when I heard thought was completely made up but turned out to be true, one of theses things are when we travelled to Fiji when I was around 8, he swam naked to a nearby island and got beaten up by the islanders.

Multiple times police have showed up to my house notifying my mum they found him lying drunk on a bench throughout my childhood.

Due to us arguing all the time, I’ve had little to no contact with him for multiple years now, am I in the right for this idk what I should do, hes my dad but hes also a prick and whenever my mum tells me stories about how he would get drunk and ruin friendships and once even almost ended my life (my mum left me home alone with him when I was a baby, when she got home he answered the door fully naked, drunk and holding me by my neck) I always get angry which I think is understandable.

I also have an older half brother (we share the same mum) who grew up with my dads parenting and absolutely hates him, and given the chance I would not doubt he would severely hurt/dismantle my dad. (my half brother has Aspergers and is in his 20s now).

So I met this guy, and he started to fall in love with me as the  days pass by, it’s not even a month since we’ve known each other, at this point he admitted how much he loves me and wants to be with me, he is the most understanding, honest, kindest person I’ve ever met. However, I can’t date him as my family have  some beliefs of dating finding it wrong, only excepted right before marriage. Basically either marriage or no boyfriend, which we both obviously aren’t ready for marriage. Now I am at fault to this whole situation as I sometimes can’t tell apart of what is a joke and not, jokingly telling him I love him, or even getting hung up in the moment and flirting. I didn’t intentionally want to hurt his feelings I still like him as a friend.  I feel like I’m not developing the same love he has for me, I feel like I’m forcing myself to love him, but he is too precious to break his heart. Quickly realizing this is a big mistake and I fucked up big time as he just broke up with his girlfriend who was not very loyal towards him, him also having a bit of trust issues, so I can’t tell him right away that I want to break up. He even made me promise that I won’t break his heart, in which I don’t know how to say no.

I was a bit off-put seeing his car parked there without any heads up notice.

446,"
 Women want nothing to do with me and it feels like a lost cause. I used to feel pretty confident and was happy enough but over the past several months all of that has gone away. The realization that nobody wants me has just gotten rid of any desire or drive to improve or do anything. I don’t want to live my life alone so what’s the point of doing anything if I’m just going to be alone in the end anyways?

I have tried very hard to improve, I started dieting last February and I’ve lost about 85 pounds. I don’t feel good or accomplished about this, I feel the most debilitating shame and disappointment that I have ever felt. I feel like I was an idiot to think that it would have any impact on how people see me. I have grown to hate myself, I try my hardest to never look in mirrors or take pictures of myself. Anytime I see them I am just overcome by negative emotions, it is not an exaggeration to say that it ruins my day.

I have gotten to the point where I consider killing myself every day. The amount of sadness I feel from when I wake up until I go to sleep is debilitating unless I smoke weed. I get that some people are okay with living alone but that is not me. I see no value in any life I could live where I’m by myself and I don’t really want to prolong that sort of life.

I know their just friends and that's not the thing that bothers me. I simply hate how she does nothing to spend time with me and how she is more loving to my fucking friend than me.

Basically without sounding like I'm just ranting and hate everything, I want to express that:
It was extremely stressful as lots of work came in and the new lady couldn't do much yet. Whenever I gave her work, she just said ""what do I do"" without even thinking or trying first. Then she went home early which I'm sure she wouldn't have done if managers had been around. Should I tell?
The clients and some co-workers were extremely pushy to the point of being intimidating. Physically looming over my desk or heatedly blaming me and not letting me speak. To clarify I work at a law firm so these things are not usually tolerated. I'm not sure how to spin this in a positive way or if I should mention it.

462,"Alright reddit, here's the deal. I'm 20, working minimum wage and live with my dad. I should start off by saying I'm not perfect in that I don't really have much money saved up because I did a lot of traveling when I was in a privileged position of not having to pay any bills. That was not a smart move on my part and I own up to that. 

My dad is an alcoholic who has been struggling with recovery off and on for years and it's been very bad the past two. He'd been attempting (unsuccessfully) to hide it from me, as well as the financial situation we were in. He lost his job and stopped making payments on the house and now we're about to be evicted next month. I'd been trying to figure out how to handle the foreclosure of the house, but I really didn't know where to get a lot of the information necessary and on top of that my dad was in and out of the hospital for anything from drunken falls to self-starvation. Just a couple nights ago he was arrested after leaving to buy food and alcohol while drunk, hitting a car, fleeing the scene, and then hitting a sign on the way into our subdivision. They let him out of jail after a night, but of course he has a lot of legal repercussions and may be looking at more jail and/or hefty fines. 

And that brings me to the thing I really need advice on. I have to move, and soon. The question is, do I move into a two bedroom apartment and keep living with my father or move out on my own? If I live with him and he is unable to pay/help pay rent because of the financial grave he dug himself, I'll end up footing the bill and I simply cannot afford rent on a two bedroom house plus utilities and necessities with my minimum wage job. If I move out by myself, I will be able to afford everything should I appropriately budget with a little bit of help in the beginning and if I need extra income I can always pick up an extra part time job on the side, but I won't have to worry about relying on a second  job. However, that puts my dad in a tough place as he may have nowhere else to stay but I or my aunt's couch. I really would love to live alone and in more pressuring situations where I have to fending for myself I tend to thrive, but I don't want to make my dad homeless in the process, even if he put himself in this situation.

It's not my fault they were so stupid with money. They trusted our snake of a landlord that he'd actually give us a working car. It's not my fault they decided to ask for hundreds for Christmas from the same person who tricked us. It's not my fault they spend $200 a month on weed a month, yet owe $2500. I don't know how they could go from having $3500 to owing $2 500, but they did it. I live with my parents and have to deal with every idiotic thing they do. They never asked me, but I gave them $500 in total helping them with various shit. I've paid their electric bill 2 times, I've been asked to give them cigarette money, my Dad asked for weed money, and they ask for money constantly for small stuff. They've owed money more times than I can count, and every month they beg for money from the family. They are on disability, and they don't make enough money to live at the home we're in. They've worked before, but they always tell me that it wouldn't work out, that dad's medicine is too expensive without Medicaid or some other bullshit.

I could give them money or sell shit, but it's not my problem. I've been smart with my money. I'm in college and don't owe a dime in debt. I want to move out to somewhere cheap where I can spend as little as possible because of holy fuck. I don't want to be like my parents, and I don't want to be with them when they have to finally confront the mess they made.",02Feb2020,1
468,"Alright, People of Reddit, this is a long one, plus I'm on mobile so, mercy? Also I posted here before weeks ago, so I think I can post again.

I an in a weird place in life. I'm gona try to be brief, but I need to be clear, so, in a way, this is gona be a short story, but not a book. Be warned, after this I hit the ground running with heavy/depressing content. 

Please understand I have difficulty phrasing, for reasons unknown, so I ask for your sympathy. If you want more context on me, please look into my post history. One last thing, I respect all religion, including the belief of atheism/no religon, and the free practice thereof, but my spirituality is one of the biggest thing in my life that has been a comfort in my darkest of times, so I request that you respect it in any replies.

Last warning for those that cannot handle heavy/depressing things. Here I go.

*MY PAST*

In short, from age to 5-9 my Half-brother physically and physiologically abused me. From age 7-14 I was bullied in school very heavily. From age 8 till my 19th birthday (Roughly, it was actually a couple of weeks after) I was AGRESSIVILY closeted to the point that I repeatedly lied to my parents about getting married to a girl, having kids, yadda yadda. Being very detailed, because I thought I would be homeless, in the country and be eaten by wild animals, when I was young, then just homeless as I got older. 

When I was 7, my dad had his first moment of Parkinson's at 40 (Early onset). I IDOLIZE this man. He served in the US Airforce for a few years and then worked as a boiler operator till one company closed (13 years apx), and another company ""Forced retired"" him early (After 15 years). He put up with a rotating shift for 15 years, in a hard job, with a condition that is hell to live with. 

My mom, bless her soul, has been trying to weather the storm of life since she was little. My grandfather and grandmother (Her parents obviously), fought and argued regularly. As I learned, about 8 months from this post, there was even a few affairs, but they stayed together till they each passed. My alcoholic aunt was babied, both my mom's and my words, by them. My mom, hardly even worried about. It obviously still hurts, years after they passed, because, well she literally stops and bawls on occasion about it all. She took so much on herself, taking care of my dad, dealing with me (More on that next), and my half brother. 

To turn this back to me, I admit my past is flawed. I did the best I could, given the circumstances, but I was a bit of a brat. I was misdiagnosed with BiPolar withOCD about food, buying things, and games. But, on that point, EVERY purchase had to be PRE-approved, and I, at 13 years old, could not ""Save for something."", I could not have a goal. I had to save for a ""rainy day"" when I would need money. At 13, where I had to get them approved, where most would hit the AA FIRE of ""DO YOU NEED IT?"" Or ""HOW LONG WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?"". (They didn't yell, Im just salty, Tbh)

Also, my parents were/are very conservitive, so as I said, closet was slammed when my mom said to me, in 1st grade I will add, ""Stop! Boys don't skip!"". As I said, I came out (Bi at first, but now I know I'm pan, They know it too) a couple of weeks after my 19th birthday.

I had to quit my job because the stress of the job, asmah attacks at work (Newly developed, severe allergic asmah, with new allergies and reactions allergist tested.), plus my mom crying daily and because of all the stress caused sleeping problems for me and that amplified everything else. Had to get on antianxiety and antidepressants because of apathetic depression and anxiety attacks (I'm doing better now, but I still have down days and attacks because of my living situation).

Here is where the spirituality kicks in.

When I was 14, I hit my lowest point. I had one last thought pass before I would end my life. The stress of being in the closet, bullying, my dark half brother pulling crap, controlling mom and overworked dad was too much. But that thought was, my half brother practiced wiccan (Which he claimed to be one of good practice, but was, very, very, very dark) so this may be a way to get SOMETHING to fucking to change. 

So I grabbed some, what I now know was carbonite which is a grounding stone, and I threw my heart to god. I prayed. I wanted something to change. Someone to be a light. Somewhere there to be joy. Then I herd a voice. Not with my ears, but my head. It introduced itself as, ""Wrath"". It was divinity, but used a dark name to have a hook to be able to say something to me. 

After it tried to calm me, I sang a lost epic in light language, one that is filled with sorrow and misery, but centered around faith. I, to this day have no Idea how I know the language, or the epic. One day I plan to translate it to english. But I can speak it. And over years I tested the light, and it tested me. But my guides were allways there if I was close. Steered me from spirals, to steady. The boat may be dead in the water, but it's always floatin.


*THE PRESENT*

My dad's condition has plummeted after he *left* his last job. He obviously suffers from depression, I can tell, but tries to mask how bad it is. He's gained weight, fallen a lot, and started to loose memory.

My mom is drinking bout every weekend. She pressures me to go to college, YESTERDAY when I move out. She thinks my anxieity and depression is unfounded because, ""My parents fought almost daily, so this ain't worth getting upset over."", and, ""My drinking is my choice."" But yet, ""Don't be upset because I drink. It's my life."". 

Also being about 4k in debt because life decided I needed to roll a car and be shafted by an insurance company and their own memory, is nothing to worry about, because they provide a food, a roof (Which is apreasated, but filled with dog hair, noise, death (Exaggeration by an asmatic), stress and depression while being an hour one way from my job.) and pay my car insurance (which is low despite the car roll, given the circumstances).

Even though all the help I try to give them, they get upset because ""Im obsessive about my scheduel"" when I work 3, 12's in a row with an average of 7 hours of sleep and a 2 hour round commute on top there of, and want to have one day a week that I can relax/recover, when I have 4 days off. Plus, given the stress, I recluse absentmindedly to avoid triggers, a anxiety attack, or a ""Talk"" where I need to give commitments to well over what I feel comfortable to do.

*So, the help to decide from you all*

Im very attached to my mom and dad. Despite everything, I love em and wish them the best. I might get worked up on occasions, but in the end, they try. But my mom still pressures me on occasion to find a girl. And also, don't dress gay. Or wear a tail (Im a furry, look at my username for more info, lol). Or do anything aside from hang out with a trans friend who she still is skeptical about me being near.

I wanna be there to help them, but I also am literally getting headaches, and high blood pressure because of all the stress. Borderline hypertension tbh.

In a few months, *underlining months* , I might have a CHANCE to move out. My credit should be ok, I could get a loan and clear a couple of non credit affecting debts, buy a used tow behind, and have a bit of a backing case something happens, and live on a rented lot (SO MUCH CHEEPER THAN AN APT) till I can figure out my next step in life. 

Should I do it? 

On one hand, it's risky n rough if I did this. i'd probably upset them a lot, maybe even burn the bridge, but everybody around me says that I should be able to live my life, and I need to worry about my mental health. My damn counslor said that I need to stop ""giving"" so much, but I don't know how with a match stick of a mom.

On the other side, if I stuck it out, bout 9 months of stress, I could move out loan free and morally untouched. But, I don't know if I can hold out that long.

Sorry there was so much, and some of it was hostile, had to cut a lot out, and there were a lot more incedents. Half brother, dad, mom, myself, but I wanna get home and sleep. Got the drive, then sleep. Today was my last day for 4 days. I'll look at responses after I get home.",02Feb2020,1
470,"I'm in creative writing with a good friend. We talk about our assignments a lot and usually read each others' to give advice and whatnot. They told me a while ago what their story would be about. Mine changed up quite a lot as I was writing it and finally pulled the last parts together today.

To be more specific, the similarity I realized my story has to my friend's is visiting the grave of a family member. I don't know how I reached this turn in my story without realizing the similarity. Now, the way it happens is completely different. My story has a sort of fantasy element, whereas theirs is completely realistic, for example. It's also not as big of a core element as it is in theirs.

Still, I feel really bad about it, like although I didn't do it on purpose my subconsciousness managed to incorporate their idea with my own, or something.

I'd still like to give them my work to critique, as I know they will with theirs when they're done. Of course there's the possibility of me just changing said parts, but I'm so content with how it turned out, and there isn't much time before it's due. Maybe that's selfish of me? I'd like to acknowledge the similarity to my friend before they read it, but I'm not sure the best way to do that without potentially upsetting them. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",02Feb2020,1
471,"Note: My girlfriend is a very loyal and honest individual. Our relationship has been built on it from the very beginning, and should probably be considered in any advice you have to offer. However I’m sure I can always be convinced otherwise. We are both 20 years old.

Hello. I have not posted to reddit before. My girlfriend of 4 years (June 2015) has recently, and suddenly told me that she ‘needs some time’. She is currently in college working her ass off, but I am on a hiatus for college at the moment because of the rough patch I’ve been through in the last year. I’ve learned a lot about myself in 2019; what values have become obsolete, what values I should probably attain, and that I really like marijuana. 

Nonetheless, during this period of self discovery, I was not being a good partner to her. Nothing abusive, mind you. Just not going to her apartment, always not wanting to go out, being short on the phone. Not to mention the constant ramblings of my worry about the future. I never took the amount of time I should have to make sure she was happy, all the while she was doing everything she could for me. I’ve even gone on dramatic phases where I second guess the whole relationship and send her into a panic... and this would be an occasional occurrence throughout the whole relationship, but never perpetrated by her. I am entirely admitting that I have taken her for granted in the last year. 

It hasn’t always been like this... She and I are obviously very close and have a very firm, and a very mutual understanding of one another and the relationship. We have many fantastic memories that for sure outnumber the bad. But when I beg and plead for an explanation of the sudden move, she says she isn’t sure, and needs time to figure out where she is in life... As said, she currently attends a major university and is trying to get into a competitive program, so circumstances are incredibly stressful right now. The most I can get out of her is that I haven’t been a great partner over the last year, of which I agreed, but personally do not think that it defines the relationship, of which she also agrees. 

I have asked her if she wants the relationship to end forever on many occasions since the separation, and she refuses to respond with anything concise or even elude to anything. 

Onto me, I am not in college, but did go to the same university as her in 2019. I half assed my first freshman semester and did well, and proceeded to withdraw from the next 2 semesters because of many reasons: lack of motivation, a true hate for school, and weed makes you lazy I’ve come to learn. I have been diagnosed with depression this year around May, but stopped taking the meds around July... and here I am. 

I am now trying to setup my circumstances to where I will succeed, not just for her, but for myself, but that’s not what I’m asking about. 

What I’m asking for is advice on what to do as of now... I have not experienced heartbreak that I have no control over literally since my freshman year of high school (which I recognize is bad). I know I shouldn’t text her in such a fragile time, but I find myself twittling my thumbs every hour of the day, thinking about her. 

Any advice?",02Feb2020,1

Just want to start off by saying this isn't for me, it's for my boyfriend. We will call him S

Now S might be getting kicked out of school. Here's a little bit of context.

At the beginning of yr 12, S went to Africa because his family works there and wanted him to come, he had organised an online distance schooling but wasn't able to do any of it due to not having any internet for 7 months. When he got back, he did summer school and then enrolled in this school that is mostly like home school but required you to come in for at least 10 hours a week. This was all going well until he had to go back to Africa again, this time only for 3 weeks, but he never got to tell the school that he was leaving due to it being sudden.


Now that that's out of the way, we can get to the current situation.

S is meeting with the school this Monday, they will most likely be kicking him out due to his sudden absence and he's freaking out because he isn't sure what to do, and is worried his life is effectively over. My question is what are his options? He has just turned 18 and is worried that due to him being an adult his options are limited. I'm not entirely familiar with the Canadian school system since I'm an Aussie, but I will do my best to give more details as necessary. He said he only needs 30 credits to graduate if that helps any

483,"(Long post ahead. I’m so sorry, I just don’t have anyone to talk to right now and I just feel so bad)

My Mom and I were never close. I grew up in a home where there’s no open communication at all. As a child, I never talked to my parents about my problems or anything I’ve been going through because they were so strict, I have always been scared of them. And I have always been jealous of other kids who are so close with their parents, especially their moms, and are practically just like best friends kind of close. 

I lost my Dad 5 years ago, and being the eldest and only daughter, I thought I would develop a closer relationship with my Mom but our gap just widened as the years went by. I am now working and is helping her as the breadwinner of the family, but I’ve been going through so much at work and even with relationships with other people and I couldn’t even talk to her about it because she is so closed-minded about certain things. And one example is about getting into relationships.. 

Ever since I was young, they conditioned me to think that I am not allowed to have a boyfriend at all. I followed them, I finished college with flying colors and never had a boyfriend. So, up until now, I have always been scared of such topics and I never experienced sharing to her about boys, or even hear her advices because she constantly rubs into my face that I still shouldn’t have a boyfriend (her reason is because I still have brothers to support).. I get that I have responsibilities and it’s not like I’m not helping at home. I barely even get to keep anything to myself from my salary because it all goes to our bills and expenses. I’ve been responsible all this time. I do my best to help her in everything.. and just a while ago, I was talking on the phone with this guy I’ve been seeing. My Mom suddenly entered the room and made a fuss. She started getting angry, she kept asking me who was that and why am I not saying anything.. she told me that if I’m dating someone, I should bring him home to meet my family. She started saying hurtful words and yes, I know she meant well and she was right, that I shouldn’t keep relationships a secret, but I felt hurt and I told her “maybe the reason your kids are always scared to tell you anything because you are so narrow-minded”. 

That guy I’ve been seeing, he has been bugging me to meet my family for quite some time but it was just me who declines everytime because I’m scared. I’m scared of what my Mom would say. I’m scared that she will tell me again and again how much of a disappointment I am. But... Damn it. I know I shouldn’t have said that. I feel so sorry. I feel like I don’t even deserve to be alive because I know I hurt her feelings. I don’t know what to do now. I know she was really hurt and I was really in the wrong because she started hurting me physically and then stormed off the house. But I know I deserved this.

Particularly as the last two weeks everyone except me and a new joiner went on vacation. I was left to cover everyone's work. Basically without sounding like I'm just ranting and hate everything, I want to express that:
It was extremely stressful as lots of work came in and the new lady couldn't do much yet. Whenever I gave her work, she just said ""what do I do"" without even thinking or trying first. Then she went home early which I'm sure she wouldn't have done if managers had been around. Should I tell?
The clients and some co-workers were extremely pushy to the point of being intimidating. Physically looming over my desk or heatedly blaming me and not letting me speak. To clarify I work at a law firm so these things are not usually tolerated. I'm not sure how to spin this in a positive way or if I should mention it.

I'm in high school (16F) and I typically buy lunch at school. There's one of the cafeteria staff that makes my sandwiches and then he grills it for me. He sometimes compliments me on my outfit/how I look and I never really thought anything of it. I just kinda assumed it was a nice way to start a casual conversation. So last weekend he found my private Instagram and requested me. Also, this guy is an adult (like mid 30s-ish) and I have **never** told him my name and I don't think anyone else has either.

Am I wrong to think it's kind of creepy? I've been avoiding the cafeteria and skipping lunch altogether so that I don't have to talk to him because I'm kind of scared it could lead to something worse. I declined his request but screen-shotted it just in case.

So my parents have always been fighting since I was little, and sometimes my father was really violent with me, my siblings and my mom.

After he kicked my brother out after he turned 18, things got a better (my brother went to live with our grandfather), he still got mad a lot, but at least he wasn't violent anymore. After my sister left for college I was all alone to deal with all of this. Now my mom kinda started to lose it. She's a teacher and since she yells at kids all day at school she started doing it at home too, and now she can't really lower her voice so it's like she's always screaming, and my dad is really mad about this, always insulting her and getting violent because of every little thing. I really can't put up with this anymore, I feel so miserable every time I try to break their fights. My mom always tells him what things he's done and how it's not her fault, but he just won't listen to her, telling her to shut up, and if she doesn't, he gets violent. I think I'll move to my grandfather's place tomorrow, I tried convincing my mom to divorce him and move out with me (my dad wants to divorce her, but my mom is really religious and she thinks divorce is against God so she doesn't want to separate, even though she's miserable). I still have 1 year and a half till I'm 18 and finish highschool, so I can't really move out on my own and get a job. I think my parents will be really mad but I think it's what I'm supposed to do. My dad hates me anyway, even though he sometimes acts kind around me. Can someone tell me what I should do? I really need help.",02Feb2020,1
497,"Need some advice on what would be the right thing to do in my position. I’m 20 years old and I have a friend who’s younger sister (15) I came across a few times randomly while we were hanging out. Turns out she had a bit of a crush on me which was a bit awkward for me but I only saw this guy rarely and his sister was only around even more rarely so it didn’t bother me much. At this guys party his sister was there and I regrettably spoke a bit to her which probably fueled her to start messaging me through Facebook random stuff like little advice on teenager life which I responded to normally but with restraint, so as not to indicate any enthusiasm. Anyway she started messaging me more regularly and it was annoying so I ignored the messages hoping it would cease. I should mention when she started messaging me she said not to tell her brother she was doing so and I felt that was fishy but the things she was bringing up were fairly innocuous and i imagined he would just tease her so I agreed to help her avoid embarrassment. Anyway the things she was messaging me started getting more edgy and after a week of nothing she sent me this massive wall of text with how she was cutting herself (not in any retribution to me, she was pretty polite and said she hopes I’m doing well even though she knows I’ll ignore this message). So now I have this dilemma where I feel somewhat obligated to tell her brother (we aren’t close friends so it’s not like we talk regularly), and break her trust of constantly making sure I don’t tell anyone about her messaging me. On the other hand I could respond to her and try give whatever advice I can, feeding what could be attention seeking behavior. Thirdly I could continue doing what I’m doing and ignoring her messages.

TLDR; read it I dont know how to summarize it.",02Feb2020,1
498,"Hello everyone! 

I just started a new job as management about a month ago. I have lots of experience in the industry, but it's been my first time being management. The transition has been rough at best, especially since 3 of my employees applied for my position and they were all internal applicants, I was the outsider. I got it. I happened to be the most qualified and educated, so I feel like I earned it. 

To sum a long story up, everyone in the company is pretty salty about it and the people that tried for my position are especially rubbed the wrong way. They constantly question my decisions, don't listen to me unless I hound them, and won't help me (as I'm still learning their specific operations). I constantly have to find out little things that theres no way I could have known by trial and error. This has made the transition even harder. They also shut a door and all gather in one area, shutting the door so I can't hear anything I presume. 

I understand why they are mad. As I would be a little frustrated if I was in their position. (I've had the same thing happen to me.) But they are being extremely disrespectful about it and it is starting to negatively impact the firm's performance as well as making my life a living hell.

I want to extend an olive branch out to them, as I don't want them to hate me. I realize we will never be drinking buddies, as I am their boss. However, I want to at least be able to ease tensions and not have it be so awkward. 

Should I try a little office party or something? What could be something that I could do? I have already tried talking to the people who tried for my job. Didn't go over well.",02Feb2020,1

502,"This girl that I have been friends with for a while know went out to the clubs last night.  She went out with her friends and I went out with mine and she wanted me to come over and wait for her to get back cause we hang out often.  She came in with this guy for a split second while I was watching tv, I was confused because we are kinda fwb/working things out between us. Anyway they came in and I could tell he was definitely wasted and he said something to her and they stepped back outside which I didn't see anything wrong with I thought they were just chatting.  Time went on and she didn't come in so I looked outside and she wasn't there (in an apartment complex btw so it's a big hallway with doors all down it).  I started to get upset which was childish of me and I just sat down back on the couch like a total idiot thinking maybe she went back out to the car to grab something or another. About 30 minutes went by and she came back inside sobbing and I froze, she didn't want me to touch her and she got scared when I got close to her.  So I gave her space to calm down and she wanted to run a bath so she ended up taking a bath.  I noticed her underwear were missing and I looked around for them and couldn't find them anywhere so I dont think she has them on when she came in.  I tried to get her to tell me what happened and she doesnt want to talk about it and said she never wants to talk about it.  She had also lost her phone so she went looking for it and I went with her and she went into the public restroom of the apartment complex and said ""this is where it happened... why would they/he take my phone too"".  I'm terrified, mad, confused, upset, and honestly I have no idea what to do.  I laid down with her and she fell asleep and I went back downstairs to do another look for it and noticed some cameras that point around that area.  I dont know if I should ask the complex if they will let me look at the cameras to see what happened last night to find out if some guy forced her into the bathroom and see what happened.  She said she never wants to talk about it but like.... the people she went out with I generally know and I want to find out if it was one of them and I'm lost on what the right move is here.

503,"A little background on this friend. He comes over unannounced without permission, and I feel bad so I let him in. We had previous history where they cheated on a partner with me, convincing me it was fine and that their partner had agreed and told them it was fine. We never had sex, but there was touching and sexual contact. I got into a relationship a couple of months ago, and they got into one one month before I did. I’m still with my partner, he’s still with his. 

Tonight he came by unannounced, like he usually does. But this time he was flirting. Very close to my face, singing songs at me, all that. He was in my personal bubble, and I was super uncomfortable. I didn’t want to make him feel bad. I flirted back twice for about 5 seconds. I just don’t feel good about it. I don’t know what to do, and I feel like I was influenced by his energy as an empath.

504,"Okay. This is a fairly long post, sorry.

Tl;dr: I describe my current job situation and I'd like to know if I'm overthinking everything my new manager says and does. And whether leaving my job now would impact me negatively in the future. I potentially have something lined up, but this is not a given. 

Post:

""You are very replaceable."" That's something I remember my current manager saying on an away day. Not just to me directly, but to everyone in the room - but it struck a chord, a sort of atmosphere. 

At the time I had a different manager who was quite chill and let me get on with my work. I barely made any mistakes and everyone relied on me. It worked nicely. There was some confusion between who does what but the general flow in the team was nice. 

And then we got a head of department. 

And then this nice manager left and now I'm under my current one. 

To date, I'm working on a project and, a few weeks ago, the manager said, ""I'm concerned that you won't be able to deliver,"" or something to that effect. 

I was taken aback. I didn't know what to say because I was trying to understand what I could have possibly done to be told that I can't be trusted to do my job.

And a few days later she pulled me into a room when I got in, and accused me delaying everyone else. That the team are waiting on me to finish a task from the day before. And I said, no, they shouldn't be? She brought a team member into the room who also agreed with me and in fact said another team member was already on the next task. No apologies. Just, ""oh, I'm just trying to understand...""

I've also been told I must structure my time spent in our email box. The manager is concerned I spend too much time there. Well, no, I don't since I have projects to work on, but okay. Sure. I said, alright, I'll structure my time.

In a team meeting, she used me as an example when trying to prove that how she's managing my team is making improvements.

""Subtlesneeze, we spoke about structuring your time. That's helped a lot, hasn't it?""

... Well, you're leaving me in an awkward yes or no situation and the answer is neither. In the same meeting, she said that some people should work from home less (and looked at me) and others more. 

As a side note, I spend 3 hours a day travelling to and from work. I have to leave around 7am. Get back home for around 6pm. When my mood has been low, I've worked from home once a week. Twice, if I felt it would help me. But I've always asked my manager for authorisation. And my old manager was supportive. Concerned for me, of course, but supportive. 

The extra sleep in the mornings helped. But in the last two months, I've worked from home twice. I've purposely done it less because I know that I'm better, so it's fine. 

Anyway, I had a day off and the next day I had put in that I was working from home, since I was getting home late. She text me and basically said, ""I know you said you're working from home but I need you in. Hope that's OK"". Imposing. On top of other things, I got upset at her tone. The funny part is... That day, I was away from my team because there was no space. 

I've requested to work from home whilst the manager is working from home and her response was, ""We haven't agreed anything, I want to catch up when I'm in."" Well that's why I asked... To see if you're okay with it... 

I just feel ridiculously scruntised. Her tone is shit. She's even told me to go on the pill when I've said that I'd prefer to work from home when I'm on my period (since we can do that!?). And I've been told that I need to keep my structure and work when I'm at home. Well, if you don't trust me to work at home, then why the heck should I trust that you're working when you're at home *every week*. Heck, she's unreachable at times!

She's said I've made many mistakes. OK yes, a number on a letter to an employer was wrong BUT it did not go to the employee and it was an incredibly easy fix. And that was ONCE. But OK, other favourited members of the team can fuck up things that I'VE FOUND AND FIXED and also mentioned THIS FACT but _I'm the one who makes the mistakes._

Like heck. 

Now. I'm 23. This is my first job out of university. I did a creative degree. I haven't had time to be creative since I come home exhausted and go back to work, exhausted. This woman is draining and I currently dread any interactions. I'm tired of having to prove myself. I'm tired of being upset. 

But since I have little work experience in the grand scheme of things, should I really resign over this? 

I also note that I've applied for this Japanese exchange thing, where you teach abroad for a year. I've had an interview and I find out in April. If I get it, I leave in September. 

So my plans are already of leaving in July, but I cannot stand the environment I'm in any longer. The job itself is great. Members of the team are lovely. But I seriously dread going to work. And I'm trying to rationalise the situation. Am I being too emotional about this? 

I also point out that I have spoken to the new head of department about this treatment but I've just been brushed off. We have lots on. So I guess no one has time for me. 

Anyway, if I leave by the end of Feb, I'll have a month to myself and will do a lot of writing to get myself back in my original goal - have a full time job and also continue my creative writing. My current work life balance leaves me too tired but that could just be excuses, right?

If I am going to Japan, then I'll look for very short term job opportunities. But to be honest I have lots of money saved since this place pays good, which is another reason I haven't left...

If I'm not going to Japan, then I can look for another full time job but this time somewhere closer to home. But only God knows how long it'd take to get into a new position. 

And will this look bad on my CV? Will new employers think, nah... 

Ah I don't know. 

I am confused, fed up and I just hate my current situation. But as I've said, maybe I'm just being too emotional when I shouldn't be. I just need someone to have an unbiased view on this. I don't want to make my life harder. I don't know what to do.",02Feb2020,1

We clicked right away and we had so much fun together at work that I started to longing after going there and work with him. Lets call him James haha. I have no Idea if he feels the same way, but Ive gotten a few hints wich I dont know is just friendly ones or the flirty kind. A few of us girls at work have a group chat where we recently talked about this girlsnight were gonna have this week. 
So my coworker, lets call her Susan, wrote 

”can James come?” 
And I wrote ”hell no” joking ofc.
Then Susan wrote ”he says shut up/ James”, then Susan wrote again ”James wondered if Esther (me) want to go to (a city) tonight” 
I wrote ”hahah ofc”
Susan - ”perfect he’ll pick u up at 10”
I wrote ”great me + 20 people”
Susan - ”He says you or no one”

Then the convo kinda died. But later on me and Susan texted on snapchat and she send me a picture of our website and on the front it has a picture of a sweaty guy who just worked out, and she wrote
”This is how guys be when they see you / James” 

And besides from these texts, Ive noticed that when his friends on other departments call him over he doesnt wanna go there cuz hes talking to me, you know small things like that. And then Susan has asked me three times ”was it fun working with James?” And I havent told Susan that I like him. 
So my question is, do you think he likes me or is this just friendly work teasing? And im kinda stressed about this cuz Im quitting my job in two weeks and I dont have his snap or number or anything.. as you may hear were young haha, im 21 he’s 23",02Feb2020,1

510,"(18M) I’ve liked a girl in my school for a while now. For the last 3 weeks I’ve been texting her &amp; been talking more &amp; more in person with her.

It’s really easy to talk to her &amp; we have spent numerous amounts of nights texting for 3/4hrs up until 1am. Everything was going really well.

I wanted to ask her out but her parents are very strict &amp; we have exams for the next 2 weeks so I decided I would wait until they finish. 

But this last week (week before exams start). She has seemed more distant, a bit disinterested &amp; seems to not want to talk in person as much. For example she previously waited for me after class so we could talk more but for whatever reason she didn’t this week. 

I’m finding it harder to make conversation over text &amp; in person as well, unlike last week where it was so easy. I asked her friend for advice &amp; he said to play it cool and that she really likes me. Giving me conflicting feelings

512,"I’m getting to the end of my tether.
My relationship with my father was great when I was younger. It was when I got to about 11 he changed. He wants me to do everything around the house. It’s gotten worse since his back condition arose a few years ago.

My mother is fed up with him as well but still loves him.

I’m 21 years old and he treats me like I’m 10. No amount of civil conversations get anywhere as he will just tell me to “shut up” or “grow up”.

If he had everything his way, my mother wouldn’t do any housework and I would do it all. My only reprieve lately is living at University Monday-Thursdays.

If my father wants something he will scream and shout and threaten me about it until he gets his way.

The latest incident was that I borrowed my mother’s coat to go to our farm (which she has worn there before multiple times). He screamed at me that I stink and I can’t wear it. Then when my mother got angry at him saying that to me, he screamed that SHE had said it originally (a lie) and that she had never worn that coat for to the farm before (again, a lie). It seemed to die down and was fine until we dropped my mother off for work. Then it started again. 

So now I have to take care of the horses in just a shirt and it’s freezing. All to make him stop screaming and threatening me.

He constantly threatens to kick me out of the house.

He doesn’t seem to see he’s driving me away or that he’s in the wrong and thinks everything is my fault.

He blames me for all of his and my mother’s problems too.

I’m financially dependent on them at the moment and my studies are very intense during the week and over the weekend I take care of the horses. I basically have one free day per week so I can’t work.

He makes me depressed.

If he tells me to do something and I ask if I can do it when I’ve finished what I’m already doing he will either yell at me to do it now or say in a mocking tone “I’ll do it in a minute” and call me lazy etc

This is all also populated with colourful language and he can’t more than a few sentences without calling me a “b***h” or a “c**t” etc usually with added “fat”, “thick”(dumb) etc for added punch. He constantly flings insults at me. His favourite being “big fat b***h/c**t”.

People have been asking her basic small talk questions for a new college graduate, stuff like if she wants to stay at her current job (she doesn't), her roommate asked if she wants to renew the lease on her apartment, and whether she's going to stay in the city we're in. A lot of her friends are moving to different places and that's scary to see. Her roommate is planning on moving to Korea in 3 years. 

It's understandable to be worried about all of this, I get overwhelmed at the thought too, but she's considering relocating because she 'outgrew' our city. That phrase in particular is what scares me. It was my justification for doing the same thing a few years ago.



She had a list of things she'd need in a city, stuff like good public transportation, a job that's actually in her field, weather was a consideration as well.


The thing is, our city has all of that. Aside from weather, it's one of the top cities for her field and quality public transportation.


She's been wanting to take a trip or go camping or anything with her friends, who frequently take short trips to go to concerts that she's not interested in. She's expressed that she doesn't have any major things to look forward to like other people do such as big trips, jobs, marriage, etc. Without anything like that, it's stagnation. 


In my honest opinion, I think this is a quarter like crisis of sorts. we're fresh into real adulthood at the turn of a decade and that makes us think about where we were 10 years ago and where we will be in 10 years from now. We talked about that over new years. I said I wanted a nice place and to be financially secure. She said she wanted to be married, or at least engaged. It's not a race, but she said that she's seeing a lot of her friends getting married or just generally having adult milestones.

That comes up a lot, seeing what her friends are doing and then she feels bad about what she's doing. A lot of them consider our city a stepping stone for where they actually want to go,but they're all in different fields that have better opportunities elsewhere. 

Which brings me to the second thing that struck me as odd. She's been wanting a new tattoo for a while. That's fine, it's been something she's put a good bit of thought into, it's a beautiful design. She has 2 already and I have one. But she made a comment about it when we were talking about how stressed she's been. Her joke was that getting a new tattoo is what people do when they need to change something/reinvent themselves. It's a cliche thing to make a connection to, but it reminds me of the trope in media where someone cuts their hair or shaves their head for the same reason.


The point of bringing this up is that I think she wants to not feel stuck in her life. I felt the same way. I thought that if I moved to the city that suddenly I'd have purpose or a sense of adventure or something, but it took me a while to realize the thing that needed to change was inside me. A 'fresh start' really wasn't a thing. I was the same person with the same problems and stagnation as before, but I was in a different place. I used to have a tendency towards self destructive behaviors and that was one of them. She also has those tendencies during stressful times. She is actively working on bettering herself much like I did before I met her, only I think this is a re-emergence of it.



When she was still in school, she was doing a lot of creative writing. Now, I don't think she has the creative outlet she's needing. I've tried to get her into some of my hobbies but the scheduling and timing has never worked out well. 



Yes, I do realize that moving to a new city itself isn't such a bad thing. If it were for job opportunities or something, I'd be sending her articles about fun things to do in that city. But to move for the sake of leaving? I don't know. I haven't even considered what would happen to us if she left and I couldn't. I still have 1 year left to finish in school because I had taken some time off and I was taking extra courses for both GPA purposes and also to be better prepared for grad school if I ever decide to. Her lease is up this summer. There's a chance she has to find a new place anyway because her other roommate might be getting a job in Ohio. 

. 

I would appreciate any thoughts on this. It's 100% not my place to dictate where she takes her life and I've always let her make her own decisions even in times where they hurt me. We don't live together, but im also not tied down to any one place. If she set her heart on it I would follow her to the ends of the earth without a second thought. There's a part of me that thinks she wouldn't want me to.

524,I am 20 and what you might call a kissless virgin. I am sick of it. I want to experience what sex is like. Yeah I would rather do it in a loving relationship but so far there is no indication in my life that this is going to happen anytime soon. Most people my age are already in relationships or have been and talk about sex. A few years ago I never would have considered such a route but it seems like the only hope I have left.

525,"I've known this girl for about four years now. I'm deeply attracted to her. I love just about everything about her. She's smart, she's funny, she's my kind of crazy, I turn into an absolute clown for her just to get a smile or a laugh and brighten up her day, but she's not into me. She never has been. When I first met her I was at a period in my life where I was doing a lot of self improvement and working to better myself as a whole, so the first time I told her I was in to her, I wasn't really surprised that she didn't reciprocate my feelings. I kinda figured at that point that we were done, but she kept inviting me out, hanging out with me, talking to me, and I didn't have much in the way of friends at that point so I just kept rolling with it, thinking that if I got my shit together maybe one day I'd have a shot.

It's pathetic,  I know, it's a move doomed to fail, and I'm starting to realize that as much as I'm attracted to her, she'll never be attracted to me in the same way. Being her friend is fun, but it also hurts me on a mental level and I think I need to put an end to the relationship. I've tried to change the way I think about her, the way I feel about her, but I can't seem to pull it off. So now I'm here: hung over after bailing out of a bar crawl with her midway through the night wondering how to end the friendship without being a total asshole about it. I don't want to hurt her, and I know she deserves better than this,  but being her friend is hurting me, and I don't see any other way to make it stop.",02Feb2020,1

Truth is I have done it in some form but since I am in the entertainment industry, public approval is a fool's errand.

529,"I recently had to go to court to testify in another state for 12 days. My subpeona was hard to get and very late bc I was working with the military via text, calls, and emails. Because I had to get a flight out and it had to be approved my all these people and they went abt the process late, my official subpeona didn’t reach my hands until 3 days before I had to leave. I’m 19 and work a somewhat decent if insanely boring retail job. So even though I made my boss aware of the situation, I wasn’t able to nail down the exact dates until three days before hand. He was pissed and went off on me via text and I just tried to minimize and apologize bc I really wanted to keep this job. Before then, in my few months working their I’d only been late once and had only missed three days because i was deathly sick. I had never called out for anything else, though i’d had good reason to. Anyways, I go to court and come back and go to see if I’ve got a job left. Thankfully i did, however now my hours were cut down to weekends, and I was going to go from getting 36+ hours a week to 9 and a half for at least three weeks. So i started to look for a second job to work during the week, and two weeks go by, no incident. Then yesterday I had to call out, and i got informed that it would be my 13th absence and if I didn’t make it to work I would be replaced. Each Employee has 12 days a year to call out or be tardy (idk the ratio) and apparently he had pointed me for all 12 days i was subpoenaed. I don’t know if this is even allowed (i’m quite sure it is not) but now I don’t have a job. It’s the next morning and i was supposed to go in today, but I just don’t know if i should fight this or not. It’s an okay job, definitely the most boring i’ve ever had, and it pays 10/hr which is nice but not the best I could absolutely get. I don’t really have any friends there, despite being really outgoing and working there for awhile.

I am 16F, and I have never travelled completely on my own- I am both nervous and excited!

533,"To clarify: I'm not a racist.

I don't care if you're: black, white, Asian, male, female, tall, short, young, old, homosexual, straight,disabled, autistic. Got nothing against you as I think we should judge someone on their character and actions instead of their appearance and the backgrounds they were born with.

I do however, throw around the word: ""Nigga"" commonly. But not as a racial slur!

To me personally, this word has lost it's negative connotation and has instead taken on new meaning. kinda like how gay use to mean you were happy but is now acquainted same sex relationships. I come to this conclusion because black people use this word as a another way of saying ""homie"" or friend.

We had a (black) speaker come to college and during his assembly, he asked a student to call him ""nigga"" with his reasoning being: ""It means I am black right?! Not ""stupid nigga"" or ""fat nigga"" It's not a dirty word; it means i'm black and there's nothing wrong with being black is there?!!"" He congratulated the student when he finally said it. It made me realize: simply stating that someone is of a different skin color isn't racist. Racism is to think less of someone based solely on that one irrelevant point. Racism is stupid logic which uses the color of someone else's skin to make the racist  feel somehow superior.

My friends and I use it all the time in this friendly context. But I understand that others may not see it this way, so i'm careful not to use such language around others. I want to stress: I would never use it as a form of attack. In fact I don't even see it as one: it's like calling me white or a man...yep, that is a fact you can tell about me from using your eyes. Those aren't bad traits: same applies to being a black man, or black woman or white woman or...hopefully you get the idea.

However, due to it being part of my everyday vocabulary and especially in my case where I have next to no filter, I fear I might accidentally let the word slip. Not in a negative connotation, but in the same way as I would with my friends or accidentally as I tell myself ""don't say it!"" over and over in my head. Both instances could come across as disrespectful; which is not my intention.  

What can I do about this?",02Feb2020,1
534,"So, Soon I will have my 16th birthdays and I have no idea what I would really want as a gift.

Let me give a Little bit of information about me :
I like drawing, I drew mostly humans, usually I do this with pencil. However I do have paints and watercolors, I Just use them much less. Maybe there are some equipments that could help me with art , that I May not know, like a tool, quidebook or something else 
I also like games,  Minecraft (of course), The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Little Big Planet 3, Pokemon, Splatoon 2, Witcher 3, Uncharted 3 etc.
So its mostly Creative games, with a lot of exploring, with a story, but not in every one of them.
I would definitely want something strategic, with a captivating plot, maybe less Creative(however,  that won't be a problem, if it demands your creativity) , but a Little bit more competitive, I'm not sure... Maybe an Indie game or older classic... 

Oh, Its good to remind that Financial limit is 200 złotych ... That would be like 50 dollars.

I also got into hazbin hotel lately and I've been a jojo fan through nearly all 2019.
That is not really important, but maybe it Will give you some hints.

And that is all I could think of right now. 
Maybe somehow this long Text will give you an idea for a gift, which I could use. 
Even though, it can be still something different, like a cloth, a book, cardboard game , blanket or anything.

He got back with his ex and accused me of trying to trap him when I told him I would have thought about abortion as we cannot get on. 

Ever since the whole thing he has told everyone that we had sex 7 times and how I am in bed (he’s never said anything bad about my skills in bed) however I do not appreciate him telling his ex girlfriend and his best friends parents along with everyone else. 

I told him to try and put things behind us as my best friend and his best friend have been dating for 3 years so we see each other regularly. However he’s been talking to them, I catch him starting at me often when I’m out but he treats me like I’m invisible, he’s told his best friend I make things awkward by being there and he can’t get over the fact we’ve had sex but I feel like it’s the whole pregnancy scare and argument. We got on so well and the sex was so good but it kills me the fact he can’t even look me in the eye now as if I’m some dirty mistake but he denies this is the case.

Anyways, I randomly decided to move April 1 at one point. I can't remember exactly why but I didn't want to put it off for long and I felt like I would have enough savings by then (about $6500). Also the longer the wait the more I feel stuck. Lastly, my birth control shot is in March so I would have the freedom to wait 3 months after that to get my next shot.

Recently I've thought that June 1st would be a good date since it would be exactly 2 years since I've moved in to my first apartment here. I'm currently on a month-to-month not a lease, so this date is really symbolic. And again, I'm worried the longer I push it off the more mentally weary I'll be. The other downside is that I will have to find healthcare at that point and quickly to get my next birth control shot in due time. However, the pros would be that my roommate-- who is actually my sister-- has more time to prepare and I would definitely have more savings.

Any thoughts? Any other months also work if you can back it up with good reasoning.

538,"I (21F) live in a college town and around 2 o’clock in the morning I was taking my dog on a late walk. It’s a Saturday night and the night is still relatively young, but as I am walking back home from cvs when I noticed two legs, and someone (~20’sM) passed out from drinking. A few of his friends were standing around him but nobody seemed to be concerned with the state their friend was in; they were weakly calling his name out to him but even if someone was dozing off from just being tipsy they wouldn’t have heard it. 

I don’t know why, but I felt a sudden urge to help the kid out. He had vomit all over him and was on his back. I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself had I known that I, being sober and aware of the scope of the situation, walked away from this kid and his friends who seemed like they only wanted him to be ok so they could go on with their nights.

I approached and asked what his name was. For obvious safety reasons we will call him Kyle. The first thing that I suggested was to place Kyle into the bacchus maneuver position. Moreover, I was going to check his breathing. Not too hot. I was trying to talk to him, letting him know my name and how I found him, but he was of course confused. I communicated to his friends and him that I was going to try and pinch his ear so I can see if I can provoke a response from him through that, but once it didn’t and I suggested to call 911 immediately, his 3 Apple beta pie bitch boys got super defensive with me and basically told me to piss off. For some reason, I felt really bothered by their hostility. I walked the rest of the way home crying, hoping the sirens that I heard were going to him or that he’s okay.

554,"I am in my third year of college, but my first year at University (went to a junior college for my associates). While the college has an amazing program for my field and I feel incredibly fortunate to have gotten in, I really haven't been happy. When I visit home instead going back, I feel empty there, everything feels fake and image is so important, it almost feels more important to the school than the actual comfort of it's students. I feel so alone there, even though I have friends. I'm only just now getting involved with a small group, but up till this point socializing and making friends has been harder than it's ever been for me. 

I am also in the 8th month of a long distance relationship with a guy who has the same major as me. We are four hours apart and see each other every couple of weeks. I'm currently staying with him and we have been walking around his campus. Before I was accepted where I am now, I had also applied to this school, but never ended up taking a tour and as soon as I got into the school I'm currently in I completely disregarded any other options I had. Every time I have visited this campus I've loved it. It's beautiful, comforting, practically screaming all the things I value in my personal life there. Academically, while not at the same level of prestige as my current University, it is a fantastic school for my major, given why I considered it in the first place. I've even told my boyfriend a few times while I was visiting that ""I definitely would have picked this place of I have visited before my current University"". 

For the past few months I've just been very lost, anxiety has been affecting my relationship, depression is affecting my school work, making me not want to get out of bed most mornings, I don't feel motivated or passionate about anything like I used to and it terrifies me. Then this weekend my boyfriend suggested I consider transferring. I don't want to completely change schools just for a boy, even if I love him as much as I do, so the idea scares me a bit given that would definitely be a partial reason, being closer to him would definitely make our relationship easier, and I also fear transferring would just be the easy way out. That I should just suck it up and ouch through, even though the next two years I'll have at my current University make me almost pale with dread. 

So my question, do you think it's reasonable to consider transferring? Is this just a case of 'the grass is greener' or is it possible I would be happier here than where I'm currently at. I've only been at my current University for a semester and a few weeks, am I just not giving it enough time? What do you think I should do?",02Feb2020,1
556,"My life has been really shit the past few months. 

Non stop conflict at home between me, my mom and my stepdad. Constantly being judged, feeling like I’m walking on eggshells around my parents. Both my parents are both physically and emotionally abusive, and have been for years. 

Last year I had exams coming up, but then I went to the hospital with a really bad case of both the flu and pneumonia.  I nearly died and had to be put in an induced coma. The flashbacks aren’t as bad as they used to be, but they are still there. 

Not even three weeks after this, I had exams. The stress just about broke me. On top of that, I had to talk two friends out of killing themselves during this time (One IRL friend, and one online friend), I empathized with them a lot, and felt all of their problems on top of my own. 

At this point I felt completely emotionally exhausted. I tried retreat into an RP sub on reddit, and that helped me cope with my life for a while. But then two of my characters closest friends died. And then, my other characters love interest had to die because the writer of that characters girlfriend was jealous of the characters relationship or some shit. I know it seems laughably insignificant, but I really identified with both of my characters, and it makes me feel depressed and physically ill whenever I think about it. 

Literally today, there was another huge fight with my parents. It started out as a friendly debate, but it got way out of hand. It ended with my stepdad kicking me and my mum out of the house, and even physically taking a swing at me (Though he thankfully missed) 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I fucking hate my life, and my main escape, RPing on reddit, just makes me even more depressed. I just want to die, I want to just stop existing and don’t have to worry about my pain anymore.

Is there any way to get rid of my emotions? I don’t want to feel anymore, I’m just so tired and I want the pain to stop.",02Feb2020,1
557,I’m a 16 year old. There’s a neighborhood cat (really cute and fluffy) she keeps going under our house and goes over by a small door in our garage that goes under the house. My mom just takes her out and puts her back outside. She doesn’t want any animals or pets. I can’t just leave her there in the cold starving because people don’t know how to take care of their pets but my mom doesn’t want me feeding it cause it will just come back.

565,"I'm a 22 year old woman who just graduated from college, and unfortunately I live with my parents at the moment. Last night I came home from work and had 3 glasses of wine, and the night before I had 2, so I finished the bottle in 2 days. I was alone both times. I understand that this isn't the healthiest behavior, but I also used to drink a lot more in college, even when alone. She didn't see that so she doesn't actually know I'm drinking less. I absolutely hated college, and my mental health was terrible there and I would sometimes drink a bottle of wine by myself and then have another drink, or I would occasionally sneak a cocktail into a terrible class to get through it. I did have a problem with my drinking, and maybe I still do, but my point is that I'm improving but my mom doesn't know because she didn't see how bad it was before.
She came into my room this morning in tears because I drank a bottle of wine in 2 nights. She said she wants to prevent me from going down this path because 3 glasses is too much to drink alone. She told me she was pacing and whisper yelling at me in the kitchen for 45 minutes because she knew I wouldn't be awake. That amount of drinking has been pretty normal for me lately, but it hasn't always been alone. 
I should also note that I am going through a breakup type thing with someone I love, but we never put a label on what we had, so that is a part of why I felt like drinking alone after work. But I didn't tell my mom we were together because I was waiting for it to have a label. 
I want to work on drinking less, and I think I will as I make the transition from college drinking to real grown up drinking, and the amount I drink has already decreased since I graduated. I just don't know what to do about my mom right now. I'm supposed to watch superbowl with her and my dad tonight. I'm okay with not drinking to make them happy but it's gonna be hard to get in the right mood after my mom was in tears over 3 glasses of wine with me last night.",02Feb2020,1

We've been pretty good friends for over six years now. We are often viewed as a couple by our friends but we usually deny it. We text each other for hours everyday. Outta nowhere she sometimes randomly says she's not into me but she often says I'm the hottest guy she's met. She also picks out some clothes for me cause she says I look good in it. She tells me personal stuff too which she doesn't tell most of her friends. After all this idk if she's actually into me or not. I kinda figured she was the one for me around a year ago.

576,"I'm (F16) friends with a group of (M16,M17) boys. 

First to set up some context. They've been a group since 8th grade, and are pretty tight-knit. Some go to the gym together after school, and they hang out all together pretty frequently (once every couple weeks at least). One person has been a little bit toxic since the beginning -- he puts down the other people, and tries a lot of the time to be superior, sometimes being rude (we'll call him K). He says this mean stuff to everybody -- but many people just brush it off since they only interact w/ him every so often. For the guys though, it's gotten to the point where the rest of them are planning to sit K down and give him a talk. 

However, the group has been putting this talk off for the ""right time"". In the meantime, they have started excluding K, and K has noticed and has been upset. I told the rest of the guys that they should tell K as soon as possible why they've been cutting him out as a basic decency so that way he can understand their actions and try to change. 

The only reason why I'm considering telling K is because he has been there for me in the past, and I feel guilty not explaining the situation to him. I also genuinely want to see him realize his wrong-doings, and try to change. At the same time I feel like it would be awful for me to intrude on their issues. I'm trying to figure out the balance between my loyalty and treating K w/ decency, and being nosy and being intrusive. What should I do?",02Feb2020,1

581,"My husband isn't a terrible person but he does things they have really concerned me. I often don't know which version I'm going to get. Some days he's okay - pleasant and easy going. Others he is sullen and I'm lucky if all I get is the silent treatment. 

He really scared me on Christmas morning when he got angry that I left dishes in the sink overnight (I was too tired to finish cleaning after wrapping presents and setting up for Christmas morning). He smashed a few of my favorite mugs and measuring cups while the kids opened presents.

He has also, infrequently, tried to use his size to make me back down. This is less effective now that I have been studying martial arts and self defense with my kids for three years, but it still bothers me that he does it.  I don't like being backed in a corner.

The other thing is that I think that most of the sex we have is probably non-consensual. I mean, he doesn't force me, but I'm really discouraged from saying no. He has walked out of the house and not returned for hours or the next morning. Sometimes it is really painful and I get hurt but he tells me it's because I just don't like anything. Also I had a pretty rough childhood where I was assaulted multiple times and I feel like he isn't always very sensitive. Like my biggest trigger is having hands on my neck and he does that all the time. Once he did it in front of his family and even my SIL told him it wasn't cool. He didn't choke me, but it was still upsetting. Which then made me feel bad because he told me how hurtful it was the I was upset since he was my husband. 

I am at the point where I'm not sure if I can keep living like this. My closest friend says that he is abusive and multiple people have asked me if he hits me. Which he doesn't. 

My kids adore him. He's not terribly helpful with them, but I can see that he loves them too. If his concerning behavior extended to them I would have been gone a long time ago but he is a great dad. 

Anyway, after breaking my things on Christmas, I have been making plans to leave him if things get really bad. I started working. I'm going to set up a separate account. I'm even taking up instacart as a side gig to put as much money away as possible. But it will be a long time until I  can save enough to leave. In the meantime, I'm trying really hard to keep it together so I can be a good mom and still be a good wife. I would like to save our marriage but I know that there's a possibility that it won't end well. It's doubly hard because we live in a small town and most of my in laws live in the same neighborhood. Now I LOVE my in laws. My own parents were horribly abusive and my husband's family has been more supportive and loving than my own. I also have a ton of nieces and nephews that I'm extremely close too - all on his side - and my heart breaks just thinking of walking away from all of that.

Also I've begged him to go to couples counseling but he will not go. I know that he too is struggling with depression but he also won't get the help I've begged him to get. He doesn't approve of my going to see my counselor and pretends that it doesn't happen. I also know he's angry with my for having to take medication to help with my mdd and ptsd but I wouldn't be a good and functioning mom without them.

Needless to say, I'm conflicted and it's really affecting my mental health. I was suicidal last year, clawed out of that hole by the skin of my teeth. I struggled with self harm as well. I'm in  better place now - with therapy and meds - but I'm scared of going back to that place. I am struggling to eat because of the stress and I've lost a good amount of weight.

586,"So one day last week I got a Paypal notification saying a payment of £99.91 was sent to the clothing site Zara. I freaked out a bit because this wasn’t me, and after a couple of minutes, I got a text from Paypal asking me to verify whether or not it was me. I obviously said no, and they said they would open a fraud claim for me and get back to me in 24 hours. I looked on the digital receipt on Paypal and the shipping details had someone else’s name and address, so me being naive, I assumed that that would be enough to prove that it wasn’t me. Alas, the next day I got an email saying Paypal denied my claim because there was nothing suggesting the payment was unauthorised. 

I freaked out a bit more, called my bank to ask if they could do anything, they said no. I called Zara to see if they could cancel the order, they said no. So I panicked and told my dad, he tried to fix it but he couldn’t, so he told me to call Paypal and speak to an advisor. So I called Paypal, and the advisor looked at the transaction and told me that it has something to do with me selling clothes on Depop. I asked her what me selling clothes on Depop has to do with £100 being spent on Zara, and she just brushed that question off completely. She got the details up for the transaction and said “it says it was done from a different IP address but it’s because you sell through Depop”. I repeated myself and said there’s no correlation between me selling through Depop and me supposedly buying through Zara, but also, since the shipping details have a different name and address, and the transaction was done from a different IP address, is that not enough evidence that the payment was unauthorised, since someone else clearly did it? She brushed this off again and simply told me they would open another case and get back to me in 24 hours. 24 hours pass and I get another email saying my claim has been denied.

At this point, Paypal had attempted to take the £99.91 from my bank account, but I don’t have the funds for that, so my Paypal balance went into the negatives and I couldn’t use it until I got the balance back up to £0. I was at a loss for things to do. I put a whole bunch more clothes up for sale on Depop just to get the money back for that negative balance, so I’m now essentially giving my clothes away for free, and I’m having to pay shipping costs on top of that, so I’m losing more money on top of half my wardrobe. Going to the police seems to be my only other option but just in case that doesn’t work, what else can I do? Paypal, my bank nor Zara will help me, and I have nothing left. 

TLDR; a dude hacked my paypal, used it to buy £100 worth of clothes and paypal won’t help me get the money back

587,"So, my best friend recently told me she was raped at a party about a year ago. She was near blackout drunk and a guy just took her up to his room. She knows who the bastard is but won’t report him or tell me his name because she’s “over it and doesn’t want to stir things up”. To be fair it’s probably a good thing she hasn’t told me who he is because if she had I would’ve bashed his face in. The only evidence is her word and possibly a witness who saw him take her upstairs, and that’s not enough to secure a conviction unless he confesses.

The title says it all in a nutshell, I don’t know where the hell i’m headed at this point. I’m so tired of hoping something good will happen but all else fails then shit rolls down hill from there then I feel like I’m accountable for said happenings so I own up to them.

I think about ending it everyday but I already know that I’m not going to ever really....I yet have these thoughts and I can’t help but cry myself to sleep every night. I literally cry everyday and I’m heartbroken. I’ve never been this heartbroken in my life, I thought I would be at some point but I didn’t know it would happen when I’m so young.

589,"Thanks for taking the time. I don't really know how to fit everything in that factors in to this but i will try.

A lot of my life i was considered ""The screw up"" never wanted to work, when i did I had a huge chip on my shoulder. When i did finally land a job i would always lose it after skipping too many days or getting fired for doing something dumb. 

In The past few years i wasn't able to work due to constant stress due to my Grandmother, the woman who raised me constantly having to be in and out of the hospital for heart problems. Due to not having any family near us who are able to help her, that responsibility fell to me.

After a few years (about 4 years ago) My Grandmother was fitted with a Pacemaker. it has made life quite less stressful for everyone. Once my grandmothers condition was solidified, I swore to myself i would get a job i could both do and not get too stressed out over, And that i would for once in my life put in the damn effort to be a good employee. The kind that shows up early, covers shifts for people etc. I chose Security due to prev experience with it and have enjoyed it so far. I feel that i have earned the respect of my peers and my superiors, Something i have never quite experienced before.

But now onto the problem. I have worked a night shift schedule of 7 day work weeks, 5 8 hr shifts and 2 12's. With a period of 3 and 4 days of in between for the past 3 years. I have missed my fair share of family events due to my choosing work over fun. I have only ever taken a total of 10 days off in my 3 years of employment, with 5 of those days being due to an extremely injured leg that i could not walk on. The other 5 due to provable illness which i had doctor's notes for.

Recently, My fiance asked me to book a day off work, just to have a ""mental health day"" for myself. which would make my normal 3 day off into a 4. but for some reason, even though i know i am in good standing at work, as well as the rest. I find myself literally feeling sick at the thought of taking a day off just for the sake of it. I feel like i'm committing some major injustice by doing so, screwing over multiple people for my own enjoyment (if i book off someone else has to cover the shift). anyone i ask about this tells me it's ""not a big deal"" including my supervisor. But i just for some reason cannot convince myself. Any advice for my disturbed self? Much appreciated.",02Feb2020,1
590,"I’m early 20sF and have a brother who’s a year and a half younger than me. Since we are quite close in age, growing up  we had a bit of a rivalry and being the oldest I was a massive bully to him. We’d fight and I’d get physical, hitting or kicking. He would fight back a little but not as hard, I was always the instigator. The physical fights never turned bloody and nobody ever got badly hurt, no bruises or anything like that but I would be really terrible to him. It stopped as we grew older and any fights just turned into screaming matches instead and more verbal, less physical, though I was certainly verbally abusive to him too. 

I was always a bit of the golden child in the sense that I did exceptionally well in school and so my brother was always a bit in my shadow, though I would say my parents tended to favour him more because of this and because I was mean to him, but I know he always felt inferior to me. So it was easy for me bully this insecurity growing up. 

Anyway, I was watching this tv show earlier, quite a dramatic and serious one, gets quite emotional at times. This character loses her brother quite traumatically and it REALLY hit me. I had flashbacks to how absolutely awful I was to my brother",02Feb2020,1

593,"I have my best friend. My best friend starts to  going out and talk very much to a guy that is very ugly, tries to act cool and I think he has very low self confidence. This guy is bullying me (he hits me etc) and now he starts telling me to say embarrassing things to people that I don't know very well and I'm afraid that as the days pass and I just do nothing for this he will start behave me more cruel. His justification when I ask him why he hits me etc he says ""Are you stupid? I'm doing it just for fun and I don't hate you"" (he is lying of course). Why I don't do something? First, if I try to tell this to the principal he will prevent me and if I manage to tell him he will say ""No he lies I didn't hit him"". Also, if I try to hit him back he will hit me again but stronger. The real reason for bullying me in my opinion is because he knows that I'm weak and I won't do something about this.

595,"Okay this is a long one so bare with me! 

Okay so my (24M) younger sister (22F) played out a plan to kick me out of the house. So I was living with my mom and my sister lived with her as well. And we had to pay rent. I never had a lot of luck with jobs at all. I would always start a new job and stay there no longer then 5 months because of lack of hours. I almost never called off and I would try my hardest when I was at work but they always found an excuse to cut our hours. So I wouldn’t make a lot of money. So I would always give my mom all they money I had but would be left with nothing and it would never be enough. One day I was getting out of work and I get a call from my GF that she wants me to call my sister ASAP. So I give her a call and tells me that my mom wants me out of the house, she’s kicking me out. Me being me I’m broken at that point. I freak out for all of 10 minutes and I decided to leave. I pack my stuff and leave the house. My GFs family took me in and gave me a place to live. 

My mom was constantly calling me everyday for the next 3 days after I left and I didn’t answer. I didn’t really want to speak to her after all. I don’t  know what made me answer after she had nonstop called me for 3 days straight but I guess I just wanted to talk and tell her not to contact me. When I answer I just hear her crying and immediately tells me to come home. I told her what my sister told me that she wanted me out and told her I wasn’t coming home. She then stops talking like as if I stopped her in her tracks for 10 seconds then just starts saying that she didn’t mean it. After going back and forth about this she just snaps and says that she didn’t kick me out, that my sister did. I froze at the news I had just heard... we talked in person about this and turns out my sister suggested they kick me out of the house from lack of paying rent. My mom had refused and my sister didn’t look to happy about it. 

After all that I was absolutely infuriated with her. But chose not to say a thing about it to her. She started talking behind my back to my family and her BF and anyone I know about how I’m a fuck up and I won’t amount to anything. I’m currently trying to go to school after all. She has a tendency to lie a lot and constantly put herself before others. I don’t know why she lies so much so I feel stupid for even believing anything she says. She’s still trying to constantly talk to me like nothing happened. Like she didn’t kick me out or like she doesn’t use me. Honestly I’m actually happy I’m not living with my mother anymore. I always felt so miserable there and I felt depressed when living there. After moving in with my GF everything has gotten better. I have a steady job, I’m going to begin school soon. And I’ve never been happier. But I still feel a certain way about my sister. Like mad and upset. I kinda don’t want to talk to her ever and just have her be dead to me. I have just been happier without talking to her. What should I do?",02Feb2020,1
596,"I honestly don’t know what to think at the moment...there’s so much on my mind that can hardly think of anything to write down then string it together but I’ll do the best of my ability anyways.

I won’t get into specifics considering I can literally write a novel of what has happened to me the past 21 years and most recently and out of respect for everyone that’s involved with me. I can’t just throw them under the bus that way. 

The title says it all in a nutshell, I don’t know where the hell i’m headed at this point. I’m so tired of hoping something good will happen but all else fails then shit rolls down hill from there then I feel like I’m accountable for said happenings so I own up to them. I really just realized that life doesn’t give a shit if your happy, sad, young, old, healthy, or sick you just have to face whatever comes and it fuckin hurts. If I could just snap my fingers right now to change everything that’s going on I totally would in a heart beat but I’m just a normal living human being like all of you so I don’t get that privilege. I think about ending it everyday but I already know that I’m not going to ever really....I yet have these thoughts and I can’t help but cry myself to sleep every night. I literally cry everyday and I’m heartbroken. I’ve never been this heartbroken in my life, I thought I would be at some point but I didn’t know it would happen when I’m so young. 

I have so much to live for and I’m feeling this way. I don’t think I won’t ever progress and continue to live my life and do all of the things I want and achieve everything I’ve ever wanted.

599,"Hello !

I am coming here, very desperate because I think I have always been a wreck and unwanted kid my whole life. 

So I’ll start from the beginning, first my mom told me (when I was a grown up already) that she would’ve liked a boy but liked the idea of having another girl (I have a bigger sister) but she ain’t the antagonist, if anything I really look like my mom personality wise.

Okay so now things are getting real serious, I have always and I mean ALWAYS been lazy, which contrasts with my hardworking « perfect » sister. Also I’m a picky eater, lazy wreck who never gets stuff done and on top of that, I’m dumb ! I’m extremely dumb, I have no capacities at all ! I don’t know shit and when people ask me to do stuff I’m like huh how what ? I’m really not reliable 

Now that I grew up (I’m 18), I still feel like a child, I’m really not responsible. I can’t cook, I’m a clean freak and that annoys my sis who’s normal when it comes to hygiene (we live together btw) and... yeah I feel like I’m unwanted. My momma told me she used to be like me when she was younger but that ended badly since she didn’t graduate from high school and struggled to find a job.

Now I’m studying abroad, parents send me money and I feel unworthy of that, I don’t wanna work, I’m a child and I don’t deserve this. 

How can I change ? How can I feel confident ? I’m very anxious about everything I told and I’m scared I’ll screw up everything I start, thus why I don’t study hard. It’s like ice skating, I’m apprehending the fall before even trying to skate because I KNOW I’m a failure. Please help me change, please...",02Feb2020,1
601,"What do I do?

I'm a man, I work at a tech company and I'm not quite at the top yet, but I'm making leaps and bounds to get there. We hired a new employee a few months back. She's an attractive female who's very qualified for her job. I made the huge mistake of allowing her to confide in me. She told me about how she was unhappy in her relationship and felt trapped. She respected the boundary, so did I. I began noticing that she would text me for things that didn't pertain to anything at all, just trying to strike up conversation on the weekend. Being the guy I am, I wanted her to think I was a cool boss that she could be friends with. A few weeks of this went by and she made a comment one time about how ""I know you just went through a really bad breakup, if I were single I would totally fix that problem for you"". I didn't know what to say. TBH, I was a little shocked. But I disregarded it because of ""if I were single"". About another week went by and I started feeling the pressure. I could sense she was developing or had developed attraction for her boss. I did the responsible thing. When we had the office to ourselves, I took her to lunch 1 on 1 as to not arouse suspsicion of anything. When there, she started crying about the status of her marriage. I comforted her. This is when I told her, ""Look, I think you're great. I just have to be real with you here. I can't help but feel the way you're texting me is an indication of how you feel. I'm just saying to be blunt, this is how affairs start. I hate to do this to you but we really shouldn't be doing this. The more we do this, the more I'm starting to like you back, and we can't do that. I'm your boss and you're married. Maybe in another universe things could have been different, but I can't allow this to go on."" She respected my answer a lot. We went about 1 week successfully. Then she texted me a long text about how I was such a gentleman for identifying that she was starting to get feelings for me and we had to stop. she told me not to reply, so I didn't. Days later, she asks to talk with me on the phone because she can't stop thinking about that ""lunch"". She says, I can't stop thinking about what you said because it made me realize how I was actually starting to feel about you. That's when she asked me if I had ever wondered about us. I told her of course I did. She then said, I wish we could just make a mistake together to see if this was real. I told her that it was risky and complicated to do something like that. Then, in person, she kissed me. We went to my apartment and made love all night. By morning we talked about how this would never happen again, and we now know what a future with us would have looked like. Let's just say it went great. I was feeling for her now too. We went cold turkey but we both barely could make it a week. We couldn't even look at each other at work because attraction was so high. That's when she told me that she was going to end her relationship. She told me about some big fight they got into. I told her that I wouldn't do anything else unless she was 100% sure it was over and there was no going back. So we made the mistake again while she was married. My reasoning was it was more ok since she was on her way out of that relationship.

Problem. When she first confided in me, I told her I'd be willing to talk to him or her if they ever needed advice. She told him this back then because we were NOT a thing. Wasn't even on our minds. He added me on different forms of social media. He started messaging me but in an obvious sort of way to start challenging ""why"" I had been talking with her about their marriage. At the start I genuinely wanted to help them. 

So he doesn't know. But she and he got in a blowout fight and she told him she was done. He dropped her off in the middle of nowhere and she asked me over the phone in tears to pick her up. I did. She stayed the night again and we talked about how we might have a chance at that future together. Well, next morning, he goes to his carrier and checks her location. She gets the notification and contacts her carrier to stop location from him. He then pulls her record to see who she's been contacting. You can't see the content of the messages, just plain phone numbers and timestamps. This was enough for him to question her. She tells me she did a good job covering it because he's been known to be a paranoid guy who is borderline stalker in their marriage. So she used that to tell him that he was going too far. She had already started staying at her mom's house. She switched her phone number but have to wait for her to buy a new sim card. That way he can't track her or anything anymore.

I'm trapped in the middle. He knows my place of work, he's been there. He thinks I'm sketch. I genuinely didn't mean for this to happen and now here we are. I'm scared. I can't message her to see if he's onto us more or if I should be worried, and I don't know if he's going to do something extreme. Right now, he doesn't know anything concrete as far as I understand. But there were lots of tiny traces left behind (even though everything had been deleted). What should I do? I really like this girl. She didn't cheat because she was a slut. She did it because she wanted someone who was a better match for her. From what I understand, he's a low effort clingy stalker type. I'm afraid he's going to somehow uncover more. He's already shocked me with how much he's digging just for the sake of it. Should I ask for a job relocation? I can do that. Give it a few months over there so he thinks there are no ties and allow for breathing room and make distance between her and me? Do I stay and cut all things off? Do I keep him on my social media accounts? I feel like blocking him would only make him more suspicious. What do I do if he reaches out to me again and sends me those challenging types of messages?

Please, I could really use some help.",02Feb2020,1
602,"so recently, this girl who I was really vibing with suddenly started seeing some other dude behind my back, but the only reason it angered me is because she had told me she was in love with me and only me, and that I was the only person she was seeing. 

i couldn’t help but feel like it was karma for when I started talking to this girl who had a boyfriend last year and she caught hella feelings for me and we had a whole thing, but now that same girl is back and she told me she still has feelings for me and for some reason, I’ve always just vibed with that girl more than the one who things ended with, she’s kind of a ditz, but i can’t help but feel some way about her, I always have and it feels like the universe always pushes us back together. 

am i being a hypocrite by wanting to get back with her despite her still having a boyfriend, even if I know how much it hurts to get cheated on or played for someone else? they always seem on the verge of breakup but they never end up breaking up and they’re constantly fighting, in what hypothetical scenario do we get together without me looking or feeling like a hypocrite?",02Feb2020,1
604,"Okay. 

Do you believe in sex addiction? I guess that’s defined by simply being unable to stop, despite severe negative life or health consequences, like feeling depression getting sick and tired or losing your job etc. Is this me? Is this real and a thing and I’m a sex addict? 

So, I don’t know when to say yes and when to say no exactly
Aside from the obvious: homeless people, complete strangers, Anything unconsenting, extremely young or old people, people with STD’s, sex workers. Cool. 

I’m VERY sex positive. But suffering deeply because I can’t say no. 

I want to say no. But not forever. Right? 

But when exactly do I say yes? 

Some background: Lots Of casual encounters at parties or nightclubs, love to watch A LOT of porn (at the tiniest craving a few taps of my thumb and the most exciting thing is there on my smartphone in seconds.) I literally CAN’T say no in the face of temptation. It’s making me sick, broke, I’m almost 32 and have to move back in with my parents, I haven’t had a meaningful fulfilling loving caring long term relationship with an SO in over 11 years. I’m often depressed and sick and lethargic, I’m gaining weight, I have no friends. All I wanna do is fuck. I just don’t know when it’s okay and when it’s not. It seems I CANT say no very well, at all, but this isn’t forever to say no, when I resist temptations and do, so when do I say yes? Is it realistic to say “no sex or masturbation at all until I make some good friends, get a job, move out of my parents and get my own place, lose 25lbs...” this could be literally 2 years or more. I’d have to say ‘No’ 1000’s Of times until I decide to say ‘Yes’ again, but when and where and with whom should this Yes occur and how do I Clearly Exactly Know that? I am doing so bad in life after INTENNNSSSEEEE sexual experiences: I’m really sick and depressed right now guys lethargic irritable and feel often so anxious, low self esteem, broke, no friends, failing in life, I haven’t been happy in so long.... I don’t think sex can be a high priority to me (saying ‘No’) even though I want it so badly right now when I’m failing this bad in life. 

Wtf do I do? Title says it all I guess. Thanks so much for your clarity guidance and perspective.",02Feb2020,1

I was and still am extremely and love with her and I hope she’s still extremely in love with me. We’ve had our fair share of issues like any relationship does and broke up twice but always ended up getting back together. I’ve been through everything with her. She was/is apart of me. I’ve shared so many memories and moments with her and i’ve always feared that she would move or something.

Now to what’s happening. The other day me and Jess were hanging out and she told me that she was moving. I didn’t even know how to feel about this. I almost immediately burst into tears. She had to go shortly after so we texted and she wanted to break up because she knew that we’d eventually have to say goodbye. She’s moving many states away and she’s against long distance relationships so that’s not even an option for her. The last time we talked was last night and all I could do was beg her not to go but it wasn’t even up to her. It was her moms decision. I’m so devastated. 3 years is such a long time to be with one person. We both shaped each other and now it’s all over. The saddest part is she doesn’t even seem as devastated as I am. I don’t understand how she’s taking this so well. She decided to stop talking to me last night. I’ve been crying ever since. I feel physically sick due to this, i’m just so depressed over it. I don’t even have anyone to talk to about it because she was the one i talked to about everything, but now she’s gone. I’ve always had a difficult time saying goodbye but this is different. This is basically goodbye forever. Everyone i’ve tried to talk to about it doesn’t seem to care. I feel like i’m annoying them so i’ve just stopped reaching out. I just cannot even function. I don’t feel like eating or doing any sort of activity. The only thing i can think about is her. My mom keeps telling me that i’ll get through it, and i know i will. I just want to get through it fast. I don’t want to cry anymore. If anyone out there can help me find a way to cope with her leaving it would mean the world.

615,"Throw away account to start with, sorry about that.

So I'd just like a little bit of advice if that's possible, thanks in advance to anyone who replies.

A few incidents while I was younger caused me to have trust issues among other things ( Generalised anxiety disorder, Social Anxiety, PTSD,  Clinical depression, low self esteem ) 

What impacted me the most trust wise was being cheated on in relationships. I tried to write off earlier cases of this as I was a teenager and young people do stupid things. 

However in my first ""serious"" relationship I thought things would be different. We were together for 3 years, my ex enrolled at a college 2.5 years into our relationship (UK college so no moving away, just extra qualifications to get into University). 

I eventually found out through one of her friends that she had cheated on me with multiple different men, almost immediately after enrolling. I quickly ended the relationship because infidelity is a deal breaker for me.

Since the split I have socially retreated inwards, I haven't dated, made any new friends, I don't work due to chronic illnesses so I see no one in a day. 

Our split was almost 8 years ago and I feel like I have stagnated ever since. I distrust everyone with a major emphasis on women and I want to try and get back into the real world again.",02Feb2020,1

So a couple of days ago it was A's birthday and I wanted to get her something. Now, because I kinda have a crush on A, I didn't really want to get something too corny because even though I have a crush on her, I can see that I'm not her type and it would ruin things. On a brief sidenote, I stopped talking to A last semester because I started to develop feelings for her so I hadn't talked to her a lot before her birthday. Anyways, I knew she liked Nutella so I bought her that. B also wanted to get her something but she was busy with classes so she was like ""hey, why don't you go buy her a cupcake"" and I was like ""sure but it'll count as a gift from both of us."" So I went and bought her the cupcake too. Now, by this point I had talked to C to arrange at what time we could drop by and surprise A since C lived in the dorm right across A's. So I get back to university and B says that she's gonna be busy with some assignments and has to go to the gym with her boyfriend, then she asks me if 8pm would be a good time to drop by A's dorm. So I ask C if she thinks it's a good time for us to drop by and she says yes. So at 8 we go to the residence building but C is not picked my up so we can't go in. This goes on for like 5 minutes, at which point B starts calling her and C comes down. So we go to A's dorm and it turns out she was actually not there. I was a bit mad because I thought when C said it was okay to drop by at this time, that she meant A was actually gonna be there. But it's fine. B and I just tell C to give A the cupcake and the Nutella whenever she sees her. So on the next few days I'm honestly just waiting for a text that sor of says ""Hey I received the Nutella, thank you!"", but that doesn't happen. So a weekend after A's birthday I ask B if A said something to her because at this point I'm thinking that maybe C forgot to give A the gifts. B says A thanked her through Snapchat. She asked ""why did she say anything to you?"" And I said ""No but maybe she just changed phones and doesn't have my number, it's fine"" which I believed to be true. Anyways, it kinda stings that I did those things and haven't gotten a 'thank you.' so I texted A yesterday and said ""Hey, long time no see, how was your birthday?"" No reply. So I thought to myself that maybe those gifts were corny and she just doesn't want to be friends with me because she now knows I kinda have a crush on her. So maybe I'll just cut it off and if she says hi then I'll say hi too but not buy her anymore gifts. I don't hold a grudge against her, it just doesn't seem worth it to spend money on cupcakes and Nutella on someone who doesn't seem interested in me as a friend. I told this to another friend of mine and he says I gotta stand up for my self and text her ""all you had to do was say thank you."" He says I need to have a backbone or girls will keep taking advantage of me like this (which I don't feel like she did but he says she knows 100% what she's doing). Anyways, am I a 'nice guy' for expecting a thank you ? And if so, how do I stop? It kinda stings right know that she didn't even acknowledge me and I feel sad because of it. 

Feel free to criticize me if you think I messed up.

TL;DR spent money on a  cupcake and Nutella for my friend who is also a mild crush and didn't get a thank you. Feel bad because of it and don't know if I'm being a 'nice guy' by doing this.",02Feb2020,1
619,"This is the first time I'll be getting Internet in my name in the States (Tucson, AZ, if it makes a difference), and I'm overwhelmed by choice and what the hell I'm supposed to do.

If anyone can recommend a good ISP, or point me in the direction of where to start, I'd appreciate it. 

First concern is price, second (and this is crucial) is I don't want to be locked into a 6/12 month contract or whatnot. We don't know where we're going to be in the near future so obviously don't want to be paying for a service we can't use.

638,"I used to work at this company which had a staff of 5 people out of which only 3 (includes me) came to office and the other 2 worked virtually. Anyway, I interned there for 2 months and I was the only girl. At first, my boss used to call me to his cabin to assign me work and the conversations used to last for 5-10 mins maximum and I'd go back to my desk.

As time went by, the conversations became more about me, politics, life in general, our opinions, etc. He used to call me in his cabin and talk about work for 5 mins, and the rest 25-35 mins we'd have random conversations. One time, we were just sitting in the cabin showing each other pictures and videos of cute dogs on Instagram. He even subtly asked me if I have a boyfriend, but NEVER once mentioned he had a wife. I found out about his wife after he told about it to another intern (a boy who joined after me) who then told me.

I likes spending time with him and naturally, I liked the attention. My boyfriend knew about it and was sceptical as well as to why he would call me into his cabin everyday just to talk. I didn't think much of it till it got kinda obvious that he was flirting (according to my definition of flirting lol). The conversation went like this: 

*I was a social media marketer and our posts had done amazingly well. This conversation is on Instagram*
Me: omg so many likes! What is going on haha
Boss: probably (my name)'s magic is going on. LOL. 

Another time was when I was telling him about the time I used to live alone
Me: So I used to live all by myself when I was 18
Boss: Wow, so you must be calling your friends often since there was nobody at home ;)
Me: umm.. not really lol

Another one, he had randomly texted this to me on Instagram: 
""Sometimes, I delay work for no reason and therefore need someone to push me to do it. Today you did it, thank you for that. Good job""
(This tbh sounds like random appreciation to me but my boyfriend thought it's a form of flirting?)

There were many subtle instances like these but the above were the top obvious ones.

My internship was coming to an end and he had offered me a full time job but I couldn't take it because I wanted to focus on my college studies. He made SO MANY offers to make me stay. He offered that I only come 3 days a week to the office or atleast come just one day and work at home the rest. He was really persuading me to stay for some reason despite me telling him it's not possible.

After the internship ended, there were some formalities left on his side like certificates and letter or recommendation for which he called me twice (one out of which he said the papers weren't ready and made me sit in his office where we again talked for hours). He used to ask me time and again when my next internship is (he is assuming I'll work for him again).

Coming to my dilemma, I'm confused because he's the first and the only boss I've worked for till now and I am the type of person who always seeks closure out of any relationship. I'm genuinely confused as to what our relationship was - was he into me but didn't act on it because he was married? Or am I reading too much into it and he's just very friendly?

643,"When i was 17 I was drinking at a party with some friends. There was this girl (let’s call her Sophie) which I met that night. Things hit off between us and we fucked. It was both of our first times so it was super awkward. Idk how consent works in this case because we were both intoxicated and we both mutually initiated. I have texts from her after the fact saying she consented so I thought it was all good. 

I’m 19 now in university and I haven’t even seen this girl for over a year now. When all of a sudden another friend (who doesn’t even know Sophie) brought up something about me raping her. I was shocked didn’t know what to say and just said loooool nooooo wdym we just kissed that’s it (I was ducking scared). Turns out this friend heard this through like 6 other people. Like Sophie told Kathy who told Hannah who told Darcy who told Rachel who told the girl who told me (all made up names)

I send the girl a text saying what happened with the screenshot of Sophie saying she consented. She was cool with it and she passed it down the line of girls from earlier. This whole Shazam gave me some crippling anxiety. My appetite was messed for a whole week. I couldn’t even lift any weights at the gym. Like it was really bad. It still affects me now I randomly get panic attacks and am super anxious about everything. 

What if I actually did rape her?? Because her friends were spreading the rumour. What if she only consented because she was too ashamed to come forward that she was raped.  She’s really well off. She was super successful academically at high school and goes to a top university in Australia.  Being raped could negatively affect her reputation. This could fuck up my entire life if she wanted to. My sexual life has also been impacted. Every time I am intimate with another girl I get flashbacks to that night. I don’t know if I seriously fucked up and this could really bite my ass down the line. What should I do. Do I just sit it out and hope nothing comes of it. Should I try contact Sophie and the other girls? But if I do they might have some sort of resentment towards me and then Sophie could come forward saying she was raped.

647,"Whenever I see a girl, often pretty, who is vulnerable or scared or sad, I get this very weird feeling. I crave them to be near me, and they are in my thoughts for weeks after.I am a 17-year-old male teenager, and therefore it is often young girls aged 17 to 20 I suddenly can get very drawn too. I have seen my share of Bondage porn, but I don't enjoy that anymore, and therefore this weirds me out. It is not like I want to dominate them, but I still have a huge wish to be with them sexually WHILE they are sad or scared. There is something about a sad girl's scared face I really find attractive.

It is weird, because it is not like i want them to be unhappy.... This can happen in real life, but also with characters from movies. A good example is the Netflix series ""The Witcher"", where I have been really drawn to Ciri, and the scenes where she is vulnerable.

I am normally a person who is in control of my emotions, and always able to pinpoint the feeling and what it exactly is. I can't do that here, and it freaks me out that I might actually get turned on by vulnerability. Not physical, but emotional vulnerability.

I hope you could understand my English and are willing to help me get to the root of this emotion, and why I find the sad girls so attractive.

Edit: It is important to note that i am not only drawn to them sexually. I have a huge desire to get to know them, and just talk with them. Imagining them laughing and feeling safe with me is also something i can think off a lot, which is weird since it is a huge contrast to the other vulnerable scared state i also like them to be in in my head.",02Feb2020,1

653,"Hello Reddit.

This is going to be a long and hefty story, but I don't know who else to turn to. All my friends tell me that ""the best comeback is living well"" but I dont know. I just cant shake this feeling of wanting to do something drastic. I might be selfish for wanting others to hear what I have to say, especially because I know there are stories on here that deserve a lot more outreach, but I'm going to share it anyway. Here is my story.

When I (20F) was younger, I looked up to everyone on my mom's side of the family. They were all very pretty, very rich, went to very prestigious schools, and were in very happy marriages. I wondered if i had what it took to become a respected, decent person just like them, and I even hated myself a lot of the time because I didn't think I could do it. It also didn't help the fact that I was chubby, loud, and not very smart lol.

The twist was that I was actually quite thin (I was 5'8"" 130 lbs), above-average smart although not like the smartest person ever (4.2 gpa, 30 ACT), and also quite accomplished (6th best violinist in the school out of 100 or so violinists + got to play at carniege hall with the symphony for a competition and got first place). But compared to my mom's side I was fucking nothing so I basically went through high school with 0 confidence in myself to amount to anything special.

I don't blame my mom's side for my own lack of self esteem, but I do think the high expectations messed me up a little bit. I had 100% convinced myself that I was overweight and that my grades were shit and I should just stop trying altogether. So in my last year of high school I gained 25 lbs and stopped going to class. I lost the confidence to even stand next to my friends and became a total shut-in.

When I got to college mostly everyone I knew were getting into relationships whereas I thought ""why the hell would anyone want to date someone like me"" (yeah, I know, pretty edgy). So when someone asked me out for the first time ever I said yes without hesitation and considered myself lucky. I never said no to him. Anything he wanted, I would do. I never complained when he was 3 hours late to everything, made me do his homework, and guilted me into doing sexual shit that I later regretted. I didnt even say anything when he would victim blame sexual assault victims that came up on the news about the school (he was very religious-right). Everyone told me to leave him but that was impossible when I had the self-confidence of a dust mite.

When I had finally gained a shred of confidence (aka tired of hearing my friends talk) after 7 months with this guy I threatened to leave him. He guilted me back into staying by saying he would kill himself if I left. This happened multiple times. Until one day my parents found out and got me out of that situation. He'd leave endless messages, get his friends (who didnt know anything) to leave messages, and even follow me into my apartment building (where you needed a key to get in) late at night. I had to move just to make it stop. Eventually, the cops were called but that didn't stop him either. Serious academic repercussions were threatened which finally got him to stop.

I fell into a deep depression. I had to drop a class and get an incomplete from another class (basically no grade until you finish the course). I stopped going to my extra circulars. I gained more weight. I lost more sleep. I made 2 separate appointments with our school's therapists but backed out of both of them last minute thinking I had lived a very privileged life and that I didn't need therapy. My school is near a forest, so I would always go into the woods at ungodly hours of the pitch-black night and for the most part just wander around wishing I was dead. But I also used that time to do some deep self-reflection. Why did I act so submissively during the relationship? Why did I think all of this was okay? Why did I feel so guilty all of the time? I didnt understand why I was so loyal to someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong. After months I ended up tracing back these feelings to my childhood.

My mom's side... although seemingly perfect, were actually very, very religious-right conservative. As such, most of the women on her side were housewives. I didn't think too much into it because they all seemed happy. But whatever the women did, they did second to their husbands. They didn't speak out of turn, they stayed thin (even if it meant not eating), they listened (or pretended to listen) intently when their husbands would talk about the amazing qualities of Trump. They all cooked and cleaned. They chose all the right words to fluff their husband's egos. At the time I was impartial to politics so I didn't really care if they voted for this person or that person... I was just selfishly obsessed with their image of happiness. But I started to wonder if this image was real. Of course, I doubted myself into thinking that I was just projecting my own unhappiness onto them. But I couldn't shake this feeling that somehow... SOMEHOW... my ex-boyfriend in some ways resembled the men in my family.

And then I found out the truth.

My father (god bless his soul) is a *very* observant man. He is nothing like the men on my mom's side. And on the long road trip home after school got out, he decided it was time for me to know everything. This is what I learned.

My mom has one brother (Adam) and one sister (Lilith).

Adam made his wealth building his own firm which now employs 100+ people. He owns multiple homes and often takes expensive vacations. He has 3 children, two older girls and one younger boy. He sent them all to the one of the most expensive private schools in the nation and the girls were pursuing the least lucrative degrees. None of them use their degrees now. But he could afford it so it was whatever.

I learned that most of his assets were a lie. Half a decade ago, Adam's family was going through some rough financial times. Any sane person who was financially struggling would stop flaunting their wealth at that point and scrape together their savings while possibly downsizing/selling their homes. But nope. He's a real shady guy. He gamed the system and essentially put everyone's college debt onto their house and foreclosed on the house. This basically means that anyone who was paying taxes was now also paying for 3 random rich kids's unnecessarily expensive private school tuitions.

Tbh yeah I sort of get it if times are really tough and you need to do that in order to not die. But my uncle Adam has no shred of guilt or care for other people. He only did this in order to keep maintaing his lifestyle and flaunt his wealth. He didnt suspend his vacations. He didnt wise up. He didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong. And now that he doesn't have to deal with all that college debt, he buys a multi-million dollar house in another, more expensive location. Smh. And I used to think people who were religious had some sort of moral code.

Now here comes the juicy part if it's not already juicy.

The reason why he was struggling with money in the first place was because 1) 2008 financial crisis aftermath (it was a miracle he even survived it) 2) a few years back he *JOINED A CULT AND SOLD OFF ALL HIS ASSETS AND DONATED IT TO THE CULT*

Often times I see people joking about organized religion and how they're essentially cults. But this was a legit, illegal, organized, kool aid-esque, mid-sized cult in the city. They were (of course) preaching about doomsday, and that everyone needed to sell off all their assets in order to be received by god in their naked state. They also told everyone that they would *handle* everyone's assets for them. Failure to meet such conditions resulted in your departure to h-e-double-hockey-sticks.

Adam was batshit crazy. He would try to get everyone in the family to join the cult. No one did. He would go into the streets and try to get random people to join the cult. My dad said he was embarrassed to be seen with him sometimes. And of course, the doomsdays came and went. And each doomsday didnt phase Adam one bit. It wasnt until after the cult leader was arrested that Adam started to snap out of it a little bit. But even then it took a while for him to realize what had really happened. He never felt guilty or ashamed for essentially ruining his whole family by falling for this cult. He held his head high and simply never mentioned it again. To this day he admits to nothing.

He also did some other less important petty stuff like he would ""forget"" to pay back 5 grand he borrowed from a relative, or insist that his firm did a good job in x when in fact my mom has a degree in x and said that it was done poorly. When it broke he blamed it on the weather. Small shit but still indicative of his poor character.

Let's talk about Lilith (thank you for making it this far).

My mom's side had originally immigrated here from another country and like all immigrants started off poor. Lilith met a man (Richard) who was studying to become an engineer at a college where she was studying to become a doctor. This man was on a student visa from the same country my mom's side was from. His parents were damn wealthy. They did the architecture for some of that country's biggest universities.

Unfortunately she became rather ashamed of her poor family. I figure that hes largely responsible for this bad mindset. He came from a very *traditional* family in a very traditional country. His mother was the pinnacle of a perfect woman in that society. She was pretty, fair-skinned, and *very* submissive. Total woman of the household. She did all the cooking, cleaning, and never got a degree. She didn't need one. She took care of the children while her husband earned the money. Dont get me wrong, I think this is fine. But you have to really want this lifestyle. You shouldnt be guilted into it by some ancient system that cant keep up with the times.

Thus, the man is considered the bread and butter of any household in our culture. And Richard was that plus he was a rich asshole. I suspect he made Lilith feel bad about her upbringing. She stopped attending my mom's side's family events for him. He never even introduced himself to her family. Thats a huge HUGE disrespect in ANY culture. And the worst part... *she changed courses to pharmacy because he told her being a doctor was too much work for girls.*

My dad later found out that this was all because he realized bioengineering was too hard for him so he switched to orthodontics and tried to get Lilith to do pharmacy so that he could still look like the bigger man. He also tried to get my mom, who was in dental school at the time, to drop it entirely because dentistry is too much work for girls. My mom (god bless her fucking soul) was like, ""nah"".

This dynamic continued into their marriage. Lilith ALWAYS puts her husband first. One time she didnt show up to my niece's wedding because it was his nephew's BIRTHDAY. Also hes a hippocrite. He always advocates for the woman to not work but he keeps Lilith working because her pharmacy gives her health insurance and she put him on it. She probably earns more than him but she still gets his hand-me-down cars. She never gets to take trips (its typical for husbands not to let their wives go on vacation out of jealousy). She never gets to see her family. She has to listen to all his political rantings about how Trump is the most moral person ever. And how the church did nothing wrong and all those cases about high catholic figures molesting young children are isolated events. He has his group of friends who think the same way as him, and they all tell his son to find a submissive wife like his mother. And he is someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.

Oh also, he likes to preach to everyone about his accomplishments but its like. Your parents gave you everything all you had to do was go to school and follow the path. How could you ever compare to your wife, who started in this country speaking no english, in a poor family, graduated top honors, paid for it all herself, and flourished into a great career? Idgi.

I wont go on but it doesnt end here. Most of the women on my moms side dont have technical degrees. Im not trying to be disrespectful towards those degrees, however this means its a lot harder for them to make money. I looked up to all of them for the happiness I thought they had, but behind the veneers they all have piece of shit husbands who treat them lesser than. They wont let them go out because theyre just that jealous. They wont admit that the women are probably a lot smarter than them. They encourage their daughters to get wealthy husbands instead of lucrative degrees.

I hate it.

I hate how whenever they come over they try to teach me lessons about living a good and honest life. I hate how they can just live everyday acting as though they didnt just fuck over a lot of people. I hate how they think they deserve their wealth and respect. Like. You. Literally just ruined your family by making them join a cult. And you never learned from that. You effectively took away a womans career in order to make yourself feel more like a man. How could I ever respect you.

And I had grown up respecting these people. I had been taught through these subtleties how to act around men. I had been taught through watching my role models and receiving teachings at family functions that I needed to be skinny, get a non-lucrative degree, find a rich husband, shell out some kids and pray to god everyday. And this shame that a lot of the women on my moms side probably feel everyday is what i got a small taste of when I was with that man who resembled the men on my moms side. I never want to feel that shame again.

SO... What do i do. I almost have my life fully together now in the wake of dating that guy. I lost like half of the weight I gained in all that depression from high school and on (to be healthy, not to be skinny). My classes are fine again, and Im on track to graduate right on time in the summer. I switched over to a technical degree. I dont have a job lined up yet but Ive done a few internships and im very certain ill have a well-paying job before graduation. Ive found my friends again and im living well.

But i still have this burning need thats been going on since summer. This need to *do something*. I dont know what that something is. Something that would let them know I made it without their stupid ass teachings. Some major ""fuck you"" to every idiot who thinks women are meant to have babies and thats it.  Something that would allow my aunt not to hate her damn family anymore. Maybe thats something she needs to figure out for herself, but ahh what can I do to help???

One day my dad told me this outrageous theory.

His theory was that shes going to get a divorce. He said that she doesnt rlly care about all that trump stuff and he has a crazy idea that one day in the next 10 years or so shes gonna realize she only has x amount of days left on this earth and shes gonna think ""man i cant spent the rest of it catering to this guy"" and straight up leave. I think thats awesome and I want to be able to support her.

So 50% for my aunt and all the women in my family, 50% for my own selfish reasons, I would like to stage something grand.  What should I do?  I politely ask that you leave out the ""you need to go on with your life and be happy"" because I know I will do this but I also want to help my aunt at the same time.  As long as it benefits me and others in the long run, i would probably very much enjoy doing it.

What do i need to do?  No matter how unreasonable, id like to hear your thoughts. Shoot for the moon and youll land amongst the stars they say.  Do i need to become rich?  Do I need to become respected enough so that they listen to what I have to say?  Gah that sounds so selfish but i dont know.  Do I need to become... I dont really know!  I wanna hear your thoughts reddit. By the way, as i said no one thinks much of me in the family. This is good as it gives me as it keeps me under the radar, but bad as i currently hold no power within the family. Thats why I say i want to slow cook a massive grand plan and reveal what ive done by the time im 30. That gives me about 10 years.

Thank you for reaching the end omg ;;;(((

656,"so i’ve a crush on a close family friend of mine for around two years now (but he’s been cute ever since we were little ngl, lets call him joseph) we only see each other a few times a year and hardly talked, but he’s the type of guy whose smile can light up the room and i’ve always wanted to impress him by being the coolest in the room- that type of guy, basically. the problem is that he’s kind of a douche. 

to preface, we had told each other that we liked each other on new years. we decided to stay friends because, one, if we broke up it would be awkward for everyone and two, we live at least a 40 minutes drive from each other.

we were talking yesterday (one time out of the year where my mom threw a party and of course, everyone is invited) with a few other guy friends and somehow exes came up. joseph brings up that the other two guys in the room have never dated anyone, and then one brings up they should all be virgins because we’re only, like, sophomores. joseph goes on to say he isn’t and that he lost it to his fifth grade girlfriend. he also says that ‘yeah, isabelle was cool in 5th grade, but now? she’s fine. girls get cool when you leave them.’ it’s kind of shitty to hear when you’re pining after a guy. 

prior to this me and a girlfriend of mine were talking about how i should just make a move even though we decided to be friends because i keep talking about how i wish we could be more, but it isn’t really fair to him. i was gonna kiss him on the cheek before he left. let me preface that im a kissless virgin and am an abysmally unsociable pussy most of the time. 

i don’t know if he was just fronting to seem cooler or if he genuinely meant it, but my girlfriend keeps saying that the way joseph looks at me when im not looking is a telltale sign he likes me. 

also to preface; im a trans guy. he knew me before transitioning, back in kindergarten. we are just two bros chilling in a hot tub five feet apart because homophobia the culture we live in is real, probably, and the threat of our families making a big deal out of it is genuinely scary.",02Feb2020,1

660,"I very recently started a new job in medical office (after being unemployed for a long time after graduating college). I understand that sometimes jobs aren't perfect and you have to stick it out until it gets better, but I have some concerns. 

First, I'm not adequately being trained for the level of work they expect. They say they're not throwing me to the wolves, but they expect me to know stuff that I've never even heard of or seen before. For example, they expect me to know who everyone is, when they're working, all of the transfer numbers/emails. I've started compiling this information on my own, but anytime I ask for this information my coworkers are incredibly rude about it. Or they say that they'll give me the information later and never do (even bugging them about it doesn't help). They also expect me to already know the entire process of my job without having questions or making mistakes. Working with insurances can be pretty tricky so the process of finding out the correct information isn't always so cut and dry. Also, when I start working on my own I'll be the only one on site that would normally know how to do my job so I won't have anyone there for me to ask questions. 

Second, my supervisor is constantly changing my schedule (when and what location I'm working at last minute). She called me last week at 9:02 asking if I could come in at 9:00 (I'm not even kidding). They never also account for the drive time and the time it takes me to get ready so I'm always showing up late (which they're unhappy about). 

Third, they have a really strict dress code and are always upset if I show up last minute not looking ""more put together"". Last week when they wanted me there immediately I had about ten minutes to get ready (women are required to wear makeup and have our hair done and have our uniforms pressed). 

Fourth, finding time to eat lunch or go to the bathroom is hard because they always require me to find someone to cover my position (someone from the back that doesn't actually know my job so if anything happens I'm called back and my break is over). They don't like us to eat at our desk so that's not an option. They also require that the phones be picked up by the second ring no matter what. We also have tasks that take us away from the desk so sometimes it is difficult to make it to the phone in time. 

I feel like I have to walk on eggshells at  work because if I make a mistake or have a question I'll have some supervisor lecturing me for not knowing something I haven't even been trained on. How long do you put up with behavior like this before moving on to other opportunities? I've continued to apply to jobs, but I haven't heard back from anything yet. I know I really shouldn't quit before having another job lined up, but I also have a hard time going to work when it is the way it is.",02Feb2020,1

I have so many friends and people that give me affirmation for the work that I’ve done and my business success so far, but I feel so alone, un-contempt, ugly, and empty inside.

I had a rough Friday night so I didn’t feel like drinking or going out Saturday night so when my roommate and our friends left our room where they were pregaming, I cleaned up, had some food, listened to some music and relaxed. 

At about 1:30 I took a Melatonin to go to sleep, and about 7-10 minutes later my roommate comes back with this girl he’s been hanging out with all weekend. I sleep with a mask to cover my eyes because my roommate likes to sleep with LEDs light strips and a giant LED sign on. They came back to the room and from what I could hear realized that I was “asleep” and left. I was happy because although I wasn’t asleep, my roommate didn’t tell me he was bringing someone back because I just figured if they saw I was asleep they’d find somewhere else to go.

Fast forward 2 minutes later and they’re back in the room. I hear my roommate open up his desk drawer and open a condom wrapper, and before you know it I’m hearing every noise imaginable.

The most radical choice is what attracts me the most, moving to another city 150 miles away and starting life over. I have plenty of savings, no debt and would not struggle to pay the rent. It would be scary, even though I have done this twice in the past, unemployed both times. 

But I am concerned why this keeps happening. Am I doing this to myself? I don't want to keep working these jobs, but companies aren't willing to train me in anything. There's public education, but it's unreliable and expensive. I would be self-employed if I had enough marketable skills. 

What I definitely do know is that I need better chances at life, and the new city I am looking to live in has cheaper rents, better public transport, and more jobs. There are also some IT training schemes that look interesting. Staying here pales in comparison. And if it didn't work, I would simply move again.

What do you think? Does this sound like someone who knows what they're doing or somebody who just needs to sort themselves out before they do anything?",02Feb2020,1
675,"This is my first time posting anything on reddit, I really need help on this thing. For a little background info I’m in job corps currently and it’s my 4th full month in. I’m in a maintenance class with this one girl that is rumored to be one that gets “passed around a lot”. She never had a full blown conversation with me until 2 weeks ago when a small group was chosen for a painting project. Me and her had a room to paint. During that time we conversed about sex and things of the like. (I never chosen the topics. I was just following her lead.) She would touch my nips, body, and ass from time to time. This would consist throughout the timeframe we we’re working on the project. (Up until last Friday. ) To clarify on my end, I went along with everything because I wanted to get some ass or something. I’ve only had sex a few times with one girl a few years back and I wanted to move on with my sex life, hopefully starting with her. So just yesterday I was walking from the recreational building towards my dorm to grab a charger for my speaker when she was pacing in the gazebo right next to the path I was taking. She stopped me and we talked about her trying to be everyone’s rock. A few people joined in and left within about a half hour, then she invited me for a walk. We talked for a awhile while we were on this night walk. She was leading the was towards this area which was unused during the night hours usually. Especially in the cold. There was a two story staircase that was somewhat exposed. “This is where people fuck” she said. “Oh shit really? Doesn’t look like it”. She then explained how it was then she posted up inside the place.... where people fucked obviously. At this point my heart was racing and I was incredibly nervous. I knew it was going to happen. We talked a bit and I brought up a silly thing we texted about. We play argued a bit and we got closer. She grabbed my pockets and we made out. Things were going decent. Grabbed cheeks and all. After what felt like 5 minutes of nonstop face sucking, she said “let’s just fuck”. I was like ok. Like a doofus. 

So she bent over and laid out the meal. I got my nervous trooper out and it was a half chub at best. I was having a heart attack at that point. What was supposed to be a great moment turned into a nightmare. I was stalling for time by fingering her but that didn’t help my scared lil guy. I said “Shit I can’t find it”. She scoffed a lil and grabbed my sausage mobile and said in a annoyed voice, “ you’re not hard enough, it’s probably too cold”. We thought about sneaking into one of our dorms, but there was a security lady that she pointed out. Apparently she monitors the shit outta the cameras. We then returned to the gazebo that started the night. I said some stupid stuff then we headed into the rec. I went to return a belt for deadlifting I did before I had the unexpected run in. She said that she has to make a call to someone and she’s heading out. “We’re still cool though”. After she said that I kinda fell into a horrible mental state like I was loosing it. I went back into dorm and was just yelling and basically having a crisis. I was looking up treatment for ED and stuff of the like on google. I even texted my ex, the one and only person I actually did it with, about the matter and we rarely talked. I used my friend’s phone to call her because there’s no reception out here. We talked for about 40 minutes. She basically said that I’m like a switch and that it happens with a lot dudes that she sleeps with. “I’ll would be worried if you did get it up in that cold”. She also said that I probably wasn’t ready.  She calmed me down and told me that it’ll be fine. That meant a lot to me. The last time I’ve spoken to her over the phone was at least a year ago. She said we can talk more about it tomorrow (today). I went into the group chat that me, her, and a few others from the class are in. She saw me in there and disappeared instantly. Like she’s avoiding me. 

Well I need advice on how to handle this situation.  I’m having a breakdown over her and if she were to say something about me,  not getting it,  to the class then to the entire campus. Should I try for round 2? Should I just skip out on the redemption shot? I’m really fucked rn. 

A few extra details I should add is that I’m a porn and wank addict. I’m attempting to recover right now; I’m on day 6. I’ve had this for almost 8 years. 

When I did have sex for the first time I couldn’t cum at all. I couldn’t feel much but I kept it pushing. I guess that contributed to the anxiety that night. 

I’m 20
She’s 18

676,"Sorry for bad grammar..

I’m 13 and I’ve known him for five years. A week before my birthday party I made plans with everybody for a birthday party.  He wasn’t responding on the day my party was so I was like, maybe he will just show up. 
He didn’t, but it’s ok. He always has Shit to do... so it’s probably something family related and I thought at the time that he’d just hang out with me some other time to hang out. 
After the birthday party, I let him know he missed it. but my party was a jam, anyway. Well, he didn’t respond for three weeks. Then while I was live-streaming he tried to correct one of my lyrics. I was like, “omfg thank you for coming back holy shit-“ I asked him if he knew he missed my b day, and he said “I know.” My mother told me just not to talk about that. 
Then after a little talking from time to time, he just left for Id say 3 more weeks. 
Last Saturday he out of the blue said, “everything I told you is a lie.” And “I didn’t care enough to answer to you. I’m sorry, but it is the truth, I’m packing up my old life and moving on.” I asked him if we were still friends, and he just said, “you were in my old life, right?”
Thing is, he just wants to escape what happened at my school. He moved schools, and he hated the drama at my school. I get it, I want to escape drama too. But I have nothing to do with it. There was never any drama with me, it was just my friends. 
I knew everything about him. He knew everything about me. We knew each others favorite restaurants, each other’s sexual orientation, we knew each others viewpoints of something, we always eventually agreed on something, and to together even more worse we literally almost had sex. I think I loved him. If something was going on, I could understand. If he wanted time to himself all I need is an explanation. 
After he basically just said he doesn’t like me anymore, I begged. He just kept responding “ok.” I went off and started spewing suicidal shit. And he gets really mad at me when I’m really sad.  He just kept acting like he didn’t care... 
the next day I messaged him again and I started begging him again.
It’s been a week and I can’t stop thinking about it. I have not been doing my homework consistently and also I have been getting random mood swings. One minute it’s like I’m drunk and the next minute I’m just sad. And sometimes I get really mad. It just feels like there is a hole in my heart. Sometimes I just break down crying. My sleep patterns are all messed up too. I can’t go to sleep how I used to. The thought of me killing myself comes back and back again. I don’t really wanna die, I don’t consider it. However, the thought of me dead comes back and it’s coming back more and more frequently. 
I’ve contacted the suicide prevention hotline and they just related to me and gave me a list of coping mechanisms that don’t really work. My friends just say he is a dick and I should forget about him. My parents just say I have to move on. 
I can’t. The thought of never seeing him again fills my mind 24/7 and I cannot just let this go. 

I need help.",02Feb2020,1
677,"Hi! New on Reddit, so sorry if I'm doing something wrong!  
So here's the deal:  
I  used to be a very introverted kid my whole life up until starting  college. I'm not sure what happened that switched my personality to  becoming more extroverted and expressive that I could literally just  walk up to strangers and greet them (which I would be afraid to death to  do that before)  
Now I'm basically the class clown in my college (as opposed to being the quiet kid in high school)

But for the past months I've realized I'm a bit too much for people, as in I'm too *loud*  or lack the shame to not do something silly in public. My friends in  college seem to be less respecting of me bc of this. Especially my  partner (26M) who complained that I'm a bit too expressive and  emotional. He says its pretty annoying and now its making me feel really  conscious if I talk too much. Except I can't help it bc I don't like  the awkward silence between us.

So  what should I do? I'd really like to get back to when I was more  introverted and more observant rather than being the center of  attention. It would also be nice to be able to go out do activities by  my own rather than needing friends to keep it not boring!  
Sorry if I'm all over the place with this post! Like I said, I talk too much :p",02Feb2020,1
678,"So yesterday I was snap chatting a groupchat that has two girls from my school,then somehow Girl  B started play flirting. (Girl A has a boyfriend). So  gB sends me a one on one snap asking if “I’m single 😘 “and also calling me “sexy”. I thought she was joking so I sent a meme back but then she goes back to the groupchat and says she’s flirting with this guy and he sent a meme back  wtf do I even respond . To that and continued flirting I  asked  if she was joking or not she asked me if I wanted her to be joking. That caused a stalemate cause I asked her first I wanted her to answer first but I gave up. I gave in. I said “look I’m gonna say yes and nothing is gonna happen. Yes” and then nothing happened she was sending videos  of her chest and ass in the Nike booty shorts. But the guess what nothing happened I told her to “walk the walk”  but she apologized and  then we both went to sleep.

681,"So, I’m a 19 year old male and I don’t think it’s normal at my age to not have a group of friends that you do stuff with. It’s weird and I’m not a fan of being like this anymore.

When I talk to people initially, I get along fine with them, but then, for some reason, that relationship just ends. Even if I get along completely fine with that person it always has to be me who has to message them first, and I’m done with that, there’s just no effort to maintain that relationship from the other side.

I only ever got invited twice to a friend’s house. I know that this is not an important thing as such, but compared to others …it’s way less, and again it’s just very frustrating.

As of now, I have no idea on how to move forward and make some connections. I haven’t kept in contact with people who I went sixth form or secondary school with, because, as mentioned above it’s always me who had to message first and not them, which I got frustrated of doing, so I've stopped.

I’ve had my parents talk to me about this, and when they asked “why?”, I honestly couldn’t tell the way. I also told them that, in terms of a career I’m pretty lucky compared to others for my age, but I’m not lucky in relationships. For others, fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, it’s the complete opposite.

Everyone who I’ve talked to about this says that I should join a club, gym, etc, and that “I’ll meet some cool people”. When I do, this never happens, it always seems to happen to others which is frustrating.

I’m planning on changing what I do and going to university instead which I know will have a positive effect on my career, but also have a positive effect on this problem, as everyone says “friends for life are made from university”, or I could be completely wrong and that won’t happen knowing my luck

Also, I'll be purchasing my first car soon which should make me more mobile and do the things I want to do, when I want, and not having to rely on my parents to get me around. I assume that this will also help with the situation, but I don't know-how at this point.

I have no problem in talking to people when I have to, but approaching people “just like that”, seems a bit hard.",02Feb2020,1

He tries numerous times to hit her with a hockey stick, attempts to strangle our PE teacher, tries to start fights with her like 2 times in the space of 1 hour, and sneaks into the girls changing room where my PE class (including myself) is getting unchanged and back into our normal clothes, where he tries to harm her once more as well as try to steal her phone.

\-Throwaway account

\-English is not my first langauge

Some important context: My girlfriend of 3 years was trapped in a human traficking ring for over a decade. She was sold to someone who would beat her and the other girls mercilessly both for their punishment and for his own entertainment, tying them to things and beating them with objects, belts, and whatnot. I have my own demons as well, and we work together to heal eachother. It's been a slow process for both of us, but we're both much more stable than we were when we first met.

We visited a local club, and on the particular night they happened to be hosting some kind of kink event, which we didn't expect. Neither of us are really all that actively kinky, but we hung around because it looked fun. At one point in one of the back rooms, they had a thing where people would volunteer to get tied to the wall or props and get whipped/spanked or whatnot for a while, while other people would lounge around on surrounding couches and watch.

I was drinking at the bar while my girlfriend wandered off without me, and she found her way into that room at some point. I was alone for a while, at least half an hour, before a man came up to me and asked if I was with her. Apparantly she was having a panick attack and hallucinating from seeing the people tied up and being whipped.

I was able to ground her and get her away from that room, but she said she wanted to go back and keep watching. She wanted to get used to watching it because she wanted to do it with me. I watch a lot of that kind of porn, so she knows I'm into it. But I'm really not comfortable with doing something to her that could flair her PTSD.

She really wants to do this and I really want to help her learn to fight her trauma, but I'm scared it will just end up hurting her more. Any advice to how we could try getting into it with the least stress to her?",02Feb2020,1
684,"Hello all! For context, I (f18) have been dating my boyfriend (m17) for around 9mo now and well he's just the best. The sweetest guy alive and cute as can be, too. 
I don't have any income ever - no job or allowance - but I recently got first in an art competition and on top of that, just had Christmas and my 18th birthday, so I have quite a lot of money for a dependent teen right now who has no bills or expenses. 
I want to get him something that he'd like, not for any specific occasion really, just to make him happy. The problem is that I have no idea what to get him!
Here's what he likes:
- Magic the Gathering, which I've only played a few times and I know nothing about. He LOVES this game though, but I don't even know where to begin to get him something related to it. I know he's subbed to all the MTG subreddits too so I sure as heck can't ask there.
- Cats. He has a little girl that he adores, and I love her too.
- Game of Thrones, which again I know nothing about! :(
- Tulips, especially red ones. I don't really wanna get him flowers though because of his aforementioned baby. My cats have huge problems eating flowers if I  bring them home and getting sick.
- He loves video games, and I could look on his steam account to find out which ones but I know he likes Minecraft and Stardew Valley for sure.
- Star Wars, loves it and all the parodies.
As I'm making this list I feel like a pretty terrible girlfriend as I'm struggling to think of more things! For our 6mo anniversary I crocheted him a little mushroom, so me making something is also an option. Any suggestions are very much appreciated, thank you!",02Feb2020,1
685,"I hope this doesn't seem shallow

I'm a 14 year old boy and I've always been unhealthily shy but since my 13th birthday and a lot of anxiety therapy I've found expressing my thoughts less formidable. Since I'm in Australia the other teenagers here are friendly but that comes with a new set of problems that I feel like shouldn't be as big as they are in my life. I have absolutely no idea where I fit in a social group, I'm gay but I'm straight-passing and people have gone out of their way to be my friend too but I always somehow give them coldness and ruin any chance of a friendship forming because I'm too scared to express my real authentic self.  Like a super-duper-passionate-outgoing genie trapped in a lamp.

Being gay adds onto the friendship confusion because even though being gay is only a tiny sliver of my identity that bit of myself has deep roots that influence on some scale my likes and dislikes on nearly everything in my life, I feel like im all over the place, liking video game reviews and theories and corny romantic soap operas- (I know people can like both but it's a small example)

My mind is in this weird spot where I'm comfortable with who I am but uncomfortable when i dont curate my personality to accommodate to whoever im talking to which causes me to panic and hide more things which leads to more coldness and me looking like a distant sad clown

 I have no interest in being a social butterfly but that seems like my fate. I'm gonna hope there's at least one girl in school with dyed hair that has a Tumblr so i can have \*some\* basis to work with lol

Whenever she plays rap music in the car when I’m in the car she acts like I think it’s weird, like she’ll say stuff like “sorry that I play this crazy music”. She’s even told me before that when I talk I sound like a white person. She also always comments on the fact that I have predominantly white friends.

I sat down and played ps4 for a little bit. Changed pants from jeans into workout pants in the bedroom in front of the mirror. Then I went to the gym.

Most people here are minorities (Asian,Latino/Latina,or Black.) We have very few white people in it. Among the group though there are some mixed race white people and my boyfriend who is white. Last week we all met up and I noticed her treating my boyfriend differently. I tried talking to her but, (and now mind you it's not hard to tell when someone is fake) she didn't seem genuine and seemed very cold to me. She is Asian. I am also Asian. I figured having another girl to talk to in a mainly guys group would be nice but it felt like there was no connection even when I tried to empathize and relate with her because we both got objectified for our race. I believe she treated me more coldly vs other girls in the group by proxy because i am dating a white guy (racially. He's Brazillian.) We all introduced ourselves during the meetup and know each others handles but she kept referring to my bf as ""the white guy"" instead of his handle which is short,or his actual name. 

Yesterday they had another meetup and a white guy from our group showed up and left. After he left the group,she not only said ""I'm so glad there are no white guys here"" but she was also referring to the last meetup when she was with me and my boyfriend and other people. My friend also told me he noticed her being sort of fake to a group member of ours cause he is mixed and he looks white. Now is the advice part. 

Is there anything I can do or should I just leave this alone? Several members in the group have an issue with her ""all white men are bad"" before meeting them mentality. And I especially don't like that by proxy,because I'm dating someone white/Brazillian,she treats me coldly when she didn't get to know me. One of my friends doesn't want to start anything and is complacent with things despite not feeling comfortable with her and how she acts. She is fine with white women,she just has an issue with white men. My friend told me there's a good chance me and my bf won't get along with her especially now that she's going to more meetups.

699,"I've been friends with this person for about two years(ish). We first bonded over shared mental health issues, but they just never got better. I'm at the point that staying friends with this person is actually hurting my recovery, due to some issues they have with emotional dependency, clinginess, and some other stuff I won't get into. The point is, staying this close to them might be putting my own mental health at risk, and that's something that I absolutely will not allow. I went through too much on the way out of my own problems to let anything or anyone jeopardize it.

Here's the thing though: this person has no one but our shared friend group. They don't get along with their family (actually, they blame their family for a lot of their issues), and they have no other close friends. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I'm afraid that if we (myself and two friends, we form their close friend group) they might do something drastic. I really feel that this friendship is hurting me and putting some pretty extreme stress on all of us. 

Last night, I was trying to figure out what to say to break it off, and I almost resorted to alcohol. I don't drink. I'm about as straight and narrow as you can get when it comes to drugs/alcohol; I never touch the stuff, nor have I ever had the urge to beyond a couple of sips for food pairing purposes (and honestly, I still didn't like it much). I can only see it as a sign that this has gone too far. I feel like I have to cut this person off, or risk my own mental issues returning. At the same time, if they actually do something extreme, my friends and I will have to live with that for the rest of our lives.

701,"My sister currently lives with her boyfriend. They're both working full time jobs, but constantly claim to be 'poor' and 'have no money for groceries'. Thus, my sister decided to ask my dad to borrow his credit card for groceries - he has multiple cards, and gave her the one that he doesn't use.

My dad is old and not tech-savvy at all, so he doesn't check the activity of the card throughout the month, he'll only see what appears on the statement at the end. For the first two months of her having the card, she spent a normal amount on the card for groceries, only using it once per month. No big deal. She's been using Instacart, and he doesn't know what that is either. 

It wasn't until this month, that he came to me suspecting that someone stole his card. I went to check the statement and there were multiple transactions on Instacart that racked up to $800, all made by my sister. 

He did not authorize any of these transactions, and only gave her permission to use the card once. Is there anything he can do about it, or let the bank know to remove the charges? He already got the card cancelled.",02Feb2020,1

709,"I recently started going out to clubs and enjoying the nightlife and although I'm a nondrinker; I'm still able to have a lot of fun. My default personality is this really quiet, shy, awkward kid who's all in my head. I don't dare to take risks talking or dancing with new people even though I want to. This is who I've been for as long as I can remember. I hate it and I feel like I'm wasting my life with social anxiety. 


Almost always towards the end of the night, I become a completely different person. I get into a type of flow state where I'm extremely social I literally become the person I wish I always was. I'm able to speak my mind freely, I'm able to meet people easily and my personality really comes out. I'm no longer lost in my thoughts and uncomfortable. Does this happen to others? How do I make this my new default personality?

Now I don't think I lack social skills 'cause I'm really social around 2-3 good friends am able to hold conversations with anyone if they start it. Though I am quite serious around strangers.  

 **The worst thing about it is when I meet people during this state and say I plan to meet them again to hang out or a date etc. I go back this quiet, shy kid and I feel like I'm a fraud because I'm not the same person as they thought I was** 


**Background info:** 

- I probably do have some childhood trauma of being bullied then turning it around becoming a bully (I still beat myself over this). 

* When I lived at home I rarely talked to my family at all. My best relationship was with my younger brother and even then we aren't that close (jr of 7 years) with everyone else it felt like we were roommates. I was really an asshole to my siblings so maybe this is how I push myself away because I believe I'm a bad person?

- Around 11y/o I got into video games and really isolated myself from face to face contact. I wasn't really off but I would rather stay home and play video games than literally anything else. Into my college years, I made no new friends and would always rush home right after classes.
* I work a very isolated job which is also nightshift. The only social contact I make is greeting my coworkers in the mornings and when I sign out. I don't take lunch with everyone and usually just go for a walk. I've held part-time jobs when I was younger that involved people and I never had a problem with my social skills.

I met with the admissions office following after this and they gave me a choice to either wait until the Spring 2020 semester or start college late. As my mental health was poor and my family was struggling financially and transportation-wise, I chose to attend in the spring.

During the time from then until now, things have shifted. I am seeking employment, I have no car, and . I have applied to *many* jobs, however, I rarely get contacted back. It's almost time for the spring semester and I have been accepted to School A, a public research university, to attend. However, I have been looking at School B. It is closer to where I live.

713,"DISCLAIMER: I've never been in a relationship so I'm not sure how to be there for her and if she's taking the situation a bit too far or if I'm just being naive and insensitive. 
Also her boyfriend isn't a terrible person, but he has a lying problem and can be kinda insensitive towards her.

So I have this friend who recently broke up with her mans, they're both 23 and 24 and they had been dating for about 7 years. Since I met her 2 years ago she would do absolutely nothing but complain about her boyfriend, but said she could never leave him. She'd always send me videos on girls talking about their failing relationships and how they should be treated better, or quotes about self care and leaving toxic people (in reference to her bf). We were both in college, he paid off her tuition, bought her an expensive laptop, was paying her rent, paying for her dogs insurance, etc. (I think she found it so difficult to leave him because of his money, without his financial support she would have really been struggling). So conveniently, after she graduated and got a job, she broke up with him shortly after (he's still paying half her rent in an expensive apartment in a nice city because that's what they agreed on when she first moved there). 

Now that they've split she won't. Stop. Talking about him! Now she sends me those same videos, exept now they're all about break ups. She talks about wanting him back but knows she shouldn't because he doesn't treat her right and lies all the time. She still texts him and they've hooked up a couple times. And she gets upset knowing he's probably talking to other girls. She mentions a lot of ""what ifs"" had they broken up when she was in college or even high school (WHICH SHE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE) and how she could already be in her ""hoe phase"" had she left him sooner. She talks about this guy at work she wishes would talk to her, etc. And she basically confessed that she's only still talking to her now ex boyfriend because she doesn't have someone else to distract her.

Now this really upset me because it seems she's constantly complaining and not wanting him but wanting him, and for the wrong reasons.

I have been supportive through it all, but I'm getting to the point where I don't know what to say anymore because it's like listening to a broken record. And if I get sent another video of a girl talking about her past relationship and how she deserves to care for herself or something I'm going to explode.

718,"Hi,

Please no judgment or boring ""don't shit where you eat"" type of answers.

I'm a woman. I'm 24 and my boss is 36, ultra feminine and extremely attractive. She's so attractive lots of people in our office can't even talk to her properly. She knows it and uses this to her advantage.

I don't know her exact sexual preferences. She's married to a man (they've been together since she was 22). I should also mention he's 15 years older than her. I highly suspect their marriage is open.

She's a naturally flirty type and smiles and winks at almost everybody.. I've also noticed she sometimes lightly touches people's arm or knee when talking to them. She also sometimes blow kisses at people (only women as far as I'm aware). She's SUCH a people pleaser and the way she manages her employees is by being super friendly to them.

**About a year and a half ago she used to heavily flirt with me**, I don't know if I was the only one she did this stuff to but it was so much more than just friendly behavior. She did things like:

\- twirl my hair at meetings  
\- fix my shirt collar  
\- pick lint off my shirt where my breasts are  
\- tell me she was thinking of me when X  
\- sometimes act awkward around me  
\- once she pulled my t-shirt down (for no apparent reason), almost touching my crotch  
\- at a one on one meeting she told me my bra looked ""amazing"" when it wasn't even visible  
\- almost put a poker chip down my shirt. She was gonna do it but stopped herself. I asked her ""were  
you gonna put it down my shirt?"", she was embarrassed and replied ""yeah, as a joke""  
\- she once locked eyes with me for a couple of seconds, smiling, until I looked away. It was intense  
\- she once exclaimed when I entered her office something like ""how pretty you are!""  
\- talked to me in the bathroom about how similar our physique is   
\- she told me she would have preferred ""swinging"" to something she had to do that night  
\- some people at my office were (god knows why) talking about sexual harassment and she completely out of the blue said something to the effect of ""women can sexually harass other women too"", and proceeded to look at me and smile (I was in no way part of the conversation and was at a different part of the room)

At the time (and even now) I didn't know what to make of it -- why she was doing it and what she was trying to achieve, if anything. She eventually stopped this behavior due to work-related issues. BUTTTT

**She has recently started acting this way again**. Yesterday at a one on one meeting she told me, out of context, that her husband said ""something really sweet"" the day before: (her words) ""It's special that we still (pause),"" I asked her ""what?"" and she proceeded to say ""love each other and (pause) are attracted to each other"". Which I suppose she meant to say their sex is good??? During the same meeting she said jokingly that I was hot.

My question/problem is **I'm really attracted to her and have no idea what she's after** and how to go about taking this to the next level. As far as she knows, I'm straight (I'm really bi-curious). If she's interested, and that's a pretty big if (as people flirt for lots of reasons), I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. I don't want to pursue anything romantic but I'd be over the moon if we spent a night together. I would also love to have a threesome with her husband if that's what she's really after... How do I make that happen? Flirting back doesn't cut it.

Thank you so much in advance!

PS: I should also mention that in spite of all these signals she's never texted me after work or asked to go out for a drink or anything. She's never done anything that could for sure indicate she wanted to pursue things further.

**Tl;dr** I'm attracted to my boss who I suspect is also attracted to me (judge for yourself). I have no idea how to initiate anything if she *is* interested in me.",02Feb2020,1

722,"I’m an artist/designer. I went to school for design and towards the end of school, I got really burnt out. I’ve slowly just put all my focus towards my art and I’ve kinda neglected design but I’m trying to get back to it and trying balance doing both. I love both worlds of art and design, but I’ve recently found myself comparing my projects/skill to other creatives I follow on social media. I just feel so mediocre compared to them. Each time I see a project from them I think “well what’s the point in me working on this project when THIS exists”. I know I should cut my time on social media and put that time towards my projects, but my drive to create is low and I also need social media to spread my work and get my name out there. I’ve been putting more effort towards my art and when I get burnt out there, I get so sad and frustrated and end up days and days without creating. Seeing other creatives have so much success and at such a young age makes me feel like I’m in a race to success and I’m only 20. I’ve done prints of my art and it got such a positive response, but I’m a perfectionist who gets hung up on “is the coloring right? Is this too blurry? Is it clear enough? Are people going to be happy when they see their print?” and being this perfectionist has taken up so much of my time and also my money trying to make things “perfect”. I’ve gotten a lot of support and a lot of people seem to enjoy my art, but for some reason I still feel like I’m not good enough?

725,"A few months ago I was doing a school project and had to find pictures of me when I was younger.  I asked my dad where I could find old pictures and he shared a google photos album with me.  The album uploads every picture taken from my mom and dad's phone (including screenshots).  I go on the google photos and start looking for pictures of me, but instead I find screenshots of texts between my mom and my neighbor.  They were texting about things that made it seem like they were having an affair, but there was no real evidence that could conclude they were actually doing anything.

Then, last night (around three months later) I went back on the google photos because I wanted to find a picture from a vacation.  Before I started scrolling down I saw a screenshot from a few weeks ago that was of messages between my mom and the neighbor.  They were talking about s\*x in their messages so at this point I knew something was going on.  Then I get curious so I start looking for more messages to try and get an idea of how long this was going on.  The first message I could find was from March of 2019.

I am not sure what to do and I haven't said anything because I don't want to mess anything up, but my dad doesn't deserve this and neither does my neighbors wife.  Also the neighbors have kids that are younger (elementary school) and I don't want to ruin their childhood or anything.  I have an older sister and I haven't told her and I don't think she knows, but I'm not going to tell her because I think she might tell my mom or dad.

You might wonder why my mom would screenshot those pictures, and I have no idea.  Another thing is I don't think my dad checks the google photos, which is why he doesn't know about it (or is why I think he doesn't know about it).

My dad has a job and provides the money for our family.  My mom is a stay at home mom that does not work.  The neighbor that my mom is having an affair with has a job, but his wife is a stay at home mom.  The wife is very nice and also does not deserve this. I babysit their kids and they are so sweet and innocent.

729,"I keep seeing women come out against men who have sexually assaulted them years ago, finally getting long awaited justice against these shitty people. I'm finally in a good place mentally but it still hurts me knowing this guy is still free after what he did to me. Here is, in essence, what happened almost two years ago, (it will be exactly two years on March 10th.) It may be triggering for some people even though I won't go into graphic detail, I don't think I can handle doing that.

I was in an uber on my way to meet up with a coworker. I had assumed we were going to be meeting up with some of my other coworkers at a bar or something, but it ended up just being us. He asked me on the phone to have the uber meet him at a gas station instead of at his house, which I find sketchy now, as it seems it was premeditated and he didn't want the Uber driver to know where he lived for this reason. From there I got in his car with him, again, I knew this guy from work, I was young and naive and assumed I could trust him as we worked in a very high scale place that did extensive background checks on their employees. He went to someones house to get drugs, and I started feeling uneasy. We went to his place and just stayed in the car. I had one drink, he kept forcing me to drink more when I didn't want to, literally forcing the bottle into my mouth. He made a move on me, I pushed him away, pretty sure I slapped his face. He hit back, punched me in the face, and I blacked out.

When I awoke, he was sexually assaulting me. I forced him away from me and got out of the car. I was screaming, kicking, fighting, nobody was around to help. It was 3am in a bad neighborhood and I knew I would die if I didn't get the hell out of that car and back home as soon as possible. I fell out of the car, scratching my face on the pavement as I struggled to get up, he took off. My phone was on 7% battery, I called for an uber as soon as I could, and while the uber got me home safe, the jackass driving tried making a move on me, salt in the wound honestly.

As soon as I woke up, I called my dad, he lived an hour away and I was house-sitting for my grandpa, so I was alone until he arrived. We called the police, I gave them all his information, where he worked, his schedule, where he lived, but they were more interested in the drugs he purchased than giving me a rape kit or looking extensively into my claim that he had sexually assaulted me. They didn't take me seriously, even though I was bruised, scratched, probably still had his DNA on me too.

A month later, the bastard called me, as kind of like a ""Ha Ha, I hurt you and nothing happened to me, I'm free and you can't do shit about it."" I panicked, I accused him of assaulting me. He went silent. I told everyone I used to work with (I had since quit the job) what he did to me. They didn't take me seriously. He continued to work there, while I was now out of work.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, I am now in a much better place mentally and emotionally. I find great therapy in my art, which has only flourished, and I have a great career ahead of me. I am a happy person. But if at all possible, I want help in finally bringing the bastard to justice, if I can.

730,"Everyone in my family, except my dad, is very religious. I am not, and never was, at all. I was just being forced to go to church etc. I (F19) was being sexually abused by my older, by three years, cousin, between the ages of 11 to 14. I didn't realize it was abuse until one day it hit me super hard, that what was going on was bad. I thought I was equally gulty as him. I told him that if what's happening between us is not going to stop I'm going to tell my parents. He peacefully agreed and that's it.

Although, my mental health continued to be in a bad state for 3 whole months. With a unclear mind of what had happend, I thought my responsibillity was huge. One day I couldn't take it anymore, and without thinking about it, in a split second I told my grandma what had happend. It was the most rational decision of my life. I have to mention that at the period I tried to ""believe"" in God because it gave me hope that things where going to be better.

My grandma obviously was devastated, was incredibly angry at my cousin, not mad at me. I immidiately felt better talking to her. She asked me if anyone else knows, she asked me if we were like a couple, I was upset and told her no! , not even close. She (also extremely religious) stated that I had sinned but it's okay and that God forgave me. She told me that we have to tell my mom in order for her to protect me. I agreed in the beggining but then I declined and she respected that. She supported me and showed me love.

Everything was fine for the next couple of months, school started and I was feeling a lot better. But of course my ""faith"" for God didn't last, since I never really believed in it, it just gave me confort for a bit.After this, the situation was never really mentioned again between us. Like actual talking. I also have never mentioned that to anyone else. She is the only one that knows.

After a couple of months I started getting paranoid that my grandma is going to tell my mom and my dad. This never happend. I was also quite mad at her for the ""You had sinned but God forgave you"" part. At some point I felt like me telling her was by far the worst decision of my life. I tried avoiding her for a couple of years. But now I don't really mind that she knows. I obviously get stressed when she has to be around my cousin/his brother/his dad. But I feel relief someone knows.

But the thing is, after I told her, my mind went through memories of the abuse and I indeed realised how:

\- I would always tell my cousin that we have to stop this. He would agree, treat me as a friend for a while and then here he goes again.  
\- There were incidents where he would actually force me to do things. Not just making me think that it was normal. Like, blocking my way out of a room in order for him to get what he wants, me trying to leave and him grabbing my hand so i can't, treating me as an object.  
\- Everytime, I would express my concerns the fact that we are related. And for years he made me actually believe that everyone does that. Like I actually thought it was that way and when I didn't, he made his best to convince me.

It was not my fault. It was abuse.

And that's where things changed my prospective. I realized that I was the one that approached the issue in a wrong way when talking to my grandma, because I hadn't realize the things I listed, at that point. I guess I mentioned it as it was something that I somehow wanted. So could I really be mad at her? No. I guess I can't. At 14 there was this big fog in my mind and in this period of 5 years, now I can see clearly how things were.

After this realisation, I felt like I needed to make things clear, for a long time, but I never really had the courage to go talk to her. But now shit is different.

In general I was fine. I didn't think much about it, things started getting better in my life, at 16 I stood up for myself to my mom and stopped doing anything religious, made my position clear. It took my grandma a while to accept that I was not religious anymore, but 3 years after she is okay with it. If I was ever to get sad about the abuse, it wouldn't last long, because I was happy with my life in general.

Now, I live in a different country to study, mental health not great, feeling pretty lonely and since November my mind got fucked again. I started thinking about the abuse 24/7. December was a bit better because I was home for Christmas but now I'm still in a bad state but I can control it somehow.

But I need support. And the only person in the earth I can talk to is my grandma. And I really want to. I want to feel like I'm not alone and that life goes on. I need her love and I know she loves me to death and I do too. I know she is not mad at be. I believe that at the end of the day she realises that it was abuse, but I feel like I need to tell her. I don't want to get into details and make her even more upset. Just mention some facts.

On the other side, I don't want to feel like I used to at some point. To feel like it was a mistake in a desperate moment in the need of support. And I don't wanna feel akward afterwards. Obviously talking with my grandma about this is not very comfortable for me. But I can't shake my mind of it. And I know talking to someone will make feel much better. Plus making things clear.

&amp;#x200B;

I have in mind to approaching her one day by saying; ""Hey, I'm not doing well. Can we talk, but please keep the religion outside of this conversation?"" I know that she will somehow mention it still. But maybe she'll respect it. 

What should I do? Talk to her or not? And if so, do you have any suggestions into approaching this?",02Feb2020,1

trigger warning, suicide attempt
hey. i’m 19, nonbinary and my partner is 18, non-binary. we’ve been together for almost 9 months, and they attempted suicide last monday. we had had a lovely evening and morning, and after i left for class, they took all their psych meds, drank alcohol, and landed themselves in the ICU. they haven’t been truly conscious since.  this has been a huge deal, they had seizures, heart issues, aspiration pneumonia... just to list a couple complications. my dad flew up to visit me, and he and his friend who i am close to are both encouraging me to break up with them, regardless of how this situation plays out. i will admit, there are very few resolutions to this that are positive. but they’re the first person i’ve ever been in love with, and i don’t know what to do. i never want to break up with them. if they wake up, feel remorse, and then actually decide to make a change in their life, then i want to stay with them. and i feel like it is very important for me to be a part of their recovery, because i was the closest person emotionally to them before this happened. anyways, i would really appreciate some advice from random strangers on the internet who don’t know me. thanks.",02Feb2020,1

after she said she might want me to come with her to prom this year. I’ve also been thinking about that nonstop.

I’m worried about two things. Firstly I’ve been wanting an emotional connection with someone. But I feel that my mind is thinking since I know her, she should be the best fit for my desire. 
Secondly I will only get to really hang out with her once the semester is over in summer because I’m far from home. But after summer she will be leaving for a college 10x further away than I already am.

I don’t doubt my want for a connection that’s deeper than a friendship with someone. But I think my mind is choosing her because that’s who I know.
I know that people change a ton in college and I fear that if we did start dating we would just have a summer fling and then fade away. But I also don’t want to miss out on an opportunity with someone like her, I already missed so many in highschool by joining activities too late.

I'm 24, female, based out of Bombay, India. I work with a tech firm in a good role. I earn well (went to a top school) and have a decent standard of living. 

Here goes the story:
I wake up at 9am, go to work and reach home by 7:30pm. I come back, roll a joint (most weekdays), have dinner, watch something on Netflix, talk to bf and go to bed. Everyday. Each month. 

On the weekends, I wake up by 1pm, do my chores, laze around, smoke some more weed, talk to a few friends and family on call - and it's Monday again. I don't even get out of my apartment some weekends. And I'm not too sad about it as well, weirdly. 

I've done well for myself professionally. However, I think I'm not really growing in other spaces of life. For e.g. I'm not making any new friends, not exercising, not trying to learn a new hobby. Surprisingly, I'm questioning myself as to why I'm okay with this way of living - how am I content even though I'm not really growing? 

I want some inspiration to change the way I live. 

What do you guys do on the weekends and post work? Do you think I'm smoking too much weed? Any suggestions are welcome.

I am talking mainly about hobbies, activities and things that we like at some point in life. For instance, I used to be crazy about a band (and no, i'm not a teenager anymore). I listened to this band for 2 years. I would collect everything I could find - interviews, bootlegs, live performances, unreleased footage, etc. It got me through some of the most difficult moments of my life, that's why this band meant so much to me (i would have killed myself if it weren't for this band) and why I'm so attached to them. But for the past month or so, I've noticed I no longer enjoy their music. I tried listening to it compulsively but I don't feel anything anymore. It's like dragging around a dead horse. I feel very sad about it, it feels like losing a quintessential part of myself. It feels as if I lost who I was, mainly because this band was a huge part of my identity.

Recently, another girl opened up to him about her feelings and he rejected her openly. He doesn't even contact her or talks to her nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

My younger sister and her husband have been living in AZ for the last maybe 4-5 years? Prior to their move everyone in our family had been living in IN.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and dad moved out to AZ to be closer to them in December of 2019 (not that long ago.) My dad was not in great shape before the move and I didn't really think it was a smart idea but my mom insisted so I let her do her own thing. Who am I to try and control her? They moved to AZ.

&amp;#x200B;

In January of this year, my dad's health crashed badly and he ended up in the hospital. He was sedated and on a ventilator? breathing machine thingy? for I think 6 days. He's awake now and on a bi-pap thing? to help with his breathing in 4 hour cycles. He hates it and is going crazy in the hospital. He has good and bad days. Sometimes he hallucinates things and tries to rip his equipment off. Other times he's ""fine"" and ""normal.""

&amp;#x200B;

I did not immediately fly out to AZ when this happened because 1.) he was sedated and would not have even known I was there 2.) I didn't want to be ""in the way"" while my mom and sis were trying to handle everything 3.) no one really knew what the future would look like (i.e. ""he'll get better soon and then you can visit once things calm down."")

&amp;#x200B;

Mom and sis called last night and basically said ""He's not going to be getting any better so you should think about coming out if you want to see him while he's still himself."" The thing is, they want to turn this into a ""mini vacation"" for me and take me to their favorite restaurants and all this touristy shit that I give 0 fucks about. My dad is dying and seeing him in person will 100% solidify that for me and it will be all I will be able to think about. I will be a huge ball of stress and nerves the entire time and I am almost disgusted that they want to show me the zoo or some stupid taco truck while my dad lies dying in a hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

They want me to come for at least 7 days. I don't feel comfortable with that long of a trip because I know that I will be emotionally dead the entire time and it will be miserable for me. Not to mention everything that comforts me will be left behind in IN while I am out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I do want to go for some amount of time because I think my dad will be happy to see me. We have done a few video calls since he has stabilized and he seemed happy to talk to me. I want to give him whatever I can by being there. I won't gain anything from the trip but he might and that makes it worth it. As horrible as it sounds, when I hugged him goodbye before they moved to AZ, I kind of made peace with the idea that I wouldn't see him again until he was dying.

I didn’t make much money since I left alittle after I filed my 2019 taxes last year(I left around January 10) but I  still wanted todo things the right way by filing for all my w2’s .i could easily go and ask but I feel like ,if they didn’t send me my w2 it must be because they are aware of what they’re tying todo and like I said i wasn’t getting paid on time the last few weeks working there so I’m not so excited togo talk with them .so my question is should I go ahead and file for the w2 that I do have from my current employer  or should I wait till the end of February first ?(also I herd that it takes a while for the IRS to send out notifications to employers who don’t send out w2’s on time so I kinda wanted to file taxes for the w2 I have now as soon as I can so I don’t file them late . ) .theres more to this story if you have any questions let me know and I’ll respond as soon as I can .thanks In advanced !",02Feb2020,1

776,"I’ve (17 F) been trying to make changes for the environment, for almost 2 years. Like unplugging cables when we’re not using them. Turning off the lights when there’s no one in the room. Recycling. And I want to do more, like walk to school (which is really close to my house) instead of using the car. And using reusable bags.
However, I can only do so much, because my mom (51 F) says it’s a waste of time. My argument is that I want to see the future generations alive and well. But whenever I unplug the cables, or turn off the lights, my mom plugs the cables again, and turns on the lights when no one’s even using them.
This topic was brought up at family therapy: both my mom and therapist (40 F) ganged up on me, telling me that’s just my anxiety, and that I’ll get over it soon.

I, admittedly acted rather petulantly, and stated that I wouldn’t be driving until I got what I wanted, even offering to pay for the motorcycle license test but my mom wouldn’t take.

So I have to do a year long internship (sigh) and anyway I’ve been interviewed at places. Technically, the deadline I have to find a place is July but places fill up sooner.

Honestly this process makes me sick. I just want to secure a place that meets the requirements. I feel like if I don’t secure my safe offer... I would be risking it for the two interviews in March. I may end up not even liking the places I would interview in March for.

792,"Hi

(sorry this is very scrambled and hard to read, i didn't know how to start)

TL;DR : I don't know what to say to people, I don't desire to tell them about me at all, my responses little by little make them think I don't give a shit about what they tell me, I love to listen though, most times, I now feel disconnected

Yesterday at a party, I talked for some time back and forth with a girl, a friend of the sister's host, I noticed we were looking at each other and just connecting on the basis that we both didn't know anyone else there (I had the basic guy analysis of if she was attractive or not, but I really couldn't care less actually because I knew those were pointless pursuits, i just wanted to get drunk with good friends and blow off some steam -- so tl:dr it's not about flirting or how to get girls), at some point she began listing me movies she liked, books, artists, and they were all things/people I didn't know, so I was genuinely interested, so I was noting them down asking about these, and at the end of her telling me something, we would just kinda smile, and sort of nod, blank silence for 3 seconds, and she would go on.

At no point did I have any urge, need or idea of what to say. I only get awkward about the end of sentence silences because they discomfort the other person and I suddenly feel at fault for not being able to carry the talk (or thereby small talk, all depends).

At no point do I have the desire to tell about myself. I initially thought it was because I thought my life was boring, but through thinking about that, I considered that objectively it was not, sometimes people were pretty entertained. I just have an utter laziness to say so. Actually, it seems like I have an utter laziness to talk to people altogether. When people make remarks, I just half-forcingly do an inventive alert reaction, like : Oh damn really ? (when some says : oh did u know they removed the bus line 131?). Sometimes I just plainly do not answer, but genuinely listen. Then, people, either say : Is any of this boring you? You must be annoyed by my nonsense rambling ! -- I say no, I just like to listen..

My alltime systemic response to people's remarks and phrases is : Mhmh. Like a damn lot, I feel ok responding like that (I don't think about it that much). I think it is when people start to think i'm disinterested

But then there are two issues : 1) I can (or i believe so) never genuinely have a real connection with people, it takes an insane amount of time, people don't know about me, and I just know a lot about them and what they do/go through

2) Even though I am not normally mortified by being around people, quite the contrary, I enjoy people's company -- Now I just am like : I'm gonna come off as someone cocky, boring or just awkward

so yeah i'm stressed

I suppose this is very typical, but I cannot wrap my head around where to start as to how to untangle myself from this issue.

I see a therapist, for other reasons than that initially, I don't feel like I could tell him that, I believe it is not a real issue. This kind of thing happens ALL the time.",02Feb2020,1

800,"I have a 6 year old male dog, and a 9 year old  male cat.
On the 2nd of March 2016 we got the most important thing to me. She was the perfect dog and meant so much to me. She was my reason I didn't commit suicide for a long time. 

Her and the older dog began fighting a lot out of nowhere about 8 months ago or a little less. We went to dog training and had a professional come in to try help us out. Back in November we ended ip having to rehome her as it got to the point that they were going to keep fighting and we had them both on leads at all times and kept them away from each other. It was making us sick and just felt ill because of it.

Since she has been rehomed, it's been awful for me. We know she went to a good home and is being looked after, in a town 5 hours away from us. But I've been struggling. I try stay away from home as much as possible, picked up more shifts and spent more nights at my boyfriends. My house doesn't feel like home anymore. I lay in bed and look at the spot she would lay on at night and it just hurts.

Since all of this, I've lost interest in my other 2 pets. The cat is okay. The dog is just kinda there. He annoys me at everything he does. I don't want him near me or in my room, I don't want to walk him at all, I don't want anything to do with him basically. I just don't care about them anymore. I have friends talk about their pets and I just couldn't care less. I don't like other people's pets and feel a weird kinda hate towards them.

I should add that my house has my father, mother and older brother who look after the pets a lot so it's not like they're being neglected, it's just me that ignores them and has nothing to do with them.

Basically how do I get over this? I don't like the feeling of just apathy towards my pets or other people's. I like looking at pictures and videos of animals and puppies and kittens still, and i feel a little better at that. But I look at my dog and just feel hurt or sorta anger, maybe because he was always my family's favourite and I believe its his fault it all started and that I lost her.",02Feb2020,1

She says we see each other in school. Which we do for a few classes where she always sits next to me and always walk with her to class, to her car, etc. 

But she says she’s working a lot more recently in door dash. She comes back at 5-6pm. So when we don’t have school I miss her if I don’t work or even when I come back I want to see her. I ask her and she says she’s hanging out with her mom or she has to cook. 

I really don’t care what we do as in just chill and watch shows or talk I just want to be with her. 

She lives 40 min away from me. Her mother is lonely at times because she lives alone so the girl hangs out with her sometimes. 

I see her 3 times a week with school most of the time now. Before school I would spend one day a week with her. 
But I mean school we have to be there so I don’t count that as hanging out really it’s just she’s closest to me so she’s gonna talk to me. 

If I tell her I miss her she says she misses me too but doesn’t do anything to change that. Sometimes she’ll ask me if I’m free then say she was going to work but she decided to spend time with me.

805,"Let’s call her Britt. 

Britt has struggled with mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, and is open about it. She’s gone through a tough break up because she was toxic in her relationship. How she was toxic to her partner is now she is in general, and I need advice on how to properly maneuver and respond. 

She goes back and forth from manic to depressive states. When manic, she openly admits she is hot s**t and can be very insulting towards others. When depressed, it’s a total pity party. In both states, she expects you to be available at all times and to drive over an hour to her if she needs you to. You cannot get mad at her for anything, because then she said it’s her mental health to blame and that we are the jerks for not realizing it.  This happens all the time. I teeter between feeling genuinely bad for her and hating her for making us always feel like a jerk. 

So today she flaked on a get together a group of all our friends were having that I organized. I cracked slightly, i pointed out her excuse (1+ plus drive from her place to mine) as false as it tastes 40 minutes maximum with weather and traffic. She went off, blamed her mental health, and texted a bunch of people how terrible I am not not considering it. 

How do I more properly maneuver this relationship? I want to help, but her constant excuse of mental health (which, mental health is a valid excuse and a real thing, but I hate how it’s always her excuse for anything at all ever) is now taking a toll on my own.",02Feb2020,1

807,"So I’m kinda caught up in this weird situation. I’m second year college student and I’ve been hanging with the same people since I met them begging of freshman year. In this group I’ve always been the one to be clowned and put down. I’m always the one taking the butt end of jokes and usually I just laugh along because these are my boys right they don’t really mean it. But recently they’ve been getting bored I guess and their jokes have getting harsher and harsher to the point where my self confidence is shot and every night when I go home I wonder why am I still friends with these people. A big problem with this is I don’t have any other friends except the ones in my group. I’m almost a third year student who wants to just start to get to know me.

With it being the beginning of the spring semester fraternities have been trying to recruit people. The group that I call friends is the type to always make fun of brothers of frats and generally show them no respect. Well I was approached by one and decided I might as well see what’s up with it. I go out to the bars with them instead of my “friends” and what happens? I’m not being put down at every instance possible I’m being hyped up and the brother actually feel like they want me there. I understand that it is rush week for these frats of course they are gonna hype you and their frat up so you join. But to be honest I had more fun with these people I just met than I have in a long time going out with these people I’ve been rocking with since last year.

All of my friends have now started making the joke that I’m seriously considering this frat because 1) they are an Asian fraternity (and I’m not Asian) 2) I’m about to pay dues each semester for friends and girls
But they don’t understand I feel like I need this push I need something to help me grow rather than them just tolerating me and keeping me with them for jokes.

I really don’t know what I should do because I’ve been with these people since the beginning of last year. These were the first people to vibe with me until they realized I’m an easy target because I’m too lacking in confidence to try and defend myself from their constant berates. But is joining a frat really going to help or did I just get a taste of positive energy in friends and now they have me sold.

812,"My life has been really shit the past few months. 

Non stop conflict at home between me, my mom and my stepdad. Constantly being judged, feeling like I’m walking on eggshells around my parents. Both my parents are both physically and emotionally abusive, and have been for years. 

Last year I had exams coming up, but then I went to the hospital with a really bad case of both the flu and pneumonia.  I nearly died and had to be put in an induced coma. The flashbacks aren’t as bad as they used to be, but they are still there. 

Not even three weeks after this, I had exams. The stress just about broke me. On top of that, I had to talk two friends out of killing themselves during this time (One IRL friend, and one online friend), I empathized with them a lot, and felt all of their problems on top of my own. 

At this point I felt completely emotionally exhausted. I tried to retreat from reality by getting into an RP sub on reddit, and that helped me cope with my life for a while. But then two of one of my characters closest friends died. And then, my other characters love interest had to die because the writer of that characters girlfriend was jealous of the characters relationship or some shit. I know it seems laughably insignificant, but I really identified with both of my characters, and their friendships and romantic relationships were so wholesome that they gave me a little hope for my own life. Now they are over, it makes me feel depressed and physically ill whenever I think about it. 


Literally today, there was another huge fight with my parents. It started out as a friendly debate, but it got way out of hand. It ended with my stepdad kicking me and my mum out of the house, and even physically taking a swing at me (Though he thankfully missed)

I had to time to just rethink certain friendships and relationships and realised this one was pretty toxic and considered telling them this and that we should just distance ourselves for a bit. We then fell out again leading to me telling them all of this not intending an argument at all but it obviously did. Before this they’re brought tickets for a gig for us and others and I’d payed them back for it. She’d made it clear that other people they knew wanted to go so when telling them how I felt I asked for money back because of this. I was told I can ‘fuck my money’ cos I didn’t want to talk anymore and that I ‘went back on my word’ .I just didn’t want to feel awkward because we wasn’t friends. In the end I just said they can give me the money or the tickets so I could sell them. I just kinda feel like it’s not very fair because I know they could find someone else who wants them and by the time I get them I may not be able to sell them. 

I know me saying I don’t want to go could be an inconvenience but I just wanted it to be over civilly and not have any petty shit happen. It’s been a while and still nothing idk what to do. Am I a dickhead for changing my mind and wanting the money back?",02Feb2020,1
814,"So this situation just happened and I'm typing on mobile so forgive me. Also it will be quite long because you need alot of backstory to understand why I reacted how I did. 

As a forewarning there are some mentions of sexual assault so if that triggers you please do not read. 

To begin I'll just say in the most brief way I can the things that have happened to me. (Nothing super  specific or graphic just so you have an idea, it's already tough enough for me to type this) 

I'm not sure when it started but my older male cousin would molest me whenever we were at my grandparents house unsupervised. They used to live around the corner and when they moved he still continued to molest me at family gatherings.  That happened for many years and then he attempted to rape me one summer (my grandpa broke down the door to stop him) when I was 12 or 13. 

The most tragic part of my story is that my grandma never told my mom about it so I did not receive therapy for it until high school when we figured out my grandma never told anyone. (She also didn't take me to a doctor or anything like that. She just examined me and told me to take a shower. I heard her on the phone with my mom so I thought she told her and I surely didn't want to talk about it so I never brought it up with my parents.) 

So after I told my parents, I've been doing therapy pretty regularly for that trauma specifically but also for the depression and anxiety I developed after the rape. 

It's also important to note that after everything that happened I really don't enjoy people touching me without my permission to. People getting really close to me without saying why or doing so suddenly gives me extreme anxiety and panics me when it happens. 

Me and my therapist worked on this on our sessions. She gave me like four different exercises to cycle through when I am anxious or paranoid so I don't become manic. Three of them require a quite space with no distractions (this will be important kinda important later) 

A caveat: 
My parents got divorced when I was like seven. My mother told me to never tell my dad about the rape or that I would have to live with him. Being an impressionable preteen that did not really enjoy the mandatory visits with my dad, it terrified me so I never told him until probably a year or two ago. (I'm 25 F for time context) 

Now that you have a general idea of what happened to me before we can get into what happened today. 

I'm sitting on the couch on my phone when I suddenly feel hands around my neck. 

I immediately start panicking because I was caught off guard but my Dad is still ""playing around"" yelling loudly and shaking me.

 What also doesn't help is that loud noises startle me so much I wear earplugs around the house sometimes because he always yells suddenly and without warning, not that he's angry or abusive he's just a loud person.

I've also told him before that I don't like it when he touches me without my permission, on multiple occasions. Usually I say something like Please don't touch me or I don't want to be touched right now and he always acts offended after I say it. 

So I loudly yell for him to stop and say that that is not okay and I run up to my room because I knew I needed to go do the exercises because I was starting to have a flashback (for those of you who've never experienced this it's quite terrifying because you're in two places but all you can see is the flashback) 

So I'm in my room doing the first round of exercises when he knocks on my door. I can't create an exact dialogue but in general he said that he didn't put his hands around my neck, that I was rude to him as my father, and I over reacted. 

I said you can't police how I react to something and he replied I didn't put my hands around your neck.

At that point I was getting very emotional and I knew I wasn't going to be able to articulate myself so I left the house. 

Now I'm not sure what to do, I feel like I shouldn't have to give the gory details of my assault just so he won't touch me but he is not understanding me at all. 

TLDR: I was molested and raped as a child so I like my personal space and to know who is touching me. My father scared me when he came behind me put his hands around my neck and started yelling loudly. (I will say allegedly because he said his hands weren't around my neck but that's how it felt) This made me have a flashback to my assault and I left to do coping exercises. Now my dad is saying I was rude to him, he didn't put his hands around my neck, and that I over reacted.",02Feb2020,1
815,"For as long as I remember, I've never stayed up or worked hard for any kind of project and now that I'm in high school it's starting to have an extremely destructive impact on my life. I was twice evaluated to have an IQ of 149 and never had to try in school until recently when papers and lab reports were the main factors deciding my GPA. I've developed a strong sense of self-loathing for myself even with so much hatred and regret, cannot bring myself to doing work. My chasing for small hits of dopamine from playing computer games and receiving acceptance from strangers online has driven me to a point of no return as I see it. I find myself staying up until 2:00-3:00am every night watching youtube or wasting my life on shitty mobile games, both of which do nothing to benefit me in any way. 

Even now I'm writing paragraphs about my troubles instead of working on the five-page paper tomorrow. I was accepted to an elite school merely because my intelligence testing scores caused them to see passed my average grades and now I feel trapped in an environment that demands far more than I've ever been capable of. 

I'm dumping all of my thoughts out on this post right now so I don't know if any of this will make sense, but all I know is **I need help now**.",02Feb2020,1

And it demotivates me from whatever I was about to do.

I don't really know what to do. I try to distract myself but I don't think that this is a permanent solution. And to be fully honest I get tied of the distraction. Games, Movies, and what not.

817,"when I was around 12-13 my stepfather sexually assaulted me for the first time. I told my mom and reported it to the police. I had multiple interviews and by the end of it they straight up told me they didn’t believe me and I had no proof. they also brought up that I can be charged if I lied. my mom and him broke up but she was miserable and took some of it out on me. not long after they got back together. I’m 19 now and since then I have struggled immensely with it. I’ve moved out multiple times throughout the years but couldn’t support myself so ended up moving back in. I struggle with feeling like my mom chooses him over me, questioning if he really did it to me or if I made it up somehow, and trying to move past it. instead of sexually assaulting me now he just constantly yells at me and threatens me. I have nightmares all the time dealing w my mom rejecting me or him coming to hurt me. I need help but I feel cornered. the only person I trust with this information has tried his best to help me but just says I have to wait until I can support myself to move out.

819,"My best friend (M14) has been out of the closet as bi for over a year now, and I (F14) completely support him. My best friend, who we'll call F1, is pretty open about his sexuality and isn't afraid to admit that he's bi. For the past couple of months, he's been crushing on a kid in our grade who we'll call D1 (Douche 1, M14).

Around 2-3 months ago D1 found out that F1 likes him, and he ended up making F1 cry. D1 pretty much texted F1 asking if F1 still liked D1, and F1 said no because he didn't want to embarrass himself. D1 pretty much went on to say that he liked F1, and F1 had a breakdown thinking that he missed his chance. F1 called me crying and after an hour trying to console him, F1 found out that D1 was pranking him with some other kid. F1 was so angry and upset. After that day he hated D1, but he still couldn't help liking him.

I was pissed. I wasn't a fan of D1 before, but now I hated him. Nobody makes my friends cry.

Last Friday F1 managed to get D1's phone number (They were using Snapchat to text before). F1 was so happy. I didn't find out about this until the end of the school day. (We're in 8th grade).

One thing to note is that my other friend (F14) who will be known as F2, is in an after school program called LEAP. For those who don't know what it is, it's pretty much at school babysitting for parents who can't get their kids when school ends. I'm not in LEAP, but I go there every time F2 goes. D1 just so happens to also be in Leap.

F1 usually rides the bus, but this Friday he decided to stay with F2 and me. Before F1 joined us he was by the busses saying goodbye to our other friends who ride the bus with him. F2 and I were standing in the snack line for LEAP when we heard this.

Note: Any new character who starts with D is a friend of D1.

D1: You bet that I could send F1 a dick pic.

D2: Haha why?

D1: Because I have his number and I know he likes me. So should I send him a dick pic?

Me: \*Now royally pissed at hearing this\* What the fuck is wrong with you?

D1: What?

Me: \*Now louder and making direct eye contact with D1\* What the fuck is wrong with you?

F2: \*Turns towards me\* We should go tell F1.

Me: Yeah

As we're walking away I hear this:

D3: Haha F1 was so happy when he got your number.

D4: Yeah, haha D1 you should send it.

That was all that I could hear before we got out of earshot. F2 and I made it to F1 and told him that he should block D1's number and explained what we heard. He was upset and only nodded and pulled out his phone. I assumed that he blocked D1's number, but I have no way of knowing if he actually did.

I was and still am shaking with anger. They hurt my friend, but I don't know how to get back at them. We don't want teachers getting involved so we can't go to them.

825,"Hi!

burner account here cause this one causes me a lot of lost pride. 

Preface with age 24yo/F and wasn't sure if it would be NSFW so erred on side of caution.

So recently I started a new job, its proper big leagues, well paid shit and I'll be getting paid more money than I've ever had at once

I used to live in poverty, and my mom was seriously depressed when I was growing up so I had to kinda drag myself up. Worked retail on minimum wage being yelled at by people for shit I couldn't do anything about It stunk but hey, it built character. And now I'm in a STEM field so I've come out on top

The only thing is, I lack the basic self care techniques a mother would have taught her daughter.

And yeah, sure, I know about Google but there's a lot of conflicting information that's just trying to sell you something half the time, I just need some solid impartial advice, woman to woman.

I know just about the basics, how to shower, wash hair, brush teeth, very bottom line stuff. 

When it comes to feminine upkeep, I'm useless. Bikini line maintenance rarely, if ever gets done. And it's never done in a way where I don't get discomfort. I will say bikini waxing is out of the question because I don't like strangers touching me. 

I don't know how to do make up, though frankly it doesn't interest me much.

Skincare though, is a big thing for me, but I don't know what my routine should be. 

The other thing is nutrition. 
Back when I was young it was the trash my mother could afford, I was grateful for a warm meal, but now that I'm in a job where I can have some self respect I want to be losing weight and becoming healthier. 
I've already been soda free for 6 weeks now, which has really helped me feel more alert and attentive at work, so that's a start. But my taste buds are naturally akin to liking 'plain' foods, day in, day out and it makes finding nutritional recipes that aren't super complex and hard to cook difficult. 

So yeah, TL;DR, lady maintenance, skincare routines, and nutritional advice to someone who is a total moron in that area would be great!

826,"I am 100% aware I shouldn’t be turning to reddit in this situation, but I’ve always been scared to talk to a therapist because I hate having anyone think I’m a bad person. Here are some traits I have that have been making me curious:

-Empathy is really hard for me to feel in certain situations. For example, when someone dies, I have no idea how to react. Like I think I somewhat understand how they feel, and try to be sad for them, but if someone tells me “this person died” I cannot show any form of empathy so it all comes off as fake. 

-I constantly crave attention. I feel so narcissistic all the time, but I have never felt what it was like to have attention. If I get a better grade then someone, or get a compliment, my ego will just get bigger. I keep all egotistical thoughts to myself, and act humble but I really don’t feel humble. I put myself down, when I really don’t feel down, just so I can get compliments to reassure myself.

-I’m a very angry person. I also don’t know how to control my anger, and have gotten really close to just exploding and hurting people. My brother made me angry once, and I started choking him and couldn’t control myself.

I have a lot of other suspicious traits so I’ll be adding them, but reading that out made me feel like such a shitty person, but I’ve learned to just accept that I’m a shitty person. Please let me know what you think",02Feb2020,1
827,"Hi all,

First of all I just want to say that I know a counter-offer is entirely the decision of my boss/the company and I can't do anything to implicitly MAKE them give me a counter offer if they just simply don't think I'm worth it.

This is more of a subtle thing. How can I go about politely expressing how much I'd love to stay for the right amount of money, without coming across and brash or entitled?

Some context, I have been at this company for a year and a half, I get on well with everyone, contribute a lot to my team, and generally I think I am a good employee. I'm currently on 26K, and this new job offer is for 35K. It's quite a jump. But, honestly, I'd love to stay at my current company and the only reason I'm leaving is because of the money, which I want to express. Hell, I'd even love to stay on 33K or possibly 32K.

How do I best go about this? I'm handing my notice in next week and I haven't told anybody. In my head I have two ideas, and not sure if I'm thinking on the right track:

* I simply hand my notice in very nice and politely and express how sad I am to leave, explain the money is really the reason why and I'm really going to miss this place and the work I do. Leave it at that and don't imply/ask anything, but hope for the best.

* I hand my notice in, but deeply express that it's entirely for the money and I would love to stay here - explicitly state that if I was made a counter-offer, I would take it without a heartbeat. So I'm entirely transparent and ultimately ask for it. But I don't know if this is a good idea.

Yeah anyway, just a bit of a ramble, I'm somewhat nervous as I've never been through this process before. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Cheers guys.",02Feb2020,1
828,So whenever my best friend had a girlfriend I would always support him. I remember the nights he would go out he would have fun and live his best life. While I sit at home just by myself and I never complained once. In fact I supported him wanting to have a long relationship I would give him advice I would always want him to be happy because I thought that was our goal together is to be happy. I thought that was what best friends would want for each other. Sadly his relationships never worked out. Now fast forward a couple years later I met my girlfriend who next year I plan on being engaged to and in the process of dating my girlfriend I lost my best friend. He just was not very supportive of it. I will try to always reach out to him. But eventually my phone calls went unanswered. Eventually he came out telling me how he was jealous of my situation we talked about it and we tried to patch it up but still things went back to be in the same. We no longer talk together.

I had a friend that I was closed with but we don't talk anymore, I like to believe I have a bright future and I don't want to bring drama in my life. I'm nerdier &amp; geeky and well let's just say she's not. Our moms use to work together and that's how we met we clicked instantly! We used to text all of the time and hang out and then she went to the military about a year ago and we would write letters to each other every month. I would consider ourselves good friends but...we stopped talking. She is one of those girls who go for bad boys that hit her and that are a nuisance to society! I a good guy and she calls me an Oreo, but she's not the only one and I take it as a compliment. She went out of control when she was with her ex-bf none of us talked to her, but she broke up with him.

The last time I saw her was a football Sunday ( Saints vs 49's ) and I was avoiding her the whole time she was there. But I went to my living, but she told me she was sorry ( we both knew what she was talking about ). I just nodded and walked away I didn't say anything because I was hurt.

But, I went to sleep last night and I gave her a very passionate kiss in my dreams! She's very pretty and I've thought about us together but I'm not her type and she's not my type ( But I kinda like her ).

I know this seems nothing but it really hurts me and it's causing me so much pain. 

She blames what happened to her when I was 3 on me because I was a troublesome kid (I don't remember much until the age of 8) and things I did would be blamed on her and maybe holds a grudge against me.

His presence on social media was limited before, and his dad recently passed.  Since then, he posts these crazy, disturbing statuses, like 5 or 6 a day.

In all of these posts he claims that he not only knows famous people, rappers from the early 90s mostly, but that he wrote their songs for them.  He makes similar claims for early 90s movies.  He was born in 1986, so these claims are not only totally untrue, but completely insane.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Following these deluded claims, he will often state that his entitlements and payment for all this is being stolen from him by his mother, the local police dept., and local politicians.  Furthermore, they are all part of pedophiles ring.  This seems to be his main delusion.  Also, he occassionally threatens to kill all of these people who are scamming him

6.20: Wake
7.00: Walk to station
7.30: Train
8.20: Underground train
9.00: Start work
Usually have 45 mins lunch break
17.20: Leave work, same journey home
19.30: Home
22.00: Sleep

This is assuming public transport is running smoothly. Delays fairly regularly push my journey back by 15 mins or (significantly) more depending on the cause.

I make this journey at least three days a week and WFH two days, though regularly have to cancel WFH.

I’m on a decent salary and would struggle to make the same elsewhere.

I have audiobooks, Netflix and a Switch for the commute but especially on the way back I feel totally sucked of energy and struggle to enjoy these at all. Without the full 8 hours of sleep I’m also very tired for the whole day.

842,"Long story short I found out my(17F) ex (18M) cheated on me with a girl that is more or less in my friend circle. I had invited him to a party (which was on Friday) prior to finding out, which he attended and the girl did too. They didn’t interact, but despite being extremely sad and heartbroken before, I couldn’t help but feel happy to see him. 

I am very much in love with him, and I think I loved him way more than he loved me. He is extremely immature and unserious so when I tried talking to him at the party he said that “we could do this later”. Which he later admitted was because he didn’t want to do it in public and was scared of saying something wrong because he isn’t good at talking. He still hasn’t initiated a real talk, probably cause he doesn’t care or that he’s a coward. He hasn’t properly apologized either.

Yesterday I did a stupid thing and messaged him telling him I missed him. He then said that we could do everything as before but without being in a relationship. We have been friends since 8th grade and began dating September last year. I can’t help but wonder, is this what he saw in our relationship? Was I so insignificant that he felt the need to look elsewhere? Am I THAT insignificant to him that he purely wants me as a friend with benefits? I’m so hurt that he would throw away all the years of our friendship like this. 

I am so scared to lose him, cause I love and care for him so much. But he doesn’t feel the same apparently. Even though he told me how much he appreciated me at the beginning of our relationship. A mutual friend of ours died and he was the person I felt the safest with. I don’t know if I should go through with his suggestion... I don’t know if I have more respect for myself or love for him.

tl;dr: Ex-boyfriend I’ve known since 8th grade cheated on me, is too stubborn and immature to admit his faults. He suggested being friends with benefits, but I don’t know what I should do.",02Feb2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Lost interest in a relationship, broke up.

Starting missing her, tried to get back, she says no... THIS IS WHERE MY MIND IS STUPID

&amp;#x200B;

I then convince myself that I left behind this perfect person, who I will never meet another like them.

Months I spend on this longing of her, the idea, what could, what should have been.

&amp;#x200B;

I then see her 6 months later, in sort of a disbelief that this person, who was not the person I created, had had such an effect on me...

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I find myself in the same situation, once the girl decides she doesn't want me, I feed the idea of her, which then torments me for months on end.

 The desire to have what I cannot.

I did a coding bootcamp about two years ago (which I took out a loan for) and never found a job afterwards. I struggle with the feeling that I should be working harder to make more money and get out on my own. I've tried going back to school three times, and each time I get dropped, or drop the classes.

I know eventually with the career I'm in now, I can make a comfortable living, but would a better person/man/father work harder for a better job? If I doubled down on what I know from the bootcamp, maybe I can still get a job somehow? Or went back to school for the fourth time?

&amp;#x200B;

In late July, I'll be moving to Massachusettes from Minnesota. Since January, I've been compiling budgeting info, trying to track down toll estimates, truck estimates, and of course, planning for the rent in the new place I'll be living in when I get to MA.

I have a living arrangement ready when I get there, which is really helping out this process from being particularly too stressful. I don't have a car, so I'm looking into truck rentals. It'll likely be just myself and my small dog, the whole way (1,404 miles / approx. 22 hours not including necessary stops for gas, food, sleeping)

&amp;#x200B;

But even though I feel like I'm the most organized I've maybe ever been looking at my spreadsheets, price comparisons, etc. I can't help but feel like there's a lot I'm not ready for. For example, I can't really say where I'll sleep besides just in the truck, along the way. I've moved to another state for college before, but it was with family. Moving between apartments, I've always moved with roommates. But this time I'm really on my own and beginning to feel the pressure of a big change, even though it's months out. I'm 22, kind of a dumbass, and I really want to be prepared for the unexpected if at all possible...

848,"I apologize for the super long post, there is a TL;DR. 

So a little bit of context here: I’ve been best friends with a girl (let’s call her Lindsey) since I was 13, We are now 20. We have grown apart due to some circumstances that were entirely out of our control but we have always talked at least once a week, and we have been getting closer again in the past couple of months. 

So about 5 years ago Lindsey started dating this guy, and right off the bat her mom did not approve, but solely for racist reasons. After a couple of months being together the abuse started. She broke up with him, but shortly after they got back together. This pattern continued, and every time, I offered my support solely for the reason that she loved him, I didn’t like him nor did I hang out with him and I made it clear that I was not supportive of the relationship but that I was supportive of my friend regardless of who she was with. I offered advice ever time she needed it and i was always there for her when she left him and at the end of the day she was my one of my best friends, and if she wanted to go back even after the rape, beatings, the police, and the hospital visits then I was there for her. I definitely did not want to leave her alone to deal with all of the trauma of this relationship. 

A couple of weeks ago, he tried to kill himself. He was committed to a mental facility by the state for 90 days. However, he got out within the week, and was put in state mandated therapy. He was doing better for about a week and they seemed happy until one day, Lindsey texts me and says she broke up with him. This time because he cut himself in front of her after he had threatened to kill her and she was trying to leave. She called 911 and they did absolutely nothing. i saw her living room covered in enough blood for him to have died. And I told her the same things I did every other time, that I was there for her if she needed anything and that she was better off, it’ll get easier, just the general things you tell someone after a breakup. 

This time was different though. Two days later he killed himself. When she called me to tell me and i could just tell that she was broken. My heart hurt so bad for her and I didn’t sleep at all that night. The next day I sent her a positive message to wake up to and I have just been offering my support throughout everything. But I can’t help being angry. I’m so angry at him for doing this. He hurt the person who was there for me through my toughest times in ways that no one should ever be hurt. And he just does this. I have been absolutely infuriated over these past two days because of his selfishness. So now not only does Lindsey have to deal with the emotional trauma of everything that she has been through the past 5 years but also the guilt of this “being her fault.” because how can you not feel that way when something like this happens 2 days after you break up with someone. 

So now i’m here feeling guilty for almost being happy that this guy killed himself, because at the end of the day it was going to come down to him or her in that grave. I haven’t slept the past two days and I broke down at work the other day because my heart hurts so so bad. I haven’t told her how i truly feel because i know that despite everything he put her through, she did love him and they did have their happy moments, and that is definitely not something you tell someone who just lost their loved one. 

TL;DR: My best friend’s abusive (raped, beat, and nearly killed her) boyfriend killed himself 2 days after she broke up with him for the 100th time and I’m almost happy that he died, because I know it would have been her if he hadn’t. How do I deal with the guilt of feeling that way?",02Feb2020,1
849,"I have a mini aussie named Crouton. I've been planning on taking him with me in the car while I drive from Illinois to California in a few weeks. We would stay at pet friendly hotels, I'd take him on walks every day and it would be a cool adventure to have together. I would love to have him there but it would probably be a little more difficult because he has separation anxiety, so there could be problems if I have to leave him alone for any reason, and when I get to California I want to look at apartments so I wouldn't want him barking in an AirBnB or hotel while I'm gone.

My mom and sister are visiting me in the middle of march. I'm leaving in the middle of February so would only be without Crouton for about a month. It would definitely be easier to find an apartment, go out, etc when I first move there without him. But I would be completely alone for that month -- I don't know really anyone there.

My biggest concern is him flying in the plane for a few hours if he came with my mom and sister.

850," So, I'm having a tough time with my band. Let me explain what's going on.

 Last year, I started a band with two of my closest friends. At first, we had a tough time coming up with a line-up. My friend and I have been playing guitar for essentially all our life, so I became the bassist and my friend became the guitarist. But we desperately needed a drummer, so my other friend agreed to buy the drums and become the drummer.

 Fast forward until this year. My friends drumming has obviously not improved since he got it and we also recently got an offer to open up for another band. We had to turn it down because we knew the drummer wasn't ready. And it honestly pained me to turn an opportunity down like that. So yesterday, during rehearsal, I proposed we do a temporary line-up change. I'm on drums and the drummer on bass. The guitarist said he didn't want to drum.

 The drummer became upset and took it the wrong way. He thought we were just bashing him on his drumming when we were just trying to communicate. But the problem is. He isn't good on drums, his drums sound terrible. He bought them for 200$ off Ebay. I even proposed to buy him a new snare but he didn't want it. He said he needed a new ride cymbal. I just don't know what to do anymore.

 My guitarist and I have been playing instruments all our life and we have to wait for him to get on our level. I'm not trying to sound like a dick but we'll be thirty but the time he gets the hang of drumming. And who's to say that I'll become a better drummer? Maybe I suck at it but that's why i want to change out the line-up. So we could figure out who belongs where. The thought of kicking him out comes to mind but I don't want to do it. It's the guitarist and my own fault for doing this to him. We honestly never should've let him join our band when he's this stubborn and inexperienced. But because he's our closest friend the guitarist and I feel like we're just forced to have him.

 I'm honestly not even having fun at rehearsal because of it.",02Feb2020,1

857,"I’m early 20sF and have a brother who’s a year and a half younger than me. Since we are quite close in age, growing up  we had a bit of a rivalry and being the oldest I was a massive bully to him. We’d fight and I’d get physical, hitting or kicking. He would fight back a little but not as hard, I was always the instigator. The physical fights never turned bloody and nobody ever got badly hurt, no bruises or anything like that but I would be really terrible to him. It stopped as we grew older and any fights just turned into screaming matches instead and more verbal, less physical, though I was certainly verbally abusive to him too. 

I was always a bit of the golden child in the sense that I did exceptionally well in school and so my brother was always a bit in my shadow, though I would say my parents tended to favour him more because of this and because I was mean to him, but I know he always felt inferior to me. So it was easy for me bully this insecurity growing up. 

Anyway, I was watching this tv show earlier, quite a dramatic and serious one, gets quite emotional at times. This character loses her brother quite traumatically and it REALLY hit me. I had flashbacks to how absolutely awful I was to my brother, and suddenly thought about what if I lost him and I’d been so horrible to him for the majority of his life. 

He’s grown into quite an insecure man, and I know I had a massive hand in who he is now. I will never ever be able to undo the psychological damage I caused to him growing up, and I hate myself. How can I ever even begin to repair the damage I’ve caused. Even now, he still looks up to me, wants to talk to me all the time and wants to give me hugs (I’m not a very affectionate person).

859,"This is a throwaway account and I don't really know where to begin or how much backstory to give, but I'll try to keep it simple:

I am a freshman mechanical engineering major at my state university. When I was going through the college application process I was remarkably overwhelmed. I was sick of the expectations, given no guidance in the process, burnt out after what years of running myself into the ground, and on top of it all my mother, with whom I've never had a good relationship, wasn't well. Nothing felt certain. I didn't know where to go, what to study, if I should take a gap year to figure things out. Despite being accepted at more renowned schools, I wound up caving and just settling for my state school because it was close to home and cheap.

Now I'm here and I'm unhappy and uncertain. Socially, it's alright. I have friends, but they're mostly people I knew in high school who don't necessarily treat me all too well. The main problem here though is I just want a fresh start. I want to be somewhere I'm not constantly reminded of my past? I don't know. It's hard to explain but I don't have anyone to actually talk to. Even my advisers are useless. Each meeting is capped at 15 minutes and the last time I went to try and express some of my academic concerns, I wasn't even able to say what I wanted before the time was up and I had to leave so the next student could come in.

Academically, I don't necessarily know what I want to do. I wanted to double major with economics or Spanish but I ran into the same problem inadequate advisers. Every time I would bring up the subject, I was simply told it's possible but given no concrete advice on how to go about it, if it was wise, what classes to take to achieve it, or how to even declare another major. I already changed my major from chemical engineering to mechanical engineering with an aerospace minor, which brings up another problem: If I'm going to pursue engineering, I'd prefer aerospace, but aerospace at my school is only offered as a minor and is not even accredited. On top of this all, I had already felt like I settled for a sub par program (my school is not well known at all for engineering) and I don't know what to do.

If I'm being completely honest, I think it would be refreshing to transfer somewhere I don't know anyone. Frankly, it would probably open up more options as well, but I'm aware transfer students are significantly limited in their scholarship options. I have good stats and a good GPA, but I also know that I won't receive financial aid. Basically, the only pros of the school I'm at (in my eyes) are this:

1. Cost
2. I have a job at the university nuclear reactor

I started renting my house in October. I'm 26, and living alone with my 1 month old son and my dog Remus. While I was still pregnant I came across a baggie of coke/MDMA on top of a kitchen cupboard. I thought nothing of it, other than to throw it out, but since then a few things have happened to put me on edge.

First, the landlord had some workmen round to fix a few things. Speaking with them, I learned that they decorated after the previous tenant left; they told me he must have been close with next door as the man was around every day saying as much. They also told me the tenant left in a hurry as they left everything behind.

Second, as I was leaving one day a man turned up in a car and beat down the neighbours door, demanding payment for a debt having seen them spending money the previous night (I'm assuming on Snapchat or something similar).

Third, when I tried to start paying council tax I was told I couldn't get single person discount as someone was listed as living and claiming housing and council tax benefits from my address. 

And fourth, the past two nights I've had someone knock at my door asking for someone who doesn't live here. The first night a girl came asking for a Megan, and tonight a man came asking for a Scott. I have no idea who Megan is but I still get post for a Scott.

I'm wondering what if anything I should do. I believe the neighbours have drug debts, and that the previous tenant of my house does too. Living alone with a newborn I feel very unsafe. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel paranoid. What if the neighbours have a spare key to my house? What if the people Scott owes money to think he still lives at my house and is sending me to the door? Any advice is appreciated.

She may have caught me staring at her a few times, one being when I was getting a powerade outside the cafeteria and I saw her walking in and I looked st her and she briefly glanced at me and smiled to herself when she looked away.. unless she was smiling at someone in the cafe. Later on when I was working with another coworker, she came by (  shes a safety committee staff member so she was making sure everyone was using there loading stands ), my coworker who is friends wigh her walked out the trailer and made a playfully rude joke to her and when I laughed she smiled and waved at me and I waved back and smiled, and then she told him to get a loading stand. Then she came around to my end and started slowly pushing my loading stand towards me with her foot. I kept turning around to continue working but I met her halfway and said thanks and she politely nodded and left.




A few days after that, I was unloading stuff from a truck and putting stuff on a the conveyor belt, so the belts get shut off I walk out to get fresh hair. I'm pretty much just standing there waiting to come back on resting my hands on the belt, the girl walks by the conveyor belt next to me and waits there. I'm staring at the floor, I wasn't looking at her and she wasn't in my direct line of sight but I could see her from my peripherals. So she turns completely around looking dead at me so I notice and look back at her, we held eye contact for 3 seconds then I halfed waved. I was caught off guard and didn't smile so I know I unintentionally gave her a cold serious acknowledgment and she slightly smiled nodded her head, but turned around and had a confused look and walked in her trailer. I dont know if she thought I was staring at her, or what. When she was looking at me she didn't look uncomfortable or bothered, she had a pleasant look on her face at the least but idk.

Anyway this is more recent stuff, my supervisor tell me to go to her supervisor to help out, so I'm throwing stuff off a conveyor belt onto another. She's like 3 belts down from me and I heard her kinda shout stop, and started calling out random names like she was trying to get someones attention. I saw her kept staring   in my direction  for a few seconds from my peripherals but felt awkward at that point so I just kept going, maybe I was throwing off the wrong stuff.




After that, the supervisor asked me to do that same in the trailer she was in. So as I came over there she was like "" what's your name again?? Lol "" I told her, and she was like "" I called you every name in the book, I'm sorry lol ""  After that I saw a box on the floor and picked it up, put it on the belt at a bad angle and it started flipping around and she looked at me and pointed past me and was playfully like "" see what you did?? Lol "" So I fixed it and laughed. So she went back in her trailer to finish unloading, a guy friend of hers was in there ( I dont know if she's single but I do know they are just friends ) so I was looking in the there direction to see which boxes needed to be taken off and for some reason I kept seeing her glance at me briefly and say stuff ( I couldn't hear )  and her friend would kinda turn around and grin or chuckle. I dont know if I was being roasted or seriously insulted or what. I do have the tendency to zone out alot so maybe it was that? She wasn't  smiling or laughing nor was she giving me dirty looks she just had a neutral expression. I started to feel a little self conscious, but I didn't show it. After a while she said "" I'm so sorry honey were almost done unloading the truck. I was kinda confused, but my eyes were blood shot and I get told I look upset eventhough I'm not so perhaps that was it, Idk. I felt like she was trying to be funny and felt made fun of. Afterwards when we finished  as I was getting my water bottle she said something and then faced towards me and asked if I was ok, so I said yeah and she asked why my eyes were red, so I told her it was my contact lenses, and she was like oh just rinse them out in the bathroom, do you have your container and solution with you and I said I left them at home lol, she then face palms, smiles, shakes her head and walked away. So in my head I was like ooooh k then.. ""






After that I worked in a trailer with her guy friend, he seemed pretty cool, and asked how long I been working there and etc. We say whats up to eacother during passing.

There was a time when I came in, she's part of the safety committee and when it was my turn in line she grabbed my hand from my side to put the needle in, and was trying to place my fingers on it ( I dont think she was flirting she probably was making sure no one was poked ) and I was kinda nervous and wasn't grasping the needle and was like "" grab it lol! "" I laughed and then I had to pop a balloon and answer a safety question, so I did and forgot a few of em and then she made me repeat it. As I was saying the answers I kinda had a nervous smile and she kinda smiled to.




Other time, she was talking to my supervisor and I came up to him waiting for him to say what to do next. I noticed she was looking at me, not smiling but had a pleasant expression on her face. I was about to look at her and say hi but she looked off and looked back again when I was talking to my supervisor.







Our last interaction, pretty similar. I'm in her area to help out, and I see her talking to her supervisor and I approach him to get further instructions, then she asked to see my water bottle ( I have the one that keeps the water cool ) as I was talking to her supervisor I see her fiddling around with it, looking confused trying push the buttons, after I was done talking and the supervisor walked off she asked what the button did,  so I explained it but was kinda nervous so I didn't speak to loud and she kinda leaned in and was like "" ok say that again lol "" and I did and she was like oh ok your fancy "". Later on I go to the bay door wait for the truck back in, and she walks up and I see her looked at me from my peripherals for a split second so I turn to her and she says "" Ok like so how are you just going to come here and steal my truck lol? "" So I said the supervisor told me to be here lool "" and she said something else I forgot and  I felt awkward and just smiled and looked away from her and she was like "" I'm just messing with you, I like talking shit lol. "" I helped her pick up a box with a blade sticking out and she told me to be careful. Then another co worker of hers came and she started talking to her.





She seems pretty outgoing and social and definitely not shy, I see her trash talking her friends sometimes. We rarely are around eacother though, but I notice she never says hi to me or anything but does to others. She never really has though, only time she talks to me was when I was in her area helping out, but if we pass eacother she never greets, or looks my way, but I never greet her either. This isnt new though. I'm not sure where I stand with her tbh.

Tldr: I like a girl but cant figure out if I might have a chance or not. I've had times previously where I thought a girl was just being friendly when she actually liked me and vice versa, and its like depending on the reality of this situation, I don't want to miss out OR make things awkward.",02Feb2020,1

I'm generally a laid-back dad, and what she did strikes me as something stupid, but not the end of the world. I've already told her not to do it again (advice she didn't need, as she's mortified and she'll *never* do it again), and I've also told her I'm not telling anyone else, and told her she's already forgiven.

We had to go to a meeting at school, though, where the vice principal read her the riot act as if my daughter is Patty Hearst. I figured the girl was due for some scolding, so I sat there and said nothing for several minutes, waiting for this authority figure to finish his rant and regain his composure. When that didn't happen, I sort of handed him his composure.

""Look, [schmuck's name], my daughter did something dumb. She knows it. She has to stay home for a week, and when she comes back she has to deal with all the things the other kids will say, and she has to deal with dummies like you, and that's punishment enough.

Last year I started University and it was really good , I met new friends and got close to this girl I liked . Just as things were going well , my personal life started to take a toll . Due to a recession in our country , the family business was not doing well at all . We had to sell off a lot of assets , this includes our other properties , the family car and we accumulated even more debt . My parents were just pushing for finished the year off on a good note with us as a family .

At the end of the year , I lost the girl I liked who was a very close friend to me . I lost many others too and the friends I did make , made me feel as if I didn't fit in with them anymore . I felt isolated and alone , I could turn to no one my age for a shoulder to cry on , everyone was living their lives whilst I was worrying about mine .

Fast forward to February 2020 and we might finally lose our house of 20+ years because of the business closing and further financial strain . I don't know where and who to turn to anymore . No one bats an eye , I feel as if I'm trying my best to live two seperate lives , one where I have to put on a smile and act totally different in the other one .

for the next 700m we walked the same route and she kept turning around, she had a fast pace tho. After aprox. 400m we get to the traffic light and she gives me a stare, gets behind me, walks with the normal pace and gets to her home (So now i know where she lives by coincidence lol), streets werent lonely, hence i didnt think she was frightened or whatever. But on the other side I thought she was frightened and If i came to introduce myself she would actually think Im a stalker.
Okay my dillema is: Was she frightened or she was actually giving me hints? Should I try and meet her again somehow by imitating the same route on that day?
Im really interested in her now tbh.

I realized it’s just a nice no because she didn’t want to say anything that hurt our friendship. After that I worked hard to maintain the close friendship.

There's actually a stigma on leaving home unmarried when you're the only child. People assume something bad happened, or you're a prick for leaving your parents by themselves.

My parents were physically and psychologically abusive through my upbringing. I've struggled with mental disease since I was a kid. Then I got a job at 18, paid my own education, started drinking alcohol and taking drugs routinely, doing wild things. So I turned into my parents aggressor. At some point I turn to substance abuse 24/7. Rehab and psych ward through the years. Right now I patched up things with my parents for good, I've been visiting them every weekend for the last month and they have been supportive and friendly.

I hate where I rent. It's dirty and my housemates are rude and noisy, I can't even play my instruments. Everything is always dirty, I can't even cook, I'm always washing everyone's dishes. They take my food from my fridge, which is just yogurt and milk at this point.

When I was younger, me, my parents and brother went to go visit my mam's mother and step dad in york. I'm not sure on exactly how old but I think around 8 to 10. She had a step brother who I'll refer to as SB. He at the time was around 20 and I believe had some learning difficulties so was odd but I obviously being a kid didnt know. We were staying there for a few days and during that time we slept on a air bed. One of these days however when I was in SBs room i was lying on his bed because I'd go in there because of his games and long story short he touched me and i remember him specifically asking if i liked it. That's all that happened I'm pretty sure but throughout my life I've blocked out memories entirely and only remembered this a couple years ago (I'm 20 now). Since then what triggered this memory was hearing from my mam that he was getting done for basically doing the same to a young girl but got let off because of his learning difficulties but that was last I heard. Hes a sick, disgusting man who I dont class as family but for whole other reasons but I dont hate him, not entirely valid but depends on how you see this.

The advice I'm asking for is mainly for me telling my parents namely my mam. She hates him and her own family because of all the terrible things shes dealt with growing up and finding out that her step brother touched her son would break her and make her do something that would have consequences. I care for her and dont want her to have to deal with any more pain in her side of our family so should i tell her now or wait a while longer until I think the times right. The point of me not hating him idk why but other than hating that side of the family I just dont care, like as if I can cut emotions out of it which I've noticed over the years a lot.

906,"Hi everyone. Below is some backstory to my current situation. If you don’t want to read it, you can skip down to where it says CURRENT SITUATION. 

So, 2019 was a pretty bad year for me. My mental and physical health had deteriorated a lot. Because of that, for spring 2020, I decided to take a semester off college because I had gotten a really bad gpa and was caught cheating and had to fill out an academic dishonesty form and was on the verge of suicide. I was so afraid that if I went back, I would end up killing myself. So, because of that, I told my parents of my thoughts and at first, they said if I needed a semester off, it’s fine but after a few days, my mom told me I was running away or giving up, which I suppose may be true in a sense. I was at college for my parents, not for me. 

At college I realized how much my life has been decided by my parents and not by me. That put me into deep depression, on top of being lonely and stressed. So, in college I decided I would take a stand on my life. No matter what happened. My father has been very abusive physically and mentally and so well, I knew he wouldn’t be happy. I was surprised at first he was saying it’s okay but a day before I was going to fill out the paperwork, he called me and yelled at me over the phone and threatened me. I was so afraid he was going to hit me again so I ran away. I got my clothes and whatever else I could and had maybe 30 dollars on me and ran away. I came home the same night because I was afraid he would hit my mom and my cousin convinced me to. 

He didn’t hit me but was giving a speech on how disappointed he was but I didn’t care. After that, my cousin told me to come to Michigan with him and his mom (my aunt) and he can help me figure things out. Since I’ve been here, I’ve been less stressed, a lot more happy and a little bit more confident. I’ve been going to therapy and my psychologist is thinking I have ocd, among other things which I won’t go into here. 

CURRENT SITUATION: 

But now, well, yesterday and today, my dad thinks I’ve been talking trash about him. I’m not sure where he is getting this from but I think it’s because my aunt told him not to hit me so he thinks I’m going around telling everyone all the times he hit me. The most I’ve said is whenever they ask or I tell my aunt if he wants me to come back, he has to promise not to lay a finger on me. But I’ve never said anything bad about him. I said he has given me a blessed life I never would have had without him but what he did was wrong. 


Anyway, these past two days he’s been texting me saying a lot of things. “Fuck u” or “I am done with you. You need to forget about me in your life” and so on. Obviously, these are the shortened versions of what he is saying.

Just an hour ago, I received a text from him saying he will not finically support me. I told him if that is what he wants to do, I understand and respect that. Now, I am looking for whatever job I can find. I have a friend in Arizona who works at a bread factory and he says he can get me a job that makes 30,000 a year. All I have to do is pay rent which is 500 for me. 

So my question is, how should I go about looking and getting a good job as a high school graduate? I can get my associates in science at the community college I went to for two years but I’m not sure what I can get with that. Should I move to Arizona? I really like living with my aunt and my cousins and they’d let me stay here for a while. What kind of jobs can I get? I should mention I have back issues (bulging disks and all that). I have been going to therapy for a while and it’s better now but it does limit the work I can do. What advice can everyone here offer me? Thank you so much if you read this far.",02Feb2020,1
907,"So this is gonna be long, grab some popcorn and get ready.

Me(23/m) and my gf (23/f) have been together for 7 years. We've had a great relationship this whole time and we get on extremely well, enjoy the same/similar things and we've been living together for a good year and a half now. We've had our ups and downs like any relationship out there, ours is usually about how she will talk to a lot of people, some of whom are guys and it bothers me more than it should. (I have anxiety, on medication for it, but I still sometimes let it out too much). Now I've always questioned it, ""who's that"" ""what are you talking about"" etc. I hate myself for it but I can't control it sometimes.
She's been great with me and handling it for a long time.


This was until last November when I was diagnosed with pneumonia, and nearly died - I don't say that lightly, they told my parents I might not make it one morning. She was by my side every day and she is definitely part of what got me through it. Now, on the exact same day I went into hospital, so did her mum via ambulance, she also had pneumonia but not as bad as mine. Fast forward a week, her mum gets discharged thankfully and we thought that was that, then a week later again, I get discharged. Problem over? Nah, her mum then drops dead a couple days after I get out of hospital.


My GF didn't really react much to it, she cried for a day or two but then she didn't seem to show any signs of upset and I thought it was odd, kept asking her how she was etc, but same response every time.
Now one of the days she supposedly went to her dad's house (she told me), but I later found out she went to the house of one of the guys she talks to and it was for just talking, emotional support etc. I don't think she'd cheat, I don't have that gut feeling (believe me, I have a lot of gut feelings from this damn anxiety) and I looked through messages etc it didn't seem like she was cheating at all. So we argued I said this has to stop, no more lying, I said I'm not sure whether to leave her because with my anxiety, lying is just making it 10x worse, its making my worries and anxieties a reality. She has lied a few times, but nothing major. And it always seems to be to avoid conflict, or to avoid falling out. I will never shout at her but she was the youngest of 5 and her family didn't treat her amazing from what I've been told when she was growing up. Naturally I think the lying is just in her nature because of her upbringing. Anyway, I brushed this off as her mum has just died and she's not thinking straight, fair enough, if my mum died I'd be a fucking mess.


Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we were looking at moving house to get a bigger house and closer to my work. We haven't shared finances, she never wanted to and I sort of didn't either but thought it would be better to do that. Alas, we had separate accounts and split bills. I always paid more, as I earn £1k more than her per month and that's fair. I assumed she was doing ok with money but it turns out she wasn't, she was going paycheck to paycheck but never told me and I would always ask if she was ok for money and she would say she is. Anyway, she told me she had 2k aside for the house move (we rent) and I had the same so we figured we'd go for it. Comes to printing bank statements and payslips for the rent application and that's when I find out what's going on with her money. And she didn't have 2k set aside at all, she was in her overdraft and had been going paycheck to paycheck but hadn't told me, I would have given her money or paid more bills if I had known. Now this is tricky because money is such a sensitive subject especially for people who don't earn a lot, I earn quite a bit and I don't feel ashamed to talk about it, but for her when I'm earning what I do, I imagine she feels a bit shy of it, perhaps embarrassed? (Maybe, I'm guessing)


I felt manipulated as we were talking about doing this and that for the new house all the time, we were so excited about it, planning things out and deciding on new furniture etc, but she couldn't afford it all along. I felt hurt, a very bad hurt as she'd promised not to lie to me at all, but again, I'm confused because her mum has just died, she's wanting to make me happy and she's trying her best to live without her mum. We had a falling out, she opened up about how much of a mess her head was in and she said she needed a break from us, my anxiety has been bad and it was becoming too much for her with her own issues and the grief of her mum. I don't believe in breaks, I believe if there's an issue you sort it, going on a break just delays it and runs away from the issue (imo). So then she dumped me as I wasn't wanting a break. We broke up for a couple hours and then spoke it out, she said she doesn't want to break up but does need the space and that's why she broke up with me. So I agreed we could have a break and we can sort out our issues down the line, but she said she'd come see me a couple times a week and message me every 3 days. Fair enough. But then it went bad again and she said she couldn't do that, she needs a proper break and dumped me again, we spoke it out and I didn't see her for a week. She won't say we're still together but we're not split up... We're just what we are at the minute. We've had sex a couple times since then and we seem to be better when we're together. We've gone on a couple dates and message fairly regularly, went out clubbing etc. It's just hard though, only 2 months ago before all this we were on about getting married and kids.


Now she's living with her dad, she's taken all her stuff and I'm sleeping at my parents house but still have our house until May, I just don't want to be alone at the minute. My head is a mess and I'm trying to support her in anyway I can but it's difficult.
Her head is obviously a bigger mess too, and she's going for grief councilling to help.
She says she's coming back and we'll return to how we were in a while but she doesn't know how long it'll be, she says it may be 3 months, 6 months, even a year. I can sort of deal with it, but of course going from what we were to this is just painful. Nothing compared to what losing her mum must have felt like though.


I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone have any advice after reading this? Thoughts on the whole situation? Am I being a dick, am I being too something or another?


Before anyone says it, yes I was very me me me at first. I was scared of being hurt from her leaving and didn't want the break, I was terrified of losing her. Now I've come to realise it's what she needs, and I'm allowing that and not messaging her when she needs the space and meeting up with her when she doesn't. I'm trying to support her in every way that I can, but I'm finding it so difficult to function, my work is suffering, I haven't done any of my hobbies in a while and all I do is get home at night, lie in bed and message her, or watch YouTube videos if she doesn't want to talk to me. 

I miss her and us so so much.",02Feb2020,1
908,"Not that I should even have to explain this part, but my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. Admittedly we were broken up for the better part of a year. We were doing long distance at the time and things just weren’t working out, so we broke up and had some painful time apart. After a while we talked about how we felt and everything that had happened and we made the decision to get back together. I love him very much, we live together now and things are going smoothly. 

However, after he moved up here my friends suddenly stopped talking to me. I, at the time, was overworked, exhausted, depressed, and dealing with the unexpected passing of my father. I didn’t have the energy to sit on my phone and talk to them for hours because if I was at home, I was sleeping. I didn’t have the energy to even articulate any thoughts during that period. They didn’t check up on me or ask me how I was. On the rare chance I did try to reach out to them, it was ignored. They dropped me at the most life-changing time of my life when I needed the most support. At the time I was too depressed to confront them, so I let it be. It’s been 4-6 months since any of us last talked, and last night I actually asked what happened. 

The response I got was a novel. That basically boiled down to... “I didn’t like that you wouldn’t listen to how I felt about you getting back together with your boyfriend after how much you vented to us during the break up, and then you decided to just get back with him and that made me feel stupid.” 

Truthfully I never asked how they felt, because I didn’t care how they felt. It was my life and my decision and I didn’t care if they didn’t like my boyfriend because of how things were while we were broken up. They didn’t go through it and deal with that situation.They basically claimed that I owed them an explanation and because I didn’t give them one, topped with the fact that they already didn’t like my boyfriend, they stopped being my friends. Without any communication at all.  

The reason they do not like my boyfriend is because of how much pain I was in during our break up. They blame the break up and all my pain solely on him, when that’s not true, and I’ve explained that to them. I had also explained to them that if I could move on and him and I could work things out, then their opinion of my boyfriend doesn’t even matter and I’d rather not hear it. They said it was shitty of me to have relied on them and have them give me advice (which I did not ask for, and never did) just for me to turn around and go back to my boyfriend, without even listening to what their opinion was of it. 

The way I see it is they friend dumped me because of their own opinions of my boyfriend. I didn’t tell them any of the developments leading up to us getting back together because I knew either way it would’ve ended up in the same boat. I asked what happened because I wanted closure, and I guess I got it. But for some reason it still bothers me that they felt so entitled to having opinions on my relationship. Like, with the amount of times their boyfriends have treated them like complete shit... of course it’s different in their situation, because they didn’t actually break up, and they’re assuming our break up was a bad thing and we can’t come back from it. I just think the whole thing is hypocritical, and they should’ve been happy that I was happy. (And gotten over it, as it wasn’t their relationship.) 

I don’t really know, but I feel like this isn’t how friendships work. I get it, I relied on them a lot during that time period, but they never offered to actually help me. They just tolerated me. But if the other golden-friend in the group was upset, it was “omg I’ll be there in 20 minutes.” I had already felt excluded for some time because of this kind of behavior but never said anything (which is my own fault), but I just think it is incredibly stupid to have kicked me out of the friend group with no communication whatsoever over something that doesn’t even concern them in any way. 

I guess I’m just mad, and want to know if there’s anybody who has some advice on how to unpack all of this and ease my aggravation. Was I wrong in how I acted, by not caring about their feelings about my decision? I’m confident in the choice I made about getting back together with my boyfriend, but I’m still unraveling that my decision that I made for my happiness apparently cost me my “friends” because they wanted to hold a grudge against my bf.

I’m currently in University in my first year of Pharmacy and it requires you to meet up with a personal tutor to complete a professional personal development portfolio. It’s either a pass or fail. I’ve only met up with my tutor once because I forgot our next meeting but me being me I didn’t think to arrange another one. 

So here’s the thing a whole term has passed since seeing him and I’ve realised that my student email has been logged out of outlook so I haven’t received any emails from the university. I log in and see he’s sent three emailing asking me when to meet up and I’m panicking so I sent him an email at like 10pm apologising and all that malarkey. 

So it’s Monday the next day and he’s teaching one of my seminars so I feel sick thinking about it for some reason but I couldn’t help it. I saw him from outside the building and I tried to avoid him when going to class. When I sat down at the table, I was explaining the situation and how awkward I felt just thinking about it and he came up-to the table handing out the worksheets and I’m thinking pleeeease don’t say anything but he does. He was saying to arrange a meeting and I was like yeah I know and I apologised again. 
Anyhoo, the seminar works where two lecturers split up to different tables and help those tables and what do you know? My tutor comes to our table and I’m thinking great. He’s trying to get a chair and I was gonna help him and he insinuates that I’m only doing it to get out of the meeting or something along those lines. I felt so awkward but I tried to play it off.

It just feels like everytime I want to say or do something I stress about how it would affect other people. How speaking in a topic even a small topic about basically nothing would affect a person, how it could upset them, annoy them, anger them or so much more. Most of the time I know I’m overreacting but I still worry about it. 

One example of this is how recently in my house there have been a lot of arguments between my mum and my brother who has OCD and Aspergers. It causes yelling and verbal abuse to my mum which makes her cry. It just got to a point where I couldn’t stand the sleepless nights of hearing my mum cry and beg for my brother to stop yelling and I couldn’t live everyday without panicking everytime I heard a voice from someone I can’t see.

Excitingly I started researching heavily when I'm not at work and have been trying to think of a name. I even have some good connections that I have listed on my whiteboard to contact after buying my LLC, making my website, solicitation permits, and getting the right supplies.

Does anyone think starting a cleaning service in a competitive area could still be worth my time? I still feel excited for it but I wanted some advice before moving forward.

One of our teachers has even gathered the high school students with dropping grades (I was included and I feel highly ashamed of it) for meeting in the library. None of what she said really helped. What she said seemed to have been targeted at the majority. Who were those students who get out of the classroom frequently during classes, talk alot, or simply don’t study. The advice I got really doesn’t applies since I don’t talk often, I get out of class when I need to, and I do study for my tests.

I would like to take some advice to improve the situation. Do you guys have any way I can improve my attention ability? It’s causing too many problems.",02Feb2020,1

She's my best friend. These past few months I have been going through a lot and she has helped me through it so much. During all that I wondered if maybe I had feelings or not so saw online that you should flirt / be a bit more touchy to try and see if you guys can go anywhere. I guess I just did this horribly wrong. Last weekend we went to a club and I was super drunk and even I knew I probably went too far that night but I apologized the next day and told her that it would never happen again.

When I started to wake up again it felt like my jaw was moving all over the place so I'd turned my head and then it felt like I was having a fit, I've never had a fit so Its what I imagine it feels like? This feeling stops and I'm trying to open my eyes but I can't, I try to move my arms, but i can't. I then try to call my bfs name but all I can muster is Juh. I tried again then couldn't even move my lips. I'm not sure how long this lasted, maybe 20-30 secs tops? Then I must've frightened myself awake, even though it felt like I was already awake, which the bf heard cos he asked if I was ok. I explained what happened and he said he'd heard me say Juh but just assumed it was me making noises in my sleep, as I usually do. This freaked me out even more tbh.

946,"In HS I was always the humanities guy, but ended up going into CS in college because I didn't know what to major in so I followed the money. Although I've just started my fourth semester, because of me taking the more competitive humanities courses in HS I was able to get out of most of my gened requirements and as a result after this semester I'll only have 9 more courses to take to graduate. I say I'm pretty much done with the degree because after this semester (which is well under way) I will have finished the 3 really hard classes + all the math classes (which weren't fun) and am just taking electives.

The problem is after my first internship this past summer, I'm really not into CS. I have secured another CS internship for this summer (I'm trying to keep an open mind), but I loathe the idea of sitting in an office from 9-5 the rest of my life while being a replaceable cog in a machine. Instead, I've thought about becoming a psychologist, a soldier, a businessman, an EMT, a diplomat, a politician- I pretty much want to stay away from programing/sitting down at a computer for 40 years. 

I'm pretty much filled with existential dread at the idea of joining the rat race after hearing the stories of the exploits of fictional and non-fictional heroes. I want to live an exciting life, so much so that the idea of dropping out of college and starting anew excites me. Few good stories start, continue, and end with stability.

So, here's my compromise (and thus, the TL:DR):

1) Continue on with CS and finish the degree (as a security).

2) Minor in something that interests me (psychology, English/Creative-writing, etc).

3) Decide what to do:

3a) Go to grad school in that minor?

3b) Join the military?

3c) Start a business?

3d) Become a monk (half-serious)?

3e) Write in my free time?

947,"Throwaway obviously. 

I live by my self in a pretty large apartment complex. Yesterday some of my friends came over to make the most of the communal pool. When we were in the hallway, one of them spotted a photo on the ground and grabbed it. 

Turns out the photo is a mildly erotic photo of my very polite, very unassuming neighbour posing topless as she eats pizza in bed. The pizza box is cleverly positioned but it’s still pretty raunchy. For some reason it’s printed on magnetic material so the whole thing is like a 4x6 fridge magnet?

My friends thought it was really funny and promptly slapped it on the front of my fridge but I feel uncomfortable every time I see it. I moved it to the side of the fridge because I felt so awkward but I still catch a glimpse of her every now and then. The guy I’ve been seeing thinks it’s funny as well but I just feel guilty and weird. 

I’m not sure what to do. I don’t know my neighbour very well but I’ve lived next to her and her boyfriend for a while now. Her boyfriend is really boisterous but she’s always come across as a bit more reserved. I feel like maybe she’d be embarrassed knowing her topless pizza pictures are just floating around in the wild?

Anyway, I need to get rid of it. 

On the one hand I think I should just throw it out and be done with it. But I keep thinking - if she realises she’s misplaced the picture and I throw it out (or hide it away somewhere I can’t see it), will she always wonder who’s hands it wound up in? I’m pretty sure she and her boyfriend know I’m gay so it’s kinda best-case-scenario for her that i found it. 

On the other hand I’ve been thinking about slipping it under their doorway but then I think she might be really mortified that someone else has seen it? I don’t know how I’d act when I see them next and I’d probably be paranoid they knew it was me who slipped it under the door.

I could just give it back to them in person but I think that would just be really embarrassing for all parties? Even though they probably know I’m not getting off to their pizza porn, it’s still a weird situation. 

All I know is, I can’t have her staring me down every time I grab something from the fridge. I need to get rid of this magnet.

950,"For most of my life I've been pretty resilient against illnesses. I'll get the sniffles off whatever cold is going around but shake it off in a couple of days.

This winter, I've taken time off work for at least two days on three separate occasions. I'm currently ill and not planning on going to work tomorrow because of it.

I think the conditions in my office have something to do with it. The toilets and kitchen are cleaned overnight but are usually gross by around lunchtime. The office itself is in a basement, which means there's also poor air circulation, which means when someone comes in with a cold (which they often do), the germs just hang around, it's not like there's a window they can get out of.

Because i think this is impacting my health, i want to bring it up to my boss. My concern is that i don't think he can do much about it. We can't put in windows to ventilate better and the only way the toilets and kitchen are going to change is if someone talks to a staff of grown adults as if they're toddlers who need potty training.

953,"Ok here's the situation, I(30m) rent a room from an older lady(75). She thinks of me in high regards because I do so much to help her around the house. I'm very handy and I help her handle her business. Fix whatever breaks. Yard work. You name it. I don't mind helping her. It actually makes me feel appreciated because her shit breaks all the time so I'm always working on stuff for her. She's divorced and her ex husband handled a lot of the stuff I do now so she's really happy I rent the room. She's even lowered my rent because of how much I do for her.

 Her granddaughter(34f) visits regularly. She recently got a puppy but she keeps it here for the time being so I've been training her puppy. She travels for work and her job pays for her hotels. She doesn't have an apartment or anything because her work covers her living expenses and she's constantly moving around. Dogs can't stay in the hotel she's currently in and grandma's too old to handle a puppy so I'm taking care of it. No issue I love dogs and the puppy's great. With her puppy here she comes over a lot more than she used to so I've gotten to know her a little bit. We talk all the time now and I've developed a thing for the granddaughter. 

Today I told her my birthday is coming up in the next week and she offered to take me out for my birthday. If it wasn't my landladies granddaughter I would've already asked her on a date. My fear is that if things don't work out well between me and the granddaughter my living situation could be jeopardized and I don't need that. Granted I do have a signed lease. It's also just being comfortable in my home. If she comes to see her grandma it could be awkward or the grandma could treat me different. My fears all stem from something along those lines. 

Because she offered to take me out for my birthday I'm kinda being thrust into the situation and I'm not exactly sure how to approach it. I'm making excuses for why I shouldn't but I think I might just be doing that as a defense mechanism to avoid rejection. But she offered to take me out so I don't think rejection is really in the cards at this point. Those negatives are still a real possibility though if things don't work out between us. Also with her traveling all over for work it's possible I won't see her for weeks &amp; months at a time. She can be sent across the city, state, country. It's not unusual for her to spend months in other states. She just happens to be close at the moment so I see her all the time. 

Should I go for it with the granddaughter or should I avoid the situation? We have a ton in common and I'm sure my landlady would be thrilled if I dated her granddaughter because she's always on the phone bragging to her friends about how great I am for whatever reason. It just goes back to those potential negatives and the granddaughter traveling all over for work.

964,"tl;dr at the bottom

My friend [19F], who is also my[20M] boyfriend's[20M] sister, basically treats us like therapists. Multiple times she's called us, often in the middle of a panic or anxiety attack, and either asks to come over to us to calm down and vent, or for us to come over to her.

We're always there for her and listen to her. However, my boyfriend and I agree that with everything she's talked about and the number of times she's had anxiety and panic attacks, therapy would be really good for her. When we brought up that up to her she semi jokingly said ""well you guys are my therapists!"" I don't mind being there for her, but therapy is not the same as your friends listening to you and trying to provide some advice.

It's not an issue of cost. We're college students, and our university provides both short term and long term therapy, and she knows about this. 

We're not saying we don't want to be there for her. After all, she's my boyfriend's younger sister and they've always been super close, and she considers me an older brother and I consider her a younger sister. We want to be there for her, but

1. we're not licensed professionals who can actually help her. We can listen to her, maybe give her some advice that's worked for us, but we can't actually help her much.

2. therapists have to be in a specific mindset with their clients that's purely professional, which is why therapists can't really interact with clients outside of work, and why they can't be their friend's therapists. The fact that we're so close to her disqualifies us from being any kind of therapist to her, and for us to be her ""therapists"" wouldn't be good for anyone.

I've been going to our university's short term therapy and I'm starting their long term therapy, and I know that it's hard and kind of intimidating at first, but it can be so helpful, much more than venting to friends. I'm not saying I don't want her to come to us if she's having issues, we'll always be there for her, but therapy would be an amazing thing for her and she's refusing to listen to us when we day therapy would be good.

Has anyone else been in the same boat? What can I say to her sk she'll at least consider going to an actual professional to work on her issues rather than treat my boyfriend and I as her therapists?

tl;dr: my boyfriend's sister, who we're both close to, treats us like her therapists. We're happy to listen, but we can't help her, and us being so close makes for a bad ""therapist/client"" relationship. Our university offers free short and long term therapy.

And I slept with someone afterwards to see if I really loved my ex or I’m just horny. I figured out I still love my ex and I went back to her. I confessed my feelings but she rejected me and was hesitant about letting me in back to her life. I was her friend for like 5 months and things started looking brighter.  I ended up asking her if she wanted to be my girl and she said yes. Fast forward two months and I just found out from a friend in common that she slept with some other guy the day before I asked her out. And she felt bad and she wanted more time with the other guy to fool around but she went with me. Her excuse to her friend is that she knew I was going to ask her out sooner or later and she thought she could knock a few in before she was taken. I feel heart broken but I don’t know if I’m over reacting. And I don’t know what to do.,02Feb2020,1
966,"Ok, what you just read was true. My dad- and to a lesser extent my mother- has fallen victim to online conspiracy theories. These range from the “the exhaust you see coming out of plane engines is in fact a sort of pest control but for humans” to “every person whom has money- whether they earned their money the hard way or not- is related in some way to the Rockefellers.” My dad won’t shut up about his conspiracy theories, and I almost fell victim to them myself. I have thought a lot about this and it doesn’t just affect me. It affects my whole family. People are starting to talk behind my dad’s back because of this. I’ve thought about cutting him out of my life entirely as soon as I graduate high school. I’ve even thought about keeping him away from my future children if this doesn’t stop. I don’t want him anywhere near my kids if he’s still spewing off this bs. So I guess does anybody have any advice for me?",02Feb2020,1

969,"Hello! here's the basic story: 

My dad passed away in November 2018, and my mom's (and the family) have been trying to deal with it ever since. I've been wanting to move back to the area where I went to college, and my mom really likes it over by my college. Anyways, my sister teaches about 30 minutes from there, and her husband works about an hour from there as well. A couple of months ago, they approached us about us possibly moving in with them after they bought a house to fit the 7 of us.  My sister has a teacher friend who's divorcing her husband and is potentially selling her house. 

Anyways, over the next couple of months we discuss houses with them, they're still sold on this one house that I mentioned above which is fine. However all of the sudden, they stop mentioning moving in together. My mom and I begin to have our doubts, but nonetheless we carry along. They come this weekend, to tell us that they bought land in one of the towns they were looking at... to build a house for just my family, leaving my mom &amp; I blindsided. They tell us, that it wouldn't work out because of our schedules, but honestly I just feel like it was a rejection of the both of us, and over the last couple of months she's felt rejected by two of her kids over the choices they have made. 

To point out, I am not mad that they decided this, I'm actually glad because I was hesitant about moving in with them, afraid it wouldn't work out. I'm more upset that they were not upfront with how they felt, and they lied to us about everything (Like taking part of my mom's money that they said they were going to use for something else . My mom said to move on from it and her and I will find a place. But honestly, I feel betrayed by them, I really want to call them out on it, but I'm afraid it'll cause conflict and my mother won't be happy with me for that. I just don't know how to handle this properly without really damaging the relationship between me and my sister even more than it has right now. Any advice is really appreciated.",02Feb2020,1

972,"So tonight whilst on the tube home from work, a drunk woman sat on top of me to get me to stand up and give her my seat. Other seats were available, but she apparently knew I would just give her mine. Afterwards she taunted me about giving her the seat and I just stood and took it before getting off at the next stop and waiting for the next train on the same line.

I'm honestly incredibly embarrassed and ashamed. I want to be able to stand up for myself, to have been able to tell her where she could shove it. But I didn't, I was a coward.

978,"I’m a 19 year old student and in a few months I’ll go to college, with my first choice being a distant city for a specific program which I loved at first sight but can’t be in because of my mom. Three years ago I was depressed and was battling a very hard situation, ending up on attempting suicide and leaving a trauma in my mom that since then hasn’t felt secure enough to let me do anything. Time has come by and that moment remained isolated, considering I have never made my family worried for me while behaving in a good way and respecting them, but I do understand that the mark is still here. By one side, college in state is not a choice that would me personally happy considering I don’t like the program, neither the place to begin with but would make my mom feel less anxious, by the other side going to that college would make me really happy but her extremely anxious because she wouldn’t have control over me or know what’s happening 24/7. As I stated before and as for now, I don’t miss calls, sneak out, return home late because I acknowledged the impact of my actions, but this overprotective and anxious behaviour of my mom made me so insecure of myself and miss so many opportunities, this college one being the next is things don’t change and I don’t want to look back in 10 years from now and regret staying at home.

Well, me (16) and this guy (17) have been talking for a while. In the beginning, he’d used to text me every once and a while. He’d ask me for advice about girls, and our conversations were pretty good. Earlier this month though, he started showing more interest in me. Asking me to hang out a lot, inviting me to his wrestling matches, calling me cute, some simple flirting, said he’d never let me down, said that I called him down a bit, and put a light smirk on his face when he saw me, trying to impress me, and sometimes when I tried to end a convo, he’d keep it going.

But last Thursday, me and him flirted, and it went a bit too far, and ever since then, he’s been kind of distant. He’ll still talk to me, but he’s been a bit off. I decided to talk to him about it, and find out whether he likes me or not. He told me that he likes me, but just as a friend rn. He said he had to sort some stuff out. Like a couple weeks ago, he told me that him and his ex were still in contact. Maybe he still has feelings for his ex? I don’t think he’s a player.

984,"We have a woman at my work no one likes. Karen is just that kind of person; she's managed, through her own behavior, to make everyone despise her. I don't even like her and I tend to like everyone. As a result, no one invites Karen to the football parties, cook-outs and holiday gatherings at co-workers homes after work hours. 

I started working there a few months ago and at first, everything was going extremely well. Then, all of a sudden, a few weeks in, no one was talking to me unless they had to specifically for work purposes, and I noticed I wasn't being invited to the after-work gatherings. Since I hadn't done anything that would get me banned, I just shook my head in confusion and moved on. I didn't take this job to make friends, after all. While it would be nice to be part of the social group, my emotional well-being isn't connected to how many work-friends text me and ask me out for drinks. But, it was highly insulting at the same time as none of them were hiding the fact I wasn't invited and would talk openly about the ""party"" next Friday in my presence, with no invitation forthcoming. 

Last week I found out why. Karen was the one who told me about the job. Some months ago, I purchased an item from her on a secondhand site online. When I picked it up, we chatted for all of five minutes; I mentioned I was looking to move for career reasons and she mentioned her company was hiring. After I was hired, I told someone Karen was the one who told me about the position. This was before I knew she was universally hated by everyone. And honestly, I forgot I even said it five minutes later. To me, it was a throw-away comment; I met the woman once for 5 mins and barely knew her. Somehow, this translated into a rumor that Karen and I were ""bestest friends"" who hung out all the time and she 'got me' the job. 

Part of me is furious for a couple of reasons. Some of them I genuinely liked and respected as co-workers and that they'd treat me like this is infuriating. I have lost any and all respect for them as people. I agree that Karen is an abrasive, unpleasant person... but really, are you any better considering your behavior? And I feel as though I'm being 'punished' for something I didn't do and have no part in. Third, we're all adults, or we're supposed to be. I'm probably more furious at myself for not looking more closely into the company 'atmosphere' before I took the position. I feel like I'm working with a bunch of middle school kids. They don't even rate high school maturity levels. 

At the same time, important networking and social connections are being denied me, and I'm missing out on news and 'gossip' about what's going on in the company. As I recently learned when there was a shakeup in another department, this can be a problem. Everyone else knew this was coming but no one told me. I was broadsided by a firing and an unexpected promotion that affected my projects. If I'd been part of the 'group' I'd have known about it beforehand and been able to plan accordingly. 

So now I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. I've come to hate these people as much as they hate Karen for how they've treated me and their immature behavior. But I need them to get ahead in my career. They take socializing seriously, and if you aren't part of it, you're out of the loop, and won't know about the pertinent behind-the-scenes happenings. And I probably won't be considered for promotion since the managers are just as much a part of the 'ring' if not the instigators of it all. I Hate the idea of sucking up to a bunch of bullies and to be blunt, immature assholes, but I Have to. Unfortunately, I'm already labeled and pushed out, and I don't know how to get around that other than talking about Karen behind her back like everyone else. Since I'm not the kind of person who talks about other people behind their back or gossips, that puts me in a moral dilemma I don't want. 

Any advice on how to fix this problem would be welcome.

988,"Okay here we go

Back in fall 2018, I was in my 2nd year of college and was STRUGGLING. I was failing almost all my classes, constantly struggling with suicidal thoughts, and rarely leaving my room unless I had to. With my therapist, I decided to take the following semester off from school. I told my mom about this decision, but not my dad (they've never lived together; split before I was even born). I forgot why I didn't tell my dad, but the main reason was probably shame and avoiding him asking questions. Hell, I never even told either of my parents I was depressed and seeing a therapist so

Anyway, my semester off turned into taking a year off for financial reasons. I did not tell my mom I took an extra semester off.
During this year out of school, I lived off campus and worked to pay rent and other bills. I believe the only time I asked either of my parents for money was over the summer while I was back home and not working, so I needed help with my rent. I had almost enough money to pay for 3 months' rent on my own, but not quite so I asked my dad for help.

Now, I'm back in school, fully enrolled, and have enough financial aid for everything. So woohoo.

What I need help with is my 1098T form. It's my tuition statement that I would normally send to my dad so he can file it with his tax forms. Because I wasn't in school at all for 2019, I don't have a 1098T form and I have no idea what to tell my dad!

994,"I haven’t done this before so bear with me, sorry if it’s too long! I’ve known my sister-in-law for over 3 years now (as long and my husband and I have been married) and she and I became best friends. I always considered her a kind person who was generous and wanted everyone to feel included. Recently she has gotten into a relationship and it seemed like the friends and family meshed well with him and everything was great but things aren’t quite like that anymore. One month into their relationship, and them even knowing each other, was my “golden” birthday, so for months in advance we had a trip planned with friends. She knew about the trip and had paid for it before she even met him. Just a week before the trip, that involved 5 other people, she decided she couldn’t go because her boyfriend asked if she could go on a trip with him instead. She ended up coming to my birthday trip but came a day later and drove herself. This didn’t bother me, I just thought ‘whatever’ she’s excited about her new boyfriend. What bothered me was her getting upset she didn’t have the exact bed she wanted when she got there. Everyone had already settled in and she came late, I mean, that’s what you get. A friend said “this trip has been planned for months she should have respected that over a guy she has known for a month” and I even stood up for her and told him “Oh it’s no worries; it is what it is. She’s just excited about her new boyfriend.” Fast forward to today about 6 months later, we have a trip in less than 2 weeks and now she is pushing the entire vacation back one day (it’s only a weekend trip) because her boyfriend has pressured her into staying for Valentine’s Day. We have had this trip planned, once again, for months! It’s 2020, this was all finalized in 2019. So for the second time in less than a year she is choosing her boyfriend over plans made with us months in advance. My husband usually lets things slide with her because it’s his sister, but he’s upset this time; yet when he needs to talk about it with her she uses some sob story about how this is so difficult for her and pouts, so then nothing gets accomplished. I’m just so upset. I guess what I’m asking is, am I overreacting? My frustrations are that I’m always the planner, I’ve had to be in contact with the rental car company and the airbnb and I’ve used MY money to pay for everything before the friends could pay their portion of the trip. I’ve also been allowing her to pay slowly over time and she still hasn’t paid the full amount and we are less than 2 weeks away. Mind you she makes more money than I do and still lives at home, her mom pays her car insurance, and phone bill, so she has no bills. And now because she says her boyfriend is pressuring her to stay for Valentine’s Day so they can go to dinner, 3 other people involved in this trip are wasting a whole day of the trip and their money. I cannot refund anyone money, we are all paying for a day we won’t be there and the refund time for airbnb has passed. She also did not tell us she was planning on going a day later, my husband and I found out while having dinner with a friend. My sister-in-law had texted my husband’s best friend and asked him if instead of going up with everyone on Friday, if he could drive with her in the snow on Saturday so she could have dinner with her boyfriend on Valentine’s Day. My husband asked her why she didn’t include us in these plans she was changing and she said it didn’t seem important and it was none of our business! I advised how about the party goes up Friday, the day we intended, and she goes up Saturday with her boyfriend because he has 4wheel drive, and she refuses to even ask him because in her own words she said it is not fair to her boyfriend to put that on him. I’m beyond dumbfounded by that at this point seeing an entire group of people are changing their vacation plans for her and her boyfriend. I work for a small business and had to call customers and rearrange their appointments for a day and now we aren’t even leaving that day. I also want everyone to know her boyfriend was invited and included in this trip, and all other trips, and he has chosen not to go. So now, my husband wants everyone to go together, I really did not want to cave in to what my sister-in-law wanted, but I am married and I’m choosing to sacrifice my feelings for my husband because he wants everyone to drive together for safety. And my husband is my first priority, you have to decide what’s worth it y’know. I made vows to him and I take that seriously. And you could say the same for my sister-in-law and her boyfriend. I can’t take away the relationship they have and say it’s less than mine just because I’m married. We have asked her if this guy is someone she could see being married to and she freaked out and said no, so I just wonder how much we are all putting aside for this guy. It’s just all been such an annoyance and it feels like high school all over again, and I don’t have time for this. My sister-in-law doesn’t talk to me anymore, she’s wrapped up in her boyfriend and has even been rude to me before any of this vacation shit happened. I want to say something but my husband’s family gets their feelings hurt so easily. One time my mother-in-law didn’t talk to me for 3 months because I hurt my sister-in-law’s feelings unknowingly once. How can I say I’m disappointed without completely ruining my relationship with both my mother-in-law and sister-in-law (they are basically like a package deal)? Or should I just keep my mouth shut? I guess why I’m here is because I want validation. Is my sister-in-law being selfish? Or am I overreacting? Am I upset because deep down I’m hurt by our relationship falling out to this guy? Or is that a different issue and is she honestly just being selfish in this instance? Sorry for my venting but thanks for listening.",02Feb2020,1

Oh...neat...I feel like a douche!  When, if ever, does the responsibility shift from me to the introvert to bridge the gap?

999,"So I'm almost 17 and it's been like two years since I started having that kind of crush where I don't have a single chance of ending up with the person. To give a context, last year, I had a crush on a girl that was going back to the country her parents lived in. Then, I had one on a girl that was doing a student exchange program that was almost over, meaning she would also get back to her country. And now I have one on a girl that's already in a relationship. I feel like my brain does that because it's afraid of being rejected so it just gets me to love people that I will not have a relationship with in the first place.

The worst of it is that I have had girl having feelings for me but for some reason I always ended up rejecting them. 

I would just like to know hiw to deal with it. If it can help, I have a lot of traits of avoidant personnality disorder, social anxiety and a big inferiority complex.

Thanks for the advice",02Feb2020,1
1000,"He is 12. 

She has been spelling his name with the wrong last letter (which completely changes his name) for his whole life. She sends him a check every year for his birthday with the wrong name on it. She says it wrong as well. 

I have sent her a book every year with his name printed on the cover, as well as Christmas cards, etc. I go out of my way to write his name out in full every time I correspond with her, either via Facebook or in a letter, but she continues to call him by the wrong name every time she writes or says it. 

We live far away and haven't seen her in person in years, but this still bothers me. I have asked everyone in my family to use his full name around her if it comes up, but it hasn't helped. She is active, doesn't have dementia, and as far as I know my son is the only one in the family whose name she doesn't know.

His name is a little uncommon, but not terribly unusual.

And suggestions on how to correct my grandma's misconception without embarrassing her?

TIA!",02Feb2020,1

1004,"Recently this thoughts just been tearing me at my seems and I’m not sure if it’s common or not. It feels like more often than not whenever I think something positive or good is going to happen the exact opposite happens. I’ll be thinking about going somewhere and then all of a sudden my plans get cancelled. It’s gotten to the point that I’ll freak out whenever I’m not worried about something, because I feel like that means that something horrible is going to happen. For context I’ve been diagnosed with very serious OCD since I was 8 and have been taking medication to lessen my anxiety. Is this a common feeling to have? If so how would you recommend dealing with it?",02Feb2020,1
1005,"I’m autistic. My pacifier is how I stim. It is not sexual. I am not an ABDL, CGL, little, or Ageplayer. I am **definitely** not a pedophile. My parents tried and tried to take it away from me when I was around 3 or 4, but it was a match made in heaven from there on out. My autistic little mind forever knew the pacifier as my ultimate comfort object. I’m 24 and not ashamed to use it anymore. I don’t use it in public or around anyone. It’s something I do in complete privacy. I do have chewy gems that I use when I am out in public as a socially acceptable alternative (though I do get weird eyes and the occasional “you look like you’re chewing on a pacifier” comment). It’s a complete secret of mine. My parents don’t know. Only one person in real life knows about it and supports it. 

With this kid my parents babysit, she’s 4 and attached to the pacifier completely. She refuses to give it up and her parents don’t seem to care anymore. My parents forbid her from having it when we watch her; that much her parents will agree on. But it kills me to see her at that age still using the pacifier. Partially because I know it damages teeth, but also because I don’t want her to end up like me. I don’t want to see her become a lifelong pacifier addict. 

It kills me because I’m being such a massive hypocrite about this. My parents have been wanting to have the “talk” with her parents about the pacifier. I’ve been keeping my mouth shut (no pun intended) about this the entire time. Mostly because my parents and I have ridden this rodeo before with me. They're convinced I no longer use the pacifier even though it's a complete lie.  So my involvement in this is inherently awkward. I just feel like a hypocrite for this and I have nowhere to even confess this.",02Feb2020,1
1007,"My friend told me that her father started to threaten the rest of her family since September of 2019. I won’t tell all the details, but her father basically started to blame all that is wrong in his life on his children verbally, and has gaslighted them (I’m not sure if this is the correct word). However, it has not escalated to be a physical problem. Recently, her father posted a WhatsApp status where he ranted about his children. 

This whole situation that has been happening since September has given her quite a hard time, especially with the added academic pressure she had (we are going to do our GCSEs in a few months), and she wonders why she has to go through this punishment, even though she has done nothing to deserve this. 

My friend claims that her mother has considered filing for divorce, but cannot do so for financial reasons. 

She also told me about this situation the same day her younger brother broke two of his bones, and had to get surgery done. So, now, she has to help her family business because her mother has to divide her attention between his brother and work at the same time, all while my friend has to deal with her father, studies and helping out in her family business. Her mother agreed to take her to a psychologist before his brother broke his bones, but given that they are in their current situation, they do not have the time to take her to one.

The thing is, as a friend, I have no idea on how to help her, because I have never been in that kind of situation. I come from a very loving family with very strong bonds between one another, something that I don’t take for granted now. I obviously know that I have to be supportive, but do not know how much we should talk about her situation at home. 

I would very much appreciate people advising me on this, since I do want to be supportive, and want to be supportive in the best way I can, and want to be as helpful as possible.",02Feb2020,1

1010,"If someone did my grocery shopping for me, and I had apples at home, I would not think more of it. I would just eat ""apples.""

Now that I do my own grocery shopping, I have to pick from a cornucopia of choices, and I take so much time weighing all the options.

""These ones look prettier.""

""These ones are bigger.""

""These ones are more expensive, but only by 39 cents per pound.""

""These ones are yellow and I haven't had yellow apples in a while.""

It's not just apples. This goes for choices I make altogether. When I write PowerPoints, I spend so much time just deciding the background, between two perfectly good options. When I'm changing my profile picture, literally hours go by as I decide between nearly identical photos.

It's so bizarrely uncomfortable for me to say ""yup, I need to move on now. I'm settling with Option X.""

Do you have any advice?",02Feb2020,1
1011,"This isn’t the first time I have gone onto one of the work stations and found porn or explicit messages. For some reason the person I work for uses the work stations as a personal computer. Today I went into the documents folder to see what I could clear out for more hard drive space. There was a large video so I clicked it to see what it was and it was my employer and his X having sex on the couch right behind me.... i closed it immediately. I do not know if she knew she was being filmed. This is kinda the last straw in a number of things for me but I’m not sure what to do. I feel like I need to ask her if she knows about it and I want to tell my employer that I’m finished at this place.

1012,"Hey, I am really anxious and possibly a bit paranoid right now And I don’t want this to carry on as I feel it doesn’t help with me being open to my group.

I had an alt account for asking lots of mental health related questions bearing in mind I’m not diagnosed with anything, as well as heaps of questions on dating subs about girls that would never work and it’s honestly the most cringe thing ever, bearing in mind I just look so unbelievably self obsessed and delusional.

Thing is every time I mention reddit to my friends or chip in in a conversation about it gets really quiet and awkward for a second, and certain subject matters that have never come up before started getting popped up and it just made me kinda anxious.

The other thing is we have this app in our group which  is like a creepier version of snapmaps where you can make groups of people privately so you can keep track of your friends. Before, a friend who wasn’t part of this group we setup mentioned getting loads of notifications from it and I suddenly got really anxious thinking that they made a group without me or something. I don’t know why they would, yes I asked some odd things on this alt but I don’t know why they would do that in the first place...

1016,"I think I’ve finally lost all hope that anyone will understand the frustration I’ve been going through, so hopefully someone here understands and maybe has some advice. I don’t really know where to start but here we go. My mother loves to do things to me such as hit, curse, and threaten me for the slightest things and if I bring it up later on she acts like it never happened and I just made it up.  All I ask for majority of the time is to leave the house (literally hate being at home with my entire being). When I am allowed out I have to text her everytime I’ve changed locations, (i.g “off the train”, “at the restaurant”) If I’m not allowed out I will try to persuade her to be allowed, however it just results in getting cursed out, arguing, threatened to be punched or possibly being hit, called ungrateful, and being told to go to hell. I know I don’t help the situation because I do end up arguing and hitting back (I used to not hit back and just block it but it got to a point where it was difficult to hold back). When I ask things like “why are you like this?”, she says I’m dramatic and that I’m playing victim, although I do know when I start an issue and will admit it. In past years she has also tried to smack me with a skillet, has hit me when I told her I was suicidal and that I’ve been close to doing so, has called me weak and pathetic because of me telling her this, also said I was ungrateful because I’ve thought of suicide, has told me to go ahead and do it, and proceeds to deny the fact that I have depression even though I see a therapist for it. I’ve tried to talk to friends and family members about it but they all don’t know what to say or say I shouldn’t carry so much hate for her or I should just ignore her (which is hard because we sleep in the same room), told that “she’s made so many sacrifices”, “it’ll get better” (which is complete bs, it’s gotten worse because she’s just more controlling as I age). Pretty much anyone I talk to takes her side. My father is absolutely no help as he just pretends to be oblivious to the arguments we have while he’s home. And he’ll just say “you know I love you” if I interact with him after the argument. I also still hold a bit of resentment towards him for cheating on my mother and having another kid and having this secret life for about 8 years or more. 

I’m at a complete loss on what to do except for moving out. I’m 18 and graduating in June so I’m hoping I get enough in scholarships to dorm in a college out of state or find a job (which is proving to be hard enough already) and move out.
